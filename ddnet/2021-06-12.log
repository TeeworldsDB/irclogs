00:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 if you want self-referential structs, you can try https://docs.rs/rental/0.5.6/rental/
00:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it works if it's behind a pointer (e.g. vec, string)
01:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Somewhy when i do GameClient()->SendKill(-1)
01:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> (Client side) it kills me with 5-10 seconds delay
01:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> I even placed console print in that place
01:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Right before kill
01:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> And it prints immediately
03:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i might have a clue know why SDL2 was buggy with the dont minimize flag  @Learath2 with the windows taskbar not showing up
03:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with SDL 2.0.16 if i just compile it with default cmake flags and use it in our client it also happens there even in wine
03:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
03:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
03:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 0110:fixme:imm:ImeSetCompositionString PROBLEM: This only sets the wine level string
03:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 0110:fixme:imm:ImeSetCompositionString Reading string unimplemented
03:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 0110:fixme:imm:NotifyIME NI_CLOSECANDIDATE
03:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
03:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie do you think thats possible?
03:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (the current sdl dev version has the flag default on)
04:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok maybe its still just timing related bcs of the mouseabsolute call, maybe i should just open an issue on sdl and ask them why this behavior is so weird xd
04:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Need some networking help again, I got my new Ethernet cables which connects my router with 2 other PCs. These two PCs have a Realtek PCIE GbE family controller network adapter, and both only reach about 47-52 mbps. I tried the same cables with another laptop and am receiving the full 150 mbps, weird enough: The router interface shows that both pcs are connected as 1 Gbitps, same as both Computers, they report to use 1.0 Gbit/s, so I dont
04:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The laptop test shows its not the cable or any general setup, and I already checked whether its any green ethernet or power saving mode in my network adapter, but that doesnt seem to affect it.
05:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nvm that actually, i think that this just proves that its an SDL thing, else it would behave differently with mingw^^
05:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nvm that actually, i think that this just proves that its an SDL thing, else it would behave differently with wine^^

09:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> aaaaa howto memory management? \:/
10:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ok nevermind i found solution without memory management \:D but still i wonder whats wrong about my malloc \:c
10:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> bot
11:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Davide> Don't use realtek network cards
11:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> how do you test network speed? if you use some web speed test, it's possible that those PCs are not powerful enough to allow the JS garbage to reach the full speed of your internet connection
11:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Comrade iperf3
11:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> For example this one up to 10 Gbit/s: http://speed.myloc.de/
11:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> or you can run iperf3 server on one PC to test LAN only
11:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> DDNet 15.5 🥳
11:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> prepare for "where did the ping go?" support questions
11:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 😄
11:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> server list refresh is much faster now at least 😄
11:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I test via speedtest provided by google, directly on google.com, thats the best one
11:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Both are high end gaming pcs from about 3-4 years ago
11:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So they are powerful enough
11:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> interesting
11:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why? Funny enough: If I connect my phone via USB-C and start a USB tetherig, then it also gets capped at 50 mbit/s, but USB ports directly go to the main board. My phone has a much highe connection than 50, depends on where i am in the house
11:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So my guess would be the mainboard, maybe
11:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Its software is from 2016, latest version is from 2018
11:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But even USB 2.0 should easily reach faster speeds than 50 mbit/s
11:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it's not hardware issue probably
11:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea
11:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Correct
11:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> can you try iperf3 on loopback? 😄
11:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Whats that?
11:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> `iperf3 -s` and `iperf3 -c localhost`
11:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sure, let me just stand up and turn on my pc :D
11:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just woke up
11:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> ah good morning then 😄
11:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> good morning :)
11:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> meanwhile it's nearly 3am here lol
11:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> good night for you 🙂
11:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lol im listening to music ignoring the fact i inevitably will have to slee
11:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lol im listening to music ignoring the fact i inevitably will have to sleep
11:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Davide> Do it with almost 4 threads so as to see the real maximum speed
11:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Davide> 
11:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Davide> iperf3 -c 127.0.0.1 -P 4
11:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay
11:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Davide whats wrong with realtek adapters? :D
11:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Davide> They are not the "top" of reliability
11:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Davide> Let's say they are actually the worst network chips on the market 😂
11:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Davide> Go with Intel if you need stability
11:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> at least Intel Management Engine can't use Realtek NIC 😄
11:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in cmd?
11:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes
11:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> couldnt find command iperf3
11:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> https://iperf.fr/iperf-download.php
11:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How do I use it?
11:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> extract it somewhere
11:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then
11:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> open cmd in that folder
11:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> aj
11:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
11:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `Server listening on 5201`
11:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes
11:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> now open another cmd and run the second command
11:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> whats happening now?
11:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> nothing
11:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh, okay
11:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `iperf3 -c 127.0.0.1 -P 4` this one, right?
11:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes
11:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> done
11:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> how much Gbps?
11:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which value is the one you need?
11:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> sum
11:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/853209986486632478/unknown.png
11:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> looks good, so loopback is fine
11:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what did this do now?
11:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> now run `iperf3 -s` on another PC and connect to it
11:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> give me a second
11:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
11:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/853210317432291348/unknown.png

11:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this is from the first window, btw
11:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes, it's the same
11:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay
11:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have a "Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 0c)" :monkaS:
11:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> Realtek stuff is very common and works just fine usually
11:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye i never seen another brand tbh
11:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Comrade can i connect to the pc where it also gets capped?
11:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or do i need one that has the full speed?
11:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it should reach ~950 Mbps everywhere
11:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> on gigabit ethernet
12:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> you can also try to run the iperf3 client with `-R` parameter to check download speed instead of upload
12:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/853212640155664404/unknown.png
12:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> download
12:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but on the same pc
12:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> both server and client on the same pc?
12:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/853212780290506812/unknown.png
12:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this is the first window
12:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> test it between 2 PCs
12:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> about to
12:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So what do I run where?
12:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it doesn't matter
12:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> PC1: `iperf3 -s`
12:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> PC2: `iperf3 -c 192.168.1.???`
12:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> you will need IP of PC running the server
12:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sure
12:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Davide> For home usage, it's fine, yes
12:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> -R?
12:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> -R 4?
12:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> at the end?
12:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Davide> -P*
12:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> server is singlethreaded anyway, so `-P` is not really needed
12:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> try both with and without `-R` to test both directions
12:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/853214453244231710/unknown.png
12:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> receiver pc
12:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think
12:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its the pc where it was listening
12:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it shows the same numbers on both sides always
12:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> hmmm 663 Mbps
12:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it should be higher on gigabit ethernet
12:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but at least it's higher than 50 Mbps 😄
12:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
12:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and now? xd
12:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> i suspect your home router
12:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its a Fritzbox
12:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> maybe someone added that 50 Mbps limit there? 😄
12:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nop, there is no limit
12:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> btw, what did your tests say now?
12:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Does it mean its not the network adapter?
12:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes
12:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> weid
12:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then its probably the bios
12:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> weird
12:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or whatever
12:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> in the release version of ddnet 15. i have orange chn and green asi
12:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> nvm. i have set my proxy wrong. it is being applied to ddnet 😅
12:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Comrade any other ideas?
12:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> should i maybe update bios?
12:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> @fokkonaut no
12:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> just test everything first
12:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i tested about everything already :D
12:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but sure, if you have ideas i will test tem
12:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> them
12:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> did you try iperf3 against the internet server that deen posted?
12:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which one?
12:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> http://speed.myloc.de/
12:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which one do i take?
12:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> `iperf3 -c speedtest.myloc.de -p 5200` and `iperf3 -c speedtest.myloc.de -p 5200 -R`

13:23 < bridge> [13:05:09] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> <1ms, sorry
13:23 < bridge> [13:06:39] [ddnet] <Comrade> it must be some speed limit then
13:23 < bridge> [13:07:05] [ddnet] <Comrade> and if you have the same problem with USB tethering, it's not your home router's fault
13:23 < bridge> [13:07:17] [ddnet] <Comrade> by the way, did you test it with mobile data?
13:23 < bridge> [13:07:21] [ddnet] <Comrade> or WiFi only?
13:23 < bridge> [13:07:35] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wifi only, but my mobile data is like 20mbit/s only
13:23 < bridge> [13:07:41] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so not worth a test, i think
13:23 < bridge> [13:07:47] [ddnet] <Comrade> yes
13:23 < bridge> [13:08:07] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yeah, 22mbps
13:23 < bridge> [13:08:39] [ddnet] <Comrade> tethering is NATed so your home router should have no idea that it's the PC doing the test
13:23 < bridge> [13:08:55] [ddnet] <Comrade> or wait
13:23 < bridge> [13:09:07] [ddnet] <Comrade> which IP your PC gets with USB tethering?
13:23 < bridge> [13:09:25] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> let me see
13:23 < bridge> [13:09:59] [ddnet] <Comrade> tethering is NATed so your home router should't know that it's the PC doing the test
13:23 < bridge> [13:10:11] [ddnet] <Comrade> tethering is NATed so your home router shouldn't know that it's the PC doing the test
13:23 < bridge> [13:10:39] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> getting a very weird one
13:23 < bridge> [13:11:05] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> usually, our range starts somewhere at 192.168.178.20
13:23 < bridge> [13:11:09] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> router is the .1
13:23 < bridge> [13:11:25] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> now i get 192.168.42
13:23 < bridge> [13:11:35] [ddnet] <Comrade> that's good
13:23 < bridge> [13:11:55] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> funny tho, my phone is still at 192.168.178.xx
13:23 < bridge> [13:12:03] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why is the pc getting such a weird range tho?
13:23 < bridge> [13:12:07] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
13:23 < bridge> [13:12:17] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not .178, but .42
13:23 < bridge> [13:12:29] [ddnet] <Comrade> because your phone translates it to hide the PC behind it
13:23 < bridge> [13:12:35] [ddnet] <Comrade> can you test USB tethering on the laptop?
13:23 < bridge> [13:12:39] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sure
13:23 < bridge> [13:12:53] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just went out of battery
13:23 < bridge> [13:12:57] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i hate old laptops
13:23 < bridge> [13:12:59] [ddnet] <Comrade> 😄
13:23 < bridge> [13:14:21] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 150 mbit/s with usb tethering on my laptop
13:23 < bridge> [13:14:55] [ddnet] <Comrade> good, so the problem is definitely at the PC
13:23 < bridge> [13:14:59] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> seems to be higher than my phone xD
13:23 < bridge> [13:15:07] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> phone speedtest shows about 130 right now
13:23 < bridge> [13:15:21] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah no
13:23 < bridge> [13:15:23] [ddnet] <Comrade> web speed tests can be pretty heavy
13:23 < bridge> [13:15:27] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
13:23 < bridge> [13:15:31] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay so its the pc
13:23 < bridge> [13:16:19] [ddnet] <Comrade> if you ask some Windows experts, then will tell you to reinstall Windows, but there should be some other way for sure
13:23 < bridge> [13:16:31] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i hope so
13:23 < bridge> [13:18:06] [ddnet] <Comrade> you can try this:
13:23 < bridge> [13:18:09] [ddnet] <Comrade> - go to Device Manager (`devmgmt.msc`)
13:23 < bridge> [13:18:10] [ddnet] <Comrade> - find your network card and uninstall it
13:23 < bridge> [13:18:15] [ddnet] <Comrade> - click on that "Search for new devices" button
13:23 < bridge> [13:18:17] [ddnet] <Comrade> - do speed test again
13:23 < bridge> [13:18:51] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i already uninstalled my network adapter yesterday, restarted pc searched for new hardware (it found the adapter on restart by itself already), didnt change anything
13:23 < bridge> [13:20:59] [ddnet] <Comrade> https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/tools-limit-bandwidth/
13:23 < bridge> [13:21:11] [ddnet] <Comrade> did you make sure all these things are disabled?
13:23 < bridge> [13:22:57] [ddnet] <Comrade> if you ask some Windows experts, they will tell you to reinstall Windows, but there should be some other way for sure

13:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just tried disabling QoS Packet Scheduler
13:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> also didnt work
13:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> HAH
13:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal` did the trick
13:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> ah nice
13:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks :)
13:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> we should've tried googling first 😄
13:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> 2 hours of useless debugging
13:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but it was fun 😄
13:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
13:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> true
14:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ryozuki could you please get the release into the AUR when you have some time?
14:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 what does the Leak IP button do?
14:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sure i forgot
14:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga done
14:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ryozuki awesome, thanks
15:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut it pings the server directly if you are in the favorites view and the server does not appear in the masterserver list
16:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> was the favorites behavior changed
16:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> oh
16:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> read that wrong
16:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> nvm
16:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> someone can tell me why with wsl i cant compile my server but with windows command prompt that work

16:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> that dont give the "error"
16:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> just stop compiling
16:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the error must be further up
16:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> no
16:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> no one error
16:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you copy paste the whole log somewhere?
16:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> just some warming
16:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> hmm yes
16:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ho shit im wrong sorry but that work with wind cmd so..
16:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/853286494462541865/unknown.png
16:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> that weird
16:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> maybe i need to install something
16:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seems you need to install python in wsl
16:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> he is not installed by default?
16:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, try executing `python3 --version`
16:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ye i tryed and he is not installed
16:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ye i treed and he is not installed
16:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ye i tried and he is not installed
16:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ho shit
16:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> now i have +1000 errors
16:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/853287270810910740/unknown.png
17:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try bam -c all
17:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ye that work thx
17:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ❤️
17:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> that for u
17:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> @Jupstar ✪ are you here?
17:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
17:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ok wait
17:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> im uploading a video
17:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> do you remember of my clan bug?
17:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do i even know about it?
17:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ye i think you already helped me about changing char to another thing
17:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah
17:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
17:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://youtu.be/ztPhxgAHGEM
17:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> check that, the first window with vscode is with linux terminal and the second with window
17:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> and the clan dont do the same thing
17:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> any idea?
17:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> to fix that?
17:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> isnt that the same bug again?
17:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> yes but u found the cause
17:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> this is a terminal bug
17:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> the value change when im moving or when i go to a specific tile
17:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what is the correct name of the clan
17:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 0xo?
17:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or do you mean the hex numbers?
17:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd say its the same bug
17:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just bcs its different client side doesn't mean its different bug
17:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the server sends random stuff and the client does the same
17:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> Oxo is just the account name we dont care of that
17:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah u probs mean the hex stuff
17:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> yes from the game
17:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd say the server decodes the client message wrong, then sends the wrong name to the client and since its UB it acts weird
17:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> in the src i write do not set a clan to the user like that : 
17:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> str_format(aLevel, 16, "   ", m_pPlayer->m_Level.m_Clan);
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> in the src i write do not set a clan to the user like that : 
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> str_format(aLevel, 16, "`here`", m_pPlayer->m_Level.m_Clan);
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> in the src i write do not set a clan to the user like that : 
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> str_format(aLevel, 16, "` `", m_pPlayer->m_Level.m_Clan);
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but maybe it also breaks when building the packets
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why not just use -fsigned-char
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> doesnt that fix all issues
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there just is a difference if you do
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 1000 - 128
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 1000 + 255
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or -1
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then they'd be same memory
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> hmm ye
17:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> i just fixed it by deleting random lines
17:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> 🙂
17:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah so it was just a patch from yourself? XD
17:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thought u talking about just using a different mod or smth
17:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and have the same bug again
17:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> yeah im using a old mod for remake it
17:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah just always add funsigned-char
17:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> signed*
18:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> @heinrich5991 was this statement still true? i can't find any reference of "serverlist_urls.cfg" in code.
18:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/853303233094877215/unknown.png
18:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ddnet-serverlist-urls.cfg
18:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just renamed ^^
18:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> cool
18:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie u on windows rn?
18:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I'm in the shower rn
18:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> WTF XD
18:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> What do you need
18:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just want to know if screenshot still works
18:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> e.g. if its a common thing on windows
18:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I guess ask someone else. I don't really want to turn my PC back on for a screenshot😅
18:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah np ^^
18:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Should've asked like two minutes ago
18:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah nvm, maybe smone will read this ^^
18:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ignoring the screenshot bug, is ping supposed be half numbers and half EUR?
18:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/853311775959941140/screenshot_2021-06-12_18-33-58.png
18:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its per ip address
18:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so if its a different bug, yes
18:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> different ip* xd
18:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> earlier today I saw only EUR
18:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> once u connect it saves the ping
18:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> so I guess it's intended
18:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ugly tho
18:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its a trade
18:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for not leaking the ip to ddossers
18:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it looks fine when it's all EUR
18:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> possibly yes
18:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> something about the width difference looks bad to me
18:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
18:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you not unwrong ^^
18:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> so I'm wrong?
18:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you not wrong ^^
18:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 😛
18:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nvm
18:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> hard language
18:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Poor ravie
19:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Jupstar ✪ do you happen to know if the body shade of the skin is also affected by a costum color?
19:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> sadly yes
19:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok not sadly
19:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but sadly for the greyscaling it isnt
19:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so alpha shadows look wrong xD
19:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> was curious because otherwise you could maybe do some trickery with skins and parts of them that shouldnt be colored ^^
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but I guess that wouldn't have been good :D
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, but i still think we should completly break vanilla 0.6 comp and fix the greyscale issue
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> e.g. glow skins suffer from this
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah :/
19:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do 0.7 skins have this problem?
19:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they dont allow coloring it iirc
19:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not?
19:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you could fake it with the body marking
19:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think thats how i fixed it for my 0.6 to 0.7 tool
19:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, there is coloring
19:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but shadows are ignored arent they
19:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe it changed
19:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> let me test
19:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah idk
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah color isnt changeable for the shadow
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i like the 0.6 behavior more, but as said it also has its "bugs"
19:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> @heinrich5991 looks like we are fetching info2.ddnet.tw first before master when user pressed refresh right?
19:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not in parallel?
19:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I'm not sure. Maybe the master is still super slow for some people
19:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Ye they seems to be parallel.
19:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Maybe the large amount of requests to the hong kong server is being picked up by the great firewall as a threat and throttled them somehow.
19:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I thought a cn company owned hk server would have some privilege of being stable.
20:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I'm a bit tired from people constantly asking about the new client and troubleshooting their dns problem. I turned off my notifications just now so I can get some rest 😅
20:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> poor tsfreddie :/
20:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie hm, so it's really slow? Should we run a server in mainland China directly then?
20:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> maybe
20:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> It is mostly ok for me. I'll do a poll tomorrow
20:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I wish we can hook up our cdn directly. But we can't make it use ddnet.tw because cn cdns require cn company owned domain's with icp lisences.
20:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Although I just tried to make it 302 to a cn cdn and ddnet client seems to accept it just fine. Maybe a small mainland server dedicated for serving 302 redirects would work?
20:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Since the master is getting hit with > 5M bandwidth constantly and we only have 5M on most of the mainland servers.

20:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Right todo
20:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> There are so many todos in the code I have to use // MYTODO: in my mods to identify which are mine. 😇
20:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd
20:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> TODO_FIX_BEFORE_MERGE
20:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
20:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
20:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not fixed until today xd
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Bruh. I really don't know why so many people can't see the server list in china.
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how did they connect to ddnet server list before xD
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Some can access ddnet.tw with a browser. But not the masters ones
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it mean that was / is also a json isnt it
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Some can open the masters url in browser but still sees 0/0
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so its not a problem with the update?
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Ue
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Ye
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> It is weird
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Maybe some people just don't know ddnet tab supposed to have stuff in it.
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Most screenshot I received are showing internet selected
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 😅
21:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> And now i just tell everyone asked to use teeworlds.cn/browser
21:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Can't be bothered troubleshooting rn
21:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah ok, but interesting that tw master servers are not blocked
21:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> master2 shouldn't be blocked too
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Master2 is literally a tencent server
21:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> One theory I have is some places like netcafe or schools just block tw domain because Taiwan? But that sounds a bit ridiculous to me. And some do have access to ddnet.tw homepage just fine.
21:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe we should just cache the current list?
21:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in worst case its outdated
21:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but not not shown at all
21:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Like in client?
21:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> si
21:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Oof, I'm not sure about that
21:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it could be grey if its outdated
21:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but also when refreshing e.g.
21:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it would silently refresh it
21:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> instead of not showing it
21:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie will know if showing a greyed out old list is appropriate for the human eye or if its more confusing xd
21:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 😅 well it might make more sense for the old list. The new one would just dim all servers and lit all of them back up probably. (If you click refresh)
21:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I should stop saying well and I guess
21:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> well, I should stop saying well and I guess I guess. :kek:
21:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well, i guess you should, yes
21:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Have you ever been so worked up during the day that you feel like sleeping at all even though you are tired af?
21:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i've had the opposite
21:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like a burnout
21:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> doesnt matter what i tocuh i feel tired xd
21:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I think I'm having both of them at the same time
21:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so you are hyped for smth, but also burned out? xd
21:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Probably. was burned out before ddnet15 dropped
21:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Then ddnet updated and my qq dm exploded.
21:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah coding creates burnouts really fast.
21:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you go full tryhard for few weeks
21:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and then u completly fucked xd
21:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/853355208448409610/Screenshot_20210613-032609.jpg
21:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Behold Chinese "emojis"
21:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Or memes? I don't think they are memes, but they do look like them
21:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> kinda of a mix
21:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ryozuki's pepe emoji collection can answer this question xd
21:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/853355693402095626/6c092f1cb8f2b2b.gif
21:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Ye was wondering why we have pepes as server emojis
21:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :poggers: not complaining tho. Just didn't think the admins would made the call to add pepes.
21:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Expect for jao maybe
21:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
21:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> everyone uses pepes here
21:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/853357651542409216/unknown.png
21:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Dota2
21:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I have almost 1000 hours in dota2 but I played like 4 games total
21:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wut
21:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> afk in menu andy
21:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS: i dont play at all

21:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Spend most of my time in custom game sdk
21:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> autochess?
21:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> No
21:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dota is pretty famous over there right?
21:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I made Tetris in dota2
21:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Didn't finish and release it in the end
21:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Probably. I wouldn't know lol
21:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they have a pro scene, since they nearly won The International 2019
21:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The International  is like the grand doto tournament featuring a 40.000.000€ prize pool
21:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess thats a lot of chinese coins
21:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Autochess might be pretty popular since most mobile game provider has a variant of it
21:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> May I know why you guys ordered the servers in regions?
21:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the ping changed to region cuz we cant know ping accurately without leaking ips to bad actors
21:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the leaked ip is then used as spoofed ips for ddos
21:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
21:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> I see
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Wait so that's how that worked
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> I mean, it's a little bit bugged, because for me, servers in SA, appear as good ping, but its clearly not a good ping xd
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> And NA appear as bad, when it's good
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i think that has to be fixed with some matrix stuff
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> Indeed
21:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> And it's taking a lot more to load up all servers when you open the game, why is that?
21:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Finding the best serverlist server takes a bit of time.
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> The 4 list servers seems to be randomly chosen then pinged individually. And the best one was cached too, so it should be a bit faster on the second launch.
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> I see
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> Thx!
22:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I have 2 questions, can you do a small code review for me and have you ever worked with `tokio-rs/tracing`?
22:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the same goes for @heinrich5991, but I think you already said you haven't worked with async in rust
22:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/discordbot I'm looking to replace part of the bot with this so I can actually debug both sides
22:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I should learn rust
22:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> go sleep xD
22:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie I'm in a bit of a love/hate relationship with it, it's limitations are rather annoying and it's libraries are nowhere as mature as they make themselves out to be, but it really does error handling the way I would in my imaginary language
22:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 did u know TEXT actually is more space efficient than varchar
22:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> atleast on sqlite and psql
22:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Depends on the db engine, but yes I did 🙂
22:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
22:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice to know u prefer rustls over openssl
22:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
22:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it may not have a long history like openssl, but they take it serious, here is an audit https://github.com/ctz/rustls/blob/main/audit/TLS-01-report.pdf
22:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would use openssl but I didn't feel like the linking issues that could come with it
22:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and besides it's not really exposed to the outside so rustls should be fine
22:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 can u run "cargo fmt" and push
22:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would help me xd
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I still use ts/js as my go-to language for everything. But I finally run into problems like having to many node apps running in a server that the 1gb memory is running dry.
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 😅
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> See this type of stuff is very meh for me, I prefer to format my code myself :/
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll run the cargo fmt, sure
22:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, I can't rn, am on windows
22:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my personal web under rust uses 35mb
22:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u wouldnt be able on windows
22:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't have any developmentstuff on windows, it's strictly for games that refuse to run under linux
22:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its not like u formatted it at all
22:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/853366639478833202/unknown.png
22:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cargo fmt is rly good imho
22:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and everyone uses it
22:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can configure it too btw
22:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rustfmt.toml iirc
22:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I'll take a look at it
22:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> My node apps are mostly in the 40mb to 60mb range. But they are really simple. I don't know why I made them separate node apps tho. I have 5 of these running rn.
22:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also had my phase of node apps
22:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Also I need 600mb for my telegram bot. Which might be the main problem than node apps tho.
22:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> node is really wasteful, rust is actually the best backend for web I've seen yet
22:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actix works really well
22:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
22:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 a competitor is appearing soon again
22:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://rocket.rs/
22:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they just need to release it
22:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I'd imagine anything native would be more efficient than node
22:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I found a feature rust needs immediately. Specializations for generics
22:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it already has it but need it to be stabilized rn
22:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844 ?
22:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :justatest: I don't even know why I love typescript so much
22:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think u can try it on nightly with  #![feature(specialization)]
22:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because javascript is so ugly that typescript looks beautiful at its side
22:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Ever time I need something in other languages I try to find a typescript transpiler first lol
22:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Typescript2Lua is pretty cute. Got me through the Dota2 custom game API shithole.
22:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> It's like an addiction
22:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i think ur missing an .await in https://github.com/Learath2/discordbot/blob/master/src/main.rs#L106 on handle_message
22:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm
22:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nvm
22:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 r u sure this works as intended? https://github.com/Learath2/discordbot/blob/master/src/main.rs#L106
22:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt it like this?
22:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```rust
22:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tokio::spawn(async move {
22:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>   handle_message( msg.0, config.clone(), discord_http.clone(), http_client.clone(), pool.clone());
22:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> });
22:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
22:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 r u sure this works as intended? https://github.com/Learath2/discordbot/blob/master/src/main.rs#L106

22:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> });
22:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
22:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sqlx also probs has a feature chrono that will do the datetime stuff for u
22:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> + thiserror
23:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the stable version doesn't have datetime for sqlite yet
23:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sqlx = { version = "0.5", features = [ "sqlite", "runtime-actix-rustls", "macros", "migrate", "chrono", "uuid" ] }
23:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it does
23:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 use NaiveDateTime instead
23:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they must have added it a second ago because I just checked it 😛
23:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It doesn't have datetime at all for sqlite, they just added it 13 days ago on master
23:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> NaiveDateTime
23:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> DateTime<Utc> is used for timestamps with timezone
23:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but sqlite doesnt support timezones iirc
23:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sure I tried that too, but I'll give it another try when I boot back into linux
23:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sqlite doesn't support DATETIME at all, they don't even do column types
23:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they have datetime functions of their own which you use to fill a column
23:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> add chrono to sqlx features
23:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it will parse it correctly
23:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> DATETIME in sqlite is an alias to numeric
23:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> All column types in sqlite is the same internal type, you can put a string inside an integer if you want
23:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/is/are/
23:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i dont care about that
23:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im just telling u u can use naivedatetime on rust side
23:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No need to wrap it in another closure, the only requirements for T is that it's `Future + Send + 'static` and it's output is `Send + 'static`
23:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> thanks for approving promt translation into russian.txt 👍
