00:10 <+bridge> <mian_ku> I'm try to make a query by stages, but is didn't work well, it's only show point of first stage.
00:10 <+bridge> <mian_ku> What's wrong with it?
00:10 <+bridge> <mian_ku> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1255284070368149544/image.png?ex=667c91e4&is=667b4064&hm=ce6668006974fa3ddb149f5497ad07a6bbe3884352209761aea4bc42abfb67de&
00:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> what's going wrong
00:16 <+bridge> <mian_ku> It's should  put 2 msgs.

00:25 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Maybe message is sent to the player themselves?
00:25 <+bridge> <mian_ku> Player can't get msgs too
00:30 <+bridge> <mian_ku> I'm try to add some `sleep ()`, still 1 msg.
01:15 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 setting up a new laptop through ssh the most fun thing ever. Having a clipboard, a browser, the right keyboard layout and credentials is sooo amazing!
01:15 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ssh in general is the best thing ever made
01:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but yes there is always the risk something goes horribly wrong :D At work I made sure all our production servers have the most intense ssh theme. I trained my self to instantly slow down typing speed and verify twice when i see the scary ssh :D
01:27 <+bridge> <learath2> try adding a dbg_msg inside `CScoreWorker::ShowPoints` see if that is being called twice atleast
01:28 <+bridge> <mian_ku> i tried
01:28 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki for me https://git.edgl.dev/edg-l/rustyman is 404 once im logged in :c 
01:28 <+bridge> <mian_ku> but don't talk about it. I change a query way.
01:29 <+bridge> <mian_ku> but don't care it. I change a query way.

09:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @murpi
09:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did da ping work? 
09:52 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> yes
09:52 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thank
09:52 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> murpi i made a marketing video for you to sell you my map patch saas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5JPyCtkWww
09:52 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if it peeks your interest feel free to contact sales@zillyhuhn.com
10:51 <+bridge> <Bota> Why is this usefull?
10:52 <+bridge> <Bota> I don’t get it why you need it
11:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Similiar reason why git is useful. Patches can be easier to work with than entire files. This allows two people to work on different parts of the map then merge it together without any manual work.
11:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> And you also see exactly what was changed. 
11:54 <+bridge> <Bota> Seems a bit overkill in my eyes
13:40 <+bridge> <meloƞ> Chiller wanna create a ddrace map together :owo: :owo:
13:44 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no sori 
13:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> chiller is all business these days
13:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> very serious
13:45 <+bridge> <meloƞ> Dude doesnt want to collab on a map
13:45 <+bridge> <meloƞ> Proceeds to write His 9372828472 bash Script a Year
13:46 <+bridge> <meloƞ> Smh
13:46 <+bridge> <meloƞ> Proceeds to write His 9372828472 bash Script this Year
13:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> he didn't want to gores w me either
13:46 <+bridge> <meloƞ> HUUH
13:46 <+bridge> <meloƞ> So Rude!
13:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> he's fired
13:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> no longer on payroll
13:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> and there will be no severance
13:55 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh boy I spend too much time writing ez languages i forgot how confusing C++ was
13:58 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> When make a C++ compiler in bash
13:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 lets go start ddnet3 initative to rewrite ddnet in go
13:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat too hard
14:02 <+bridge> <jxsl13> doubt that Go is the right language in which one should implement the server
14:02 <+bridge> <jxsl13> might be possible and interesting, but not necessarily the languahe of choice.
14:02 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what about client?
14:03 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why not the server?
14:03 <+bridge> <jxsl13> that might be cool
14:03 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why is client cool and server not xd
14:03 <+bridge> <jxsl13> might have GC performance implications
14:03 <+bridge> <jxsl13> but one never knows
14:03 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but the client has that issue even worse right?
14:03 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its the client that needs gaming vps
14:04 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the servers already run on raspberry pis
14:04 <+bridge> <jxsl13> dunno
14:04 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fps*
14:04 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not vps xd
14:04 <+bridge> <jxsl13> imo the server needs to crunch more data
14:04 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> anyways i found my C++ bug im in love again xd
14:06 <+bridge> <jxsl13> server vs headless client, that is
14:06 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah headless
14:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> im losing love with every inexplicable memory error
14:07 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea headless makes sense even in ruby
14:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> then i want to consider a language like rust but am genuinely deterred by the elitist douchebag behavior i will be responsible for by proxy of associating with the language
14:10 <+bridge> <jxsl13> there are people implementing games/servers in Go, so it's possible but imo not the best choice: https://youtube.com/@unitoftimeyt?si=hu3sXde_C665tGTo
14:11 <+bridge> <jxsl13> there is also a game engine: https://ebitengine.org/
14:19 <+bridge> <learath2> I have a new favourite vim motion `gn`
14:20 <+bridge> <learath2> idk how I lived without it
14:20 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat gn do
14:21 <+bridge> <learath2> "Search forward and select"
14:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> search what xd
14:21 <+bridge> <learath2> Well it's like n, it does your last search hagain
14:21 <+bridge> <learath2> Well it's like n, it does your last search again
14:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hmm
14:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im not sold xd
14:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> especially because gp is paste?
14:22 <+bridge> <learath2> Well how would you do search and replace selectively
14:22 <+bridge> <learath2> There is no `gp` is there?
14:23 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im stupid xd
14:23 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i thought p is previous search hit
14:23 <+bridge> <learath2> `N` is previous
14:23 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye
14:23 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `gN` also somehow borked for me
14:23 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh wait it isnt
14:24 <+bridge> <learath2> For search and replace I do `/<search>`, `gn`, `c<replace><ESC>`, then you can navigate matches by `n` or `N` and do the replace with `.`
14:25 <+bridge> <learath2> Perhaps `cgn<replace><ESC>` can also work without going into visual in the middle
14:25 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea thats pretty cool
14:26 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i wish i could use `c` :( 
14:26 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> mine is blocked by custom "compile" hotkey which i very much need
14:26 <+bridge> <learath2> The thing I use most is `caw`, `ciw`, and `ct<something>`
14:27 <+bridge> <learath2> All my custom stuff are behind `<Leader>`, why do you need compile on c?
14:27 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> accesibility
14:27 <+bridge> <learath2> `;c` is about the same speed since it's on separate hands
14:28 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nah 1 key is different than 2 keys
14:28 <+bridge> <learath2> or `\c` or ` c` a good leader is very fast
14:28 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i switched my leader from , to space
14:29 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> I also have space as leader
14:29 <+bridge> <learath2> mine is ; idk why I got used to that
14:29 <+bridge> <learath2> I guess since the motion is quite useless
14:30 <+bridge> <learath2> If you have an ansi english layout keyboard \ is very good
14:30 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> DEUTSCHLAND
14:30 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> qwertz
14:30 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pog
14:31 <+bridge> <learath2> Wait, why have compile on c on a german keyboard? Just have it on ü?
14:32 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> mr international lerato
14:32 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ü
14:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> qwfpgjluyarstdhneiozxcvbkm
14:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> think about it
14:46 <+bridge> <jxsl13> true
14:47 <+bridge> <avolicious> Facts
14:51 <+bridge> <wurpi> hey guys
14:59 <+bridge> <reitw> is there an issue about banlist behavior on some servers, if it's too long you may timeout ?
14:59 <+bridge> <reitw> (not specific to banlist but any command is like that if the output is very long)
15:08 <+ChillerDragon> ye lerato you right "ü" would be nice but im not used to it
15:08 <+ChillerDragon> fakin webchat exploded in ma face mid converation xd
15:09 <+ChillerDragon> @reitw might be but i thought they all got fixed
15:11 <+bridge> <reitw> letme try
15:12 <+bridge> <reitw> doesn't seem
15:13 <+bridge> <reitw> maybe it's specific to our srv but we have around 650bans, everything is properly showed but then only admins timeout
15:13 <+bridge> <reitw> like, I do the cmd, it'll timeout all loggedin admins

16:46 <+bridge> <wurpi> hello, i'm wurpi
16:47 <+bridge> <murpi> hellou wurpi, I love your profile picture!
16:47 <+bridge> <wurpi> thank you, I drew it myself
17:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
17:31 <+bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/golang/go/issues/17058 go might be the only language with absolutely no way to silence it's linter
17:37 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Only works if your linter is correct all the time
17:37 <+bridge> <learath2> this is a general issue with rcon, 650 lines spams the sendq too much, when the sendq is full the connection dies with no way to recover as all rcon messages are vital
17:37 <+bridge> <0xdeen> and not having a way to silence it will force the linter to improve I guess? 😄
17:38 <+bridge> <reitw> is there any workaround that can be impl to fix that ?
17:38 <+bridge> <learath2> There are a couple things a linter just can't know though. E.g. it warns on a "context leak", but I'm willingly leaking that context on those code paths because what follows outside that function is a panic that will kill everything anyway, no graceful shutdown possible
17:39 <+bridge> <learath2> Are you following ddnet master nowadays?
17:39 <+bridge> <reitw> I'm mostly out of tw nowadays
17:39 <+bridge> <reitw> so I don't rly see what's happening
17:39 <+bridge> <learath2> I meant as in is your source based on a relatively new ddnet version
17:39 <+bridge> <learath2> I remember us discussing a fix for this last time it came up, so we may have added something
17:39 <+bridge> <reitw> well the current one not, but we have another one that does
17:40 <+bridge> <reitw> current one is vanilla based sadly
17:40 <+bridge> <learath2> let me take a quick look if we added anything
17:40 <+bridge> <reitw> sure thanks !
17:41 <+bridge> <learath2> but your options are basically to throttle the messages, implement non vital messages or paginate your bans
17:41 <+bridge> <.zokra> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1255548587547558062/image.png?ex=667d883e&is=667c36be&hm=f40fff3e9461ee84e06e7591d4a063162d05b0994483741bccc8cc6e541b1d8f&
17:41 <+bridge> <.zokra> can someone ban this guy pls
17:42 <+bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5375 here is what we did
17:42 <+bridge> <.zokra> he has been blocking for ages
17:42 <+bridge> <0xdeen> checking

17:43 <+bridge> <reitw> oh ok I see, I could implement the same then, thanks !
17:43 <+bridge> <learath2> it's a relatively clean patch, it might even cleanly apply 😄
17:47 <+bridge> <reitw> yea
20:33 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> yoooo, i finally fixed integers in my "compiler" 😏 it looks so ugly https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/meraki/blob/15cc708cdd9e4276f54e61ae3140a94fe9f51b26/src/parser/expr/int_repr.rs#L111-L133 but it works and I hope I will never have to touch this ever again :justatest:
20:34 <+bridge> <learath2> What on earth? 😄
20:35 <+bridge> <learath2> Why aren't your int literals just ints?
20:36 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> ure too bad to understand this 2000iq solution :justatest:
20:36 <+bridge> <learath2> The div2 and mul2 are actually scaring me, what are these? Are you trying to support arbitrary precision?
20:37 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> yes and no
20:37 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> in theory it can, in practice i wont
20:37 <+bridge> <learath2> `fn inc(num: &mut String)` I do not understand
20:37 <+bridge> <learath2> maybe I'm smoothbrain afterall
20:38 <+bridge> <learath2> num ----> String?
20:38 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> "1234"
20:38 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> xd
20:38 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> it increments a string
20:38 <+bridge> <learath2> How does that += 1 not overflow? <a:FrierenDies:1198335807686193182>
20:39 <+bridge> <learath2> `1239 + 1 = 123:`
20:40 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> it's getting called after mul2 so last number never be 9
20:40 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> ez clap
20:41 <+bridge> <learath2> I'll pay you to make it `pub struct IntLitRepr { inner: i64 }`
20:41 <+bridge> <reitw> :justatest: cisco would sue you
20:42 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> what if i want to store u64
20:43 <+bridge> <learath2> Store an `u64`  and a `unsigned: bool`
20:43 <+bridge> <learath2> Or `UIntLitRepr` that also works a lot of compilers would treat those literal types differently anyway
20:44 <+bridge> <reitw> https://meraki.cisco.com/fr-fr/
20:44 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> that's a good time to tell that it could be 2 separate structs
20:45 <+bridge> <reitw> https://meraki.cisco.com/
20:45 <+bridge> <learath2> It has actually been a very long time since I've actually looked at a piece of code and all I can think of is <a:huh:640511171765600257>
20:45 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> ure welcome :justatest:
20:48 <+bridge> <learath2> Straight to programming jail you go 😄
20:50 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> I would go there if it didn't work
20:51 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> Never heard of her
21:08 <+bridge> <learath2> The ability to run `make -j16 -l17` is so pleasant
22:03 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/meraki/blob/92b33d3865c0670086d958dd6dfa064dc8aa1cfe/src/parser/expr/int_repr.rs @learath2 is that better? xd
