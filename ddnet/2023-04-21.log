08:27 < bridge> <tela> hey thanks for this, exactly what i was looking for.  I'm gonna play with this soon.  Might be some good info for the 'colors' section on the binds wiki, altho maybe a bit too tangential.  I def want to add this into the wiki somewhere at least
08:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u should document this in the wiki
09:07 < bridge> <ReiTW> @Jupeyy_Keks @Ryozuki https://twitter.com/esankiy/status/1649104852704690178
09:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh
09:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he is using assets from store kek
09:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Nice. That's what I wanted to see
09:10 < bridge> <ReiTW> so now u believe it
09:10 < bridge> <ReiTW> @Ryozuki I think he uses quixel assets
09:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i feel the game will have rly simple gameplay
09:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and be boring
09:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but nice visuals
09:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Tru xd
09:33 < bridge> <DefaultO> Could be like "Ready or not"
09:34 < bridge> <DefaultO> Beating that game in graphics already
09:37 < bridge> <Learath2> The quixel/megascans library has this level of assets and nanite/lumen does make this level of rendering realism pretty feasible. So I'm really not very surprised it's not fake
09:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I hope he says that it was a single 4090 running it at 2k(trailer resolution) at 60fps .. that would be sick for future games i guess
09:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's not even about graphics. It's the insane animations and camera handling too
09:39 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, that too. The dude most definitely mastered Matinee 😛
09:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> On mobile the graphics indeed look real
09:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> On desktop i can certainly see some uglier assets
09:41 < bridge> <gerdoe> subprocess in script tries to launch every clang-format it knows on terminal, it actually works if i will not check for exact 10 version xd
09:41 < bridge> <gerdoe> but yep seems its unnecessary
09:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we should update to llvm 17 clang format
09:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> llvm itself has a clang format python script
09:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> bro tf xd
09:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> looks so good
10:04 < bridge> <Bomf> Personally I’m not too sure about the audio I think they need to bet some sounds recorded because the gunshots,door sounds don’t really sound convincing
10:04 < bridge> <Bomf> I don’t really see how it would work in regards to story or how they could keep the gameplay interesting over a long period but it may have a story that has not been shown in the trailer
10:05 < bridge> <ReiTW> it could be like some games in which you have to clear a building
11:01 < bridge> <Bomf> Yes but how will this gameplay stay interesting
11:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Chairn  do u know about fully homomorphic encryption?
11:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://fhe.org/
11:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
11:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> >  Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without first having to decrypt it. The resulting computations are left in an encrypted form which, when decrypted, result in an output that is identical to that produced had the operations been performed on the unencrypted data. Homomorphic encryption can be used for privacy-preserving outsourced storage and computation. This allows data to
11:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
11:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption
11:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
11:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this paired with AI and chatgpt might not be a bad idea
11:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's infinitely slow
11:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and neural nets need lots of computing power
11:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so not really a good fit
11:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i see
11:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1098909482236514354/image.png
11:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we sellin
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ur company or personal?
12:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> personal
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Epic
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do u share the game?
12:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what game
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No game no life
12:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
12:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> are you asking if I hold any rights to the game I'm making?
12:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wanna sell stuff too
12:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but idk what
12:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i dont like c#
12:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> sell rust tutorials
12:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I need that
12:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u just need to read the book
12:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (website)
12:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> books are boring
12:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
12:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dont think of this as a book
12:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> too much english
12:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I just found out tauri as an alternative to electron
12:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
12:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but I haven't run into anything that I would need to implement in the backend yet
12:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> mobile apps are the money
12:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if only i could do them with rust
12:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and not java
12:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or kotlin
12:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it is not possible?
12:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its possible but its more oriented to games
12:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont have the fancy ui builder
12:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it'll be there eventually
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Thought u sell some game
12:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think he is selling a unity thing
12:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nah, just editor extensions for unity
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ah yeah u mentioned it was declined some time s
12:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> three times
12:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but ye, it is accepted finally
12:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if the rust "game engine" can do manual redraw instead of every frame. you can make a ui library using the game engine as a rendering engine probably.
12:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it probably wouldn't be too hard on battery life
12:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what i mean is that, the android studio rly makes ur life easier
12:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but u need to use a jvm lang
12:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with rust u can do anything obviously with enough effort
12:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i see
12:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i haven't used any ui builder for ages tho
12:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> android studio is rly top tier
12:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i used it
12:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I didn't like android studio
12:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (its made by jetbrains with google)
12:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not sure what was it like today tho
12:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I did make like one app on google play store with android studio. I didn't enjoy it over just using typescripts and html lol
12:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh well yeah html and ts is easier
12:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but its not native
12:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> well ye, backend would still be in java or kotlin i guess
12:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tauri is adding android support
12:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rust backend
12:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
12:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie what are you selling?
12:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we just said it
12:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> unity extension/asset
12:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> on unity asset store
12:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah 🙂 (couldn't find it in the backlog ^^)
12:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so wouldn't it still be a browser frontend tho
12:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
12:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tauri uses the OS predefined "webview"
12:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> isntead of bundling chromium
12:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> like electron
12:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so its way less space
12:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also less ram
12:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hi ryozuki
12:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz its rust backend
12:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not nodejs
12:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I was trying to avoid electron when I found tauri
12:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i have plans for tauri
12:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i LOVE svelte
12:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and u can use tauri with any frontend framework
12:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sveltekit included
12:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I was hoping to find a nodejs backend without chromium tho
12:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> reactjs doesnt come close to svelte
12:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> svelte is rly gud
12:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i ended up just using tauri anyway
12:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> vue ftw
12:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> omg svelte
12:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> past tech
12:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> modernize to svelte
12:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I just learnt sveltekit
12:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's so good
12:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it is
12:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im using it
12:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rust with axum + sqlx for backend
12:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sveltekit with typescript frontend
12:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> although I thought sveltekit can be full stack
12:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and sveltekit has a deno adapter
12:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so u run the frontend server with deno
12:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> instead of the slow memory hog nodejs
12:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> turns out the server-side stuff lacks a bit
12:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it rly is a difference

12:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well
12:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i use rust for backend so
12:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idc
12:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :brownbear:
12:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I still haven't learned rust
12:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I'm too bad at learning rust specifically
12:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also rust has a metrics crate
12:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with prometheus
12:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rly gud
12:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> go wasn't that bad but rust hurts my soul

12:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> there is a query i need to optimize

12:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> on the table
12:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> is it your job or you're just making stuff
12:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is a hobby project
12:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its this site https://market.xivhub.org/
12:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> epic
12:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> at my job i build a compiler
12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ryo gets smart af. I'm jealous
12:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u know a lot about vulkan
12:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dont be
12:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and im stupid
12:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also ur smarter now
12:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz u use rust
12:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this reminds me i need to setup elastic search and add it to the wiki
12:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> now that i have my vps with 64gb ram
12:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1098922942974398544/image.png
12:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> didnt know itt had a gpu
12:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wonder what that is
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Wtf
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why u have such a beast as vpn
12:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> vps
12:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> *
12:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks the reason is
12:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz i want
12:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats it
12:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> too many moneys lying around?
12:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its not a vps tho
12:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well it is
12:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it theorically is metal or idk the term
12:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> dedicated server?
12:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i mean i would say im not too bad, but i simply enjoy having a good server at my disposal
12:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to test and have my stuffs
12:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
12:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dedicated
12:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its 45€ month iirc
12:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hetz
12:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest: being public shamed for having a server :justatest:
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean if u like it why not;)
12:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1098924589494579210/image.png
12:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this one iirc
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But sounds like second desktop PC xd
12:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye xd
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also sounds very expensive actually xd
12:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its like paying for chatgpt 2x a month
12:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this reminds me that I'm paying a lot for ger2 ^^
12:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> how much
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I like netcups root server. U have dedicated cores, so the computing time is not shared. But the CPUs itself are still shared
12:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in the same range
12:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but well with my job i can pay this ez
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What strikes me a bit, is that the cpu is rather old and still it's not really cheap
12:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm
12:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk if i found cheaper
12:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but the cpu is not bad
12:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i can say im biased towards amd
12:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> there are intel options
13:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks i just need to make a saas that earns 45$ month :justatest:
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's Not bad. My point is rather. For that price u get the same shit on ebay and can host urself. Sicne u have good internet
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ez
13:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but no static ip
13:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and electricity costs and stability
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I use dyndns for that
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well electricity is pretty cheap except u know the server is rarely idle ^^
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Dunno what u calculating the whole day xd
13:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
13:19 < bridge> <Learath2> No one has home internet “datacenter good”
13:19 < bridge> <Learath2> You can have good speeds at home, but datacenters have strategic peering
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah, but why would u need this professionalism for personal projects xd
13:28 < bridge> <Learath2> I also have a 30e dedicated server, I mostly have it for proxying through, being my permanently on irc bouncer, monero node, etcetc
13:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> seems like we waste some money
13:28 < bridge> <Learath2> I mostly still have it just because it was cheaper when I initially got it then germany decided energy should be 2x
13:29 < bridge> <Learath2> Not like I have anything else to spend the money on, might aswell have a cool server
13:30 < bridge> <Learath2> It also let’s me host more rsc intensive games when friends fancy playing
13:31 < bridge> <Learath2> Probably s/‘// there but I’m not a 100% on that one 😛
13:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hobbies are waste of money
13:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> see, u get it
13:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> s#'## indeed
13:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> let's is always short for "let us"
13:34 < bridge> <Learath2> If I had a job I’d probably have an even cooler one like yours 😄
13:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u can use sed with any separator
13:34 < bridge> <Learath2> It’s forbidden knowledge
13:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> s,/,,
13:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, but discord special-cases / so I can't use /
13:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> troll sed
13:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> s"'""
13:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is like s/'//
13:35 < bridge> <Learath2> You can do `s\/‘//`
13:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> XD
13:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm, any byte? unicode codepoint? grapheme? emoji cluster?
13:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk
13:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sed uses C so probably ascii kek
13:36 < bridge> <Learath2> I’d guess any ascii
13:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 👨‍👨‍👦‍👦
13:36 < bridge> <Learath2> Maybe any unicode codepoint if very very well implemented 😄
13:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```sh
13:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> $ echo abc | sed sßbßbbß
13:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sed: -e expression #1, char 2: delimiter character is not a single-byte character
13:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
13:37 < bridge> <Learath2> Discords version of the sed syntax clearly shows that it was implemented by someone that only opens the terminal to write `npm build`
13:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im cooler
13:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i use pnpm
13:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> easy casual "JS developers bad" embedded in "discord developer unexperienced"
13:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if we are real
13:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> most js devs are people who took a 1 time course
13:39 < bridge> <Learath2> I worked hard to get both into one sentence
13:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they barely interested on programming
13:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also typescript is a sign of js being bad
13:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> typescript is passable
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> TIL https://blendermarket.com/categories/scripts-and-addons
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a marketplace  for blender addons
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its python tho
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my life is sad, no rust addons anywhere
14:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> be the change you wnat to be in the world?
14:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can produce python modules with rust using pyo3 I think
14:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :brownbear:
15:30 < bridge> <Patiga> I think most open source addons are simply hosted on github/gitlab, since an addon is just a zip file containing a python module
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> blender is the only reason i ever coded python 🙃
15:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they are sold there, with GPL license
15:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://polyhedral.info/
15:42 < bridge> <Patiga> looked up some addons from https://github.com/agmmnn/awesome-blender, and to my surprise some of them are actually in the market, but definitely not most from my sample
15:43 < bridge> <Patiga> but good idea, maybe I should just upload my twmap addon for free there for better visibility
16:26 < bridge> <Voxel> tell me if i should fix the max_clients-1 thing because i still dont know if i should
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks since how long r u working on ur company
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and did u ever ask for a raise
17:45 < bridge> <DefaultO> How much does he earn?
17:46 < bridge> <DefaultO> Just calculated my hourly rate and it is above about 18€
17:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @DefaultO r u german
17:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or russian
17:51 < bridge> <DefaultO> German. Yeah its low.
17:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 55k yer?
17:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 51*
17:51 < bridge> <DefaultO> Only daydream job
17:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if so, not low here xD
17:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what does that mean
17:52 < bridge> <DefaultO> You sure? Looked it up. Avg. is at 28€
17:52 < bridge> <DefaultO> You sure? Looked it up. Avg. is at 28€/hour.
17:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i guess my math is off
17:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk
17:53 < bridge> <DefaultO> I earn more than that with less work with my pay 2 cheat company
17:53 < bridge> <DefaultO> So its not what I really have on me at the end of each year
17:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> definitly not in spain
17:53 < bridge> <DefaultO> We are still in Germany
17:54 < bridge> <DefaultO> I didnt move a few secs ago
17:54 < bridge> <DefaultO> I didnt move just a few secs ago
17:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think 8€ is avg
17:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i earn about 16€
17:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but nobody uses hourly rates here
17:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats a american thing
17:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we just say the yearly
17:54 < bridge> <DefaultO> Nah mate. Programmers. Min wage is 9€ something.
17:54 < bridge> <DefaultO> Nah mate. Programmers. Min wage is 9€ something in Germany.
17:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i tell u
17:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but well here in spain if u work for a spanish company
17:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> expect to be paid bad
17:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or idk i havent found any good one
17:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i work for international
17:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @DefaultO how much  u wait/waited to ask for a raise
17:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats what i wanna know
17:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> I havent
17:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> Thats what I get once I finished my test next week
17:57 < bridge> <DefaultO> Company wants me. Company needs me.
17:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well well
17:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dont get swayed by words
17:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> anyone is easily replaced
17:57 < bridge> <DefaultO> Not in a 4 man company.
17:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oof
17:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i workedi n a small company
17:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its better to work in a medium or bigger one imho
17:57 < bridge> <DefaultO> Where the devs know how everything works
17:57 < bridge> <DefaultO> And if you kick one of them
17:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats a sign of bad org
17:58 < bridge> <DefaultO> Your company probably won't recover
17:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> imho
17:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i prefer medium or bigger
17:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also more opportunity to learn from others
17:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u gotta leech the knowledge
17:58 < bridge> <DefaultO> I do
17:59 < bridge> <DefaultO> Marco before me did too
17:59 < bridge> <DefaultO> Ended up getting 4.5€ per month
17:59 < bridge> <DefaultO> But because his child is ill. He looked for a job where he can work from home.
18:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> another reason to not go for spanish companies here
18:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they prefer u work from office
18:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> like a bee
18:00 < bridge> <DefaultO> Ended up getting 4.500€ per month
18:00 < bridge> <DefaultO> Guess I am earning good then
18:01 < bridge> <DefaultO> Though a spanish guy can't prove that to me
18:01 < bridge> <DefaultO> Germany has expensive workers
18:01 < bridge> <DefaultO> That's why everyone goes to China. But China realized they drive the world. So they get more expensive too.
18:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> That sounds like inflation 💀
18:03 < bridge> <DefaultO> Guess I am earning good then. I don't believe you though. I will end up getting 1.500€ something after taxes.
18:04 < bridge> <DefaultO> Guess I am earning good then. I don't believe you though. I will end up getting 1.500€ something after taxes. Expect me to pay around 1000€ for a shitty flat. And food isn't free either.
18:05 < bridge> <DefaultO> Germany has expensive workers because everything here is expensive
18:07 < bridge> <DefaultO> Aka money devalueing itself
18:10 < bridge> <DefaultO> My other jobs earnings are between 28.000€ and 35.000€. I don't pay taxes on them. But I also don't get to keep it either. Can get a few € from it for myself without anyone raising their eyebrows.
18:12 < bridge> <DefaultO> That's money you can pay with in IRL shops
18:13 < bridge> <DefaultO> ^ That's money you can pay with in IRL shops
18:13 < bridge> <DefaultO> A couple hundred Euros pretty much, something below 1000€
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but u work for an argentinian company arent u
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its 12€, are u living in a cave lol
18:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no leaks kek
18:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but i get paid a above average rate in spain
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> really?
18:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would be surprising to me, but well
18:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i earn about 2100€ monthly, average  is 1500
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd ask once per year maybe if u want more
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or after the first 6 months
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well ofc depends on how many h per week
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyway @Ryozuki 
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 100% serious, your job from what u showed, sounds really cool
18:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 2100 net tho
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> better earn few money for cool job than much for a shit one
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u only live once
18:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks i know
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> time is more important
18:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i actually got offers
18:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for jobs at 55k
18:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i earn around 33k
18:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but i looked at em
18:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and they looked bland
18:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i rly like the company i am rn
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epic
18:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but for real i earn more than all my friends and family
18:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
18:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the only above me is my sister
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> except hentai sister xD
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDDD
18:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> by a factor of 4x
18:39 < bridge> <Chairn> yes i've heard of it and seen some papers implementing it
18:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks is it natural to feel uneasy to ask for a raise tho? xd
18:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> depends, if u worked well 6 months in, i'd say its ok
18:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> today i had a meeting with my manager
18:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i asked how they view me and my perf
18:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but if u work 1 month and directly except smth its weird
18:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they said they consider me a above average developer
18:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and really good
18:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez
18:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how long are u in?
18:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 6month
18:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 5-6
18:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mhh ok
18:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well u should try yes, 4k€ should be in i guess
18:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
18:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean for full year
18:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> without taxes
18:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeye
18:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but start with 6k
18:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe ill wait a bit
18:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then go down xD
18:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u switch your job get at least 6k€ more than the previous job xD
18:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if i switch i probs would get 10k more
18:42 < bridge> <DefaultO> I am old son
18:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> how old
18:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but a worse job 😆

19:32 < bridge> <ReiTW> the 1st object
19:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> thanks i'll put that in our idea library
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😆

19:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> omg
19:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> gold
19:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:  man i hate that unreal is getting really good while we are stuck on optimizing for mobile chips
19:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> unreal 5.2 looks pretty cool
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tru story
19:46 < bridge> <deen> mobile chips are just desktop chips - x years, right? So just wait a few years if you want to run it on 1 W instead of 300 W
19:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why use unity
19:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's just easier and quicker to meet the stupid deadline the leader set
19:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also probably runs better on quset 2
19:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i want bevy to get the editor ASAP
19:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so gamedevs that only know how to make games with editors try rust
19:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and bevy is awesome itself
19:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://bevyengine.org/
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Chairn explain why this doesnt work, u gave me a 1h presention about this xD
19:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://bevyengine.org/examples/3d/3d-shapes/
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sadly bevy uses wgpu
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it will probably not beat unreal
19:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://bevyengine.org/examples/shader/shader-instancing/
19:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> <https://bevyengine.org/examples/ecs/iter-combinations/>
19:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also if mobile chips are capable of running unreal's desktop rendering stack like nanite and lumen in one or two years. that probably means we are already one or two years behind on building the authoring tools for XR cuz we are building them in unity
19:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks https://bevyengine.org/examples/stress-tests/bevymark/
19:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> try this
19:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> click
19:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> stress test
19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am capped to 240hz xd
19:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with 40000 i get 60 fps
19:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its wasm tho
19:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'd rather use godot if we need a custom engine:troll:
19:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> godot will not be as perfomant
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cool 😄
19:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks u can do custom render drivers iirc
19:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/hakolao/bevy_vulkano
19:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :brownbear:  C++ runs fine
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i get 80fps
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nobo nvidia
19:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i am on windows rn tho
19:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz i played ff
19:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so not my self compiled firefox
19:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah firefox ofc slower
19:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i use chromium
19:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/anime-gun-rain-gun-point-gif-14458931
19:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> anything would be better than C# anyway
19:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> c# is a wanna be rust
19:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with its unsafe  keyword
19:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> kekw
19:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i did use unsafe once
19:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u need unsafe to stack allocate
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> vulkano is also not vulkan tho xd
19:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for sharing data between burst and .net
19:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @TsFreddie never  used spans?
19:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> burst doesn't support span
19:58 < bridge> <Chairn> hmm not really no
19:59 < bridge> <Chairn> they have different pipeline and architecture
19:59 < bridge> <Chairn> obviously, they are optimized for efficiency rather than raw performances
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "and the density of transistors is so small that they have more power desentiy than nuclear power already which makes it less headroom for improvement" - Chairn

20:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> keep the memes coming
21:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Thanks @Ryozuki I actually fixed my Unicode with issue with the lib you recommended. Also thanks @heinrich5991 for adding the rust bridge it’s super neat! I kinda abused it as a package manager. Since rust has a solid one and c++ basically doesn’t. I wonder if you have any recommendations for git conflict driven development. I had to edit around 4 rust files and I will get 100% a conflict on next merge with ddnet when some new rust stuff 
21:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no abuse here
21:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> legit use
21:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and im glad
21:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rust is better
21:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Width issue\*
21:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I mean I basically just use a rust crate in c++ no own rust code. So that’s why I mean abuse.
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its ok
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ur using a rust crate because its better
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats already valid
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
21:27 < bridge> <Chairn> damn, the more i hear Ryozuki talk about rust, the more i believe that rust developpers are the equivalent of french people
21:29 < bridge> <Voxel> LOL
21:42 < bridge> <gerdoe> 30/70
21:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the opposite, rust devs want to work until they die, french dont want to work so long xdd
21:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the opposite, rust devs want to work until they die(just with rust), french dont want to work so long xdd
21:49 < bridge> <Chairn> both are (supposedly for french though) arrogant as fuck
21:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> whats french ppl
21:49 < bridge> <Chairn> it's a legend
21:49 < bridge> <Chairn> feared among europeans
21:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its not arrogant if true
21:49 < bridge> <Chairn> when france coughes, europe catches a cold
21:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
21:50 < bridge> <Chairn> least based rust dev
21:50 < bridge> <ReiTW> macron démission
21:51 < bridge> <Voxel> rust devs are the reason why i dont want to code in rust
21:51 < bridge> <ReiTW> :pepe_angry:
21:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
