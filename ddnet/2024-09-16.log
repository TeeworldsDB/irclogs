01:26 < bridge> <teero777> if you're on linux just unpack it like `tar -xf sometarfile.tar.xz`
01:26 < bridge> <teero777> if you are on windows you should use the windows release xd

02:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @noah23559 do you still have the issue? Check the console (press F1 to open it) for errors. Also can you try if this command in the console works ``connect ger2.ddnet.org``
02:10 < bridge> <noah23559> not anymore

05:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so this is saying line starts with match or there is a space before the match?

09:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: do you know where to find similar lines in ddnet as in teeworlds https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/c56fa9e6a20cfc9d7d16502e18c7d7633acdf492/src/engine/shared/network_client.cpp#L100-L101
09:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat still searching?
09:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you wen't for 0.6.5 tokens?
09:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i was trying make 0.7 server show up in lan tab
09:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u doing server now?
09:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and then I got in token rabbit hole
09:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so why do you care about ddnet?
09:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im not sure if ddnet can even do lan anymore these days
09:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ? :thonk:
09:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well cuz ddnet basically deprecated the entire udp connectionless protocol with the http master
09:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> vanilla 0.7 servers do not show up in the ddnet client lan tab
09:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yep
09:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk which idiot implemented client side 0.7 support into ddnet but he probably didn't do a good job
09:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> where is the code which sets the token in client when you connect to 0.7 servers?
09:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet client?
09:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ye
09:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just look at tw code. ddnet code is harder to read
09:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but sec ill find it for you in ddnet
09:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I found things I needed in teeworlds code but I can't see it in ddnet
09:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> xdddd
09:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why do u even need to see it in ddnet?
09:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blame/20cb02048da10771939cee3b00b57a46846b8aa1/src/engine/shared/network.cpp#L308
09:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this should(tm) be where the ddnet 0.7 client reads the token from the server
09:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean i wrote the code .. but idk anymore that was like 4 yrs ago on some italian beach
09:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but this value isn't used anywhere,  is it?
09:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its a ptr
09:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its used in every packet header the client sends from now on
09:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg answer my question already why u care about ddnet code @milkeeycat 
09:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/20cb02048da10771939cee3b00b57a46846b8aa1/src/engine/shared/network_client.cpp#L97
09:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> because I wanna do #8920 ;p
09:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> response token is passed in as a ptr here 
09:40 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8920
09:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and then used for feeding again
09:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/20cb02048da10771939cee3b00b57a46846b8aa1/src/engine/shared/network_client.cpp#L115
09:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh lol rossbit made an issue 
09:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i didnt even see that
09:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I'm pretty sure no way I can do that xDDD
09:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I'm pretty sure there's no way I can do that xDDD
09:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i believe in you
09:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> your godlike hacker
09:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> everyone is gangsta until they have to do something in other's codebase
09:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> everyone is gangsta until they have to do something in someone's codebase
09:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can tell you how i would do it
09:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but to quote lerato
09:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> "Chiller, your development methods are quite chaotic if I may say üòÑ"
09:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my approach might not be useful for you
09:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how would you do it? :p
09:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i only read code as a last resort xd
09:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would spin up a vanilla client and a vanilla server and look at whats heinrichs dissector says should be sent
09:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this is the part of the network i never really cared about so idk it. But as far as i know there are some inf etc packets that need to be sent
09:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i had ddnet client and teeworlds server and i was putting dbg calls to see if code goes further if I change shit in ddnet client code xd
09:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then just copy paste the code that sents it from tw 0.7 into ddnet
09:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ez done
09:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1726472850.png
09:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this seems to be all you need
09:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> unless there is something outside of port 8303
09:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how do i show only tw packets in wireshark? :p
09:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how to make wireshark show only tw packets?
09:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i capture like this ``sudo tcpdump -i lo "port 8303" -w debug.pcap``
09:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but you can also do filters in wireshark
09:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just enter tw
09:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> enter TW7 in display filter for example
09:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``_ws.col.protocol == "TW7"``
09:54 < bridge> <Ewan> I‚Äôm gonna move to Montana and be a dental floss tycoon
09:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1726473242.png
09:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> right click in wireshark then apply as filter
10:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i turned off my wifi and couldnt find the ddnet lan server anymore lol
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok now i got the right dumps
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1726474086.png
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> left ddnet 0.6 and right tw 0.7
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so both trol spam request some port range and then pray for a response xd
10:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/ce245f479abfea3f1ec216dcdd2ebf06bbd05231/src/engine/client/serverbrowser.cpp#L988-L992
10:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> here is where the client sends it
10:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the famouse ``gie3`` packet 
10:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> brings back good old ddos memories haha
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> here you also gotta spam the 0.7 token packet @milkeeycat 
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or how far are you already?
10:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im before start line üò¨
10:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok nice then ill recommend sending the token packet in that loop i sent you
10:11 < bridge> <learath2> What are you making? Weren't you trying to get a tee in the game?
10:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> boi is side tracked hard
10:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also confused me
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> he is now contributing to ddnet so we cant complain
10:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i thought it would be easy but it's not
10:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but now I have to do it to sleep well -.-
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it might take some time!
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its not a low hanging fruit
10:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you want a low hanging fruit i can send you some xd
10:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> all my previous contributions were 5 loc change
10:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat this is another 5 loc :) https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8805
10:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 5 loc are the best
10:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i also would like to add lots of buggy code and fix it for half a year :feelsbadman:
10:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> life goals
10:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 watch the entire video and let me know if you knew everything https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_e9vZj7D8
10:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but I don't make bugs it's just unintended features
10:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I saw dis video :poggers2:
10:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice
10:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that's where I learnt about volatile
10:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i knew volatile exists and what it does but bascially nothing else in the video xd
10:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> now i finally know what the `restrict` means that is always used in the man pages
10:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also the fact that C is allowed to optimize out debug printfs is nuts

14:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> lets make a company
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> RDDX 5090
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sry for spreading true myths
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I stop that
14:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki the company josspit is talking about would make only losses no profits. it basically is a non profit that funds teeworlds development.
14:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> teeworlds dev or u mean 0.7 dev?
14:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> i prefer ddnet dev xd
14:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
14:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> :fuckyousnail:
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ChillerDragon if for one second you don't care about profit, but about pulling the future into the present, Would that convince you?
14:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is no clear decision on that yet but some ideas were floating around that everyone can work on what they want
14:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so basically what we do already but we don't need jobs on the side
14:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk what that sentence means @Jupstar ‚ú™ xd
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I try to bring both of us on the same track
14:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so your recruting me away from teeworlds to dd-pg?
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You are clearly a realistic economic pro.
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And I am a daydreamer.
14:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my trading performance would disagree
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Bcs you listen to me xd
14:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The truth about being good at trading stuff is to be bad
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Monkey are good in it
14:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i totally predicted intels downfall just messed up the option trading xd
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs they'd randomly pick random companies
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You try to predict
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You shouldn't

14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> As long as the overall economy increases take that
14:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> i found out thanks to this, finding a private key is easier if u have a public key
14:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> thanks to this algorithm
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Risky investments are for ppl with lot of money or for ppl that want to be rich xd
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U are rich enough but not super rich
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok chiller now that we have that out of side
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Back to my original question
14:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hm?
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Would you say that working on something as your "job" also means that it must have an impact on how the world develops?
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Like smth innovative?
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean having fun and working on smth
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Like seeing a sense in your job
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or would you say, job is job, I just want money
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> question too vague
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What do you want? An essay about the question?
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i understand what you mean by "job" its the thing that we do to earn money. So the main source of income i guess.
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont understand what you mean by "must"
14:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41547395
14:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> must as in i think every human should contribute to society?
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok but you can have a job that makes millions and you can have a job that is enough to survive
14:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or must as in i would need it to feel fullfilled?
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean you cannot tell me that all the burocracy jobs are "useful" jobs
14:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> explain the "must"
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok true, that is confusing.
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean "is your goal to"
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Like the idea of your job is to be innovative, even if you fail.
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont mind having a useless job to make money
14:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i do appreciate contributing to sociecty
14:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok
14:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah fine
14:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But that is all I wanted to know
14:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u?
14:16 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> That is easy i think
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok pro
14:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ are you typing or u went afk? xd
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I guess I care less 'bout money than usefulness. If your thing is truely useful it should generate enough money anyway
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I am here bro
14:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea thats the thing
14:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you mix in money it might move the usefullness behind a paywall
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But still, to be very clear. I have the feeling that there are many jobs that are not really useful & overpaid
14:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but then on the other hand the paywall might fund the usefull thing that would have otherwise not been possible to be produced
14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I prefer don't do be in such a job
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ agree
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i hope i land such a job xd
14:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> overpaid sounds nice
14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dunno it's just no fun
14:19 < bridge> <simon_1603> where is the default enteties stored?
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> data/editor/entities_clear
14:19 < bridge> <simon_1603> thank you
14:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ i did some real boring non fun job once and it was a really nice time because it was a crazy fun company
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Wtf
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But anyway chiller. You have the money I don't
14:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you have nice people around you that can do a lot
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So you must start the company
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You know how you can convince me
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So be creative
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
14:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> convince you to do what=
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> To join you
14:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pay you a salary?
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well first of all you should open the company
14:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> teewelten GmbH
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Nice
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So we sell tea? üòÇ

14:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wtf is a bitcoin puzzle why do ppl reveal parts of their private key? xd
14:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> iirc you can also restore a complete RSA key if you have parts of it. Which is rip if you only do partial censoring.
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But yeah, join the dark side chiller, ddpg is the new hot ego-trip for the jedi 0.7 defenders
14:36 < bridge> <zhn> lmfao
14:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> join u means implementing switchers in twgame?
14:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> writing GPL rust code sounds more like a job for ryo
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You can also create ddnet physics with a different license ofc
14:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can i do it in C? xd
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In theory yes, but you'd need to use a rust wrapper for the interface
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fair
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> tbh i dont think i could write any code in any language that would be better in any way than ddnet or teeworlds C++ code
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well maybe my asm client is more light weight and my ruby client has easier developer expirience but thats it xd
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xddd
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I need to convert Robster to the dark side

14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> He could have saved 0.7
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> He was supposed to join 0.7 and destroy them.
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> He was supposed to save 0.7 and destroy them.
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oy too afk
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> He was supposed to save 0.7 not destroy them.

14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> tomorrow more ddnet-insta coding with fresh bran
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Good night
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I hope my inception worked
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And you create your idea until december
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u brain washed me?
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> planting ideas
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u want me to build ddnet3 or wat
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is this reality?
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> to have more options for the launcher?
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> whats ur agenda
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Good idea
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can we put goofworlds in the launcher?
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds-go/goofworlds
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Wth xD
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> How many projects do you have man
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
15:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> zilly dreck Huhn
15:24 < bridge> <learath2> Do we have a map renderer for the web?
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We have 3
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The old.
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> DDNet based
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> TwGPU based
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://ddnet.github.io/
15:26 < bridge> <learath2> Which one is the most performant?
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I guess for zooming, twgpu is unbeaten
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> DDNet based is basically like ingame with wgl overhead
15:27 < bridge> <learath2> Oh and is twgpu mature enough? As in no missing features?
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> afaik it is mature now
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mipmaps are finally implemented
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But DDNet & twgpu use webgl2
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Afaik that doesn't work on iOS
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xdd
15:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://ddnet.org/mappreview/?map=Linear works on ios for me iirc
15:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and whatever patiga sent me also worked on iOS
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Oh ok
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then that changed
15:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i cant tell if lerato is trolling
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ?
15:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> "Do we have a map renderer for the web?" 
15:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its a core part of the official ddnet website since i can remember
15:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> patiga keeps talking about it. you keep talking about it.
15:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is even twwe
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sometimes he is 80, sometimes he is 12
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Gotta accept it
15:40 < bridge> <learath2> I could have asked just about the thing patiga is working on. But this way I got a nice overview from the jupman
15:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> this page uses webgl1
15:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But WebGL2 was indeed added to safari in 2021 finally xd
15:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I am just old
15:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im gonna cook something on my job using webgl2 üòè
15:44 < bridge> <patiga> bezier curves are not implented, apart from that everything should be implemented. on normal zoom levels, the ddnet renderer is much more performant.
15:44 < bridge> <patiga> in theory twgpu can also run on webgpu, but I haven't set that up yet (then it would run semi-native from on desktop)
15:45 < bridge> <patiga> *webgpu would run on vhrome windows, everything else not certain üòÖ
15:46 < bridge> <learath2> even running inside a browser?
15:46 < bridge> <patiga> yea chillerdragon's link is twgpu
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What, since when that?
15:47 < bridge> <patiga> ah no
15:47 < bridge> <patiga> read the link wrong
15:47 < bridge> <patiga> brb changing trains
15:47 < bridge> <learath2> Also do you happen to know if any of these renderers expose a js api to control stuff?

15:49 < bridge> <smallcapybara> thx
15:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what do you to control?
15:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what do you want to control?
15:51 < bridge> <learath2> Mostly zoom level and camera coordinates
15:55 < bridge> <patiga> not directly on js level, but that could be *relatively* easy with the generated wasm module.
15:55 < bridge> <patiga> see https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twgpu/-/tree/master/map-inspect-web?ref_type=heads
15:55 < bridge> <patiga> for the website behind
15:55 < bridge> <patiga> https://mapview.patiga.eu/?ddnet=Linear
15:55 < bridge> <patiga> I couldn't figure out the html/css for mobile :/
16:14 < bridge> <patiga> if you want static camera zoom + coordinates, I would simply add url parameters
16:36 < bridge> <timakro> do you guys think it would be a good idea to add /super to bring super to practice mode?
16:37 < bridge> <timakro> i noticed this was missing when building the new trashmap and now also someone asked for it
16:57 < bridge> <furo> Well, super currently works by being in team 64 and is able to interact with other teams. It has special cases all over the code base, just searching for `TEAM_SUPER` gives 107 occurrences. But would probably be possible to make something that is "less-super".
17:01 < bridge> <timakro> super is basically not being able to freeze, no?
17:03 < bridge> <learath2> I wanted to but it was terrifying üòÑ
17:03 < bridge> <learath2> It feels like it will definitely create cheats
17:04 < bridge> <timakro> seems to me it would be simplest to ignore the existing super code
17:04 < bridge> <timakro> not sure if it does anything but prevent freeze
17:07 < bridge> <furo> That's what it's mainly used for, but it does a lot more. Excluded from shields, draggers, switches, kill tiles, all types of freeze (deep, live) and ability to interact with any player.
17:13 < bridge> <timakro> hmm if it's interacting with so many systems it would indeed be smartest to hook into the existing super code
17:14 < bridge> <timakro> and yep i agree it's scary :D
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> super can also interact across teams
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
17:58 < bridge> <louis> yes
17:58 < bridge> <louis> furo mentioned that
17:58 < bridge> <louis> you're not affected by powerup-offs though which is kinda funny
17:59 < bridge> <louis> i don't think it's worth it though
17:59 < bridge> <louis> i feel like the current /lastrescue command is really powerful on its own
18:00 < bridge> <louis> it could be upgraded to a /setstate and /laststate type of command though
18:00 < bridge> <louis> so you can reset to a midair state
18:00 < bridge> <louis> so you can reset to a midair state with velocity, etc.
18:00 < bridge> <timakro> i mean tp to cursor is powrful as well
19:13 < bridge> <texnonik> could you ad in demos marker filter so if there are markers i can filter them to up ?
19:19 < bridge> <totar> This is kinda insane right? Is there any reason we should keep this
19:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :f4:
19:26 < bridge> <louis> its rly funny to troll people with it pls keep
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Not if it blocks useful features üòÑ
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or refactors
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's quite messy that teams interact with each others

23:40 < bridge> <learath2> I've never seen it tried on a novel programming language it can't possibly have in it's corpus
23:45 < bridge> <Ewan> it cant
23:45 < bridge> <Ewan> im gonna guess
23:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i tried to get it to write Cave Story TSC but it didnt get the concept at all
23:45 < bridge> <Ewan> and that language is very very simple
