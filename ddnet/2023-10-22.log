06:04 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> Why are these stars in the frieze visible to all players, and not just allies?
06:04 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> As I understand it, TeamMask() is the same for both teams?
07:14 < bridge> <kekomonter> Team mask is using for ddnet teams, not for teeworlds teams
08:51 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> how to do it for TeeWorlds?
08:55 < bridge> <kekomonter> Pass in `Mask` argument all teamates id's
08:56 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> in an array?
09:00 < bridge> <kekomonter> This is bitset, smth like array with bits, just get all teamates id's and add to bitset. Smth like this:
09:00 < bridge> <kekomonter> 
09:00 < bridge> <kekomonter> ```cpp
09:00 < bridge> <kekomonter> CClientMask Mask;
09:00 < bridge> <kekomonter> 
09:00 < bridge> <kekomonter> for(int i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++)
09:00 < bridge> <kekomonter> {
09:00 < bridge> <kekomonter>     if(m_apPlayers[i] && IsTeamate(i))
09:00 < bridge> <kekomonter>         Mask[i] = true;
09:00 < bridge> <kekomonter> }
09:00 < bridge> <kekomonter> 
09:00 < bridge> <kekomonter> CreateDamageInd(arg1, arg2, arg3, Mask);
09:00 < bridge> <kekomonter> ```
10:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it should (and did when we saw the old oracle cloud servers revive)
10:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but maybe something broke during the DoS
10:49 < bridge> <Ewan> this is not a bitset
10:49 < bridge> <Ewan> something similar can be achieved with a std bitset
10:49 < bridge> <Ewan> but this is just a normal array
10:49 < bridge> <Ewan> unless i am missing something
10:52 < bridge> <kekomonter> This is typedef std::bitset<MAX_CLIENTS>
10:52 < bridge> <Ewan> oh lol
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> yes that typedef would have been helpful
11:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> good morning
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> time to apply to moderator :kek:
11:51 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Do you +1 applicationa which mentions rust? :justatest:
11:51 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Do you +1 applications which mentions rust? :justatest:
11:52 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Do you +1 applications which mention rust? :justatest:
11:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> why aren't you a moderator actually
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was in the past but i fighted heinrich
11:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> honestly i probs could easily be moderator unless heinrich doesnt want cuz we sometimes dont go together
11:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that make a lot of sense actually
11:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
11:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo: i probably shouldn't be a mod as well, but i think i'm just here overseeing chn mods
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur like the chinese messenger
11:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>  i guess so
12:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
12:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tsfreddie arrived for the chinese ppl
12:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSSGzS9JykmJ_TQuvR46vGf8jCuBuJWKEMcJtWdBWICuP1rcyTa
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd like to mass ping all the ppl that asked to apply as moderator lmao
12:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I should eat more salad
12:35 < bridge> <sao_jomini> 😄
12:36 < bridge> <sao_jomini> 🙂
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> 😬
12:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :PokeShock:
13:04 < bridge> <chronoveins> how do I apply for an admin of ddnet
13:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for admin, no. for moderator, check #announcements . no idea why you haven't tho
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDDD
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> directly apply as admin
13:11 < bridge> <cyberFighter> :gigachad:
13:18 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> Is it possible to somehow make a ban not by IP, but by hwid or mac address?
13:21 < bridge> <robyt3> That's not how the internet works, your mac address is only known in your local network
13:22 < bridge> <robyt3> You'd need to change the client so it's sends this hardware ID and mac address to the server, but a malicious client could just send fake data
13:22 < bridge> <robyt3> You'd need to change the client so it sends hardware ID and mac address to the server, but a malicious client could just send fake data
13:24 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> DDNet client does not send hwid?
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no why should it
14:10 < bridge> <chronoveins> How can I find out if I have been successfully selected as a moderator?
14:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> admins will reply on your application thread i'm pretty sure.
14:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> give it a week or two
14:17 < bridge> <learath2> Usually after the applications close we reply within one to two weeks
14:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> did you announce a closing date
14:18 < bridge> <learath2> No, but we usually do 2 or 3 weeks
14:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> 👌
14:34 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> and how to implement a ban except for nickname and IP
14:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, implement accounts
14:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else u cant
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nickname bans also have a disadvantage, that smone could fake them
14:36 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> I know about nicknames.
14:36 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> I need a ban that cannot be circumvented by changing the IP/nickname.
14:36 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> accounts - not particularly suitable for this task, there are accounts, but they are not required, just for entering player statistics
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well what kind of thing should that be? XD
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no account and no IP
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mac addresses are not safe as robyte already said
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can easily fake them
14:39 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> That is, there is no way to do without accounts? right?
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> basically no
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> new bot
16:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> bothub
17:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would apply to mod but i like purple color more
17:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i feel special
17:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> and if someone rejects me, i want it to be heinrich
17:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> honestly 16 is too young
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do u even play this game? xd
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i do from time to time
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> but moderating is not like playing
17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well then just go ahead. your beef with heinrich is like 6 years ago. u got more adult and so on xdd
17:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah been long since i think i had beef with him
17:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u know u never know
17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> longer than me 😬
17:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> 😬
17:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> go for mod
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mhh dunno xd
17:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> my only grip is that it says u have to answer to calls for help but i wonder if they include technical stuff, i hate dms about technical stuff when they can ask in #questions and anyone can answer faster
17:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> i always redirect em to here
17:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> (this is not a complain to get the dev role removed, i like it xd)
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no technical questions are not included
17:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder why plp think a dm is better than asking in a public channel
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe they think the question is stupid
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> understandable xdd
17:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wont apply anyway
17:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
17:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oke
17:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks non staff ppl like us carry ddnet
17:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> its the way it is
17:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
17:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> now we should just remove back compat
17:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> further progress
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we should instead split the project
17:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u know when vulkan 1.4 releases
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am no krhonos member yet
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
17:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> yet
17:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sad that i am old
17:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> so old
17:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> there are 60y old programmers there
17:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was about to make a joke but better not
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> these are basically my prime days.. so if i wont achieve anything now, then never
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> huge RIP
17:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> u will be a old wise coder
17:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> teaching the goods of rust
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but they aren't really doing anything useful  anymore xd
19:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does someone have a tool to extract chat from a demo?
19:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @patiga u once worked on demo stuff, maybe u have some code flying around for that?
19:13 < bridge> <robyt3> Not exactly a full tool, but you could play the demo in headless client on fastest speed and get the chat from the console log
19:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i think i did that once
19:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i want to analyze like 300-1000 demos xd
19:14 < bridge> <robyt3> Should be straightforward to create a tool for this though
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah probably xd
19:29 < bridge> <robyt3> I'll probably do it eventually
19:30 < bridge> <robyt3> Is chat enough or is someone going to ask for broadcast export etc. next? :justatest:
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDD
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for me chat is enough
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but u dont have to do it
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think i even still have a backup

19:44 < bridge> <robyt3> Opened an issue for now. Want to try implementing lazy skin loading first
19:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 3 lines of bash
19:55 < bridge> <learath2> This is already implemented in the teewebs client, if you want inspiration
19:56 < bridge> <chairn> wasn't there an already opened PR ?
19:58 < bridge> <robyt3> There's #6727 but it's mostly a draft. And I think that implementation is a lot more complicated than it needs to be.
19:58 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6727
20:00 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Yo, i recently made a ~~game~~. It was my first time using opengl and c++ :pepeW: (i had to do it for uni). If you have nothing to do id my very happy if you could check the code and how fukcing bad it is, maybe i had to use x instead of y or smth. :D https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/diagonals
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no vulkan, bad
20:01 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> vulkan isnt for grugs
20:01 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> hard
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i like the CallGL macro
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is that your idea?
20:02 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i yoiked it myself
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice nice
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now pls maintain opengl code for ddnet
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
20:03 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :pepeW:
20:03 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i barely wrote a program with 3 shaders
20:03 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> and it already looks ugly
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sounds like u talkn about ddnet
20:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least u can say u know all the OGL 3.3 techniques
20:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> vertex array
20:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> index buffer
20:04 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> yea :D
20:05 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Yo, i recently made a ~~game~~. It was my first time using opengl and c++ :pepeW: (i had to do it for uni). If you have nothing to do id be very happy if you could check the code and how fukcing bad it is, maybe i had to use x instead of y or smth. :D https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/diagonals
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now learn vulkan and understand that vertex arrays are a lie
20:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
20:10 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i wanted to write somehting like this
20:10 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1165713716185157632/maxresdefault.png?ex=6547da7f&is=6535657f&hm=a6c5f0278d2c1e5e876e8de3cbac4aff0e61fad5a953ab188be656cbc828c1a9&
20:10 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> but muuuuuch simpler xD
20:10 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> this one looks like it will take few years to do :pepeW:
20:11 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> this one looks like it will take a few years to do :pepeW:
20:12 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i also wanted to make a moaning anime sound when u lose but i didnt know what lib to use for it :feelsbadman:
20:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> could be cool
20:26 < bridge> <kekomonter> bass? OpenAL?
20:26 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i couldnt decide what to use xD
20:26 < bridge> <kekomonter> OS API? :kek:
20:27 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i asked before but nobody answered xd
20:27 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> windows just have function PlayAudio :pepeW:
20:28 < bridge> <kekomonter> Use Bass xd
20:28 < bridge> <kekomonter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1165718369761247303/image.png?ex=6547ded5&is=653569d5&hm=0499ff07dd9f43225904fdf4abf956e8922069c890d70c1018d63ee44b65d328&
20:53 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> god i need to get into shader code
20:54 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> custom shaders for ddnet maps would be sick af
20:55 < bridge> <kekomonter> Adding custom shaders in ddnet renders is so painful mission
20:56 < bridge> <kekomonter> And how I remember, vulkan and opengl have different shaders langs
21:31 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yea..
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then thers is opengl 1
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it doesnt even have a shader language in its core spec
21:48 < bridge> <kekomonter> Hm, maybe shaders in maps is real, but it need smth like translator from GLSL to vulkan shaders and just turn off shaders on opengl 1. And I think it will make ddnet map files fat
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well just saying shaders for maps is ez
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u'd need a spec what exactly can be changed by a map shader
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does it get any input (e.g. vertices?)
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is it post processing only
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> stencil buffers
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there is so much stuff
21:49 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i was thinking post processing stuff
21:50 < bridge> <kekomonter> RTX in ddnet :gigachad:
21:50 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> you can do a lot with shaders but post processing seems the most straight forward
21:50 < bridge> <cyberFighter> @_voxeldoesart
21:50 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> npt reading thay
21:50 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> not reading thay
21:50 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> not reading that
21:51 < bridge> <cyberFighter> Ok but asking clyde
21:51 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> clyde is ass
21:51 < bridge> <kekomonter> Im so lazy for turning on vpn and ask normal gpt
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well and another problem is that shaders can crash your GPU
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as stupid as it sounds
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there isn't really a 100% safe shader
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> recently chromium also had a vulnerable related to webgl
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> probably nicer would be if the user has to manually enable mods (with some kind of disclaimer)
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and if he gets virus... rip xd
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> his fault xdd
