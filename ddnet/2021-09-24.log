00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but anyway, i've read stuff, that makes no sense to me anyway
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. the computer case causing laggs xD
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @heinrich5991 do you think a pure rust safe(except some needed code, but mostly userspace) OS + rust user space programs could disable virtual memory translation and the system-user space CPU rings?
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> like a proof that memory is used safly
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> like a proof that memory is used safely
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you intend to do? I think there are some research OS that do what you mean with webassembly
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but they run into hardware vulnerability problems
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh ok, i was just thinking about potentials of higher level languages, that have good performance like rust
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and maybe in a long run also redesigning CPUs again
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what is the point of getting rid of the rings? less context switching?
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, all in for performance
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> smells risky üòõ
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah true, i just always liked to find a way to remove such stuff without destroying the whole world xD
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe with a subset of rust that could allow formally proving safety?
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk if such a subset exists/can exist, but if you could formally prove that the user can't do the things the user isn't supposed to do you could get rid of the rings
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the rings add defense-in-depth at least, I wouldn't like to drop them tbh
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I havne't had enough proven software yet, I think
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I like the ring structure, so I wouldn't touch it, it's not that inefficient to do a context switch into the kernel
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> could there be some way for afks to have map veto to an extent
03:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if u have to go for like 10 mins in t0 in a long run someone could join and vote a diff map

14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Since when does ddnet client autocomplete commands?
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont think i have ever seen that nor the code for it
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's a bit ugly but it works, it uses a builtin list
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah, then i wouldnt call it "working"
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> at all xd
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for other servers at least
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well given ddnet encompasses almost 60% (iirc) of all players and ddnet based mods encompass probably 90% of players, I'm fine with calling it "working" üòõ
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xdD
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I want to send the 0.7 command message to ddnet clients too and use that instead
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea, I wanted to suggest that too
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Add the RemoveCommand too :)

15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i forgot i did this
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> back when you didnt know about force push, we've all been through this xd
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™ no
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a tactic
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to appear higher in contribs list
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> lol you didnt even commit under you as author
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats some 999IQ play
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats cuz its a old email
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i changed my githubv username
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i should do that too xd
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then i dont get nobo fixes into my stats xd
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have found peak cancer
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://www.mightyapp.com/
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Mighty streams your browser from a powerful computer in the cloud.
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What sort of twisted thinking is required to go from "this piece of software is performing badly" to "we should stream it from the cloud"
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Large corporations love this kind of thing, like Windows on some cloud machine
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The subscription model is crack for capitalism anyway. The more they can milk out of you the better
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, everything is cloud-based and "as a service". I'm even worried that people might think that's how DDNet works since we offer it for free
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When are we doing ddnet on stadia btw? üòÑ
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really want to see someone try engineer a browser from the ground up, with strict adherence to the standard. I wonder if it really needs to use a gigabyte of ram per tab and eat 16 core cpus for breakfast
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> what causes this btw, the vms?
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe we just support too many languages
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> javascript imho
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> one clean language, and the others are loaded on demand, but then its the performance battle again as soon as someone claims to have faster JS performance or whatever, bcs the on demand startup time is too slow
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> js shouldnt exist it should be just webassembly
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a feeling it's all the indexes needed to let web developers do stupid things without a performance hit
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah probably xd
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> discord for me lately is acting rly slow
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think since last update
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sucks
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> clean cache
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> for me its slow after 2 months
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is no reason to the way modern web pages are rendered, you are supposed to be able to access all parts of the DOM O(1) at all points of rendering
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then i clean the cache and its fast again xd
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (im using discord app)
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh i use it in browser. but the app also uses webkit i think
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is a cache in %Appdata you can try clearing
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it would probably nuke your login too btw
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wats Appdata
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah you are on linux, right
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it should be somewhere under .local
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bold of u to assume otherwise
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or maybe .config
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its better
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to open the inspector
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i forgot how
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ctrl + shift + i
