12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why i dont like tw and i like more ddnet in a single comment
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even worse then that, in the vanilla realm it all depends on getting on Oy's good side, I spent hours trying to convince them to adopt 64p, no budging
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all the leaders of tw dev think they are all mighty and just **right**
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I forgot whom but someone else convinced oy with like the equivalent of "lol let's just add it bro"
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i guess being friend of them makes it easier to model the game the way you want ðŸ˜‰
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I do kinda agree with lordsk on not adding sliders for everything but I'm not against ui options being hidden in the console
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why even hide them
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt hurt anyone to be able to customize it in a easy way
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the way you want
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well limited ui space is one issue
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that guy jsut wants to treat people like 11y olds
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can add a scroll
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and just scroll down
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah but is that really good ui?
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for me yes
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the more options the better
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is what factorio sound options are
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/695223758654537788/unknown.png
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> want to know what sound options tw has?
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not overkill to add 4 options for chat sounds
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are just overexagerating
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is good user experience to actually have the options, sure. But I'm not sold on having scrollbars for all the ui elements
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah the sound thing was ridiculous
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe a checkbox somewhere that enables extra settings?
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd keep the default ui retard friendly like the vanilla people want and we can get more options
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2277
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh shit can we finally change weapon volume
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can we make ryos sound options a meme pls?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I think thats even worse https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2525
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> "we wont fix bugs because there are other bugs as well"
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dune is a special child
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he is usually 90% the one who says bloat this bloat that
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea my propsoal is not bloat
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its a bug fix ðŸ˜„
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> could solve spying on whisper for example
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if you name ur self "namless" you can spy on all whisper msgs sent to "nameless tee"
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> chillers bug fixes usually cause more bugs
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rude
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he didnt make the bugfix
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he just opened a issue
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so it has no relation jao
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he didnt code anything
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i saw some bug fixes from him
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1624
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ðŸ˜„
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> didnt it solve 2 issues at once?
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @heinrich5991 Hey, can I bug you because of vanilla tokens again? It seems like there are really only two places where a server needs to send connless packets instead of responding and those are the mastersrv heartbeat and the mastersrv count request. I want to try to get around implementing a token cache and packet cache (to wait on requested tokens). Do you happen to know if I can use a token multiple times and if i can rely on the token 
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I would try only getting before the count request and just sticking with that until a full reconnect occurs after 60 minutes
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I would try only getting a token before the count request and just sticking with that until a full reconnect occurs after 60 minutes
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Also are old tokens still valid immediately after a new token is announced via the control message? Should be like this to account for a situation where the token control message has not yet arrived when a connless packet is sent by the other party

20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 what does validate_size do here? or why is it important?
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/ca03ab6337cc14858e2577c8c177b6f3245f8641#diff-4c1480841d96bf73e07b29e10fbd394b
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That object can be any size depending on version iirc
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro tokens are valid for 10 seconds
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 https://pabloariasal.github.io/2018/02/19/its-time-to-do-cmake-right/ cool read
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> interesting, will read
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> concerning ddnet though: @Ryozuki https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2085
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ugh
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would bump it
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> github downish
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marius> RIP github
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @heinrich5991 When i request a new token, is the old token still valid for some time?
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> token validity has nothing to do with whether you request tokens
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it only has to do with timeouts
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the server changes the token every 10 seconds (or so)
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> are always 2 tokens valid then?
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ahh
