20:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> oh thats rly nice
20:57 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> hmm, is it intended that passing some configfile with -f will search storage paths and in most cases not accept a direct path ?
20:58 <@deen> probably not, should make that an absolute path
21:01 <@deen> it calls the same method as exec right now
21:03 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> maybe just add a switch to CConsole::ExecuteFile, so it uses io_open instead of storage stuff and use that for -f ?
21:03 <@deen> nono
21:03 <@deen> i have a special enum flag for that already
21:03 <@deen> when we want that kind of file handling
21:03 <@deen> will add it here
21:03 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> nice
21:04 <@deen> but hm
21:05 <@deen> actually this might be a bit of a bigger problem
21:05 <@deen> how do we want to open autoexec.cfg for example?
