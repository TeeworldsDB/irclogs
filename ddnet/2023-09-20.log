07:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> kill whoever invented webkit-gtk
07:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> it takes longer to compile than firefox
07:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just wanted to use gnucash to keep track of my accounting, it requires for some reason webkit-gtk

10:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft go sleep
13:11 < bridge> <learath2> Wat?
13:12 < bridge> <learath2> Is it like an electron app but they didn't want to use electron so they made their own?
13:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk xD
13:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> gnucash predates electron
13:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.gnucash.org/
13:12 < bridge> <learath2> Make your own, accounting is simple
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> made in 1999
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i already compiled it
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> hm
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe i should use a cli one
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i like that gnucash makes graphics and stuff
13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> <https://github.com/Gnucash/gnucash/blob/stable/ChangeLog.1999>
13:14 < bridge> <learath2> Assets = Liabilities + Equity, just do it by hand like in the olden times
13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think they use webkit for the plots and stuff
13:14 < bridge> <learath2> Wow that is ancient. So it predates webkit too
13:15 < bridge> <learath2> Why not just output dot?
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont ask me
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> im  mad at this

GnuCash uses Gtk2 for its GUI, so you must use WebKitGtk-2. `yum-builddep gnucash` should get you everything you need, though you may need to include a Fedora rpm repository in your list as IIRC Centos/RHEL doesn't support GnuCash.

13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> so
13:17 < bridge> <deen> I see, let's add Webkit to DDNet to render the server browser etc?
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> they want to show generated html reports in the app itself
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> instead of delegating that work to firefox for example
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes, so ddnet with deps will compile in 1 hour
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> on a good system

13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> they did smth rly wrong there
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> gtk is up to bad
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 u know the best
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> webkit-gtk has 3!!! slots
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> in gentoo
13:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> so if u end up with 3 binaries that use a different slot
13:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> u compile it 3 times!!

13:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://bugs.gentoo.org/893668
13:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://bugs.gentoo.org/526998
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> @deen is https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6552 still not possible?
13:24 < bridge> <deen> I gave up on using crosstool-ng
13:25 < bridge> <deen> seems complicated
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 wasnt zig the best cross compiler
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> u know if it works here
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> @deen can u do cross builds using docker?
13:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/cross-rs/cross does that somewhat
13:26 < bridge> <deen> Maybe not following https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/16270
13:27 < bridge> <deen> How does it matter if it's docker, a VM or a chroot? The problem is that there is no distribution that has an old enough glibc version and a new enough C++ compiler to make this work
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
13:27 < bridge> <deen> which is what crosstool-ng is supposed to solve
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> well do we rly need to support those old glibcs
13:28 < bridge> <deen> First you complain about long compile times, then you want to use fancy new C++ features which will probably increase our compile times üòÑ
13:28 < bridge> <deen> I care, and so do people using non-rolling release distros
13:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean we are talking different orders of magnitudes xD
13:29 < bridge> <deen> I think the more modern C++ usage is the main reason webkit takes longer than compile than firefox
13:29 < bridge> <deen> to*
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> is it?
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> what version do they use
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> altho in part firefox uses nodejs
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> which takes another 15min to compile
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> also arent modules simplifying compilation
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc, compile times arent due to parsing c++
13:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> they are from codegen
13:30 < bridge> <deen> Not using a more recent standard, but fancy features like templates
13:30 < bridge> <learath2> It's probably less the fact that it's C++20 but that the modern way of writing C++ is jusr very very slow to compile
13:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> why?
13:31 < bridge> <learath2> Templates and SFINAE
13:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> template heavy stuff?
13:31 < bridge> <deen> Templates live in header, have to be handled again in each cpp file that includes the header
13:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> is template heavy c++ slower to compile than rust?
13:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:31 < bridge> <deen> No, Rust is probably even worse
13:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder
13:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> deno compiles in 4 mins for me
13:32 < bridge> <learath2> If rust werent compiling everything it might be faster
13:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> it does the same as nodejs
13:32 < bridge> <learath2> No templatemagic
13:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> true, we include deps when compiling in rust
13:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> so its a mixed bag
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
13:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i  feel rust has better paralelization when compiling?
13:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No header files no problems xd
13:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That's what i hate just about cpp tbh
13:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Having to write functions twice
13:33 < bridge> <learath2> I don't even think about it nowadays
13:34 < bridge> <learath2> The biggest annoyance for me is not being able to declare templates in headers
13:34 < bridge> <learath2> You end up with this weird asymmetric case
13:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> one thing i always found curious is
13:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> c++ forward declarations
13:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> u simply dont have them in rust
13:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i think they are beginner unfriendly
13:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wont tell u how much i struggled to understand em when learning xd
13:36 < bridge> <learath2> It's necessary to have with the way C++ is parsed
13:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/definition
13:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> ODR

13:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> reposting a meme heinrich shared time ago
13:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:38 < bridge> <deen> Just go back to Pascal, large scale programs compiled before your finger is off the key you pressed to start the compilation üòÑ
13:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> wasnt pascal a 1 pass compiler or smth
13:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
13:38 < bridge> <learath2> There is an article on my to read list about how pascal compiled so fast
13:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont build an ast 4head
13:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 have u seen what clang ast looks like
13:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
13:39 < bridge> <learath2> I've only barely interacted with it to parse ddnet source to extract a relationship graph

13:39 < bridge> <deen> > The Turbo name alluded to the speed of compiling and of the executables produced. The edit/compile/run cycle was fast compared to other Pascal implementations because everything related to building the program was stored in RAM, and because it was a one-pass compiler written in assembly language. Compiling was much faster than compilers for other languages (even Borland's own later compilers for C),[citation needed] and other Pascal compilers, and p
13:39 < bridge> <deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal
13:40 < bridge> <deen> Probably this article: https://prog21.dadgum.com/45.html
13:41 < bridge> <deen> (Part 2 about Pascal: https://prog21.dadgum.com/47.html?repost=true)
13:41 < bridge> <learath2> Could be, not home to check
13:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh nice
13:42 < bridge> <learath2> These computers they make us take exams on are so damn slow. Matlab runs at a snails pace
13:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i used once the rust clang crate (bindings to clang itself) to inspect a c++ library to generate bindings xd
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just buy more cores
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Soon we compile on gpu, xd
13:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i always forget that if u have  a var of type `[uX; N]` it is Copy
13:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> [u8; 32]
13:50 < bridge> <learath2> That's one thing gpus would probably never be good at
13:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if compilers do this, but i think the future would be to make function dependency graphs
13:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> and analyze it
13:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> then find paralelization opportunities
13:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> when compiling
13:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc rn most langs just paralelize modules
13:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> but im not much into this i may be bullshitting
13:52 < bridge> <learath2> Solving these graphs might take longer than just compiling. It's not exactly trivial

13:55 < bridge> <learath2> That's a big oof
13:55 < bridge> <reitw> 35TB :issou:
13:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why not. If your project is big enough
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Like many translation units
14:07 < bridge> <learath2> Idk if modern compute units are flexible enough but parsing through code isn't exactly what they are good at
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well i guess they are flexible enough, but probably is still rather slow
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe if u somehow group similar compilation tasks together
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Would defs be a funny experience

15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Buy a GPU
15:36 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> oke
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Somehow u made your sdl go into an offscreen mode
15:37 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> when im root all works but when i change user it doesnt :pepeW:
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is this Wayland?
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It sounds like u arent in the video group
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And thus have no access to your gpu
15:38 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> x11
15:38 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i chose what ive seen in wiki :D
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why do you all choose gentoo if u don't know how Linux works lmao
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Gentoo is for no lifers
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Like ryo
15:40 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :feelsbadman:
15:40 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> thanks for advice anyways
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Search the wiki about the video user group
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That could be the problem here
15:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> are u in gentoo
15:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> video group
15:48 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> yep
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> they are following my cult
15:49 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> actually yes
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> To follow the path:
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki>     look to the master,
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki>     follow the master,
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki>     walk with the master,
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki>     see through the master,
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki>     become the master.
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe write a gentoo blog where this wouldn't have happened
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> but ur right they should learn more
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> the video group is actually on the wiki

16:09 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Or Mint
16:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Xdd
16:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Did u try to search the Internet for your problem
16:13 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Yep
16:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat whats ur bash_profile

17:08 < bridge> <learath2> I can become a rustacean
17:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
17:21 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> It worked ü•π
17:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> what worked
17:22 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Everything
17:22 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Startx works
17:22 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Ddnet works
17:23 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> All i did is added 2 groups
19:02 < bridge> <learath2> Are you also doing the gentoo moment?
19:13 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> maybe
19:14 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> gentoo btw

19:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> bruv
19:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> remove borders from i3
19:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and use this awesome purple color theme
19:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
19:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat if u want a lightweight file browser that doesnt require bloat gtk, i recommend xfe
19:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> welcome to 1995
19:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its fast af
19:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> and lightweight
19:23 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> who couldve though if u login with one name but then change it, you wouldnt be able to run startx :pep
19:23 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> who couldve though if u login with one name but then change it, you wouldnt be able to run startx :pepeW:
19:24 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I use lf https://github.com/gokcehan/lf
19:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i use tree
19:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mr.gh0s7 i only use gui file manager cuz some programs want drag and drop
19:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> otherwise i use ls cd
19:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:28 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I copy the file path from lf in such cases and paste it from there (in the gui one) so in the end it's faster
19:29 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Also, lf is very extendable via shell scripts.
19:32 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> @ryozuki can i be in gentoo ddnet club? :justatest:
19:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> u gotta use it for a month
19:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur daily driver
19:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz u wont find "problems" if u dont use it
19:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw what terminal u use
19:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw i recommend this
19:36 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> I use xterm
19:36 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> But u use alacrity
19:37 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Coz its written in rust btw
19:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i3config, i do it gapless
19:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```

19:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> use alacritty bro
19:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> its faster
19:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> my modifier key is the windows key
19:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> or where the windows icon usually is
19:37 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Ill probably switch terminal coz i cant even paste shit in Terminal
19:38 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :pepeW:
19:38 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> I use alt
19:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye xterm is not best
19:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> alt is not the best modifier
19:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz u use alt in programs
19:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> u dont use win key
19:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its personal
19:38 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Fair
19:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw i use i3blocks for the bar
19:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> check out  https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks-contrib

19:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> then i can use 20
19:40 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> I can finally build client code ü•π
19:41 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Dats cool
19:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u setup gentoo guru
19:41 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Not yet
19:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> do it
19:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> also learn portage
19:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> its the heart of gentoo
19:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> learn what a package mask is
19:41 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> I was setting up tmux
19:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> learn what use flags are
19:41 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :p
19:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> hm does tmux make sense locally
19:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> u just split

21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did have this before?
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else try to restart windows over "Restart" first.. this often helps
21:08 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i see window
21:08 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> windows reference (based)
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> ‚ùì
21:19 < bridge> <teero777> jus a joke
21:46 < bridge> <pilonpl> Nice
21:47 < bridge> <pilonpl> But
21:47 < bridge> <pilonpl> We already have many image generators
21:48 < bridge> <pilonpl> ~~Specifically for generating anime girls~~
21:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> question is how well it works together with gpt
21:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that could make it very powerful
21:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g.
21:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://images.openai.com/blob/54facbbb-c94c-4884-8c94-5b984b19749c/dalle-image-map.png?trim=0,0,0,0&width=2600
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if that is true. would be completely insane
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> midjourney was the best draw in the world. but it was stupid af
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> understanding text
21:53 < bridge> <pilonpl> I wonder what they did to make it more precise
21:53 < bridge> <pilonpl> Is this just a diffusion model with better training?
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess they somehow combined it with gpt intelligence.
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. maybe descripe the individual details first, then combine it into a final image
21:58 < bridge> <pilonpl> I think gpt can use this tool
21:58 < bridge> <pilonpl> So it's not exactly integrated into it
21:58 < bridge> <pilonpl> It's hard to tell
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i could imagine it's a model that actually is connected to gpt3
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> similar to our brain.. but ofc still very different xd
22:00 < bridge> <pilonpl> I wonder if chatgpt could communicate with the diffusion model using some "ai language" and not english
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah maybe it doesnt really communicate over text
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but over "neurons"
22:01 < bridge> <pilonpl> I guess it depends on how you train the models
22:02 < bridge> <comebackplay> i just come back after 1 year drop
22:03 < bridge> <comebackplay> i jsut need some how reduce single cpu, if possible do multicore
22:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can change the thread schedular.. but no idea how under windows
22:14 < bridge> <comebackplay> i think it is possible just by change game settings, but i change fps and no reaction at all
22:14 < bridge> <comebackplay> i think it is possible just by change game settings, but i try change fps and no reaction at all
22:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can limit cpu usage
22:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> over cl_refresh_rate
22:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it might affect input tho
22:15 < bridge> <comebackplay> ye i aready tried that
22:16 < bridge> <comebackplay> like i said before, no reaction at all
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what did u set it to?
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `cl_refresh_rate 60` should almost eliminate all usage
22:16 < bridge> <comebackplay> 30 fps and still overloaded cpu
22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u sure u used CL
22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not gfx
22:17 < bridge> <comebackplay> what is it
22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> CL refresh rate
22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not GFX refresh rate
22:18 < bridge> <comebackplay> it sis gfx or cl

22:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if its in graphics settings
22:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its gfx
22:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the other is in general
22:20 < bridge> <comebackplay> lol ye its help
22:20 < bridge> <comebackplay> but what diff?
22:20 < bridge> <comebackplay> @jupeyy_keks
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cl = the whole game loop: simulation + input + prepare gfx calls
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> gfx = only gfx calls
22:21 < bridge> <comebackplay> 1 unlimited
22:21 < bridge> <comebackplay>  2 320

22:21 < bridge> <comebackplay> why why it is set up so cringe on default?
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> have u played with 320
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it changes the input
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i personally can't play with it
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> feels weird
22:22 < bridge> <comebackplay> i sure some one too lag cus too have unlimited
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont think so
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lags = overheating
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> most ppl have good coolers
22:23 < bridge> <comebackplay> wtf it is like mining
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's a single core on 100% "only"
22:24 < bridge> <comebackplay> if i run any game it is dont have any lags.
22:24 < bridge> <comebackplay> but tw lag
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> good, but that doesnt mean its tws fault xD
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's your setup that causes it
22:24 < bridge> <comebackplay> idk i have 5.1 ghz
22:24 < bridge> <comebackplay> and no overheat at all
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can also have 8ghz and no lags üòÑ
22:25 < bridge> <comebackplay> i think
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it lags, it must be either some software bug. or some hardware bug
22:25 < bridge> <comebackplay> ofc cus its more powerfull
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and cooling is pretty likely üòÑ
22:28 < bridge> <comebackplay> fck it is frezze some times
22:28 < bridge> <comebackplay> fck it is still frezze some times
22:28 < bridge> <comebackplay> fck it is still frezzed some times
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ^ did u try this already
22:29 < bridge> <comebackplay> it imagen how 2d game have  always lags
22:29 < bridge> <comebackplay> it;s imagen how 2d game have  always lags
22:29 < bridge> <comebackplay> it's imagen how 2d game have  always lags
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no matter which computer i try.. not even my android phone (1000+ fps) i ever had any lags
22:30 < bridge> <comebackplay> last 5 years always need dance with settings for have "unlag tw"

22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u want to compare
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i have cl refresh rate 0
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and gfx refresh rate 1440
22:31 < bridge> <comebackplay> i cange 3 pc and every time its better and still lags.
22:31 < bridge> <comebackplay> i change 3 pc and every time its better and still lags.
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> LAN server ofc

22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the only problem i could slightly imagine is #1996
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> since i'm on linux i dont have this problem
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but most ppl don't complain about lags, so it would be weird if this is really the issue
22:38 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1996
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah i mean doesn't look too bad to me tbh
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does LAN server also lag?
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u play there
22:40 < bridge> <comebackplay> idk didnt play
22:40 < bridge> <comebackplay> why if i set 60 fps its lagg like 20 fps
22:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> newest client?
22:41 < bridge> <comebackplay> 17 2 1
22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then dunno
22:43 < bridge> <comebackplay> when i change Hz my mouse change speed when i move
22:43 < bridge> <comebackplay> @jupeyy_keks  this is so confusing
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You can try:
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `cl_refresh_rate 60; gfx_refresh_rate 0; gfx_asyncrender_old 0`
22:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway sleep is awaiting me. have a good one
22:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can reset all config variables with `reset <var>`
22:45 < bridge> <comebackplay> on any other game if u change fps this is no effect on mouse sentivity.
22:47 < bridge> <comebackplay> idk i smth change and feel like my mouse have more smooth moves and it is annoyng
22:47 < bridge> <comebackplay> and ye it is lag
22:47 < bridge> <comebackplay> still
22:48 < bridge> <comebackplay> after alt+ tab when back into game it is have fps like 20
23:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/GFX_Troubleshooting#Low_FPS,_stuttering_or_similar_problems
23:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
23:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Btw this is all the trouble shooting i collected over the years that helped somebody
23:05 < bridge> <comebackplay> lol
23:07 < bridge> <comebackplay> what about smooth mouse move?
23:07 < bridge> <comebackplay> how to fix that?
23:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Smother is always better
23:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just get used to it
23:08 < bridge> <comebackplay> nope

23:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Source: Internet
23:09 < bridge> <comebackplay> trust me, i swa some video about game desing and smooth is problem on new games
23:10 < bridge> <comebackplay> if u need more realistic video u need smooth but on CS GO it will kill her on tw same
23:10 < bridge> <comebackplay> if u need more realistic video u need smooth but on CS GO it will kill game on tw same
23:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well with smooth i don't mean motion blur or some weird effects. But if it feels faster. It's better
23:11 < bridge> <comebackplay> im now about clear. i wanna fast change my mouse but i cant cus it is smooth
23:12 < bridge> <comebackplay> im not about clear. i wanna fast change my mouse but i cant cus it is smooth
23:12 < bridge> <comebackplay> im not about clear. i wanna fast change my mouse but i cant cus it is smooth look like delay but it is not delay
