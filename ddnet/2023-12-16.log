00:55 < bridge> <cyberfighter> uhhhh
01:02 < bridge> <cyberfighter> nope i have no idea how any of this works
01:02 < bridge> <cyberfighter> what do i do after installing bam
01:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> type `bam` in the source folder
01:08 < bridge> <cyberfighter> tells me no c/c++ compiler found
01:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> apt install build-essential
01:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> apt install build-essentials
01:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i'm not trying to be rude when i say this, i'm genuinely asking. why are you on linux if you don't know how to use a command line
01:16 < bridge> <cyberfighter> im not fucking paying 300 dollars for windows
01:16 < bridge> <Ewan> oh if that's the issue
01:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hypothetically, linux distros also target users not wanting to use the command line
01:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @cyberfighter did that help?
01:19 < bridge> <cyberfighter> whatever, i get to play some old abandoned 13 year old games on linux
01:19 < bridge> <Ewan> we love linux
01:19 < bridge> <cyberfighter> yes but now it just spits out a ton of errors on the building
01:19 < bridge> <louis> u dont need to pay
01:19 < bridge> <louis> u can remove the activate windows thing for free too
01:19 < bridge> <Ewan> but i'm not gonna say it's the year of the linux desktop until it's 100% command-line pain free for basic users
01:19 < bridge> <louis> @cyberfighter make sure u have the correct version of bam
01:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we'll get to that once it errors ^^
01:20 < bridge> <Ewan> which errors
01:20 < bridge> <Ewan> he said it errors already
01:20 < bridge> <louis> lol i remember minetee
01:20 < bridge> <cyberfighter> uh how tf do you check versions on linux lol
01:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> send the errors
01:20 < bridge> <cyberfighter> ok
01:22 < bridge> <cyberfighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1185376413461774496/message.txt?ex=658f62d0&is=657cedd0&hm=848831a31f2dafedf942213bfa2bb987bf65b29f437e33c98d87dd0d6a062736&
01:23 < bridge> <cyberfighter> i only saw videos of it
01:23 < bridge> <Ewan> apt install libsdl2-dev
01:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> might be libsdl1.2-dev
01:23 < bridge> <Ewan> i missed a lot what mod are you trying to compile
01:23 < bridge> <Ewan> you'll run into this a lot if you haven't installed the deps
01:23 < bridge> <Ewan> i'd start with ddnet deps to be save
01:23 < bridge> <Ewan> safe
01:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it's okay to install it one by one
01:23 < bridge> <Ewan> yea but it'll take a long time lol
01:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> instlaling ddnet dependencies is going to install a lot of shit we don't need
01:24 < bridge> <Ewan> perhaps
01:24 < bridge> <Ewan> what is he trying to compile
01:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> since ddnet depends on a lot of libraries nowadays, unlike teeworlds 0.6
01:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> some teeworlds 0.6 mod
01:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> minetee
01:24 < bridge> <Ewan> link
01:24 < bridge> <Ewan> oh
01:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> .
01:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i was gonna just see what packages the CI installed but it's down :feelsbadman:
01:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> didn't have CI back then IIRC
01:26 < bridge> <Ewan> well there's a broken CircleCI lnk in the readme
01:26 < bridge> <Ewan> link
01:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
01:27 < bridge> <cyberfighter> i think i already have libsdl1.2
01:27 < bridge> <Ewan> 2015 sounds like it's well within sdl2 territory
01:28 < bridge> <Ewan> unless the mod author was rly so lazy
01:28 < bridge> <Ewan> dunno
01:28 < bridge> <Ewan> so you have to compile a custom client alongside the server?
01:28 < bridge> <cyberfighter> yeah it needs custom client and server
01:28 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
01:29 < bridge> <cyberfighter> doesnt work, no idea if im doing something wrong lol
01:30 < bridge> <Ewan> same issue after installing pkg?
01:34 < bridge> <Ewan> this looks dramatically broken actually
01:34 < bridge> <Ewan> looks like somehow it's been configured to compile for windows
01:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> delete `other/freetype/include`
01:40 < bridge> <cyberfighter> ok theres less errors now
01:41 < bridge> <cyberfighter> uh maybe lmao
01:42 < bridge> <cyberfighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1185381356662960228/message.txt?ex=658f676a&is=657cf26a&hm=1c35b4df87fe6122898de9434bcba2cd89ee9ce83cbdec603d3b4dc34bdcfb98&
01:42 < bridge> <cyberfighter> oh wait
01:42 < bridge> <cyberfighter> nvm
01:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try `bam server`
01:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> actually ^^
01:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
01:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you want the client, too
01:43 < bridge> <cyberfighter> i dont think you can play without the client on it
01:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ye
01:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sorry, will go to sleep for now
01:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess i'll take over
01:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd suggest you try to compile it on your machine, too
01:54 < bridge> <Ewan> time for an actually appropriate use of WSL 😃
01:55 < bridge> <cyberfighter> yea im probably gonna sleep soonish too
01:55 < bridge> <Ewan> well i am here in the meantime
01:55 < bridge> <Ewan> installing pkgs rn
01:55 < bridge> <cyberfighter> ok i can wait
02:01 < bridge> <Ewan> `cd MineTee`
02:01 < bridge> <Ewan> `git clean -xdf`
02:01 < bridge> <Ewan> `sudo apt install libsdl1.2-dev libfreetype-dev python-is-python3`
02:01 < bridge> <Ewan> `bam`
02:01 < bridge> <Ewan> binaries should be `tw_minetee_d` (client) and `tw_minetee_srv_d` (server)
02:02 < bridge> <Ewan> ya heard ?
02:03 < bridge> <Ewan> this was the same error cuz bam needs a clean build environment to adapt to pkg changes
02:04 < bridge> <Ewan> looks like it probes for the pkg one time & once the logic has been generated and the include paths have been setr and whatnot, it doesn't re-check unless the info is absent
02:04 < bridge> <Ewan> looks like it probes for the pkg one time & once the logic has been generated and the include paths have been set and whatnot (or in this case not set), it doesn't re-check unless the info is absent
02:04 < bridge> <cyberfighter> wut
02:04 < bridge> <Ewan> follow instructions
02:04 < bridge> <cyberfighter> the second line does nothing
02:05 < bridge> <Ewan> it is just making sure that the build is not going to be influenced by your previous attempts
02:06 < bridge> <Ewan> it's ok if it does nothing
02:06 < bridge> <Ewan> as long as it does not error
02:06 < bridge> <cyberfighter> it says fatal
02:06 < bridge> <Ewan> what does it say
02:06 < bridge> <cyberfighter> not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
02:06 < bridge> <Ewan> what is output of `pwd`
02:06 < bridge> <Ewan> oh you're in .git
02:06 < bridge> <Ewan> why
02:06 < bridge> <Ewan> `cd ..`
02:07 < bridge> <cyberfighter> huh
02:07 < bridge> <Ewan> did you do `cd ..`
02:07 < bridge> <cyberfighter> yeah
02:07 < bridge> <Ewan> now what does `pwd` say
02:07 < bridge> <Ewan> MineTee at the very end right
02:07 < bridge> <cyberfighter> no its uhhh..
02:07 < bridge> <cyberfighter> desktop..
02:08 < bridge> <Ewan> where did you clone minetee
02:08 < bridge> <cyberfighter> i put it on my desktop
02:08 < bridge> <Ewan> you're `~/Desktop` right
02:08 < bridge> <cyberfighter> yeah
02:08 < bridge> <Ewan> or `/home/whomever/Desktop`
02:08 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
02:08 < bridge> <Ewan> ok do `cd MineTee`
02:08 < bridge> <Ewan> no more
02:08 < bridge> <Ewan> no tab completion this time pls
02:08 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds like last time u accidentally did MineTee/.git or smth
02:09 < bridge> <cyberfighter> ok
02:09 < bridge> <Ewan> pwd?
02:10 < bridge> <cyberfighter> /Desktop/MineTee
02:10 < bridge> <Ewan> excellent. do these cmds starting at line 2
02:11 < bridge> <cyberfighter> failed
02:12 < bridge> <cyberfighter> the git clean still had a fatal error btw
02:12 < bridge> <Ewan> what is it
02:13 < bridge> <cyberfighter> same thing 
02:13 < bridge> <cyberfighter> fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
02:14 < bridge> <Ewan> did you download the zip
02:14 < bridge> <Ewan> instead of cloning
02:14 < bridge> <cyberfighter> uh i dont think i did
02:14 < bridge> <Ewan> where did you get it
02:14 < bridge> <Ewan> /how
02:15 < bridge> <cyberfighter> wait no i did
02:15 < bridge> <cyberfighter> sry i forgot
02:15 < bridge> <Ewan> then it's not gonna have the repo info

03:09 < bridge> <Ewan> gn
10:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
10:37 < bridge> <teero777> eyo would a pr for modifying maps live be accepted? Or is there something that hinders that?
10:38 < bridge> <teero777> like minetee
10:38 < bridge> <teero777> eyo would a pr for modifying maps live be accepted or is there something that hinders it?
10:46 < bridge> <robyt3> It's wouldn't be compatible with old clients, so you either need backwards compatibility, or add the feature without using it and wait until most players updated to a version that have the feature
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> its update day
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1185519298215682058/image.png?ex=658fe7e2&is=657d72e2&hm=575b16c013b7d7de05ba325c4034104b24427384f39d2b8dbca5e52688f4b6e9&
10:54 < bridge> <teero777> so if you have a serverside mod that uses that functionality then just kick ppl below some version?
10:55 < bridge> <teero777> just tell them to update ig
10:55 < bridge> <robyt3> That's probably what you'd have to do. Changing maps don't predict correctly for old clients
10:56 < bridge> <robyt3> If you want to implement something like this for DDNet then you should open an issue first to discuss
10:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what about pr to allow use passwords in custom browser protocol :santatrollet:
11:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @teero777: yes please add that! I need it so much!!!
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i lost my Minecraft world
11:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> f
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> copied it over to a portable drive and many of the files were comprised of null bytes
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i let it finish and even if i hadn’t write caching was off
11:21 < bridge> <Ewan> i don’t understand
11:21 < bridge> <teero777> new minetee version would be cool
11:22 < bridge> <teero777> And you could edit quads.
11:22 < bridge> <teero777> So cool animations and dynamically animated images would be a thing
11:24 < bridge> <teero777> soon in teeworlss
11:24 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1185527756822429808/RDT_20231216_1123423082047355012522408.jpg?ex=658fefc3&is=657d7ac3&hm=8ea411374dd8b18abe849477b3f455c11fc5e39bbc5c8cc15615b504b7ce87ca&
11:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Imagine mapping ddrace parts in game with others as collab and live test it. Same as you would build something with friends in Minecraft
11:24 < bridge> <teero777> soon in Teeworlds
11:24 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1185527756822429808/RDT_20231216_1123423082047355012522408.jpg?ex=658fefc3&is=657d7ac3&hm=8ea411374dd8b18abe849477b3f455c11fc5e39bbc5c8cc15615b504b7ce87ca&
11:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That’s already possible
11:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> With envelopes and sounds
11:24 < bridge> <teero777> yea live map editing is cool
11:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/video.php?t=cod_montage.mp4&u=chiller
11:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Basically full Spider-Man 4K
11:26 < bridge> <teero777> haha
11:31 < ChillerDragon> we should add RCE to clients to fix all future backwards compatibility isses
11:31 < ChillerDragon> issues*
11:34 < bridge> <teero777> xdd
11:34 < bridge> <teero777> remote executing Trojans letsgo
11:35 < bridge> <cyberfighter> would it be bad to host a minetee server (like, is it not safe)
11:35 < bridge> <teero777> Should be ok imo
11:35 < bridge> <teero777> I would play
11:35 < bridge> <cyberfighter> i actually could try hosting maybe
11:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 🤓
11:37 < bridge> <teero777> fokkonerd?
11:38 < ChillerDragon> you got a vps cyber?
11:39 < bridge> <cyberfighter> nudel's :troll:
11:40 < ChillerDragon> a
11:40 < ChillerDragon> so about safety unless the mod author added bugs or backdoors you should be good to go
11:41 < ChillerDragon> usually what could go wrong is that the author puts in malware or ransomware and btc miner and some shit into the mod and then it potentially fucks your whole vps
11:41 < ChillerDragon> or the author codes a bug and there is RCE so every player who joins the server can fuck your whole vps
11:41 < ChillerDragon> and my "usually" i mean i never saw that and i do not think it ever happend xd
11:41 < ChillerDragon> but those are the two safety risks i am aware of
11:42 < ChillerDragon> if i am not mistaken mintee was made by unsigned char* who is poggies so he probably didnt do any major fuckups i think you should be safe hehe
11:43 < ChillerDragon> also depends on who is attacking you. Im sure there is some ddnet/teeworlds CVE in the NSA secret database
11:43 < ChillerDragon> s/CVE/0d
11:48 < ChillerDragon> ok honestly idk if tardo = unsigned char*
11:48 < ChillerDragon> does any1 know?
11:53 < bridge> <cyberfighter> where do autoexecs gotta go? same folder as the server executable?
11:54 < ChillerDragon> ye
12:08 < bridge> <Ewan> he did not in fact have a vps
12:12 < ChillerDragon> when issue @teero777
12:12 < bridge> <teero777> when I'm home maybe
12:12 < bridge> <teero777> I have winter ferien soon so I'll give it a try
12:13 < ChillerDragon> ferien xd
12:13 < bridge> <teero777> I have winter ~~ferien~~ vacation soon so I'll give it a try
12:14 < bridge> <cyberfighter> WTF
12:24 < bridge> <cyberfighter> the server comes with an anticheat or smth?
12:25 < bridge> <cyberfighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1185543096839184435/screenshot_2023-12-16_12-13-39.png?ex=658ffe0c&is=657d890c&hm=329a241b1a17c7edc69937a1276c304f62f70586ce24519be9f35bb71e8c09dc&
12:25 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :banhammer:
12:25 < bridge> <cyberfighter> even though i just held the fire button
12:58 < ChillerDragon> In case anyone remembers me bitshing about boot times
12:58 < ChillerDragon> it was asan being on ._.
12:59 < ChillerDragon> so all good :)
13:01 < ChillerDragon> @cyberfighter ye the author was into antibot stuff he also has this repo https://gitlab.com/Tardo/TWAntiCheats/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads
13:01 < ChillerDragon> jopsti u here?
13:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ 
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hai
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wazzup
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd recomment to buy new pc
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for rust questions ping ryo
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i had gfx question
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i somewhat hacked it
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I did ``bool IsTileBufferingEnabled() override { return false; }``
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if i want to build minetee and update layers how do i do that and not hardcode false here xd
13:18 < bridge> <chairn> nah, i just summed last column
13:18 < ChillerDragon> seems like tilebuffering does not rerender new textures if i mess with the map data
13:18 < ChillerDragon> is there some refresh i can call?
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > i'd recomment to buy new pc
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the system isnt really build for it
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ i sold literally all my organs for this pc wtf
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u'd need to also upload 0(air) tiles
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wot
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> explaination over
13:19 < ChillerDragon> idk wat u mean
13:19 < ChillerDragon> ok thanks xd
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah hard to describe without explaining everything
13:20 < ChillerDragon> ye fair
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but if u want to dynamically remove tiles, u'd need to update them to 0
13:20 < ChillerDragon> when jopsti gfx blog
13:20 < ChillerDragon> or yt videos
13:20 < ChillerDragon> tile index 0 gets hot reloaded?
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and not like remove it out of the tiles, bcs that would affect/shift all other tiles
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tileindex 0 will simply be invisible
13:21 < ChillerDragon> even with tilebuffering on?
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> especially with it on
13:21 < ChillerDragon> xd
13:21 < ChillerDragon> ok lemme try
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for the old rendering it doesnt matter
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they are uploaded every frame
13:21 < ChillerDragon> ye
13:21 < ChillerDragon> thats why my hack worked
13:23 < ChillerDragon> wait are you telling me on your pc the client starts instantly with asan on?!
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ?
13:24 < ChillerDragon> when u turn on asan
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u dont have a reply feature
13:25 < ChillerDragon> and lauch client
13:25 < ChillerDragon> is it fast
13:25 < ChillerDragon> > u dont have a reply feature
13:25 < ChillerDragon> xd
13:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but who even said that
13:25 < ChillerDragon> you said buy new pc
13:25 < ChillerDragon> i was wondering
13:25 < ChillerDragon> if you were implying "works on my machine"
13:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's my standard answer to all problems
13:25 < ChillerDragon> yeyeikr
13:26 < ChillerDragon> still wondering
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, asan makes is slower, but let me try
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did u use debug or releasedebug
13:26 < ChillerDragon> ``CTile *pTiles = static_cast<CTile *>(m_pLayers->Map()->GetData(pTilemap->m_Data));pTiles[MapIndex].m_Index = 0`` and then in a new frame something other than 0 is still not updated with tile buffering
13:26 < ChillerDragon> or did u mean something else
13:26 < ChillerDragon> prolly debg
13:27 < ChillerDragon> ye debug
13:27 < ChillerDragon> i just need a way to unbuffer the shits
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes:
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - remove the tile > 0 check in maplayers.cpp
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - add a buffer update that uploads the new tiles somewhere in that file
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - enjoy 10k fps teemines
13:27 < ChillerDragon> xd
13:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well then why dont u simply use your hack you use
13:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it sounds good to me
13:28 < ChillerDragon> i turned off all buffering
13:28 < ChillerDragon> everywhere
13:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> > i dunno, asan makes is slower, but let me try
13:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> > did u use debug or releasedebug
13:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> answers pls
13:28 < ChillerDragon> debug
13:28 < ChillerDragon> did the msg not go thru .-
13:28 < ChillerDragon> 13:26:55 ChillerDragon | prolly debg
13:28 < ChillerDragon> 13:27:04 ChillerDragon | ye debug
13:29 < ChillerDragon> bridge momement
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it did
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i simply didnt identify it
13:29 < ChillerDragon> pog bridge working
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs u have no reply feature
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
13:29 < ChillerDragon> xd
13:29 < ChillerDragon> irc shaming is stricly forbidden in this inclusive environment
13:29 < ChillerDragon> i will file a report with heinrich the feelgood manager
13:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he wouldn't be able to tell why either, bcs no replies
13:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 🙂

13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ./DDNet quit  2,37s user 0,83s system 61% cpu 5,233 total
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2,3s but the quitting was the slowest tbf
13:31 < ChillerDragon> but did it quit instantly?
13:31 < ChillerDragon> ye
13:31 < ChillerDragon> rigged test
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ya
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fix quitting
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😭
13:32 < ChillerDragon> i got 8s
13:32 < ChillerDragon> sos
13:32 < ChillerDragon> lets trade pc
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well 5seconds total
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd also say the window does not open instanly
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i guess also around 8s
13:33 < ChillerDragon> wat did u run?
13:33 < ChillerDragon> i did ``time ./DDNet quit``
13:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> > ./DDNet quit  2,37s user 0,83s system 61% cpu 5,233 total
13:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> me too
13:33 < bridge> <teero777> yea quitting ddnet is very slow for me too
13:33 < bridge> <teero777> Sometimes like 5s
13:33 < ChillerDragon> ah
13:33 < ChillerDragon> use i got 1s
13:33 < ChillerDragon> but user is garbage
13:34 < ChillerDragon> real is onlything that matters no?
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ur pc is also much faster than me
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mine
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but me too
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the last value is what matters
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the "total"
13:34 < ChillerDragon> a
13:34 < ChillerDragon> what time are you using? xd

13:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for me

13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyway
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just type "time"

13:38 < ChillerDragon> skill issue
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but doesnt it depend only on the internet speed anyway?
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the quitting is slow bcs of the http requests
13:38 < ChillerDragon> idk what the hanging does
13:38 < ChillerDragon> also my boot might be slower cuz 4k
13:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `git reset --hard` is dangerous ^^
13:44 < ChillerDragon> and git clean isnt?
13:44 < ChillerDragon> doesnt git reset --hard also keep stuff in the ref thingy?
13:45 < ChillerDragon> whats dangerous about it heinrich?
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it bytes
13:45 < ChillerDragon> xd
13:46 < ChillerDragon> omg tilebuffering annoying af
13:46 < ChillerDragon> can we delete it? xd
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pls
13:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xddd
13:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tbf we never use quadbuffering without tile buffering
13:50 < ChillerDragon> litle trol pr
13:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but the other way around xd
13:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> good pr
13:50 < ChillerDragon> xd
13:51 < ChillerDragon> improve maploading times by 200%
13:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xdd
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the map format sucks too hard
13:52 < ChillerDragon> :c
13:52 < ChillerDragon> hater
13:52 < ChillerDragon> well idk i never worked with it
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep
13:52 < ChillerDragon> i have patiga for that
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rip
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he atleast dislikes it partially xd
13:53 < ChillerDragon> lets reinvent map format
13:53 < ChillerDragon> and break compat
13:54 < ChillerDragon> i propose zipped xml as format
13:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1988 XML strict core
13:54 < ChillerDragon> xd
13:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> xml for what?
13:54 < ChillerDragon> maps
13:54 < ChillerDragon> (i was trolin)
13:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the m in xml stands for map
13:54 < ChillerDragon> indeed
13:55 < ChillerDragon> extreme map language
13:55 < ChillerDragon> xml is such a broken acronym
13:55 < ChillerDragon> did you know it stands for eXtensible markup language
13:55 < ChillerDragon> like wot
13:55 < ChillerDragon> should be called eml
13:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think there are a couple of abbreviations where ex… is shortened to X
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> find the x in christmas
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xmas
13:56 < ChillerDragon> heinrich name another or fake news
13:57 < ChillerDragon> xd jopsti
13:57 < ChillerDragon> find the x in twitter

14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is there any english word (in dictionary) that has two x
14:01 < ChillerDragon> ah XL ok pro heinrich
14:02 < ChillerDragon> i cant think of any
14:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> xxl
14:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 😄
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's funny. chatgpt completely dies when i ask it
14:02 < ChillerDragon> omg xd
14:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> fixxations
14:02 < ChillerDragon> is xxl a word?

14:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah they are names of invented things
14:03 < ChillerDragon> thefreedictionary haulicanting more than chatgpt

14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ChXXXerDxaXXn
14:04 < ChillerDragon> yea that would be my best guess something from some speicifc domain
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so many x in ur name
14:04 < ChillerDragon> like medicine biology etc coming from xXxLatinxXx
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epic
14:05 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 any chance we can get the poggies command aliases
14:05 < ChillerDragon> they so dope
14:06 < ChillerDragon> dopest code i prd to ddnet
14:06 < ChillerDragon> after 0.7 support
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't see the benefit it brings over the complexity it introduces
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and the complexity isn't done yet, because the client commands were ignored (although that's just a couple of more lines, I guess)
14:13 < ChillerDragon> no its done
14:13 < ChillerDragon> furo solved that
14:14 < ChillerDragon> we just dont preload them on the client side
14:14 < ChillerDragon> i wrote whole bible on why thats ok
14:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wont join ur religion
14:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> as long as the feature exists, it should work correctly
14:14 < ChillerDragon> it works correctly
14:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> introducing subtle data inconsistencies is bad
14:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the preloaded list of client commands is wrong
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> as long as there is a preloadedd list of chat commands
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it must be correct
14:15 < ChillerDragon> its not wrong
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> having an incorrect list is worse than having no list at all
14:15 < ChillerDragon> its impcomplete
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
14:15 < ChillerDragon> missing duplicated commands
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> correct
14:15 < ChillerDragon> that usually autocomplete the same as their alias
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so the list is not synchronized between client and server
14:15 < ChillerDragon> and on new ddnet servers you wont notice it
14:15 < ChillerDragon> because there its synced instantly
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm not a fan of subtle data inconsistencies
14:16 < ChillerDragon> we can just drop the list if connecting to new servers
14:16 < ChillerDragon> if that makes you feel better
14:16 < ChillerDragon> seems reasonable anyways
14:16 < ChillerDragon> because it doesnt add dupes
14:16 < ChillerDragon> and then has outdated helptexts
14:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > if that makes you feel better
14:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, it does not
14:17 < ChillerDragon> why not
14:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because there's currently a list of chat commands in the client that's incorrect (missing aliases)
14:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> anyway, that was just an additional minor point
14:18 < ChillerDragon> aa i think you didnt get me
14:18 < ChillerDragon> we can remove the list
14:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > I don't see the benefit it brings over the complexity it introduces
14:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
14:18 < ChillerDragon> as in not load it 
14:18 < ChillerDragon> on new servers
14:19 < ChillerDragon> which also helps with getting the newest params and helptexts
14:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> well, the list is incorrect for old servers as well
14:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the aliases already existed there
14:19 < ChillerDragon> on old servers the alias will also stay missing yes
14:19 < ChillerDragon> adding aliases i also do not like the complexity it introduces
14:20 < ChillerDragon> client side
14:20 < ChillerDragon> or i mean there is a non complex way
14:20 < ChillerDragon> but i do not like that it has no helptext and params anymore
14:20 < ChillerDragon> eventho they are unused
14:20 < bridge> <gerdoe> this coversation somehow forced my mind to pop out idea of caching rcon commands for specific ip
14:20 < ChillerDragon> ?xd
14:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> since it currently works fine, introducing caching sounds like complexity for no benefit
14:21 < bridge> <gerdoe> xd try to use nobys server
14:21 < ChillerDragon> having to edit 2 files vs 3 when adding chat commands would be amazing imo
14:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> make rcon commands downloadable as xml
14:22 < ChillerDragon> xd
14:22 < bridge> <gerdoe> xd
14:22 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 the current duplicated code makes it easiy to accidentally cause data inconsistencies :c
14:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, that's a bit bad. hasn't happened so far though AFAICT
14:23 < ChillerDragon> also dont know any case
14:23 < ChillerDragon> having antoher 10 lines of RegisterAlias seems like a totally fine complexity to solve that
14:24 < ChillerDragon> also having commands autocomplete that do not exist seems also like data inconsitency
14:24 < ChillerDragon> or a wrong list
14:25 < ChillerDragon> maybe the ddracechat.h include should be removed at all times 
14:25 < ChillerDragon> to ensure correctness
14:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dragon: make chat commands like in minecraft
14:25 < ChillerDragon> all ddnet servers are up to date anyways
14:25 < ChillerDragon> what do they do in minecraft?
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they fancy af
14:26 < ChillerDragon> you mean like in 0.7?
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no better
14:26 < ChillerDragon> wot better than 0.7
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> impressive right?
14:26 < ChillerDragon> last time i played minecraft they were plaintext like ddnet
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf
14:26 < ChillerDragon> but sure we can fancy them up at some point
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how old r u
14:26 < ChillerDragon> old af
14:27 < ChillerDragon> i play minecraft since like 2009
14:28 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i am serious now that i think about it removing the client side list is the cleanest and most correct way to go with
14:29 < ChillerDragon> im also fine with waiting a bit to give servers time to update but lets be honest who even is there
14:29 < ChillerDragon> who is even running ddnet servers?
14:29 < ChillerDragon> ddrock, kog uhm who else?
14:29 < ChillerDragon> maybe onbgy
14:29 < ChillerDragon> but autocompleting /rankteam is probably already bugged there
14:30 < bridge> <teero777> Chiller what are you arguing about?
14:30 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7657
14:31 < ChillerDragon> i am propsing to remove the autocompletion list shipped by the client
14:31 < ChillerDragon> for less complex aliases
14:31 < ChillerDragon> and more correct autocompletion
14:31 < ChillerDragon> its weird that the client autocompletes a bunch of ddnet commands and not the actual commands available on the server
14:32 < ChillerDragon> we should go full Sv_CommandInfo msg only and no hardcodet lists the client brings https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7649
14:33 < bridge> <teero777> Why not just a list of aliases at the end of the CHAT_COMMAND macro?
14:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1185575445626900520/image.png?ex=65901c2d&is=657da72d&hm=a2710f54e52c23a2336e85e51a46fd46e29d61b95ff5c71d259e4904eb4dcf75&
14:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cloud is hard
14:34 < ChillerDragon> @teero777 can macros even do vargs? also not sure how that would be less complex
14:34 < bridge> <teero777> Just {"teamrank", "tr", "some other"}
14:34 < bridge> <teero777> Just {"teamrank", "tr", "someother"}
14:35 < bridge> <robyt3> Why do aliases separately? I'd do this if possible:
14:35 < bridge> <robyt3> ```cpp
14:35 < bridge> <robyt3> CHAT_COMMAND({"w", "whisper"}, "s[player name] r[message]", CFGFLAG_CHAT | CFGFLAG_SERVER | CFGFLAG_NONTEEHISTORIC, ConWhisper, this, "Whisper something to someone (private message)")
14:35 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
14:35 < ChillerDragon> { wtf xd
14:35 < bridge> <teero777> that's what I'm sayin xd
14:35 < ChillerDragon> Sure works for me
14:35 < ChillerDragon> not sure if heinrich likes it
14:35 < ChillerDragon> and not sure if my macro skills are good enough
14:36 < ChillerDragon> but seems possible
14:36 < bridge> <teero777> XD
14:36 < ChillerDragon> robsti but if there is no alias it will be still {"w"} instead of just "w" ? .-.
14:36 < bridge> <teero777> problem?
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> Aliases can be a seperate argument if you want
14:37 < bridge> <robyt3> A small price to pay
14:37 < ChillerDragon> makes everything more bloated 
14:37 < ChillerDragon> yea i guess its okay
14:37 < bridge> <cyberfighter> bloat? didnt you make ddnet++?
14:37 < ChillerDragon> if heinrich likes it i will give it another go
14:37 < ChillerDragon> yea but ddnet++ is all about bloat
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> so "whisper", {"w", "whspr"}
14:38 < ChillerDragon> no without first part
14:38 < ChillerDragon> like rosbit sent it
14:38 < bridge> <teero777> You said U don't like it
14:38 < ChillerDragon> i would prefer not to have { added to every line
14:38 < ChillerDragon> but its okay i guess
14:38 < bridge> <teero777> Then hack the compiler xd
14:39 < ChillerDragon> just use rust for chat commands
14:39 < ChillerDragon> i was told rust macros op
14:42 < bridge> <gerdoe> good one cyber
14:44 < bridge> <gerdoe> xdddd
14:44 < bridge> <gerdoe> :f3:
14:56 < bridge> <cyberfighter> @_voxeldoesart https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/930544521719210097/1185581208873222204/2023-12-16_14-55-39.mp4
14:56 < bridge> <cyberfighter> WTF this mod has half blocks
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is that the minetee mod chiller talked about?
14:58 < bridge> <cyberfighter> yes
14:58 < ChillerDragon> yes
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why is suddenly everyone interested in it xD
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what did i miss
14:58 < ChillerDragon> i was always interested in live mapupdates
14:59 < ChillerDragon> and cyber posting it here made me wanna try it again
14:59 < ChillerDragon> and thats already all who are interested
14:59 < ChillerDragon> oh wait no teero also liked it
14:59 < ChillerDragon> still waiting for him to open the issue on ddnet
14:59 < ChillerDragon> since i got ratelimited for opening too many trol issues on ddnet
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> understandable move by github
15:00 < ChillerDragon> xd
15:02 < ChillerDragon> jopsti wat are then chances that if i implement refreshbuffers it will be bug free and gaming fps?
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, if u motivated enough it should be _quite_ easy
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean all u need to do is remove the tileindex > 0 check & understand how to create an offset in the buffer from x, y tile coordinates
15:05 < ChillerDragon> yea i did something else xd
15:06 < ChillerDragon> HOLY SHOIT
15:06 < ChillerDragon> IT WORKS
15:06 < ChillerDragon> no segfault
15:06 < ChillerDragon> no fps drop
15:06 < ChillerDragon> first try
15:06 < ChillerDragon> wtf
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no update
15:06 < ChillerDragon> it updated
15:06 < ChillerDragon> i swear
15:06 < ChillerDragon> DUDE
15:06 < ChillerDragon> im a developer

15:09 < ChillerDragon> jopsti if you have any gfx questions im here for you
15:10 < bridge> <cyberfighter> oh yes
15:10 < bridge> <cyberfighter> remake minetee now
15:10 < bridge> <cyberfighter> xd
15:10 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i dont hear no mechanical blue switches - so that's a lie
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i've many questions
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: i have the feeling u had tilebuffering off
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> troll
15:11 < ChillerDragon> i swear
15:11 < ChillerDragon> i used lambdas
15:11 < ChillerDragon> to tilebuffer
15:11 < ChillerDragon> the frames
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did u reupload the whole map?
15:11 < ChillerDragon> ye
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lel
15:11 < ChillerDragon> webscale
15:11 < ChillerDragon> i basically called onmapload() xd
15:11 < ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxD
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
15:12 < ChillerDragon> it works tho -.-
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean... that's ONE solution
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for smaller maps it should be ok
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
15:12 < ChillerDragon> hammer spam digging a hole into Back In Time 3 might cause suddle fps drops

15:13 < bridge> <cyberfighter> lmao rip server
15:13 < ChillerDragon> yea i should probably go for your approach 
15:13 < ChillerDragon> xd
15:14 < ChillerDragon> cyber
15:14 < bridge> <cyberfighter> ?
15:14 < ChillerDragon> nice clip
15:14 < bridge> <cyberfighter> the oldest anarchy server in teeworlds
15:14 < ChillerDragon> lmao
15:17 < ChillerDragon> i love how the protocol_ex_msgs.h example is minetee
15:18 < ChillerDragon> 7 yrs ago heinrich was already in mintee hype
15:18 < bridge> <cyberfighter> tbh amazing mod but needs polish
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> who coded all this?
15:19 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> it needs official ddnet support 😜
15:19 < bridge> <cyberfighter> unsigned char
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> looks like a lot of work
15:20 < ChillerDragon> this dude insane
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> except u showed all stuff that is possible xdd
15:20 < ChillerDragon> he also built live mapper on tablet
15:20 < ChillerDragon> one of the most inspriing yt videos 
15:20 < ChillerDragon> of all time
15:20 < ChillerDragon> and also he coded own gta from scratch
15:20 < ChillerDragon> dude is a genius
15:20 < ChillerDragon> and he still plays
15:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> send
15:21 < ChillerDragon> also he made h-client which is basically ddnet client but already done 10 yrs ago
15:21 < ChillerDragon> im not sure i can find it
15:21 < ChillerDragon> thats also what gives it the magic touch
15:21 < ChillerDragon> i think he made his yt private
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dragon send time ./DDNet quit

15:24 < ChillerDragon> rust
15:24 < ChillerDragon> woah you already have console commands?
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i just wrote them, just for you xDDD
15:25 < ChillerDragon> xxxD
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> good motivator a.k.a. chiller

15:25 < ChillerDragon> u too
15:25 < ChillerDragon> u send me on many good sidequests
15:25 < bridge> <cyberfighter> imagine if the ground tiles automapped themselves when u rboke them
15:25 < bridge> <cyberfighter> so they dont look weird
15:25 < bridge> <cyberfighter> xd
15:25 < ChillerDragon> dune did something like that
15:25 < ChillerDragon> automapper for gametiles
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> omg hook for holding minecraft animals is cool accidentially fit
15:39 < ChillerDragon> its basically terraria
15:39 < ChillerDragon> i never played that game

15:47 < bridge> <bencie.> thats so cool lol
15:47 < ChillerDragon> u livin uder da rock
15:47 < ChillerDragon> ninslash nodes and mintee are basically the most famouse tw mods that break protocol
15:48 < bridge> <cyberfighter> i cant find crafting recipes for weapons, only blocks
15:55 < bridge> <misteringanamorte> HEY BRO!!!
15:55 < bridge> <misteringanamorte> HOW TO USE BOTS IN DDNET++
15:56 < ChillerDragon> xd
15:56 < ChillerDragon> sounds so sus
15:56 < ChillerDragon> i am sure he is referring to legit server side bots
15:56 < ChillerDragon> @misteringanamorte what do you mean by "use"
15:56 < ChillerDragon> you want to spawn one as admin or code your own?
15:57 < ChillerDragon> use the chat command ``/dummy 1`` to spawn one dummy
15:57 < ChillerDragon> then the rcon command ``dummymode vi`` to set its mode
15:58 < ChillerDragon> so ``dummymode 1 mode`` to set clientid 1 to that mode
15:58 < ChillerDragon> the modes are all hardcodet for maps so not sure what exactly you need
15:59 < ChillerDragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/video.php?t=minetee_farmin_dirt.mp4&u=chiller
15:59 < ChillerDragon> i totally didnt have to use rcon to move into the wall because collsion is not updating
15:59 < ChillerDragon> this is legit fully featured minetee coded by chiller before breakfast
16:00 < ChillerDragon> also jopsti checkout not a single fps dropped with my performant gfx refreshes
16:04 < ChillerDragon> holy shit minetee is fun
16:05 < ChillerDragon> its so fuckin satisfying
16:05 < bridge> <cyberfighter> ur playing minetee?
16:05 < bridge> <cyberfighter> nvm
16:05 < bridge> <cyberfighter> lol
16:05 < ChillerDragon> i play my version xd
16:05 < ChillerDragon> but hammering away blocks is just epic
16:08 < bridge> <misteringanamorte> THANKS BRO

16:10 < bridge> <cyberfighter> can you just get banned already
16:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/videos/users/chiller/minetee_airhook.mp4
16:11 < ChillerDragon> bugfree
16:12 < bridge> <cyberfighter> ye that hook bug is in minetee too
16:12 < bridge> <cyberfighter> probably fix it :troll:
16:12 < ChillerDragon> nono it good feature xd
16:21 < bridge> <learath2> I think you can accept either one string or multiple aliases. I can imagine what it should look like
16:21 < ChillerDragon> @teero777 mf since u didnt do it i created the issue
16:22 < ChillerDragon> @learath2 you mean its technically possible to omit the { ?
16:28 < bridge> <learath2> It should be possible to accomodate both a brace and a single
16:29 < ChillerDragon> ok c pro
16:29 < ChillerDragon> good to know
16:29 < ChillerDragon> then we do not need any alias hacks for the client i will give it a try after heinrich said he is ok with it
16:36 < bridge> <learath2> But it'll probably involve templatemagic. I wonder if you can convince hein
16:40 < ChillerDragon> i used all my heinrich coins on 0.7 pr he wont accept any other shits from me anymore :c
16:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> btw, are you interested in this PR even if the followup PR would be rejected, ChillerDragon?
16:45 < ChillerDragon> yea i still think aliases are a nice to have
16:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> kk
16:45 < ChillerDragon> and i can then do the followup only in my forks because i also would like that 
16:46 < ChillerDragon> i will also if motivated follow up for rcon aliases
16:52 < bridge> <teero777> I'll be home in 4 hours. haha you can't wait
16:52 < ChillerDragon> no
16:52 < ChillerDragon> i cant x
16:52 < ChillerDragon> d
16:52 < bridge> <teero777> 😂
16:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you take over this PR?
16:57 < bridge> <teero777> I will be dead soon
16:57 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1185611676221980692/Screenshot_20231216-1656472.png?ex=65903deb&is=657dc8eb&hm=e5da73d9a26387164c3e30b3d1234196c639df11a1d3f2b818c9c9f09178b89b&
16:58 < ChillerDragon> f teero
16:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> rare moment of terminal images being useful xd https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1702742326.png
17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 in #7555
17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can you very seriously not imagine why more ticks is better in a competitive scenario?
17:12 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7555
17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean isn't it obvious af? XD
17:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I mean I gave an example
17:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and wondered whether you meant that
17:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and I guess that's what you mean, given your response
17:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah ok
17:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/francoismichel/ssh3 @heinrich5991
17:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> ssh3 over quic
17:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i am never sure if you arguing from a ddrace stand point
17:16 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> for a timing sensitive gamemode like ddrace, the idea to change tickrate seems horrible, i can already imagine the mod and admin pings in #bugs and #questions ;_;
17:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it wasn't proposed to change it in ddnet
17:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ~~for a timing sensitive gamemode like ddrace, the idea to change tickrate seems horrible, i can already imagine the mod and admin pings in #bugs and #questions ;_;~~ imagine reading the actual pr ,_,
17:18 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ~~for a timing sensitive gamemode like ddrace, the idea to change tickrate seems horrible, i can already imagine the mod and admin pings in #bugs and #questions~~ imagine reading the actual pr ,_,
17:44 < bridge> <learath2> Should I? I thought chiller wanted to try
17:45 < ChillerDragon> i think he means i try and you feedback me and merge
17:46 < ChillerDragon> so your part is already done lerato
17:47 < ChillerDragon> you gave me a +1 on the comment so i know it will be merged 100% and i give it a go when i find time
17:47 < ChillerDragon> :p
17:47 < bridge> <learath2> Protip: `std::initializer_list` something overload something something
17:47 < ChillerDragon> ok thanks pro
17:48 < ChillerDragon> i can see heinrich loving that complexity already
17:49 < bridge> <learath2> But no templatemagic. He might accept an overload
17:49 < ChillerDragon> well you are in charge now 
17:50 < bridge> <learath2> Tru, am boss. Make it good
17:50 < ChillerDragon> ok boss
17:52 < ChillerDragon> @ryozuki oidc over ssh built in o.O
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> oidc?
17:52 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/francoismichel/ssh3/tree/022474eab45545b165e203d79c2a5de913233ad4#openid-connect-authentication-still-experimental
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah ye
17:53 < ChillerDragon> also having url path instead of just random port seems like a nice security win
17:53 < ChillerDragon> cool stuff
17:53 < ChillerDragon> hope it succeeds and actually gets battle tested enough so one can use it inprod
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is "normal" ssh also over http?
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no ok, but what exactly is the motivation to use http3?
18:07 < ChillerDragon> its fast and battle tested i guess
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean what is better about it than just quic
18:07 < ChillerDragon> a
18:08 < ChillerDragon> idk quic
18:08 < ChillerDragon> but maybe because http features
18:08 < ChillerDragon> such as paths and oauth
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean maybe it's cool dunno, but defs sounds like a huge feature increase over what we have now xD
18:09 < ChillerDragon> and thats bad cuz bloat?
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mhh no i guess not, hard to say
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe it just "feels" wrong to me
18:10 < ChillerDragon> it surely feels wrong to depend on go for ssh
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> http doesn't seem like the right protocol xd
18:10 < ChillerDragon> xd
18:10 < ChillerDragon> http everywhere
18:11 < ChillerDragon> http will replace operating systems
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean http is stateless
18:11 < ChillerDragon> web is the future
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is ssh stateless? xd
18:11 < ChillerDragon> uhm
18:11 < ChillerDragon> cookies
18:11 < ChillerDragon> xd
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean they will know better than me xD
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe they keep the http connection alive the whole time
18:12 < ChillerDragon> i guess so
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so they basically destroy the idea of http
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
18:12 < ChillerDragon> i assume its similar to video streaming
18:12 < ChillerDragon> or maybe only http during connection handshake
18:13 < ChillerDragon> this makes me wanna build a ssh server into ddnet
18:13 < ChillerDragon> so you can ssh into a server and have a rcon shell
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "SSH3 uses QUIC+TLS1.3 for secure channel establishment and the HTTP Authorization mechanisms for user authentication. Among others"
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe they also just click baited me
18:14 < ChillerDragon> a
18:14 < ChillerDragon> econ too insecure
18:14 < ChillerDragon> fifo not webscale enough
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when ssh instead of rcon
18:14 < ChillerDragon> ye!
18:15 < ChillerDragon> local console becomes bash
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epic
18:15 < ChillerDragon> and remote console becomes ssh in local console
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sudo shutdown
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bam
18:15 < ChillerDragon> xd
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no need to close client anymore
18:15 < ChillerDragon> you can then edit the client code with vim
18:16 < ChillerDragon> and do ``exec``
18:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hot reload inside client
18:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
18:16 < ChillerDragon> epic
18:16 < ChillerDragon> ``kick $(status | grep Someone | cut -d'"' -f4)``
18:17 < ChillerDragon> imagine not moderating like this
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
18:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> neither is a security win
18:19 < ChillerDragon> obscurity win then
18:19 < ChillerDragon> also i disagree
18:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ssh is already secured by private key
18:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> unless you do password auth, which you shouldn't
18:20 < ChillerDragon> they can get leaked
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller when custom url parser for ddnet
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon://<ip>
18:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you do password auth, this is simply a longer password
18:20 < ChillerDragon> there is jopsti
18:20 < ChillerDragon> it avoids bruteforce
18:20 < ChillerDragon> key or not
18:20 < ChillerDragon> its not nice to be bruteforced
18:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> key cannot be bruteforced
18:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it discourages people from trying?
18:21 < ChillerDragon> i prefer to have my logs not spammed by skids
18:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's maybe a log problem, but not a security one
18:21 < ChillerDragon> and see if one actually tries to target me
18:21 < ChillerDragon> i prefer my address not being leaked over having a unbreakable door
18:21 < ChillerDragon> dont you?
18:21 < ChillerDragon> makes me feel more secure
18:22 < ChillerDragon> even if i do not have to leave the house
18:22 < ChillerDragon> like living in a self sustained village 
18:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I prefer having a key over doing some weird shenanigans to open my door
18:22 < ChillerDragon> i am not pro password here
18:22 < ChillerDragon> i do not use passwords
18:22 < ChillerDragon> but i still think its nice to not have the ssh address known
18:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> was supposed to be my version of your analogy
18:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> add wireguard then
18:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's an actual security boundary
18:23 < ChillerDragon> ah right you are annoyed by the custom path or port when entering the server?
18:25 < ChillerDragon> maybe security is the wrong wording
18:26 < ChillerDragon> but something security adjacent then :D
18:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> obfuscation
18:26 < ChillerDragon> yea 
18:27 < ChillerDragon> imagine there is some ssh 0d but you need to know the port
18:27 < ChillerDragon> all 22 folks might be insta pwnd
18:27 < ChillerDragon> yes the 0d is the vulnerability
18:27 < ChillerDragon> but the obfuscation helps to make it less likely to be exploitable
18:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> but bots try
18:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can have both
18:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> key and obfuscation
18:28 < ChillerDragon> yea
18:28 < ChillerDragon> also think that key and obfuscation is better than just key
18:30 < ChillerDragon> @ryozuki i think heinrich means let the bots try they can not crack a key
18:30 < ChillerDragon> so having them try or not is no change in security
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> and if they cant knock u save resources
18:31 < ChillerDragon> well they still knock 22 i guess
18:31 < ChillerDragon> but its probably less resources yea
18:33 < ChillerDragon> but still resources are not a security vulnerability id say
18:34 < ChillerDragon> i mean more the case where someone might get in even if you use a key
18:41 < ChillerDragon> https://ddnet.org/server/
18:42 < ChillerDragon> the most complete list off all features ddnet has over teeworlds
18:42 < ChillerDragon> xd
18:43 < bridge> <furo321> Don't forget this big list as well!, <https://ddnet.org/client/>!
18:43 < ChillerDragon> xd
18:43 < ChillerDragon> completest
18:44 < ChillerDragon> but its nice with images cant complain just thought its funny
18:48 < ChillerDragon> could be maybe some "good first contributor" issue on ddnet-web
18:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> go chiller
18:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur new
18:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> :trollet:
18:48 < ChillerDragon> maybe someone is motivated to add more screenshots of ddnet client and server highlights
18:48 < ChillerDragon> i am newish on ddnet-web indeed but i got too many todos already xd
18:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xddd
18:51 < ChillerDragon> ddnet-weeb
18:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thanks for convincing the 0.7 playerbase chiller
18:51 < ChillerDragon> wot
18:51 < ChillerDragon> todo wat
18:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with the new awesome highlighting of ddnet feature
18:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> s
18:52 < ChillerDragon> ddnet is 0.7 client
18:52 < ChillerDragon> soon(tm)
18:53 < ChillerDragon> could maybe also be added to the pr checklist
18:53 < ChillerDragon> - [ ] Added to ddnet-web if cool feature
18:53 < ChillerDragon> xd
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller
18:54 < ChillerDragon> jsopti
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u like 0.7 skins.. understandable.. the idea generally is cool
18:54 < ChillerDragon> i dont like 0.7 skins
18:54 < ChillerDragon> xd
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but do you not think it also makes using skins quite a bit more complicated?
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and it will allow ugly skins
18:54 < ChillerDragon> yes
18:54 < ChillerDragon> its the worst
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we have a skin database so we dont get ugly skins xD
18:55 < ChillerDragon> i have dl skins off
18:55 < ChillerDragon> because database is too ugly for me already
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i have to honestly say i am extremely divided
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on one hand i can understand that bit of customization without drawing new skins is cool
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on the other hand, bloat
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
18:55 < ChillerDragon> agree
18:56 < ChillerDragon> ok holy shit its 7
18:56 < ChillerDragon> i really need to do some breakfast xd
18:56 < ChillerDragon> i lost control over my life
18:57 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> lol
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> WTF
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why is it soo late :lol:
18:58 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> go snooze
19:16 < bridge> <pluskz> No 0.7 skins? :(
19:23 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> 0.7 skins are jank anyways
19:27 < ChillerDragon> @pluskz it currently looks like they will be added as far as i understood it
21:25 < bridge> <teero777> chiller I'm homr
21:25 < bridge> <teero777> Did you do smth already
21:26 < bridge> <cyberfighter> hi homer
21:27 < bridge> <stnwtr> Just started an update using `yay -Syyu` and my pc almost froze completely ... updated only 1 package, ddnet.
21:27 < bridge> <stnwtr> that never happened to me on any ddnet update, huch - is that normal?
21:27 < bridge> <stnwtr> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1185679633753067530/image.png?ex=65907d35&is=657e0835&hm=825190ff13a884d45c04e16b7159352d076a9efe45921cd428e60dd894f40e27&
21:28 < bridge> <teero777> ddnet isn't written in rust so compilation shouldn't be that computationally expensive XD
21:29 < bridge> <teero777> also I would not recommend using yay when not necessary
21:29 < bridge> <stnwtr> my system is kinda "messed up" anyways (for years ... no time for cleanup ...) - but thanks :)
21:30 < bridge> <stnwtr> also .. its ... am afraid to say it ... manjaro
21:31 < bridge> <teero777> Manjaro gud. it's base is better ;)
21:31 < bridge> <gerdoe> im still struggling with installing nvidia drivers on fedora
21:31 < bridge> <gerdoe> its so cursed
21:31 < bridge> <teero777> reinstall is always good 👍
21:31 < bridge> <gerdoe> on arch i had completely messed system but it worked at least lmfao
21:32 < bridge> <stnwtr> wanted to switch to arch for so long ... and trying out different DEs / WMs but time .. time no time
21:33 < bridge> <teero777> recommended are x11 and a tiling wm of your choice
21:33 < bridge> <gerdoe> i3 goes brr
21:33 < bridge> <teero777> wayland kinda buhhy
21:33 < bridge> <teero777> wayland kinda buggy still
21:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i3 :gigachad:
21:34 < bridge> <stnwtr> soemone told me sway+wayland is nice
21:34 < bridge> <gerdoe> on newer systems only
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> kde
21:34 < bridge> <teero777> I tried Hyprland but it was kind of bloaty and I had some bugs with Wayland
21:34 < bridge> <teero777> U nob
21:34 < bridge> <gerdoe> why are you not kupstar then :troll:
21:34 < bridge> <teero777> u nob
21:34 < bridge> <stnwtr> i like kde, too - its so simple and familiar coming from windows
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> kde is at least not a buggy hell like the others
21:34 < bridge> <gerdoe> stop editing messages like that xd
21:34 < bridge> <gerdoe> too bloat
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's true 😬
21:35 < bridge> <teero777> KDE is almost windows
21:36 < bridge> <stnwtr> I like Windows
21:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you meant: windows is almost KDE
21:36 < bridge> <stnwtr> Dont ban me please
21:37 < bridge> <teero777> you won't be banned. we in the #developer  channel only judge on skin colour.
21:37 < bridge> <teero777> you won't be banned. we in the #developer  channel only judge by skin colour.
21:37 < bridge> <AssassinTee> @jupeyy_keks answered on the ticket/issue and added the map 🙂
21:37 < bridge> <teero777> Of your tee ofc
21:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what if its default :justatest:
21:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> gentoo, i3wm, X
21:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> the way to go
21:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> emerge ddnet adding the guru repo
21:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> on gentoo
21:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i maintain it
21:38 < bridge> <teero777> +
21:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can't reproduce it
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah u meant that it is white?
21:39 < bridge> <teero777> jupsti is default
21:39 < bridge> <stnwtr> Reminds me of you, Ryozuki
21:39 < bridge> <stnwtr> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1185682637088628777/650px-GURU.png?ex=65908001&is=657e0b01&hm=4c3d54c32c94d8186f93c776b30479281625021ebba58ea5d1ff7612b4961285&
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like the background of the tiles?
21:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> good logo
21:39 < bridge> <stnwtr> +1
21:39 < bridge> <stnwtr> simple still beautiful
21:40 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I mean the existence of the vertical white line which flicks in and out of existence
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh i dont have it.
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what's your GPU + driver version?
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also what renderer are you using?=
21:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> client -> settings -> graphics
21:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> client -> settings -> graphics -> renderer
21:42 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Vulkan 1.1
21:42 < bridge> <AssassinTee> latest nvidia

21:43 < bridge> <AssassinTee> 2K Montior @165 Hz Windows 10
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i also have 2k monitor
21:43 < bridge> <stnwtr> no no like rust?
21:43 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I can still reproduce it and clip it if you want
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can you zoom in like this:
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1185683557478318161/image.png?ex=659080dd&is=657e0bdd&hm=63017b7ceb7e2794c1a21c3351b85a92b6e39b5fd2ac49ffbf9e88b175babeb8&
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i want to see how similar it looks
21:43 < bridge> <AssassinTee> how do you zoom in like that?
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> zoom+ ? xdd
21:44 < bridge> <teero777> I want Dev role now too xdd

21:45 < bridge> <AssassinTee> left with, right without bug
21:45 < bridge> <stnwtr> Can I have dev role contributing a comment of my name? hehe
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> who is on windows & has nvidia
21:45 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Nvidia 546.29
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which gpu is it btw
21:46 < bridge> <AssassinTee> RTX 4070
21:46 < bridge> <teero777> Does the line get thicker if you zoom?
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 u on windows right? and i think u had nvidia?
21:46 < bridge> <stnwtr> Ok sorry disturbing your conversation but your name says "Assa" in the screenshot. "/\ssa"? "FlyAC"?
21:46 < bridge> <robyt3> yes
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @essigautomat what is the layer name of the white background?
21:47 < bridge> <AssassinTee> you mean the cement layer of the black bricks?
21:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> CGrey found it
21:48 < bridge> <teero777> is the map somewhere uploaded?
21:48 < bridge> <AssassinTee> @teero777 not yet, i am still working on it
21:48 < bridge> <teero777> ok
21:48 < bridge> <AssassinTee> but found a bug while mapping
21:49 < bridge> <AssassinTee> @jupeyy_keks also from the cement the right pixel row seems to be missing, even on the screenshot
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well a "bug"
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
21:50 < bridge> <AssassinTee> so inside the wall a vertical dark line is seen between the bricks
21:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
21:51 < bridge> <AssassinTee> at least we have persons finding stuff like this 🙈 even one quad missing of thousands
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well it should not look different between my GPU and yours
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so one of us has a driver bug
21:52 < bridge> <AssassinTee> are you at the latest driver?
21:52 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I recently updated
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'm on linux & have AMD
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1185686098245070858/image.png?ex=6590833a&is=657e0e3a&hm=1a1e1bed5fefc5f6b7cffc2be70a3c77def59e50f5d3856cd5484785f7bb0fcf&
21:53 < bridge> <AssassinTee> how do you enable gfx debug information?
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when u start the client it shows it in F1
21:54 < bridge> <AssassinTee> nevermind
21:54 < bridge> <AssassinTee> ```
21:54 < bridge> <AssassinTee> 023-12-16 21:54:16 I gfx: GPU vendor: NVIDIA
21:54 < bridge> <AssassinTee> 2023-12-16 21:54:16 I gfx: GPU renderer: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070
21:54 < bridge> <AssassinTee> 2023-12-16 21:54:16 I gfx: GPU version: Vulkan 1.3.260 (driver: 546.29.0.0)
21:54 < bridge> <AssassinTee> ```
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 546.33  WHQL is the latest btw
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe worth a try
21:55 < bridge> <furo321> The bug seems to only happen if you have FSAA samples on.
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah that's interesting
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thanks
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah now i can reproduce it
21:57 < bridge> <AssassinTee> most prominent with fsaa 2, i have it on 4
21:58 < bridge> <AssassinTee> thanks furo
22:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mhh this gonna be a problem with older opengl versions 😄
22:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in vulkan ez fix tho xd
22:17 < bridge> <cyberfighter> hi
22:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hai
22:18 < bridge> <AssassinTee> so bug confirmed! 🐛
22:19 < bridge> <cyberfighter> unrelated but my renderer just says amd unknown
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> FBI
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what did u do to manage that to happen 😭
22:19 < bridge> <AssassinTee> when your gpu was used before to mine bitcoins .. xD
22:22 < bridge> <cyberfighter> idk lol
22:22 < bridge> <cyberfighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1185693335361429674/image.png?ex=659089f8&is=657e14f8&hm=9720eb07e10dfc39ae10ea6dab2ee9d13e746bace25a51051202e02451b684e1&
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what is your GPU?
22:22 < bridge> <cyberfighter> rx 6700
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's really weird
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but also your driver is at least not the newest
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> are you on windows?
22:23 < bridge> <AssassinTee> RX 6700 = AMD Navi 22
22:23 < bridge> <cyberfighter> no im on linux
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which?
22:23 < bridge> <AssassinTee> it says Unkown (Radv navi22)
22:23 < bridge> <cyberfighter> mint
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i have rx 6900 xt
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so same gen
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess with the next mint release it will be fixed then
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it was probably at the time where the GPUs were still new
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or smth like that xd
23:36 < bridge> <gerdoe> is this bad to bring std::vector in CComand?
23:46 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
23:49 < bridge> <gerdoe> wanna to make this alias thing real
23:49 < bridge> <gerdoe> wanna make*
