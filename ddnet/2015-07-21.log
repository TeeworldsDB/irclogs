18:54 < BeaR_> deen: got some requests from an old racer: he would like the see the actual server time on top and bigger current time with miliseconds :d
18:54 < BeaR_> like on the normal race mod
18:55 < BeaR_> (will probably stress the network)
19:06 <@deen> BeaR_: as a broadcast? not going to happen
19:06 <@deen> i prefer it as it is
19:07 < BeaR_> I guess a client-side solution might work as well
19:07 < BeaR_> also dislike using broadcast
19:08 <@deen> well, I
19:08 <@deen> 'm also not going to do a client-side solution
19:08 < BeaR_> ok ^^
19:08 <@deen> why does he need to see the server time? how does it matter?
