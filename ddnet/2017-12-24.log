07:34 <+Learath2> imgur is also blocked in turkey
09:36 <+ddnet-discord> <DEXi> It's blocked in Iran too but I can see the preview
09:37 <+Learath2> yay for fascism
09:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> aaaaaaaaaaand ovh is having problems again
09:59 <+Learath2> Ryozuki what kind?
10:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> you understand french? the shitty ceo of ovh is french and prefers to post in french instead of english
10:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> "Network:: rbx2-10a-n6: Plusieurs ports sont passÃ©s en &quot;faulty&quot; sur cette Ã©quipement. Aucun impacte constatÃ©, le traffic s'Ã©coule actuellement via rbx2-10b-n6. Nous investiguons."
10:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> which barely translates to "Network :: rbx2-10a-n6: Several ports are passed in & quot; faulty & quot; on this equipment. No impact noted, the traffic flows currently via rbx2-10b-n6. We investigate."
10:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i can't ssh into my server but their website works perfectly
10:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i think its some ip problem
10:04 <+eeeee> isnt ovh like the cheapest hoster? what did you expect
10:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> uh
10:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> they are a big company
10:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> you know why its cheap? because they have lots of clients
10:05 <+eeeee> yeah but also cutting costs on everything
10:05 <+Learath2> ryozuki, several ports deemed faulty
10:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> also its only this last 2 months there has been this problems
10:05 <+Learath2> no impact, the traffic is actuall routed thru somewhere else
10:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> 1 year and a half with them, and no errors
10:06 <+Learath2> we are investigating
10:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> any of you know any cheap hoster? xD
10:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> tho ovh has anti ddos
10:08 <+Learath2> hetzner was quite a pleasing experience
10:09 <+Learath2> especially now that they dont boot you for ddos
10:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> is there a bandwidth quote?
10:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> quota*
10:14 <+Learath2> yes
10:15 <+Learath2> are you not going to thank me for my translation services? :P
10:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> oh thank you :P
10:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and the hoster u send seems interesting
10:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> it's really hard to waste 5TB of bandwitdth in 1 month right?
10:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and it has ddos protection
10:16 <+Learath2> well i never got close to finishing up the bandwidth
10:17 <+eeeee> a few years ago ovh's ddos protection was nullrouting you for day or so
10:17 <+eeeee> is it any different now?
10:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> mm idk, i think i never got ddosed
10:17 <+Learath2> eeeee: they nullrouted you until you sent a fax
10:17 <+eeeee> seems legit
10:18 <+Learath2> signed letter saying it won't happen again plx unblock plx
10:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> any other hoster i should be aware of?
10:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> since its end of month
10:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> its the perfect time for change
10:18 <+Learath2> used online.net aswell
10:18 <+Learath2> highish setup cost, but good deal
10:18 <+Learath2> hetzner uses desktop hardware
10:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> what means that
10:19 <+eeeee> what do you need a server for anyway?
10:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i have some webpages
10:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and i host a ts3 server
10:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and idk i like to play with it
10:19 <+Learath2> also check out hetzner serverbidding
10:19 <+eeeee> webpages would be prolly better off in a cloud
10:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> oh also i host some unique clan tw servers
10:19 <+Learath2> you can get a great server for around 30e
10:20 <+Learath2> eeeee: where would you host websites btw?
10:20 <+eeeee> on aws
10:20 <+Learath2> currently working on a bigish project that wil need hosting soon
10:20 <+eeeee> like upload to s3, create cloudfront and forget about it
10:20 <+Learath2> isn't aws ridiculously expensive?
10:20 <+eeeee> if you're doing terabytes of webpages then yea
10:21 <+Learath2> are you not charged on traffic?
10:21 <+Learath2> or cpu cycles?
10:22 <+eeeee> requests and traffic and small stuff like that
10:23 <+eeeee> it's still pennies for small websites
10:26 <+eeeee> well if your webpage is not static then you'd still have to run it somewhere, and aws is not that great at that
10:27 <+eeeee> gets expensive and annoying. also not good if you're expecting non-trivial amount of outgoing traffic (e.g. hosting all ddnet maps)
10:28 <+eeeee> in that case i'd get a vps like from vultr.com
10:29 <+eeeee> they have lots of locations, their vps win benchmarks and their website is not in fuken french - what's not to like about that
11:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> my website is not static
11:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> my websites are not static
12:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> tbh, im with ovh for last 4 years, and got a lot ddoses
12:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> on my ts3 server
12:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and I never had problems with OVH company. They filtered it out and mailed me what's going on, then it back to normal after few minutse
12:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and, they improved DDoS protection, if i can trust their newsletter
12:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> this month
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and they have polish localization (what's good for me )
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> with good anti-ddos protection, I think best in Poland actually
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> in that price
13:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> aparently it as a big big ddos
13:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> what happened to ovh
13:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> it is fixed already
13:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> it was*
13:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> Is there actually any hosting service with a compareable pricing and service?
13:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> Is there actually any hosting service with compareable pricing and service?
13:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> don't know any tbh
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <n000b> @heinrich5991  don't want to give you more work but this came by in general: 
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <n000b> 
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <n000b> feature of showing ghost / outline-tee in place someone's in spec?
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <n000b> 
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <n000b> What do you think?
16:14 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I don't like /spec
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> why do we have it?
16:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> remove it
16:47 <+ddnet-discord> <n000b> ah okay yeah or remove it.
16:54 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> i like /spec because its 1 less character u hve to type than /pause
16:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> bind key say /pause
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> ya
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> its easier to bind
17:15 <+jetmir> noby !
17:17 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> lol wut
17:17 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> how did u get into the ddnet dev channel
17:18 <+jetmir> ?
17:18 <+jetmir> QuakeNet
17:18 <+jetmir> it's a network just like wetfish
17:20 < nobody1> jetmir: no u
17:20 <+jetmir> ohai!
17:20 <+jetmir> you're here
17:20 <+nobody1> i just wanted to see if i could find it 
17:26 <+jetmir> lol
18:09 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: we have it so you can has strong/weak
21:45 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: 1) that's just abusing the coincidence that pause spawns you in the order needed for weak/strong
21:45 <@heinrich5991> 2) pause was definitely not introduced for that
21:45 <@heinrich5991> 3) and I even consider that a bit bad. why do you get to do anything that's not on the map?
21:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> another suggestion: make the client remember what entities opacity player wants. There are some players who always play with entities instead of mapres, including me lately, and even when I added `cl_overlay_entities 100` line in the settings file, it worked only until 2nd launch...
21:59 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> put it into `autoexec.cfg`
22:01 <+Learath2> merry christmas lads
22:02 <@heinrich5991> merry christmas :)
22:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> did, worked only for first launch
22:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> oh, wait
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> still doesn't work
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> nvm, that worked on 2nd launch
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> weird
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> thanks
22:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> merry christmas ! :0
