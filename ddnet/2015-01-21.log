01:44 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went down!
01:45 < eeeee> oh noes
01:46 <@deen> and down goes GER2
01:47 <@deen> just when i wanted to play a round
01:47 < eeeee> well it's back if you still want to
01:47 <@deen> yeah, have to fix some problems first^^
01:48 < eeeee> i guess micro instance just doesn't have enough cpu to handle the shitstorm
01:48 <@deen> yes, but neither does a dedicated system with 4 cores
01:49 < eeeee> really?
01:49 <@deen> yes, really
01:49 < eeeee> maybe we could optimize sth
01:49 <@deen> oh, looks like they are starting a company around ddosing
01:49 <@deen> someone came on the server and wrote "Down by http://netbreak.ec/"
01:50 < eeeee> lol
01:50 < eeeee> wish them good luck with that
01:50 < eeeee> definitely gonna get into prison at this rate :D
01:50 <@deen> that's why i want the lizardsquad database
01:51 <@deen> if there is a correlation between their realname email addresses and ddosing ddnet in there, it's good stuff to go to the police with
01:51 < eeeee> dunno whats lizardsquad but lmk if i can help
01:52 <@deen> lizardsquad were the guys who downed PS4 and xbox networks around christmas
01:52 <@deen> and their botnet was for rent as well
01:52 <@deen> now someone hacked them and the database of all users with all attacks was taken
01:52 < eeeee> nice
01:52 <@deen> don't think it's public anywhere
01:52 <@deen> or at least i haven't found it
01:53 <@deen> but since I found their real names in many other databases, i have some hope
01:53 <@deen> of the ddosers*

04:13 <@deen> Learath2: hm, the download bar still goes too far right after fallback once
07:23 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
07:24 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
08:00 < eeeee> sv_fast_download doesnt seem to work on mac :(
08:00 < eeeee> who wrote that shit
08:17 < ochristi> eeeee: for me it did not work on random occasions
09:04 < eeeee> yeah i'm not sure why but it has no effect when connecting to localhost on mac. download is slower than from the internet.
15:24 < Nimda> DDNet South Africa went down!
15:34 < Nimda> DDNet South Africa went back online!
17:46 < nuborn> hi, does the latest ddnet compile for you?
17:52 < Learath2> deen: ill go over the download bar
17:52 < Learath2> its probably my flawed logic
17:52 < Learath2> it was late and i only cared about making it work :D
19:56 <@deen> nuborn: for me, yes. what's the problem?
20:11 < nuborn> deen: with bam release I get: other/curl/curl.lua:33: attempt to compare number with nil
20:12 < nuborn> I think I got it after the commit "Link against libcurl."
20:12 <@deen> yes, i see
20:12 <@deen> not my commit!
20:13 <@deen> what's your compiler?
20:13 <@deen> you're on windows, right?
20:13 < nuborn> no, arch linux
20:13 <@deen> what?
20:13 <@EastByte> arch linux!!! :)
20:14 <@deen> do you have curl installed?
20:14 <@deen> ah
20:14 <@deen> have you tried removing the config.lua?
20:14 < nuborn> yes :) I think so. I have: curl, python2-pycurl, lib32-curl
20:14 <@deen> remove the config.lua!
20:14 < nuborn> I can try that
20:15 <@deen> that usually fixes lua problems
20:15 <@deen> yeah
20:15 <@deen> that fixes it
20:15 <@deen> just tried on another system
20:15 <@deen> hm, how can that be automated?
20:15 < nuborn> yes, it worked! thanks :)
20:16 <@deen> would be nice to detect when a lua file changed and to rebuild config.lua then
20:17 < nuborn> maybe it should be deleted when you do "bam -c"? I thought that command would reset everything
20:17 < nuborn> or idk
20:17 <@deen> yeah, true
20:17 <@deen> at least we should do that
20:17 <@deen> if i understood bam I could even do that
20:19 <@deen> maybe you can find out how
20:20 < nuborn> I dont know bam either
20:22 < nuborn> I could look
20:23 <@deen> ok, try that
20:24 < Learath2> you need bam config
20:26 < nuborn> Learath2: it seemed like "bam release" automatically created config.lua again afterwards
21:32 < o_be_one> hi all
21:33 <@deen> hi o_be_one 
21:34 <@deen> ddos attacks on your servers as well?

22:21 < o_be_one> i was not sure
22:22 < Learath2> is this the same all the way from 0.5
22:22 < Learath2> same nico*
22:22 <@deen> don't think so
22:22 <@deen> he seems a bit young for that
22:23 <@deen> was the 0.5 NICO italian?
22:23 < Learath2> nah 
22:23 < Learath2> One question do any of the old guys still play ?
22:25 < o_be_one> i was in 0.5 ..
22:25 < o_be_one> ive played on first ddrace maps too
22:25 < o_be_one> i was hosting AiP team too 
22:25 < o_be_one> Zarnexxx & co
22:25 < Learath2> from 0.5 i just remember the enC clan members 
22:25 <@deen> Learath2: probably, you can search here (top right): http://ddnet.tw/ranks/
22:26 < Learath2> oh wow even chew still plays
22:29 < Learath2> eh basically the old enC members are all in gB
22:30 <@deen> yes, that was the intention of gB
22:30 <@deen> the really old great players
22:30 <@deen> or something like that
22:31 <@deen> they even have meetups sometimes I hear
22:31 < Learath2> enC had around 20 DDRace servers and they hated the crap out of me :D
23:06 <@deen> what did you do to them?^^
23:11 < Learath2> deen: there was one bug where you could insta vote off anyone
23:13 < Learath2> they told me to fuck off and i kicked every single enC runner in the server 
23:13 < Learath2> needless to say they were mad
23:33 < ochristi> I cringe when I see that spelling and grammar o.O
