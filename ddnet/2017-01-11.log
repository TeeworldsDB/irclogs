15:24 <@EastByte> can we do something to improve auto-complete for names containing stupid characters?
15:31 < nadsfy> if you press shift + tab the names starting with a "stupid" character get often listed first.
15:33 <@EastByte> oh, I didn't know shift+tab works on the first index, thanks
15:34 <@EastByte> helps a bit atleast
