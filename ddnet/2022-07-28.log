15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> can u bind cl_dummy_hammer on a defferent key than mouse 1 i want that the dummy do if just if i press a key like y
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> if i aktivate the bind the dummy hooks all time i fire
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> You can re-map dummy hammerfly in the control settings
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> and if i aktivate dummy_controll the dummy hammer 2 if i hammer 1 but the comand dummy_fire/dummy_hammer is set to 0
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> why does this happen
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> how to get there
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> @murpi if u are bores u can call me xd
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> @murpi if u are bored u can call me xd
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Let's talk in DM instead
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @deen so sad noby & **me** worked on it üò¶

15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> love ur blog btw, was thinking about doing one for myself
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, added you üòÑ
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ty ‚ù§Ô∏è
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> would be great
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> HTTPS-based Whitelist is this still a thing?
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> HTTPS-based Whitelist is this still a thing? (are you still using it)
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> there were too many hosters which use carrier grade nat
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so each connection can have a different ip
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ah that issue yeah
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Will still attempt to finish my solution (thanks to heinrich & Ryozuki for helping with Rust tho).
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Could work as the HTTPS-based whitelist but instead you automatically add an entry in the whitelist when a player was ingame for more than 5 minutes for example. And  only during attacks they can get whitelisted through a website or like you did with the client connecting to a server via HTTPS
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> ?

15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> (I'm attempting to build a Rest API in Rust to manage BPF Maps in XDP which contains players IPs, the whitelist)

15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Could work as the HTTPS-based whitelist but instead you automatically add an entry in the whitelist when a player was ingame for more than 5 minutes for example (this is cool as you already have the IP of people who use carrier grade nat. Only people attempting to join during attacks may have issues).

15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so many abbreviations
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> (I'm attempting to build a Rest API in Rust to manage BPF Maps which contains players IPs, the whitelist)
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sadly yes
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I will still attempt to finish my idea (thanks to heinrich & Ryozuki for helping with Rust tho).
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>

15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> where to find this
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> settings cog in esc -> Controls -> Dummy
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> i dont want to chnage thge key to stard it i was to remap the code
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> how do i change the not mouse 1 but mouse 2 when dummy cl_dummy_control is 1, the actions are
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> cl_dummy_hammer/jump/hook/... executes.
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> how do i change the not mouse 1, but mouse 2 when dummy cl_dummy_control is 1, the actions are
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> cl_dummy_hammer/jump/hook/... executes.
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `bind mouse2 say hi`
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> xd deen i know how to write binds but that code i gues
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> i need to change the key for dummy control actions
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> and i dont know how
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> use config files
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> yes i lokked at it i didnt find it
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> yes i looked at it i didnt find it
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://wiki.ddnet.org/index.php?title=Binds&oldid=1739#Improved_toggle_with_config_files
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> i mean i didnt find the line with the comand i find the setting list
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ThatFeed you can use `dump_binds <key>` to see what command is bound to `<key>`
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> the valie is not changing if i aktivate dummy_controll/hook but the action is done if i click the mouse 1 button
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> the value is not changing if i activate dummy_controll/hook but the action is done if i click the mouse 1 button
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> so it is not drect bound on mouse 1
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> but i dont know that comand initialize the dummy controll actions
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> but i dont know what comand initialize the dummy controll actions
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> the do look the code behind the dummy controll actions like dummy_hok/jump:fire
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> the do look the code behind the dummy controll actions like dummy_hok/jump/fire
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> how do look the code behind the dummy controll actions like dummy_hok/jump/fire
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> how do look the code behind the dummy controll actions like dummy_hook/jump/fire
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> ok i got it
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> the only think what is bad that if u aktivate dummy control the dummy hammer 2 if u just click t ime and u can fly very bad if that get a fix it would be very nice
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> the only think what is bad that if u aktivate dummy control the dummy hammer 2 if u just click t 1 ime and u can fly very bad with it . if that get a fix it would be very nice
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ThatFeed> how to get in **controls.cpp**
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno but when i use the steam version on linux sometimes when i tab out & in, it stutters pretty hard, i wonder if its the SDL we ship. bcs self compiled i never experienced that, but i'm updating now to be sure
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or its just steamoverlay xd, but aslong windows runs smooth
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can try disabling the steam overlay to check if that fixes it
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah it sadly happens to randomly, but could try
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my client reliably freezes for a couple of seconds after I finish a race
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not so bad because I already finished the race
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it's still a bit annoying
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that sounds like harddriver writing üòÑ
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Use io_uring
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or threads
20:31 <+ChillerDragon> Remembers me of back in the days when destin had a high chance of getting a client crash on finish :D 
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> We should make the same things as doom community did
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Run ddnet inside ddnet, mcdonalds
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> run ddnet in basically everywhere
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in factorio
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in gmod
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in the web
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> etc
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in a gpu shader
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Lmao imagine a big screen outside
23:42 <+ChillerDragon> lets start with running ddnet inside of 0.7 -.-
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ChillerDragon: agreed
