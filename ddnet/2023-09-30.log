00:40 < bridge> <patiga> that is just implemented for all types that inplement the other trait, like ryo said. its purpose is just to implement the concept of item types which expect only a single item generally (so dor example it errors if there are 2 item of the type, and it also provides a clean return value).
00:40 < bridge> <patiga> that file actually had the most refactors of them all, like 3 iirc. I hope I didn't go too abstract with it, to the point where its not comprehensible

01:02 < bridge> <Ewan> good evening
02:15 < bridge> <learath2> This is the most confusing thing I've ever seen
02:15 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1157470680611307621/screenshot_2023-09-30_02-14-32.png?ex=6518ba13&is=65176893&hm=b40eb76039ecbd2389295223c87f9d195bc2c253fdfd29c3dda2f0a42d6f6cc6&
02:15 < bridge> <learath2> The number on top of your own tee is not your client id but it's your strong weak id, it made it look like both tees had the same client id, made me go on a wild goose chase for 20 minutes
02:54 < bridge> <Ewan> damn

08:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i remember this
08:55 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> @ryozuki do u have rustup installed?
09:05 < bridge> <Ewan> OF COURSE BRO what kind of a question is that
09:05 < bridge> <Ewan> :owo:
09:06 < bridge> <Ewan> New emoji to add to ur irc client btw ChillerDragon

10:08 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I see it
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes man i told u to not use system rust and use rustup and install RA with it
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> u dont listen
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
10:56 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> The hell is RA
10:57 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> My bad :feelsbadman:
10:57 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Now time to read how to install rustup package :poggers2:
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> ra is rust analyzer
10:58 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Oh
10:58 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Oke
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> install rustup from web
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> the curl command it shows
10:59 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Did u not emerge it? 🤨
11:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I installed it from the repositories
11:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd probably also emerge it on gentoo
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2023/09/29/polonius-part-2/
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> rustup? nop
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i like my rustup from web
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> linux rust binaries are optimized with lto + bolt btw
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> its probs faster than ur local build
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> and pgo*
11:24 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Where did u get rust?
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just told u
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> rustup
11:24 < bridge> <learath2> I wouldn't emerge rustup on gentoo
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://rustup.rs/
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> this on ur local user
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a per user install
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> rustup is awesome cuz u can have lot of rust versions
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> and for other toolchains
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u havent do
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> `rustup component add rust-src`
11:25 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Btw
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe u were missing t hat for RA
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> it needs it
11:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's the point of gentoo then? 😮
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#installation
11:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> firefox is also pgo-ed
11:26 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Yesterday i spent 3 hours installing rust by emerging :)
11:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and chromium as well
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> highly customizable linux distro, kernel tuning, u can customize all packages via use flags and custom patches
11:26 < bridge> <learath2> You can teeeechnically have system rust from rustup, but there are some annoying issues with it
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> also ebuild is awesome
11:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can install rustup from emerge without also using system rust
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> more than pkg thing from arch imho
11:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i made packages on both
11:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> (from my xp maintaing ddnet)
11:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> maintaining
11:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> at least on arch
11:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> still think I'm missing something
11:28 < bridge> <learath2> Wym without also using system rust?
11:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you install rustup
11:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> on arch
11:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you still use rustup to install rustc, cargo etc.
11:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's just rustup that's installed using the package manager
11:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> not on gentoo
11:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, weird
11:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
11:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat what use flags u added to the rust pkg
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> dev-lang/rust clippy rust-analyzer rust-src rustfmt
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> ?
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw if u add system-llvm u may not need to compile 2 versions of llvm
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway make sure u added rust-src
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> RA needs it
11:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > In a generic installation of Rust (one that is not done with Gentoo's Rust package) things are usually updated and installed with dev-util/rustup.
11:29 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Thats what am gonna do
11:29 < bridge> <learath2> Since gentoo compiles everything, it needs a system rust
11:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> aah
11:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I see, that's the problem
11:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah gentoo packages that use rust use system rust
11:30 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> I just ran emerge dev-lang/rust :clueless:
11:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat do u know how to add per package use flags?
11:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's a bootstrapping problem
11:30 < bridge> <learath2> You can have rustup, it's just that ebuilds will be tested against the rust package, so you can get weird issues
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat did u ever edit portage package.use
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/package.use
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:Parts/Working/USE#Declaring_USE_flags_for_individual_packages
11:34 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> /etc/portage/package.use is a folder, not a file
11:34 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> and it has cpu-flags file :clueless:
11:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
11:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> all files inside
11:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> are like package.use
11:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can organize better then
11:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> make another file
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would call it 00-general
11:35 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> so i can name it however i want
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> or smth
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> anything
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> 00 is to change the order
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> in case u add a package  multiple times in multiple files iirc the last one is used
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> or maybe they are merged
11:36 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> soooooo, i have to delete emerged rust and install everything from web
11:36 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> ye? :owo:
11:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> no!
11:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> keep ur system rust
11:36 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :pepeW:
11:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> install rustup
11:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> system rust will be used for gentoo packages that use rust
11:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> but if u dont have any system pkgs that depend on rust well u can remove it if u want
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> (its fine to have both system rust and rustup)
11:37 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i better dont delete it coz i dont want to reinstall gentoo again
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> ?? zs
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> it wont let u delete it if other pkgs depend on it
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> simply --deselect it
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> and if nobody depends on it
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> --depclean will remove it
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can also check if something depends on it with equery
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> equery d rust
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
11:38 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> thanks god theres protection from such idiots like me :owo:
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a spare ryzen 3200g
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think it can be a good initial fit for a home server
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need a motherboard
11:39 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :tee_thinking:

11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> well
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can still --deselect it
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> portage  will keep it as long as a package  depends on it
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> u only keep packages in world file that  u use directly
11:40 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> so how do i have to install rustup? xD
11:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> go to ur non root usual user
11:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> and run that
11:41 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> oke
11:44 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :justatest:
11:44 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1157613875382980648/image.png?ex=65193f6f&is=6517edef&hm=75d44b3d108d4032d53663b06619375b1fa941eccd07b6c8bbe0767b7fcc5d10&
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> continue
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> if ur non root its fine
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> well as root would be fine too
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> rustup doesnt install rust in usr bin
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> it installs everything in `/home/user/.cargo/bin/cargo`
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> for example
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> so u add the bin dir to path in bashrc
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> and ur done
12:02 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> it works 🥹
12:02 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1157618347731591178/image.png?ex=65194399&is=6517f219&hm=6c2b97c5b38d416dc16def555bb59e4dc3277cb48269b541ff93db80635ad588&

12:02 < bridge> <ar1gin> tmux sux, use zellij
12:03 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> dont u dare to say anything bad about my boi tmux
12:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> wdym
12:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe restart ur tmux session
12:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw soon is hacktoberfest

12:20 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> when i start tmux it changes $PATH :pepeW:
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> if [ -f /etc/profile ]; then
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki>     PATH=""
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki>     source /etc/profile
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> fi
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> try adding this
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> to .bash_profile
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk about other shells i use bash
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://superuser.com/questions/544989/does-tmux-sort-the-path-variable
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well u should research this urself
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is not a rust problem
12:49 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i jsut had to put same line from .profile in .zprofile xD
12:49 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> and everything works 🥹
13:22 < bridge> <reitw> When does deen make a studio like hypixel & makes his own tw-like game
15:11 < bridge> <learath2> Have you tried fish yet? I like it better than zsh
15:11 < bridge> <learath2> Well I use bash still but if I wanted to use a more “advanced” shell fish is the one I liked more
15:57 < bridge> <solayer> @robnegh
16:37 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> I didn't :o what did u like more in fish than in zsh?
16:44 < bridge> <learath2> The syntax feels more human and the entire thing more polished
16:45 < bridge> <learath2> The completion/syntax highlighting as you type is pretty nice
16:47 < bridge> <learath2> I still use bash myself though because I didn't feel like installing any shell on all the machines I use 😄
16:50 < bridge> <Ewan> fellow fish user?
16:50 < bridge> <Ewan> oh u use bash
16:51 < bridge> <Ewan> fish not being a login shell sorta blows
17:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> ive been using gnucash and so far its nice
17:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> not like i have xp using any other
17:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wish my  bank had a export option in a format thats  not excel
17:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> imaging having standards
17:20 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> have your heard about ansible? :gigachad:
17:20 < bridge> <learath2> Sure
17:40 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i finally have right time 😎
17:41 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> ok, maybe i didnt (its 6:40pm)

18:11 < bridge> <furooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo> @robyt3 I think you might have broken something with the recent server browser changes. It seems like various server are missing on latest git master. Here's a comparison on the DDNet tab.
18:11 < bridge> <furooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1157711289372655787/image.png?ex=65199a28&is=651848a8&hm=794165b03589fabb7ffd6464cee4fade548aeb44c3788df3e407fa257b98427a&

18:13 < bridge> <robyt3> I'll take a look later, thanks
18:46 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> ok now fr fr
19:39 < bridge> <robyt3> Actually wasn't my changes that caused this. Bisect showed https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/c4d325e09baeff27ab800283dca4fe8cf6aff79a is the first bad commit. The servers which are not shown have clients which don't have the "afk" attribute, so their info is considered invalid.
19:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Would make more sense in my opinion to add backwards compatibility for missing attributes, but it looks like everything else is checked very strictly
19:47 < bridge> <furooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo> Oh, sorry. Yeah, the attribute should definitely be optional and be set to false if missing.
19:52 < bridge> <furooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo> I'll create a PR to fix it.
20:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> wdym, not a login shell? I use it as my login shell
20:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> python can read excel stuff
20:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (if you need a way to read it)
20:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> on ddnet servers it's already installed 😄 and on all my servers, too
21:03 < bridge> <learath2> `for l in (cat testmsgs); echo $l | perl -e 'my @arr = split " ", <STDIN>; foreach ( @arr ) { printf("%0.2x ", $_); }; printf("\n");'; end | sed 's/^/\\\\x/' | sed 's/ /\\\\x/g' | sed 's/\\\\x$//'` cursed teehistorian debugging tool
21:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ??!?
21:34 < bridge> <learath2> It’s my awful attempt at getting a binary message out of a teehistorian file without compiling stuff 😄
21:35 < bridge> <learath2> (abusing teehistorian_dump along the way
21:58 < bridge> <Ewan> you must be very lucky, it does a bunch of POSIX incompatible stuff like exiting on failure (which will cause a panic if it’s the first process)
22:00 < bridge> <Ewan> dunno where exactly these incompatibilities are documented but both arch and gentoo wikis mention how it’s not a POSIX compatible shell (gentoo’s the only one that says it will outright break your system if you use it as a login shell)
22:01 < bridge> <Ewan> i think it’s intentionally nonstandard so it can address flaws of normal shells. just wish they had a mode or something where it can be used as the login shell
22:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it can absolutely be used as a login shell
22:01 < bridge> <Ewan> it might even warn if it detects it’s being used as one?
22:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe not on gentoo
22:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but definitely on arch
22:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it does not (on arch)
22:01 < bridge> <Ewan> arch is where i initially discovered it couldn’t
22:02 < bridge> <Ewan> it works as the initial process?
22:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> after I enter my username and password I get to fish
22:03 < bridge> <Ewan> which init system do u use
22:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> systemd
22:03 < bridge> <Ewan> oh yeah
22:03 < bridge> <Ewan> weird
22:03 < bridge> <Ewan> how did you set it up? chsh broke iirc
22:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chsh -s /usr/bin/fish user
22:03 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
22:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also on all my servers btw
22:04 < bridge> <Ewan> u have magic fish
22:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think you have a fear of fish ^^
22:04 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe i have it setup as the login shell on my vps actually… I could be thinking of something else
22:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> arch doesn't even warn against it anymore
22:05 < bridge> <Ewan> oh yeah maybe they just fixed it
22:05 < bridge> <Ewan> did this or smth
22:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they did not
22:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it still works in a good way
22:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oh, fish is partially written in rust these days: o
22:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oh, fish is partially written in rust these days 😮
22:07 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> rust btw
22:08 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> blazingly fast
22:08 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> thread safe
22:08 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> memory efficient
22:08 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> BLAZINGLY FAST
22:08 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> and also more BLAZINGLY FAST
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> fish intro says this

22:29 < bridge> <Ewan> how is rust debugging?
23:05 < bridge> <ar1gin> you don't "debug" rust, you just compile it and it runs perfectly
23:10 < bridge> <Ewan> what
23:40 < bridge> <learath2> eeh, anything beyond C is a certain degree of annoying to debug
23:41 < bridge> <learath2> I've had the pleasure of debugging some async rust and the 76 deep backtrace was extremely annoying
23:44 < bridge> <Ewan> oh sounds great
23:45 < bridge> <Ewan> most c/cpp debugging tools are probably completely useless on it right
23:45 < bridge> <learath2> there is a gdb plugin that makes it bearable
23:46 < bridge> <Ewan> oh good
