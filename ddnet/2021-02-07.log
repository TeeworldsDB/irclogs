00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Chairn no solution to use 64bit? reinstall nvidia driver or smth
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> cant be impossible xD
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i never got it to work
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i mean it does work, but only with intel graphics
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> you cant be the only one with that problem ^^
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> when add posibility to click on links from f1 console
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> when you implement it @Kicker üòâ
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> but im not dev :(
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> i had client long time ago where it was possible
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont even know if other maintainers want this, bcs then ppl start to share spam
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> but for click on it u need to open f1 and aim on it wtf
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> u can spamm chat without it being implemented
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but nobody would copy the url from chat
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs u cannot select and copy it
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u'd need to write it from console to ur browser
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Chairn thats what i found:
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> "I have an Acer Nitro 5 laptop which has an intel CPU as well as an integrated nVidia graphics card. The 32 bit client has, and continues to, see the nVidia graphics and uses it in the game. With the 64bit client it is using the intel graphics. Does anyone know where I can change this setting so the game uses the nVidia graphics with 64bit?
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Thanks.
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok, 5 minutes later I found a solution. In UserPreferences64.ini file I changed DisplayAdapter=0 to DisplayAdapter=1. I did not have to do this for 32 bit client but it seemed to do the trick!!
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> "
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> wat? no @Jupstar ‚ú™
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> u click on it in f1
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> and it open browser for u
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> that how it worked
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean currently @Kicker
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> in client i had
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i understand
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the problem is that ppl start to share spam in the ingame chat then
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> with spam i mean spam URLs
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u know, these sites that make ur browser crash ur pc etc.
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> ye i see
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> ü•∫
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but you can craete an issue to make it optionally
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so you could enable it, if u really want
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> so need more opinions from main devs?
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> best is to create a github issue
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then ppl will respond to it, bcs they will receive an email
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or any kind of notification
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> ok thx
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> link please?
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how come opengl 3 uses so much memory?
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it buffers the whole maps vertices
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> instead of creating them per frame
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Chairn already closed that site, but it just was a single forum comment
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ddnet.tw
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ?
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> what?
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> forum comment, ddnet forum?
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> or get your browser history
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no, random in the internet, but there is the solution
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont have any browser history ^^
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> "Ok, 5 minutes later I found a solution. In UserPreferences64.ini file I changed DisplayAdapter=0 to DisplayAdapter=1. I did not have to do this for 32 bit client but it seemed to do the trick!!"
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> where is that file?
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> per folder file?
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i've never seen a file named like that, so it may be application specific
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh maybe its only working for that single thing
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thought it was some windows file xD
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh, but there still has to be a solution ^^
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Is there a way to gather STEAM_ID if you play on steam?
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> via ingame commands
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> your own steam ID?
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> for a server most likely
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Chairn before i spam you with random suggestions, have you ever tried to search the solution urself and tried many things?
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. windows seems to have a configs for each app
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5af09a37db5a6.png
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i tried everything i could find yes
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> never got it to work
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also just reinstalled the nvidia drivers?
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ye
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> uninstalled intel drivers? xD
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> windows sohuld work with microsoft basic apdapter too
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, but that defeats the purpose of the thing no?
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno, i cannot imagine there is no solution to this
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> either the nvidia or the intel driver should have some option to change priority
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> they have
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but it is ignored for the 64bit ddnet client
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> blizzard games in 64 bit do use the graphic card
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Discord also seems to trigger it at start
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but do they use opengl?
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how would i know?
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tbh i doubt alot of games use opengl on windows
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or apps
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i dunno, if you can print the currently used shared libraries, it should list opengl32.dll
04:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dr.Flappe> bind p "bind mouse1 "/+fire; +toggle cl_dummy_hammer 1 0; emote 14; toggle cl_dummy 0 1; emote 14; toggle cl_dummy 0 1/""
04:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dr.Flappe> best bind ever
04:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dr.Flappe> me and @Beni  made this sick ass command
04:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beni> ‚ô•Ô∏è
04:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> does it even work?
04:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> ye just like i though, it doesnt work
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/807911587532374046/unknown.png
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> soon ill make a django like framework in rust :lol:
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Could the shields in the top left corner also be used to show how much hook time you have left?
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is that useful at all
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think the time is already 2 short to be looking up left
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Idk just an idea. But I think it's more useful than freeze time
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @Ryozuki :wutface:
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> yo I think holic said ask here instead of the questions channel
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> my client is fucked and like buggy as hell. TLDR internet is good, ping is always fine, (40-50 stable), fps is fine (over 1k stable), etc etc
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> but my game will sometimes just occasionally just have what feels like ping spikes because my own tee and others will just jump around on the screen, and sometimes it's so bad that it's unplayable. antiping does not only NOT solve this issues, but makes things worse
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> I've even tried playing with antiping always on to solve the issue but the gameplay is smoother with it off no matter the situation
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> I'm not sure of the exact issue or what I could provide to help solve the issue but I'm tired of failing to random blips in gameplay. and at times like right now it's almost unplayable
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> I've tried to different versions of the ddnet client as well as the steam client which is what I'm using now and there's been no luck
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> So yesterday there was a skin called babyYoda, today its gone again? what the fuck
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> pls dont
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Django bad
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Sounds like a packet loss issue
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> is there a way to fix that? I'm uploading a video to showcase it that I'll send
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaLyv9bp-pM
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its still there
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> it's gotten a lot worse recently, and it's random on how bad it decides to be
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Thats definitely packet loss
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> and by recently I mean within the last few months
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> sweet to know the issue
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> how fix if possible to fix
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> it's failed me so many times
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> If you use antiping the game has to recalcuate the prediction due to the latency jump
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> I get the issue with or without antiping, antiping just makes it worse
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> You yourself can't really fix this, contact your ISP and complain about possible packet loss.
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Most of the time they wont do shit about it though :/
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> I see I see
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> big sad
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> also don't use WiFi
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> use a LAN cable instead
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> I'm not I'm on Ethernet
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ah well
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> we get like 120+ download as well
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> which is why it's annoying
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> should be fine
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> only game I really have the issue with anyway
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Get in touch with your ISP, maybe they will help you, maybe not. It's worth a shot
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ> I'll try. Appreciate the help
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not bad
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 by django i mean something on the level of ruby on rails, laravel, django, etc
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a full fledged web framework
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with the power of rust macros
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
16:21 <+ChillerDragon> i can proudly present the ugliest function i ever made :D idk why but after years of coding it just does not get cleaner what i do https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1612711213.png
16:22 <+ChillerDragon> up to 400 external program calls for a simple stdout :D
16:23 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait no actually probably not
16:23 <+ChillerDragon> see i dont even get what the code does
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> If I use auth_add, can I enable for this auth some commands?
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> or its like access admin, mod and helper
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Only admin mod helper now
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> @Learath2 nah, we don't store passwords of course, only special hashes that helps to validate. So nobody even admins can see it.
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @qshar mishighlight?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, I guess it could be a reply to what I said before about it, but by the "naive way" I was referring to cutting the password at the 10th byte
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Teeworlds code did that for a loong long time, we still do in most places
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> When did the ping slider for Anti-Ping get removed? Also how is it 'predicted'?
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Seems like I spike, TLDR I should fix it on my end, but having anti-ping always enabled makes it difficult when I spike continuously and when its off, I can feel the delay.
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> This is why you should not play on wifi.
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Reason why I asked about the ping slider for anti-ping. My understanding it would trigger past a certain point so would compensate when I spike but would disable other times.  Seems like that was removed and now its always enabled?
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yeah i think it was removed because people didnt underestand what the slider did and it was confusing
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> If the slider was removed, I assume they replaced its activation/deactivation with some math calculations.
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> If the slider was removed, I assume they replaced its activation/deactivation with some math calculations?
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ig it still can be configured in f1
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> cl_antiping_limit <ping>
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need to render a rectangle with 488k squares in it and at some scales one square can get smaller than 1px, wat do?
22:17 <+ChillerDragon> what is this for?
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 dont render it?
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki but multiple squares next to eachother define a larger area than a pixel
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon I'm looking into making something like vmmap that is cross platform
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> some fancy frontend for `/proc/self/maps` ?
23:20 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 mix the colors then
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mixed colors make no sense, most of the pages side by side will be the same color
23:28 <+ChillerDragon> add zooz or minimum screen res 
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Comrade yes but with an added more detailed map within the heap
23:29 <+ChillerDragon> why would u need that
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. to debug that 32bit allocation issue we were having
23:29 <+ChillerDragon> seems like you pick a random project just to procrastinate ur wireshark dissector we all wait for
23:30 <+ChillerDragon> every morning i wake up i check ur wireshark repo
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or if you aren't a hipster and actually care about the memory usage and fragmentation of your program
23:30 <+ChillerDragon> xd
23:30 <+ChillerDragon> better invest the time on rewriting in rust of u want to fix stuff like that
23:31 <+ChillerDragon> you can also just rewrite that part in rust
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> nearest neighbor maybe?
