01:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 slow down 😛
01:30 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Learath2 already slowed down 😛
01:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 does #953 work?
01:43 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes, tested it
01:43 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> time for bors
01:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I can't really test it at all on windows as I can't launch any of the opengl builds :/
01:44 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> gfx_opengl3 0?
01:45 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> `gfx_opengl3 0`?
01:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> nope, instant crash
01:48 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> mh
01:48 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> that's bad
01:48 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> even though you changed the config option?
01:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> yeah
01:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I'll try to compile my own see if it reproduces
01:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> if it does can get you a bt
01:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> or could fix it 😛
01:49 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> 😉
01:49 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but #953 should work™
01:49 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but if you want, there are 6 other, less risky, PRs open by me 😛
01:51 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Learath2 how do you compile on windows btw?
01:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> normally with mingw but this is a clean install, I only have VS
01:51 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> vs2017?
01:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> y
01:51 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you could try the method in my tutorial 😉
01:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> ue4 doesn't work with any other IDE or compiler
01:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 your tutorial generates 2 errors
01:53 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> tell me
01:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> http://codepad.org/4mBb4wpT
01:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> would probably have worked if I had git in my path but don't have git on this computer yet either
01:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you can install git via vs2017
01:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> and I tell the people to install it in the tutorial 😃
01:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but I'll patch out that git dependency
01:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well it did clone properly
01:56 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> did you select "Git for Windows" (or similar) in the vs installer though?
01:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> doubt it
01:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I didn't hopefully it doesn't pollute my path with it 😛
01:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> 257mb for git 😄 While the entirety of msysgit is 36mb
02:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 if git isn't found maybe skip gtest alltogether
02:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 heh the crash isn't in opengl at all but in aio_write
02:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well io_write from aio_thread but same same
02:02 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> good (?)
02:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> better then it being an arcane opengl crash
02:03 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> back to the drawing board? 😦
02:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> isn't visual studio supposed to be the fruit of millions of dollars of investment from microsoft?
02:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> the icons disappeared 😛
02:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> hmm, this debugger is harder to use then I remember
02:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you know how to check the fd associated with a (FILE *) here?
02:15 <@heinrich5991> on windows?
02:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> in VS2017 to be exact
02:15 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> no, don't
02:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> am I supposed to keep track of them by paper?
02:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> have you tried hovering a `FILE *`?
02:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it's technically not a FILE * in tw code
02:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we cast it to a `IOINTERNAL` or sth like that
02:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> is it possible that we are calling io_write before ever calling io_open? wtf
02:22 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yea... that probably tricks the debugger
02:22 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes, for `stdout`
02:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> if I put enough breakpoints it doesn't crash at all
02:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> my favourite kind of bug
02:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 it's a write to stdout that causes the crash
02:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I might get a couple wires and hook it up to my MCU to get more information about it as that's about as much as I can get from VS
02:25 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it's maybe related to https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/914
02:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we pass buffers as pointers, I don't even know what it tried to write :/
02:26 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #959:  Fail gracefully when trying to automatically download GTest  (master...pr_ddnet_cmake_fail_gracefully_gtest) https://git.io/vben4
02:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> what would be a simple `print (char *)buffer` in gdb, the best substitute is inspecting the memory address by hand as far as I can see
02:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I don't see anything off with the call tbh
02:29 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> try sth like `(char*) pArray` in the watch window apparently
02:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> MAGIC
02:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> hmm, might be printing one too many bytes
02:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> nah not that
02:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 wanna give me a hand here?
02:37 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I can try
02:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> if you have time that is
02:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> 😛
02:37 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but I tried to stare that code down already
02:37 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it won the the staring contest so far
02:38 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I might be blind to the mistake as I wrote the code ^^
02:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> feel free to debug on my computer where it consistently happens as long as you don't slow it down too much
02:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you could comment out the code in the `static void logger_file(const char *line, void *user)` function to see if you can start the client then
02:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Learath2 ^
02:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> crashes on another io_write
02:41 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> backtrace? does it contain `aio`?
02:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> oh not another io_write
02:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> its a lock_unlock in fetcher
02:42 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> with or w/o my PR?
02:42 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ^^
02:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> w/o your PR
02:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> which takes me to my next question, how do I checkout prs in vs?
02:43 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> good question, don't remember what I did last time
02:43 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> maybe just add my repository as a remote
02:43 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> and fetch the appropriate branch
02:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> sure, how? 😄
02:44 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> in the panel on the right, go to repository options or so
02:44 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you can add a remote there
02:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> do you know how to fetch?
02:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I mean hmm
02:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> oh a restart fixed it nvm
02:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 well your job overhaul fixes that bug
02:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> so the crash is only with logger_file
02:49 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yay \o/
02:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well not yay
02:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I don't have any idea where to even start looking at that thing
02:50 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> well, I find likely that it is somewhere between `aio_write` and `aio_thread`
02:51 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but since I haven't found the bug so far, maybe I'm looking at the wrong place
02:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> yet it crashes all the way in ntdll.dll
02:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> so it manages to get past every sanity check between there and our code 😛
02:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> the input is fine and the size looks to be correct btw
02:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> mh
02:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> oh wait
02:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> actually not
02:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> with 1 line break per line it's 1009 lines
02:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> with 1 line break per line it's 1009 characters
02:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> but we have \r\n in windoze
02:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> our passed size is only 906
02:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> hmm, but a lower size shouldn't be a problem
02:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> also it's normal given you are using a "circular" buffer
02:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> actually I dont ever see how you could read past in this case :/
02:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> you know what would be great? valgrind or asan 😛
02:57 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> currently trying thread sanitizer from clang
02:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> mingw doesn't provide --fsanitize=address for windows
02:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> how do people even develop anything on windows? 😛
03:01 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> the same question will be asked by people switching to windows 😃
03:01 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you probably have to forget a bit of your linux knowledge and find out how to do what you want natively 😃
03:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> you meant s/windows/linux/ in your previous statement
03:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> and switching to linux was pure bliss in that regard. I'd switch just for valgrind tbh
03:03 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I remember me switching to linux. it was definitely not a bliss for me, everything worked differently and I didn't manage to do almost anything
03:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> oh everything except development, surely was painful
03:07 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I'll go to bed soon
03:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> great, so this one will be unsolved for a decade or so
03:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> guess I'll just comment out the file_logger while building my own
03:11 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> what is this language
03:11 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @worstwish which language?
03:11 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> its def not english my friends
03:11 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> you guys are from a different planet
03:13 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I think the technical term is "technical language" 🙂
03:13 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> 👍
03:14 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> what's the special reason behind your numbers @heinrich5991
03:14 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> guess 😛
03:14 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> a girl?
03:14 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> nah
03:14 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> a boy?
03:15 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> nah
03:15 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> learath?
03:15 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> Oh, 5991 = 1995
03:15 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> 😛
03:16 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I was eleven years old, okay? ^^
03:16 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> we all were
03:16 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> how old are you? 😉
03:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I think I'm done, the only tool that looks halfway viable for windows is Dr Memory. It looks like it's from 1981, the latest update on the documentation is for VS2015 and the code slows the client down so much that it works, I also highly doubt threads were invented back when this monstrosity was written, so even if it crashed I doubt I'd get any result
03:17 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> not under 13 (def your type)
03:17 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> Kappa
03:17 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> I'm 18
03:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> mh 🙂
03:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> and where're you from? germany, as most people in here?
03:18 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> nope, Albania
03:18 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> shit country
03:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ah right, I think you told me that before
03:18 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> BUT I'm moving to germany
03:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> huh, why?
03:18 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> yes we had something special going on
03:19 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> my parents live there
03:19 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> and work
03:19 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ah
03:19 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> if you're 18, are you looking to study somewhere?
03:19 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> well
03:19 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> I still haven't finished the last grade
03:19 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> I'm studying economy rn
03:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> oh
03:20 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> class or grade idk how you say that
03:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> still in school and already studying?
03:20 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> 12th class
03:20 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> I mean
03:21 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> the thing teachers teach us in this class is mostly about economy and business administration
03:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ah
03:21 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> if you get what I mean
03:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> so you're gonna be my boss somewhen 😉
03:21 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> I don't know how to explain it properly
03:21 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> tbh
03:21 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> I don't like it lmao
03:21 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> it is too stressful
03:22 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> I want to find something that I can actually enjoy n shit
03:22 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> but nowadays that seems impossible
03:22 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> hmm
03:23 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I totally don't know you, so I can't really help here
03:23 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> its just like trying to follow the girl of your dreams but your ex drags you behind
03:23 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> from behind
03:23 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> – do you have something you really enjoy, some kind of hoby or so?
03:23 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> – do you have something you really enjoy, some kind of hobby or so?
03:23 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> I actually do
03:23 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ok, drop the "really"
03:24 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> something you enjoy should be enough ^^
03:24 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> what is it?
03:24 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> well
03:24 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> sex?
03:24 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> jk, tbh the only hobby that makes me happy
03:24 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> is the gym
03:25 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> and its not even a hobby
03:25 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> its a part of my life
03:25 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> that's definitely not my area of expertise
03:26 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I do enjoy climbing – but I'd have no idea what kind of jobs fit to your description
03:26 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> we're way too different, it won't work :c
03:26 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> climbing?
03:26 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> that seems exciting
03:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we should probably change the website with our updated compatibility
03:26 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> hi @Learath2
03:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> hi worstwish
03:26 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> I missed you
03:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Windows 32bit (mostly)\n Windows 64bit (mostly) should work fine
03:27 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ^^
03:27 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I'll try to get the fix for the issues 😦
03:27 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but now I have to sleep :/
03:27 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I'm actually still a bit ill and uni starts tomorrow again 😦
03:28 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> g'night
03:28 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> sleep well
03:28 <+ddnet-discord> <worstwish> and hope you get better buddy
03:29 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> thanks

03:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> App Verifier is quite nice and works at a decent enough speed, but the output I get from it is not much more useful then the call stack itself 😛
04:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> https://hastebin.com/axacitutag.m and these are the leaks I could find with dr memory, all also present in linux
11:53 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> after i compile the unchanged source of ddnet i get a problem ingame
11:54 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> if i run into a wall, the tee sinks like 1.0f down into the ground
11:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> that doesnt happen on the compiled exe from the website though
12:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> :feelsbadman:
14:10 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> @ZimE  Compiler, version, OS, CPU arch? Try some weird compiler flags to change float behaviour
14:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> deen:, whats going on on ger ?
14:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> With lags? DDoS? Firewall configuration?
15:55 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> Looks like DoS
15:55 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> At least I see 600 Mbit/s incoming traffic
15:56 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> probably my fault, I asked admins to disable the FW rules they had 😅
15:56 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> because I suspected them to cause lags in last days
15:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> DoS since yesterday
15:57 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> @HMH ok, reenable again I guess. Sounds like it's even worse without the protection
22:10 <+eeeee> `win 9
22:14 <@heinrich5991> `win 9.5?
22:14 <@heinrich5991> `win 95?

22:28 <+eeeee> /dos 6.22 is for foreveralone, not for workgroups
