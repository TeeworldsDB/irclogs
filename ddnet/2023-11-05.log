00:59 < bridge> <Ewan> damn now they're even impersonating fred
01:00 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> the spambots?
01:01 < bridge> <Ewan> @tsfreddie how could you promote such malware
01:01 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1170513074365665290/image.png?ex=65595040&is=6546db40&hm=acba45abd0e70abe2bb398a7da885b212a0af2feb9e8d202b770a958a6e1caa6&
01:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
01:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so did deen
01:02 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :O
01:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I'm pretty sure they just copied every name under `https://ddnet.org/staff/`
01:03 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ```2023-11-05 02:03:31 I chat: *** 'TsFreddie' has left the game (You have been banned (spambotlikedeen))```
01:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
01:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, i'm blown away while i was finding something that could work with sfx designing other than just using a standard daw. this looks pretty insane for non-tempo based effects
01:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> apparently blockhead's rendering is done with godot
01:30 < bridge> <Ewan> iirc they were doing roby before deen
01:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's probably just randomly chosen
13:36 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> ```
13:36 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> pTarget->TakeDamage((vec2(0.f, -1.0f) + Temp) * Strength, g_pData->m_Weapons.m_Hammer.m_pBase->m_Damage,
13:36 < bridge> <he11owor1d.>                 m_pPlayer->GetCID(), m_Core.m_ActiveWeapon);```
13:36 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> 
13:36 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> 
13:36 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> how to determine which direction the player pressed for this function?
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that's not how hammer works
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> hammer checks which entities are possible hittable in the dir you are looking
13:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but if u hit it, the cursor dir doesn't really matter
17:00 < bridge> <Fussel> why these spambots don't get banned by some sort of text match?
17:11 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> accounts are the only way
17:14 < bridge> <Fussel> ? my idea was: every message has to go through the server and therefore can be filtered before it is send to the other clients
17:15 < bridge> <Ewan> while i agree, nobody seems interested in having a halfway solution like this
17:16 < bridge> <Ewan> if it was proposed it probably wouldnt be merged
17:20 < bridge> <devinci24> doesn't seem like such a bad idea. a message could be identified by a number of factors like content, lenght, sender, and idk. it's not necessarily a halfway solution
17:22 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> what if there are false flags
17:22 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ddnet 1984
17:24 < bridge> <devinci24> it's not necessarily a problem. if some spam is detected it could just mute the user or just not sending that message to other players.
17:24 < bridge> <devinci24> Best case scenario there aren't any x)
17:26 < bridge> <Fussel> guys i didn't mean a full automatic solution: just adding a pattern by mod/admin on an as-needed basis
17:27 < bridge> <devinci24> well, that would be easily avoidable and probably end up as beeing useless. So I would understand it not beeing merged
17:28 < bridge> <Fussel> user bans are easily avoidable too, but it works somehow â€¦
17:29 < bridge> <devinci24> they do not work... :/
17:29 < bridge> <devinci24> The ones who really should get banned aren't
17:29 < bridge> <Fussel> ^^
17:33 < bridge> <robyt3> Not really, accounts wouldn't solve spambots for very long, the spammers could just make new accounts
17:33 < bridge> <learath2> I can merge it just so everyone sees how fast it gets bypassed and stops talking about a filter
17:34 < bridge> <Ewan> not if the accounts are tied to something like email. i feel like this has been said a billion times
17:34 < bridge> <robyt3> So they can make new emails, how does that stop anyone?
17:34 < bridge> <Ewan> emails are hard to make
17:34 < bridge> <robyt3> I have infinite emails addresses with one gmail
17:34 < bridge> <robyt3> no
17:35 < bridge> <robyt3> maybe if it was tied to a phone number
17:35 < bridge> <robyt3> but nobody wants that
17:35 < bridge> <learath2> Tied to SSN, real consequences for real dickheads
17:35 < bridge> <Fussel> that's for sure
17:35 < bridge> <Ewan> well it seems to be working for kog ðŸ˜ƒ
17:36 < bridge> <_gwendal> i think kog is tied to phone numbers ? not sure
17:36 < bridge> <devinci24> because there account system is far from beeing automated
17:36 < bridge> <devinci24> mods need to manually accept new players
17:36 < bridge> <Ewan> why would the account system need to be completely automated
17:36 < bridge> <devinci24> because their account system is far from beeing automated
17:37 < bridge> <learath2> Are you going to be the one manually accepting the accounts? That's so kind of you offering your time like that
17:39 < bridge> <devinci24> well, ddnet has a fairly big playerbase...
17:39 < bridge> <Ewan> it would not be too much for mods to handle
17:40 < bridge> <Ewan> also having a hard time keeping a serious conversation when everything you're saying is masked in sarcasm learath
17:41 < bridge> <devinci24> well, and for asian players? as far as I know we don't have that many of them...? And getting some english speakers talk with chinese ones may not be the bestest idea
17:41 < bridge> <devinci24> well, and for asian players? as far as I know we don't have that many mods for them...? And getting some english speakers talk with chinese ones may not be the bestest idea
17:42 < bridge> <devinci24> it's still a burden for mods + players
17:42 < bridge> <Ewan> idk, it seems worth it to prevent spammers and blockers and whatnot
17:42 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> vouch system?
17:42 < bridge> <learath2> What happens when someone spams 8000 account registrations?
17:42 < bridge> <Ewan> then they get denied
17:42 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Like every player can vouch for 1 or 2 players
17:43 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> and each player needs 2 vouches to be seen by the automantion or smt
17:43 < bridge> <avolicious> Also thought about such a system
17:43 < bridge> <devinci24> then just 2 randoms need to get accepted somehow and whole system is useless
17:44 < bridge> <avolicious> Add some spice to it. If a vouched player gets a punishment, the voucher gets half the punishment
17:44 < bridge> <Fussel> if that works it will kill the userbase ^^
17:45 < bridge> <learath2> What is the advantage to having the mods in the middle? There is no way they go through and deny 8000 applications. So we are assuming an automated system can catch and deny these
17:45 < bridge> <learath2> Or we get some money to hire staff
17:45 < bridge> <devinci24> yeah well. what I meant by that is, 2 guys spammers get accepted for some reason.
17:45 < bridge> <devinci24> From that point it's a matter of time before there's thousands of spammers accepted. a punishment wont do anything
17:45 < bridge> <Ewan> or they can just expire
17:45 < bridge> <Ewan> and not be explicitly allowed
17:46 < bridge> <devinci24> but Ewan, how do you know those 8k applications need to be denied
17:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I think there's merrit to that. If the vouching player gets a punishiment the player that he has vouched to should be in question
17:46 < bridge> <avolicious> Its just for the start
17:47 < bridge> <avolicious> If you want a full automated system, you need a fresh start. But using existing stats, its impossible to add on top without having some sort of manual review
17:48 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> I know where the shader code is, but where is the shader LOGIC located? I want to see if I can decrypt it and make something out of it
17:48 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
17:48 < bridge> <learath2> How will mods even use this system? A stream of applications are coming in, how will they spot the legit ones in it?
17:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i hope it'd be fairly obvious
17:49 < bridge> <robyt3> even if it's faily obvious and only takes 1 second per applications, that's a few hours to go through 8000 applications
17:49 < bridge> <robyt3> even if it's faily obvious and only takes 1 second per application, that's a few hours to go through 8000 applications
17:50 < bridge> <Ewan> it's like you don't even read
17:50 < bridge> <devinci24> I wasn't criticising it. I just think it's a big reason why you have no spammers.
17:50 < bridge> <devinci24> Does the kog community also have diehards spammers/ddosers? If so it would be interesting to see how are you doing after automation takes place
17:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Just accept the legit/known players (I am talking about the vouch system btw) and they can vouch for 1-3 friends of them that way you don't have to manually go through them (atleast not as much)
17:50 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly the only way I see something that manual working out is if we just pray to god that the spammer spamming messages wont spam account applications
17:50 < bridge> <avolicious> Accounts dont stop ddos
17:50 < bridge> <avolicious> Captchas would be a good start tho
17:50 < bridge> <devinci24> I was just wondering if you had those kinda players x). I don't play kog thatoften
17:51 < bridge> <learath2> So no new players ever again except by vouch? Good luck convincing anyone that's a good idea
17:51 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> hmm you gotta a point
17:51 < bridge> <devinci24> Ouch
17:52 < bridge> <learath2> I just wouldn't put humans in the middle of the process, that's like an extremely obvious bottleneck to overwhelm
17:52 < bridge> <learath2> Captchas, some other hard pow, it has to be automated, the more manual the process the less robust it is to any sophisticated attacker
17:53 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ig it's just gotta be as hard for the spammers to make accounts as for humans/mods to detect them
17:56 < bridge> <learath2> No harm in adding a simple spam filter and hoping the attacker is just not smart enough to bypass it is not the worst idea. If anyone wants to help that's what I would do
17:58 < bridge> <learath2> Or if you want to get more mileage out of it something like a fuzzy checksum based spam detection would last a little longer
18:05 < bridge> <learath2> Or regex filters that can be added through rcon so mods can filter it out, that'd also be not the worst idea
18:06 < bridge> <devinci24> that's actually quite smart as it should take more time for the spammer to avoid it than for the mods + the dev to make it?
18:08 < bridge> <learath2> yes, efficient use of time and mods are much smarter than whatever naive algorithm we can think of
18:40 < bridge> <patiga> not really. all my friends couldn't create accounts there. they are relatively new, but they do have a few finishes. there are too few non-account servers on kog for us to vote the easy maps that we need, so I straight up can't play kog with my friends
18:41 < bridge> <patiga> their applications were first rejected, then ignored and at one point no new applications were possible due to discord channel count limits or smth
18:43 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :feelsbadman:
18:47 < bridge> <Ewan> messed up
18:47 < bridge> <Ewan> their problem is relying on discord
18:54 < bridge> <louis> chat captcha would be good for spam
18:54 < bridge> <louis> i think some other games have it
18:54 < bridge> <louis> the new kog account system is a dumpster fire lmfao
18:56 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
18:56 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not awesome
18:56 < bridge> <Ewan> but it's working fundamentally
18:56 < bridge> <louis> bad user experience = doesn't work
20:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im not even sure which issue you try to solve with accounts?
20:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What Spam? In the Chat? That should be a non issue in the first place. Every client can mute other clients so everyone can build their own spam filter or mute players if needed.
20:23 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> would you mute deen :kek:
20:24 < bridge> <Ewan> if you let the spammers stay you are pretty much just encouraging ddnet lobbies to become malware spreading spaces
20:24 < bridge> <Ewan> the average user is not gonna think to or want to mute these ppl
20:24 < bridge> <Ewan> it's just gonna reflect negatively on ddnet
20:24 < bridge> <Ewan> wow these ppl obviously don't care about their players
20:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If i get annoyed by his messages yes
20:26 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> but it's not deen that's what I mean
20:26 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> if you mute the spambot you also mute deen
20:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Depends on how I mute
20:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I usually mute per id and only rarely the names
20:27 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> the bots reconnect every 2 or 3 minutes
20:27 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> gl keeping up
20:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I see that point. If that is so important than you can still make spamming impossible rather than optimizing the punishment for it.
20:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
20:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Punishing behavior in games seems wrong to me. Why not change the game to disallow the behavior.
20:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh i have not seen those. But then yea I would go for their names or message content depending on what is more consistent
20:41 < bridge> <Ewan> Yes the goal is to make the spamming impossible in the first place
20:43 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet client cannot mute players based on message content

21:56 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> I managed to make sound happen when you open and close the top menu!
21:56 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> If I merge this I will change the sounds, but for now I'm using Terraria's sound effects as a placeholder.

21:57 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> I managed to make sound happen when you open and close the top menu!
21:57 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> If I merge this I will change the sounds, but for now I'm using Terraria's sound effects as a placeholder.

21:58 < bridge> <Ewan> idk if im a big fan of having sounds in the ui
21:58 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe if they are off by default
21:59 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yeah. just like the fucking sit pose
21:59 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> nice try
21:59 < bridge> <Ewan> wat
21:59 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> when there was the whole sit pose arguement people wanted an option with it being off by default
21:59 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> which is like... why even bother
22:00 < bridge> <Ewan> it would be silly to deny a feature that some people obviouslyt want
22:00 < bridge> <Ewan> but if the amount of people that want it is not the majority than it can just be off by default
22:00 < bridge> <Ewan> you don't want to go against the average user's wishes
22:02 < bridge> <Ewan> also where would these sounds come from
22:03 < bridge> <Ewan> afaik all sounds in the game so far are from teeworlds
22:03 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i.. make them?
22:03 < bridge> <Ewan> how are u gonna make them match
22:03 < bridge> <furo321> Thanks, I hate it. When PR?
22:04 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> why so many questions
22:04 < bridge> <Ewan> is there a problem
22:04 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Can DDNet organize a (preferably public) blocklist? The spammers change IPs but I don't believe that they can afford enough resources to deal with global bans.
22:04 < bridge> <kaffeine0> 
22:04 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Spammer bot joins a DDNet server => the server submits the IP to the global ddnet blocklist => all other servers pull the update and also ban that IP.
22:04 < bridge> <Ewan> i would love that
22:04 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ??
22:04 < bridge> <Ewan> i had collected a few IPs in the past and asked noby if he would share his but got no response
22:04 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh well. i guess its just another thing to stack onto ddnet 2.0
22:05 < bridge> <Ewan> what is the point in not sharing the banlist anyway
22:05 < bridge> <Ewan> literally just makes the rest of the community suffer
22:05 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I also have a list but it does not really help for a fellow lonely server.
22:05 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
22:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't think it's uncool i just think it'd be the first introduction of any foreign sounds and it would be for something as minor as the menu
22:07 < bridge> <Ewan> just seems sorta weird
22:08 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> @bencie.
22:12 < bridge> <bencie.> ohh nice lol
22:13 < bridge> <bencie.> i used to have a soundpack which was mostly terraria sounds
22:14 < bridge> <bencie.> for like pistol and hammer swing etc
22:15 < bridge> <cyberFighter> good one

22:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What happend
22:29 < bridge> <Ewan> spammers joined advertising leaked nude discord servers
22:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> chillerbot-ux can :p
22:30 < bridge> <Ewan> cool?
22:30 < bridge> <Ewan> ðŸ˜ƒ
22:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How do accounts make spamming impassible?
22:30 < bridge> <Ewan> cuz spammers can't get accounts
22:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Can they then also not play?
22:31 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess you aren't familiar with the spammers we're talking about
22:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No
22:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But I assume they are owned by someone who also plays the game
22:32 < bridge> <Ewan> they're not real people. they're fake clients set up on a server somewhere that just join and spam their preprogrammed message advertising a bot client
22:32 < bridge> <Ewan> it's hard to ban them by name because they  are always changing
22:32 < bridge> <Ewan> at first they were colors
22:33 < bridge> <Ewan> now they seem to take a random pick of all admin/moderator names
22:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So you want to use accounts to make bans stronger and not make spamming impossible
22:33 < bridge> <Ewan> well these spammers could never get accounts in the first place because in theory they'd be backed by some sort of other identifier that everyone has 1 of
22:33 < bridge> <Ewan> like an email
22:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Then they use their email?
22:34 < bridge> <Ewan> the spam bots are not real people
22:34 < bridge> <devinci24> Ewan, has Robyt said before. emails aren't hard to make. Accounts by themselves wont solve anything
22:34 < bridge> <Ewan> they are hard to make
22:34 < bridge> <devinci24> Ewan, has Robyt said before, emails aren't hard to make. Accounts by themselves wont solve anything
22:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Are they created by AI?
22:35 < bridge> <Ewan> ???
22:35 < bridge> <Ewan> harder than the average spammer is willing to put effort into i'd bet
22:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I assumed the bots were operated by a human
22:35 < bridge> <Ewan> making an email required manual human intervention
22:35 < bridge> <Ewan> making an email requires manual human intervention
22:35 < bridge> <devinci24> I'd bet you differently
22:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea same manual intervention it took the spammer to download the game and code the spambots
22:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Now there is one extra step to login
22:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Which every player would have to go to. And also the spammer can do.
22:36 < bridge> <devinci24> I don't know that much about mails. But I'd trust Robyt when he said he had endless email adresses with one gmail
22:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I still do not see how you intent not giving out accounts to malicious people
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> who is rearranging channels xd
22:37 < bridge> <devinci24> This is the exact same topic we had a few hours ago
22:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I assume he meant the + feature of mail. Could be solved with one regex. But yea you can also register 100 gmails
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> given the account system is fully automated, which isn't even guaranteed, it'd go something like this
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> spammer makes a new email and joins the server to spam with their single allowed client at a time
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> account gets banned within minutes, and by extension, so does the email
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> the spammer then has to create a new email for every client they want to have join & spam
22:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not really Iâ€™m trying to understand how ewan thinks that accounts are not used for harder punishment but instead make spamming impassible
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> unless they're hosting their own mailserver, emails typically require captchas to create. and it's easy to detect burner emails anyway
22:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes you just proof my point. Spamming is still possible. Just punished harder using accounts.
22:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I suggest to not punish spammers at all but Filter the chat instead.
22:39 < bridge> <Ewan> if accounts have to be manually verified then it would be very very hard
22:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> To Spam twice
22:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But you still have to be caught once
22:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Just ban all players and i can ensure you the problem is solved
22:40 < bridge> <devinci24> and that's where Learath ideas come in. "Or regex filters that can be added through rcon so mods can filter it out, that'd also be not the worst idea"
22:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And then you life ban a player from playing the game for using the chat
22:40 < bridge> <Ewan> either by moderator, or by vouch system, or by some sort of automated system which checks how many accounts have been created by that ip + with emails on that domain + with emails whose names are gibberish + whatever
22:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes that makes way more sense than accounts
22:41 < bridge> <Ewan> there is #âœ‰-create-a-ticket in the rare event that someone has a false positive
22:41 < bridge> <Ewan> i still do not think you understand how the spambots work
22:41 < bridge> <Ewan> this is not a real person
22:41 < bridge> <Ewan> the only info we have on the person behind it is that he owns a vps at some ip lol
22:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @mpft: technically allowing spam and then punishing it is still a bad process.
22:42 < bridge> <Ewan> nobody is allowing spam
22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It purely depends on the motivation of the spammer anyway
22:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I mean technically. You can spam in the chat. If that wasnâ€™t possible due to ratelimits and filters. The problem would be solved.
22:42 < bridge> <Ewan> sure but the filters would need to adapt
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> As said depends on motivation of them
22:43 < bridge> <devinci24> Anyways. I doubt that if accounts ever become a thing it will be to stop spammers x)
22:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Itâ€™s like saying. Everyone who moves in freeze tiles gets banned. Instead of locking movement.
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It's same for accounts
22:43 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller what are u talking about
22:43 < bridge> <Ewan> this is not for ppl who message too many times
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But you both could team up and provide a solution xd
22:43 < bridge> <Ewan> this is for ppl who promote a bot client
22:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I donâ€™t like your approach
22:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Bans are bad
22:44 < bridge> <Ewan> a bot client whose virustotal scan very strongly suggests it's intentional malware
22:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just Filter bot ads
22:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> whats the tea this time
22:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> He wants to use accounts to ban people from the game
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Xd
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Rage bait
22:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean i would happily collect chinese ids just to ban them
22:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :greenthing: :greenthing: :greenthing: :greenthing: :greenthing:
22:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
22:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> especially the ppl who keep lureing ppl out and doxxing our players
22:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the leak of national database made doxxing entry barrier so low that kids are doing it for cool factors
22:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Let's just do lan events from now on
22:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh man i would love to host lan events
22:48 < bridge> <devinci24> yes!
22:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> In chiller Villa
22:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> its just not legally viable
22:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> here at least
22:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ive been wanting to do a lan fng tournament since 2014
22:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
22:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> partially bcs ppl keep calling me bot and i want to destroy them in person (back in 2014 i mean)
22:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> in jopstis big garden
22:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also my coughing came back this weekend
22:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Outdoor lan best
22:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why
22:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i tried to eat healthier yesterday and i felt asleep at noon
22:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wake up 5pm. then fell asleep at 11pm again
22:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes healthy food is the worst
22:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> illegal gathering is a criminal offense
22:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :nouis:
22:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> A lan party?
22:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> With friends?
22:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or you wanted a big event?
22:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> with enough ppl probably
22:53 < bridge> <devinci24> yeah, what's considered "illegal gathering"
22:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> like 10+
22:54 < bridge> <devinci24> I know a few guys who would have big problems :Shrugeg:
22:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I always thought Iâ€™m western brain washed. And china could be chill. But Fred you make it sound no fun.
22:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> im probably exaggerating
22:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I See
22:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> like if you eat out with a whole classroom of 45 ppl is probably fine
22:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How legal is it for you to complain about china in this discord?
22:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i dont think getting 10 ppl online to a place to play a unregistered video game is a good look
22:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i dont mind dying
22:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> mood
22:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> speaking of complaining. someone in other discord did once link our irclogs and says he found my work info and tried to threat me
22:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
22:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i dont think a google search is that threatening
22:59 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
23:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> imma get some breakfast
23:04 < bridge> <Ewan> one day fred is gonna disappear from the internet
23:04 < bridge> <Ewan> and we will know he's in prison for 200 years for unlicensed internet use
23:04 < bridge> <Ewan> among various other china crimes
23:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i could disappear rn if you want
23:04 < bridge> <Ewan> no thx
23:05 < bridge> <Ewan> WTF
23:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> can chiller see discord stickers
23:06 < bridge> <Ewan> probably not
23:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> chillerdragon
23:06 < bridge> <Ewan> his taskbar is so flashing rn
23:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ~~chillerdragondeeznuts~~
23:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> apparently they made QR codes longer
23:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> youtube recommendation is weird
23:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://www.qrcode.com/en/codes/rmqr.html
23:14 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> idk
