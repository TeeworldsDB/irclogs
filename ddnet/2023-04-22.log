09:19 < bridge> <ReD> ok I will watch the demo as well
09:20 < ChillerDragon> thanks
09:21 < bridge> <ReD> I see it, changed the ban to 3h because of the spawn blocking
09:21 < bridge> <ReD> np
09:22 < ChillerDragon> :)
11:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I did nothing today
11:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> great
11:20 < ChillerDragon> buy better timezone then my day just started :p
11:21 < ChillerDragon> any arch user can recommend some font packages? I would like to see all the unicode fancyness inlcuding chinese symbols etc without having to install 100gb of virus fonts xd
11:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wdym virus fonts
11:24 < bridge> <Learath2> I use `adobe-source-han-fonts`
11:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> source han sans and source han serif are the standard CJK fonts rn
11:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also unifont i guess
11:24 < bridge> <Learath2> `adobe-source-han-sans-fonts` actually 😛
11:25 < bridge> <Learath2> Oh and `noto-fonts-emoji` for the emoji
11:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :poggers2: I'm making my own pixelated cjk fonts
11:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for my (unexisting) next game
11:25 < bridge> <Learath2> For a game?
11:25 < bridge> <Learath2> Aha
11:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
11:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not sure if it is even possible for one person to do
11:26 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah ngl cjk is too many characters
11:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there was one guy making 12px cjk font and still haven't finished it two years later
11:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for 16px there's unifont
11:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there are no stylized cjk fonts for pixel style at all. i really want to try to make a standard 14px or 16px font and just make filters to transform them into different styles
11:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> paper's please used like 20 different fonts while the chinese and japanese translation just had the same font everywhere
11:28 < bridge> <Learath2> How many characters did you decide to do?
11:29 < bridge> <Learath2> The entire unicode cjk plane would be a little too ambitious I think 😛
11:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> at least 20000 to cover GBK probably
11:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> a font can only has 65535 glyphs, so I guess no font covers the entire unicode
11:30 < ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie by virus fonts i mean if i randomly go to the aur and install all "free font home made" packages ill get some sketchy stuff xd
11:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there are IDS database tho, so maybe some of them can be generated just by radicals
11:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there are IDS database tho, so maybe some of them can be generated just by radicals (i think)
11:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> anyway just use source han sans
11:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> everything use source han sans now
11:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> including ddnet and teeworlds :kek:
11:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> source han serif is very pleasing to look at with heavier weight
11:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> highly recommended just to use it to read
11:34 < ChillerDragon> yea emojis i already got somehow xd but thanks fredi and lerato got the fonts look gud :)
11:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> source han serif
11:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1099267255914733589/image.png
11:36 < ChillerDragon> ok nice my broken crack client handles cjk better than my vscode now xd
11:36 < bridge> <Learath2> I actually never checked how fonts handle differences between simplified c, traditional c, j and k. I think you share the codepoints but the strokes are different
11:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you just switch fonts depends on the user
11:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean you're supposed to. i know lots of game just stick to j glyphs
11:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we can read them anyway. just some stroke are different, they didn't mix simplified glyphs and traditional glyphs
11:38 < ChillerDragon> oh btw @heinrich5991 i managed to reduce the cmakelists diff by a lot using cmakes `include()` and overwriting the variables i wanted to change instead of creating git conflict surface in place
11:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> microsoft made 4 version of the same font and have different names for them depends on the glyph type
11:39 < ChillerDragon> omg i got a compile error because syntax error in a comment!?
11:39 < ChillerDragon> rust moment xd
11:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> btw traditional c has at least two types too, hong kong and taiwan glyphs are different too.
11:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> simplified only has one tho, singapore chinese and malaysia chinese just use the same one with us.
11:41 < bridge> <Learath2> Ah. Okay, so they just don't have a mechanism for this
11:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nope
11:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they just expect you to see the ones you read, handled by the operating system
11:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> taiwan :justatest:
11:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> yes it is a place
11:56 < ChillerDragon> yo @Ryozuki do u use alacritty?
11:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i did
11:56 < bridge> <Learath2> Chinese Taipei surely is a fascinating place
11:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> then windows terminal came out
11:56 < ChillerDragon> xd
11:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
11:56 < ChillerDragon> ye windows terminal is kinda cool ngl
11:57 < ChillerDragon> i like uing stuff the os ships thats also why im having a hard time dropping my gnome terminal
