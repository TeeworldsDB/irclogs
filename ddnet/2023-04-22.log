09:01 < bridge> <ReiTW> spammer
09:01 < bridge> <ReiTW> :giga_chad:
09:06 < ChillerDragon> where are the mods? ._.
09:06 < ChillerDragon> votes dont get through on multi
09:17 < ChillerDragon> @ReD are you mod?
09:17 < ChillerDragon> zillyhuhn.com/tmp/ange_sb.demo
09:17 < bridge> <ReD> yes
09:18 < bridge> <ReD> I watch angelina from anonymous if she blocks
09:18 < ChillerDragon> check the demo
09:18 < ChillerDragon> also he is famouse for sb im surprised you dont know him
09:19 < bridge> <ReD> I banned for the funvote
09:19 < bridge> <ReD> I know them
09:19 < bridge> <ReD> ok I will watch the demo as well
09:20 < ChillerDragon> thanks
09:21 < bridge> <ReD> I see it, changed the ban to 3h because of the spawn blocking
09:21 < bridge> <ReD> np
09:22 < ChillerDragon> :)
11:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I did nothing today
11:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> great
11:20 < ChillerDragon> buy better timezone then my day just started :p
11:21 < ChillerDragon> any arch user can recommend some font packages? I would like to see all the unicode fancyness inlcuding chinese symbols etc without having to install 100gb of virus fonts xd
11:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wdym virus fonts
11:24 < bridge> <Learath2> I use `adobe-source-han-fonts`
11:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> source han sans and source han serif are the standard CJK fonts rn
11:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also unifont i guess
11:24 < bridge> <Learath2> `adobe-source-han-sans-fonts` actually 😛
11:25 < bridge> <Learath2> Oh and `noto-fonts-emoji` for the emoji
11:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :poggers2: I'm making my own pixelated cjk fonts
11:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for my (unexisting) next game
11:25 < bridge> <Learath2> For a game?
11:25 < bridge> <Learath2> Aha
11:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
11:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not sure if it is even possible for one person to do
11:26 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah ngl cjk is too many characters
11:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there was one guy making 12px cjk font and still haven't finished it two years later
11:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for 16px there's unifont
11:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there are no stylized cjk fonts for pixel style at all. i really want to try to make a standard 14px or 16px font and just make filters to transform them into different styles
11:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> paper's please used like 20 different fonts while the chinese and japanese translation just had the same font everywhere
11:28 < bridge> <Learath2> How many characters did you decide to do?
11:29 < bridge> <Learath2> The entire unicode cjk plane would be a little too ambitious I think 😛
11:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> at least 20000 to cover GBK probably
11:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> a font can only has 65535 glyphs, so I guess no font covers the entire unicode
11:30 < ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie by virus fonts i mean if i randomly go to the aur and install all "free font home made" packages ill get some sketchy stuff xd
11:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there are IDS database tho, so maybe some of them can be generated just by radicals
11:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there are IDS database tho, so maybe some of them can be generated just by radicals (i think)
11:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> anyway just use source han sans
11:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> everything use source han sans now
11:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> including ddnet and teeworlds :kek:
11:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> source han serif is very pleasing to look at with heavier weight
11:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> highly recommended just to use it to read
11:34 < ChillerDragon> yea emojis i already got somehow xd but thanks fredi and lerato got the fonts look gud :)
11:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> source han serif
11:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1099267255914733589/image.png
11:36 < ChillerDragon> ok nice my broken crack client handles cjk better than my vscode now xd
11:36 < bridge> <Learath2> I actually never checked how fonts handle differences between simplified c, traditional c, j and k. I think you share the codepoints but the strokes are different
11:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you just switch fonts depends on the user
11:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean you're supposed to. i know lots of game just stick to j glyphs
11:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we can read them anyway. just some stroke are different, they didn't mix simplified glyphs and traditional glyphs
11:38 < ChillerDragon> oh btw @heinrich5991 i managed to reduce the cmakelists diff by a lot using cmakes `include()` and overwriting the variables i wanted to change instead of creating git conflict surface in place
11:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> microsoft made 4 version of the same font and have different names for them depends on the glyph type
11:39 < ChillerDragon> omg i got a compile error because syntax error in a comment!?
11:39 < ChillerDragon> rust moment xd
11:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> btw traditional c has at least two types too, hong kong and taiwan glyphs are different too.
11:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> simplified only has one tho, singapore chinese and malaysia chinese just use the same one with us.
11:41 < bridge> <Learath2> Ah. Okay, so they just don't have a mechanism for this
11:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nope
11:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they just expect you to see the ones you read, handled by the operating system
11:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> taiwan :justatest:
11:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> yes it is a place
11:56 < ChillerDragon> yo @Ryozuki do u use alacritty?
11:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i did
11:56 < bridge> <Learath2> Chinese Taipei surely is a fascinating place
11:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> then windows terminal came out
11:56 < ChillerDragon> xd
11:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
11:56 < ChillerDragon> ye windows terminal is kinda cool ngl
11:57 < ChillerDragon> i like uing stuff the os ships thats also why im having a hard time dropping my gnome terminal
12:13 < bridge> <uwu> Include guards > pragma once gang member disapproves this pr :greenthing:
12:14 < bridge> <k2d222> what is better with guards?
12:14 < ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ daily ddnet code base quiz is the string "Hallöchen" in the git history of ddnet/ddnet?
12:15 < ChillerDragon> no checking allowed! just thinking!
12:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> y
12:27 < ChillerDragon> ok jopsti missed the deadline
12:27 < ChillerDragon> and ryo won the daily ddnet code base quiz
12:28 < ChillerDragon> running `git log -S'Hallöchen'` yields some commits from german trol heinrich adding some german umlaute in a sample string in the rust docs
13:16 < bridge> <Darius - ;v> :PES_ReeePing:

16:47 < ChillerDragon> `TeeHistorian.DDNetVersion` and `TeeHistorian.Auth` started to fail with that merge?! xd
16:49 < ChillerDragon> Hm it fails on buffer error hmm maybe the new net message messed with it. But why did the pipeline not fail for ddnet? xd
17:30 < bridge> <Learath2> Better option

18:47 < bridge> <deen> thx
19:27 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> Is there code for a teeworlds client without gui that just joins a server and spectate ?
19:29 < bridge> <Avolicious> But if you have no gui, how do you wanna spectate?
19:31 < bridge> <Robyt3> If you mean without any graphics: compile the headless client.
19:31 < bridge> <Robyt3> If you mean no HUD: just disable all the HUD when starting with the config options
19:32 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> Where is the headless client ?
19:37 < bridge> <Robyt3> You need to compile ddnet yourself. Follow the instructions at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet and set HEADLESS_CLIENT=ON with cmake
19:39 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> Will it be able to connect to regular teeworlds servers as well ?
19:41 < bridge> <Robyt3> To regular 0.6 vanilla servers, yes
19:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> reddit avatar on discord
19:44 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> Not 0.7 ?
19:45 < bridge> <Robyt3> DDNet client can only connect to 0.6 servers
19:49 < bridge> <Robyt3> Vanilla client is also available in headless mode, but I don't know how well it works
19:49 < bridge> <Robyt3> So you could use vanilla client if you want to connect to 0.7 servers
19:53 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> There is mention of HEADLESS_CLIENT in cmakelist in the vanilla client but idk how to activate that
19:55 < bridge> <Robyt3> Add `-DHEADLESS_CLIENT=ON` as an argument when calling `cmake` (or set `HEADLESS_CLIENT` to `ON` in a cmake GUI if you are using one)
19:56 < bridge> <Mʎɹ シ> When support of 0.7 servers in ddnet :troll:
19:57 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> I'm over my head 
19:57 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> Maybe someone here would be interested in writing a dummy headless client that records the scoreboard of every game in a database to be displayed in a teeworlds stats website
19:57 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> I can take care of the website part
19:58 < bridge> <Mʎɹ シ> https://www.npmjs.com/package/teeworlds
19:59 < bridge> <Mʎɹ シ> This is headless teeworlds client written in JS, you can use this for collecting scoreboard
20:00 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> https://status.tw/
20:00 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Would you not be able to use this API?
20:02 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> Wow, js rewrite, impressive
20:04 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> Status.tw only crawls the masterserver, i woul get more detailed info with a headless client
20:07 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> @Swarfey would you be interested in recording the scoreboards if i take care of the website part ?
20:11 < bridge> <Avolicious> What information would you need? You can crawl the https master too
20:11 < bridge> <Avolicious> https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json
20:13 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> That info is already availâble for ddnet
20:13 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> For vanilla tw it would be interesting to record the scoreboards at the end of the game
20:14 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> That's not included in the master server crawls
20:14 < bridge> <Avolicious> Ask the server providers if they allow this
20:14 < bridge> <Avolicious> If you connect on the server with a "bot", you might get banned of their servers
20:15 < bridge> <mJ2P7Wuf> So be it, no harm in trying
20:21 < bridge> <ReiTW> # is this new or wut ? #
20:21 < bridge> <ReiTW> # is this new or wut #
20:21 < bridge> <ReiTW> ah yes
20:37 < bridge> <Robyt3> @deen Did you forget to merge #6521 or should someone else review as well?
20:37 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6521
20:39 < bridge> <Robyt3> How can we check if #4537 is resolved with latest SDL version? @Jupeyy_Keks @Learath2
20:39 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4537
20:43 < bridge> <Chairn> done
20:44 < bridge> <Chairn> weird that key_first and key_unknown are same value
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, install win11? xd
21:05 < bridge> <Robyt3> pls no
21:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> drop support for windows
21:13 < bridge> <Avolicious> Only support blackberry
21:13 < bridge> <Avolicious> Market share < 0.1
21:14 < ChillerDragon> the headless client option should work as well in vanilla as in ddnet last time i checked both were working equally functional @Robyt3
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would solve some issues
21:43 < bridge> <Ewan> hi fred @TsFreddie
