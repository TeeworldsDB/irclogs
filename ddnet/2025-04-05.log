06:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why is this not if else?
06:27 < bridge> <pioooooo> I think some mod can have both at the same time
06:28 < bridge> <pioooooo> You can see the first commit that has those
06:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> bit weird but oke
06:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> what mod? why is there no comment then?
06:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would remove it
06:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `Client-Render-SpriteScale-Anti-Static -> roby/Client-Render-SpriteScale-Anti-Static`
06:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if its possible to do before i dont want to be the one to remove the feature
06:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `Client-Render-SpriteScale-Anti-Static -> roby/Client-Render-SpriteScale-Anti-Static`
06:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i havent heard of multiple name plates
06:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oo new roby branch
06:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> spec char should only exist when char is not there
06:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
06:43 < bridge> <always> how do you add a custom sound?
06:43 < bridge> <always> i cant tell if i did it correctly or my wv is just broken because it fails to open
06:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> shame i dont think haswell vulkan drivers support fsaa

07:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @robyt3 for doing EProtocol, there is a map between each item and bool
07:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do i add a custom class to handle this (with no overhead)
07:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do i add a templated class (EnumMap) to handle enum, type maps (with no overhead)
07:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do i raw dog it (just use an array and lots of static casts)  (with no overhead)
07:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do i use a (unordered_)map to be clean (with overhead)

09:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> not the implementation but the structure
09:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if you add a new variable (with getters and setters) to the server, it would make sense to add it to client prediction
09:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that to me sounds like something that should be interfaced

10:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why on gods many colored earth?
10:33 < bridge> <robyt3> You can add yourself to the CODEOWNERS file and PR it, I suppose the file should be sorted in ascending order to clear this up immediately
10:33 < bridge> <melon> at this point just auto everything :PepeCringe:
10:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I'm not a write access and I shouldn't be
10:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> The thing I read said I had to be
10:38 < bridge> <robyt3> I see, I think GitHub generally prevents you from pinging non-repository users
10:39 < bridge> <robyt3> well, you can ping them, but you can't assign to issues or request a review unless they commented on it or are a user with write access
10:41 < bridge> <robyt3> No sure, maybe that also needs a discussion. I've used an array and casts before because it's simple and no overhead. https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/064ae962eb46cc807d0b6b40a0950e8555380c01/src/game/client/components/touch_controls.cpp#L804-L854
10:44 < bridge> <robyt3> Can you rebase the branch on current master? Auto merge doesn't work because it tries to run the old Ubuntu CI
10:45 < bridge> <pioooooo> oopsie
10:46 < bridge> <pioooooo> lemme se
10:46 < bridge> <pioooooo> see
11:05 < bridge> <learath2> This was done almost 2 decades ago, but iirc the reason was to unify lambda and function declaration syntax
11:12 < bridge> <pioooooo> This looks promising
11:12 < bridge> <pioooooo> https://github.com/Neargye/magic_enum
11:12 < bridge> <pioooooo> but idk since we're in c++
11:13 < bridge> <pioooooo> but idk since we're usin c++
11:15 < bridge> <learath2> I often forget how nasty metaprogramming looks in C++
11:48 < bridge> <remakepower> ddnet-rs had a wrong display on the low screen resolutions.
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what does that mean
11:49 < bridge> <remakepower> the health and armor bar is really big
11:50 < bridge> <remakepower> it is nearly full of 1/4 of the screen
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it depends on your DPI, you can change it with `cl.render.ingame_ui_scale ` (float)
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I remember there was a bug, dunno if you have to reset the config
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But I tested it on my phone and looked good afaik
11:51 < bridge> <remakepower> I had a screenshot of it
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You can always share it with me if you want. I can later take a look with default settings
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What resolution do you have?
11:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I have done an overcomplicated no overhead solution. I don't particularly like casting back and forth, feels like you might as well just use an enum
11:52 < bridge> <remakepower> 1366x768
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok ty
11:52 < bridge> <remakepower> Truly weird resolution
11:52 < bridge> <remakepower> Ah
11:52 < bridge> <remakepower> not 1/4
11:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I have done an overcomplicated no overhead solution. I don't particularly like casting back and forth, feels like you might as well just use an enum. Judge however you like
11:52 < bridge> <remakepower> but truly much bigger than vanilla
11:53 < bridge> <remakepower> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1358016605858300016/Image_22801310979008.png?ex=67f24f05&is=67f0fd85&hm=aae409a8035c2f35520946cd1990291683e1eefe2d3cc51125d5d44478887cfa&
11:53 < bridge> <remakepower> idk why
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah it defs doesn't fit in your case
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> How does normal vanilla look like for you?
11:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> How does patiga get pinged
11:55 < bridge> <remakepower> Let me find a screenshot...
11:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> How does patiga get pinged. I think you can get requested for review wo write
11:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Maybe the thing I read was wrong
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe you are a detective and find smth you should not know 😂
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> He probs has it private
11:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Private write access?
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean you can hide that you are a member of a organization
11:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Ah I see
11:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Why would you want to do that
11:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Badges r cool
11:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I saw that but I rolled my own solution
11:58 < bridge> <pioooooo> that's what i mean we're using c++ 😄
11:59 < bridge> <remakepower> Hm
11:59 < bridge> <remakepower> I cannot find a screenshot
11:59 < bridge> <pioooooo> always reinventing the wheels
11:59 < bridge> <remakepower> I'm going to PrintScreen.
12:01 < bridge> <remakepower> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1358018615387099176/Image_23290784930072.png?ex=67f250e4&is=67f0ff64&hm=316076678688b7a863f3535250244b7a0c655b7dd8dc77777dc15ecbb53b6ac0&
12:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oh wow so much smaller, ok
12:01 < bridge> <remakepower> So this is vanilla health bar
12:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I mean I'll do it and see if it works
12:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Best map
12:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> It's the shit
12:01 < bridge> <remakepower> I wonder why ddnet-rs causes this problem
12:02 < bridge> <remakepower> But
12:02 < bridge> <Assa> are we now in favor of always using `unsigned` or `unsigned int` ? I learned to always use `unsigned int` but I want to do this consistent with tw "corporate" guidelines
12:02 < bridge> <remakepower> I cannot realize most of Rust code
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Because it tries to do DPI related sizes.
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> On a phone it's harder to read e.g. the system time in your screenshot
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Since the screen is smaller
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But I set a minimum scale factor, and maybe that minimum is too hight
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But I set a minimum scale factor, and maybe that minimum is too high
12:03 < bridge> <remakepower> ~~use uint32_t~~
12:03 < bridge> <remakepower> :nouis:
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well that is actually the correct way to go
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> For new code use proper variable sizes
12:05 < bridge> <remakepower> When I learned int64_t for the first time, I found tw int64 is long long, but int64_t is long.
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ah yeah I remember trouble like that
12:07 < bridge> <remakepower> I felt strange, and then I found that long long equals long in the GCCx64.
12:07 < bridge> <remakepower> I meant the range.
12:09 < bridge> <remakepower> Ah
12:09 < bridge> <remakepower> So i thought that's why there are int32_t and int64_t.
12:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how do i read config variables form the antibot module?
12:19 < bridge> <Assa> the return type of `sizeof` is `unsigned int`, hm
12:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> isn't it size_t?
12:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sizeof
12:21 < bridge> <Assa> this is at least what my IDE tells me, but I feel like you are right
12:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> > The result of a sizeof expression is a constant expression of type std::size_t.
12:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do you run on 32bit? XD
12:21 < bridge> <Assa> no?
12:22 < bridge> <Assa> maybe I am compiling for it xD
12:22 < bridge> <Assa> this is from `map.h`: `    virtual int GetDataSize(int Index) const = 0;`
12:22 < bridge> <Assa> Whould be size_t
12:22 < bridge> <Assa> this is from `map.h`: `    virtual int GetDataSize(int Index) const = 0;`
12:22 < bridge> <Assa> Should be size_t
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ig, except the map format explicitly only supports u32 or similar
12:25 < bridge> <chairn> so should be unsigned int at least, int might overflow to negative values
12:28 < bridge> <Assa> what does `int * unsigned` do? is this an unsigned or an int then oO
12:28 < bridge> <Assa> should be int, feeling like it
12:33 < bridge> <Assa> there wa explicitly logic added to return 0 instead of negative numbers, because otherwise it would return error codes
12:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> gives you an int
12:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because the operator is defined on the int probably
12:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and -5 * 30 -> 150
12:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so its probably an int either way
12:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and -5 * 30 -> -150
12:39 < bridge> <learath2> I don't think we do that, so the interface might not have it
12:41 < bridge> <learath2> IDEs usually evaluate all the way to fundamental types. `size_t` is defined to be an unsigned integer type large enough by the implementation
12:42 < bridge> <Assa> This problem is solved for now, I had to just be a caucious there
12:44 < bridge> <Assa> This problem is solved for now, I had to just be caucious there
12:44 < bridge> <zhn> didn't you fix it already huh
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Hi guyz
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> How should I upload a 1.5GB file for GitHub
12:46 < bridge> <Teero> helllooo
12:46 < bridge> <zhn> hi
12:46 < bridge> <melon> hey guys
12:46 < bridge> <DDNet> Hellou :3
12:46 < bridge> <learath2> To figure this out you need to follow the integer promotion rules followed by the usual arithmetic conversions. 
12:46 < bridge> <learath2> 
12:46 < bridge> <learath2> In the case of int and unsigned, the overall result should be unsigned
12:46 < bridge> <Teero> Just commit it?
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Apparently the max size is 100MiB
12:47 < bridge> <learath2> LFS
12:47 < bridge> <Assa> does github have an upload file size limit? Maybe lookup github LFS
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or do you have other experience Teero?
12:47 < bridge> <learath2> Github givrs some free lfs storage, if not enough you can also host your own
12:47 < bridge> <learath2> Github gives some free lfs storage, if not enough you can also host your own
12:47 < bridge> <Teero> Hmmm no but 100mb sounds so low. Is it a private repo?
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok is uploading
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let's see if it works

13:31 < bridge> <DDNet> Hellou :3
13:32 < bridge> <zhn> what's /showothers sound
13:32 < bridge> <01000111g> u dont hear the others if they arent shown, are you on an old client?

17:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> impossible that discord still didnt fix this

17:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> people clicking obvious scams?
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ppl sending obvious scams
17:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i want my markdown style links ><
17:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> plz dont take them away because of bad people ruining it
17:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this one doesnt even work

17:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sneam
17:39 < bridge> <kebscs> you can literally use discord automod to block "50$ gift"
17:39 < bridge> <kebscs> or any discord bot
17:39 < bridge> <kebscs> but ddnet staff is so slow
17:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think tiny urls should be blocked and google dangerous link thing
17:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and warn on newly registered domains
17:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> makes it hard to accidently trip the filter
17:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> can be done w/ discord bot
18:09 < bridge> <learath2> The value just changes, has it ever occured to you that we have already done these things?
18:09 < bridge> <kebscs> it didnt
18:09 < bridge> <kebscs> its always 50 dollar
18:10 < bridge> <learath2> It's fine for like a month, then the next scam uses 50 euro gift, then it's 25 euro gift, then its 25 dollar gift
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 50 or 20
18:10 < bridge> <learath2> then it's free game
18:10 < bridge> <learath2> then it's free hacks
18:10 < bridge> <learath2> then it's 30 dollar gift, then it's free nudes
18:10 < bridge> <kebscs> it has to be very hard to block new gift every month
18:10 < bridge> <kebscs> feel you
18:10 < bridge> <kebscs> but ive seen only 50$
18:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki do you think this code compiles? and if it does what will it output?
18:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```rust
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> struct Foo<'a> {
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     field: &'a i32,
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> impl<'a> Foo<'a> {
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     pub fn foo(&self) -> &'a i32 {
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         self.field
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     }
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> fn main() {
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     let mut foo = Foo { field: &10 };
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     let tmp = foo.foo();
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     foo.field = &20;
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     dbg!(tmp);
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the fact that they spam the same msg in every channel is already enough
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just direct block xd
18:11 < bridge> <learath2> there is also the @heinrich5991 factor, what if someone legitimately wants to talk about a string containing "50$ gift"?
18:12 < bridge> <learath2> I'm sure he can spend 8 hours with you on how the god given right to use the string "50$ gift" is not to be breached
18:13 < bridge> <kebscs> 50$ gift
18:13 < bridge> <learath2> I spent 2 hours trying to find a regex that only catches unescaped attempts at trying to highlight everyone because he thought people should be able to talk about it
18:14 < bridge> <kebscs> 💀
18:14 < bridge> <learath2> Why would anyone need to discuss @ everyone on the ddnet discord in a meta manner, I do not know, but I still had to figure out a way
18:16 < bridge> <kebscs> just making life harder for everyone
18:16 < bridge> <kebscs> on my server i blocked "stenmcommnunnity" and 50$ gift and havent seen these spam in long time
18:17 < bridge> <learath2> I'm sure such decisions are much easier to make when there aren't ~27k members and 7 admins with very different sensibilities
18:18 < bridge> <kebscs> i dont see anyone buying 50$ gift for their grandma on ddnet server
18:18 < bridge> <kebscs> idk why would there be such discussion about this specific thing
18:18 < bridge> <learath2> and I don't see any reason anyone should need to type @ everyone
18:19 < bridge> <kebscs> @everyone
18:19 < bridge> <kebscs> i mean it doesnt work
18:19 < bridge> <kebscs> just role permission
18:19 < bridge> <learath2> but it was in every scam message for a bit, so it was a nice easy way to detect them
18:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the way a much small server is handling it is to match any previously seen scam msg
18:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because they always come in waves, the goal is to cut the wave as short as possible to prevent another wav ecoming
18:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this is why @everyoneshouldnt be matched xd
18:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also the bots never type and msg all channels at once and that is detectable, but it could be circumvented
18:31 < bridge> <learath2> I personally would match it and just handle the few cases where it is some legitimate meta-discussion by hand
18:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i guess so
18:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i would get banend if i wasnt a part of this meta discussion
18:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> rust pros and others I have a stupid question, why is it possible to call `work` function many times and mutate the struct later, shouldn't it be borrowed  immutably for `'a`? :\
18:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```rust
18:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> struct Foo<'a> {
18:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     field: &'a i32,
18:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
18:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
18:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> impl<'a> Foo<'a> {
18:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     pub fn work(&'a self) -> &'a i32 {
18:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         self.field
18:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     }
18:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
18:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     pub fn no_work(&'a mut self) -> &'a i32 {
18:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         self.field
18:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     }
18:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
18:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> self doesnt own field, cuz field is a reference
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> u could say &'a mut self doesnt matter for "field"
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> cause field is already a non mut ref
18:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> new code 
18:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```rust
18:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> impl<'a> Foo<'a> {
18:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     pub fn work(&'a self) {}
18:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     pub fn no_work(&'a mut self) {}
18:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
18:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
18:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> why isn't it possible to call `no_work` many times?
18:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz the 'a
18:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur mutably borrowing for 'a
18:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> remove it
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> on the self
19:06 < bridge> <syrinok> Can I have $50
19:07 < bridge> <syrinok> as a gift
19:10 < bridge> <syrinok> @everyone

19:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that is future work though

19:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> use feet :kek:
20:00 < bridge> <Assa> I am on my phone rn, can send foto from german Autobahn
20:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> please do, if you are not the driver
20:01 < bridge> <Assa> And can't program with phone with hands and feet
20:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> well, might need 4 phones
20:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> one for each limb :kek:
20:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I look forward to it
20:05 < bridge> <syrinok> Should just make an executive decision and stop trolling the playerbase tbh
20:07 < bridge> <learath2> What if they make the executive decision to make me a purple name because I infringed on the right to say "50$ gift"?
20:07 < bridge> <syrinok> Unlucky
20:07 < bridge> <syrinok> You got the easy way out
20:08 < bridge> <Assa> "trolling the playerbase" My friend... I don't know where to start
20:08 < bridge> <syrinok> only hein would have this absurd? opinion anyways
20:09 < bridge> <syrinok> Also hasn't hein always stated it was his opinion and he hopes he wasn't the final say on everything? Why are you allowing his say to be the final say on everything
20:10 < bridge> <jxsl13> he's grandpa heino. And old people are not flexible D':
20:11 < bridge> <syrinok> You can sensibly block these spam messages and monitor for the logs for f+s
20:11 < bridge> <syrinok> You can sensibly block these spam messages and monitor the logs for f+s
20:11 < bridge> <jxsl13> what is this even about?
20:11 < bridge> <Assa> please don't shit on heinrich, he is amazing and has done a lot for this game
20:12 < bridge> <syrinok> I'm not shitting on hein, he's just... Extra about things, to an extreme fault
20:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> I'm just trolling. But criticism should always be allowed.
20:12 < bridge> <Assa> sure
20:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> and it's common pattern when experienced people has their way of doing things
20:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> have
20:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> most of the time due to good reasons and well founded and sometimes "because we have been doing this all the time"
20:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> or always
20:15 < bridge> <syrinok> I would just filter the literaly exact message they send and go from there
20:15 < bridge> <syrinok> I would just filter the literal exact message they send and go from there
20:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> can I advertise fot the banserver utility I created ?
20:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> for
20:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> is it about spambots?
20:16 < bridge> <syrinok> It's about discord steam scam messages
20:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> ah, my bad
20:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> thought ingame
20:17 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya, it's a much easier problem to deal with, cause afraik, they don't change what they say ever
20:17 < bridge> <syrinok> So it's like... Just filter it wtf?
20:18 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya, it's a much easier problem to deal with, cause afaik, they don't change what they say ever
20:18 < bridge> <jxsl13> pretty easy solution, ig
20:22 < bridge> <syrinok> Ah, I see Learath discussed it a bit above, just filter the entire message every single time asap, you don't need to filter small portions of it
20:23 < bridge> <syrinok> They don't change the text often enough
20:25 < bridge> <syrinok> The ones ingame are obviously a different story 🫡
20:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> imo it's discord's job for public servers
20:26 < bridge> <syrinok> Both, it's our community
20:26 < bridge> <learath2> I don't like confrontation, so I state my opinion on things and don't really go much further than that
20:26 < bridge> <syrinok> I don't like the great wall of hein, and I'll gladly take admin and spank him up
20:26 < bridge> <syrinok> :greenthing:
20:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> SKEITH FOR ADMIN CONFIRMED?
20:27 < bridge> <syrinok> TOO EZ
20:27 < bridge> <syrinok> Hey man, murpi got admin in less time than me!
20:28 < bridge> <learath2> It is my opinion that both on discord and ingame we can be faar more aggressive with our filtering and accept some collateral. I think only murpi would agree with me there, so that's that
20:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont even know how and when murpi got admin
20:28 < bridge> <syrinok> Discord is omega easy
20:28 < bridge> <syrinok> Accounts are magical things
20:29 < bridge> <syrinok> Flip a switch and filter out all the bad boys
20:29 < bridge> <syrinok> hein would never allow it
20:29 < bridge> <learath2> and the other camp does has smart people with sensible arguments that would take hours and hours of discussion, at which point they'll probably have just changed my mind because, well I do not like conflicy
20:29 < bridge> <learath2> and the other camp does has smart people with sensible arguments that would take hours and hours of discussion, at which point they'll probably have just changed my mind because, well I do not like conflict
20:29 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya. that's one of the main problems with DDNet though :D
20:30 < bridge> <syrinok> Need a nice mix of both
20:30 < bridge> <learath2> Like I do not believe for one second that you have some legitimate need to send the link of a bot client whether ingame or on discord
20:30 < bridge> <syrinok> Need a nice mix of both that actually play the game and understand what could benefit it
20:31 < bridge> <syrinok> Need a nice mix of both that actually play the game and understand what could benefit it / needs to be done
20:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> you can count messages after joining
20:32 < bridge> <learath2> But I guess yes, there is some tiny probability that you sent the link to say something like "gosh darn it, I hate that people keep sending this botclient.com/download-bot-today, link"
20:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> or how fast a message with said link was sent after joining.
20:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> or just ban the link
20:33 < bridge> <louis> cant you let users who have like 50+ msgs to be ignored by any filter
20:33 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, these were litigated a billion times over. I'm very tired and not allowed to implement the albeit imperfect solution that is obvious to pretty much everyone
20:33 < bridge> <learath2> So I will not be talking about this anymore, it is a topic that does not bring any joy, only despair
20:34 < bridge> <learath2> Most of the discord spam is from people that lose their legit accounts to token grabbers
20:34 < bridge> <syrinok> Maybe it's time to purple name unironically Learath
20:34 < bridge> <learath2> They see the "free 50$ gift" and click the link
20:34 < bridge> <louis> i see
20:35 < bridge> <louis> maybe put a command to bypass filter like /sendrealmessage message:[]
20:35 < bridge> <syrinok> Why be part of the team when the team doesn't want to team, there's an obvious issue here that NEEDS a solution asap, why aren't they working with you to come up with one, rather than giving reasons why it can't be done
20:36 < bridge> <jxsl13> about ingame spam.
20:37 < bridge> <syrinok> If they can't work with you to come up with a better solution, then why do they get to just say no to the only solution available
20:37 < bridge> <syrinok> That you're willing to do
20:37 < bridge> <learath2> Well on most things we do not disalign this much. This specific topic has been a contention point for years onw
20:38 < bridge> <learath2> Well on most things we do not disalign this much. This specific topic has been a contention point for years now
20:38 < bridge> <kebscs> :pepeW:
20:38 < bridge> <syrinok> We block people for defending themselves in block, I personally view this as less evil than reposting a bot link
20:38 < bridge> <syrinok> We ban people for defending themselves in block, I personally view this as less evil than reposting a bot link
20:39 < bridge> <learath2> The only current spam issue that is easily fixable is the join spam. That's why I made an issue for it (and people pointed out the option to limit connections already exists, so that one is at least in theory solved)
20:40 < bridge> <learath2> The message spam is not all that easy to automate, but moderation tools are hardly adequate to handle it by hand
20:40 < bridge> <syrinok> We ban people for defending themselves in block, I personally view this as less evil than reposting a bot link
20:40 < bridge> <syrinok> 
20:40 < bridge> <syrinok> Obviously this is only dealt with this way because we can't know who started it
20:40 < bridge> <syrinok> This wouldn't be the first time we took a certain approach because it was easier
20:41 < bridge> <syrinok> If you're posting a bot link you're a moron, and sorry, morons get punished all the time in this world
20:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> but inclusion
20:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> :kek:
20:42 < bridge> <melon> Please punish ne
20:42 < bridge> <melon> Please punish me
20:42 < bridge> <learath2> The bot ads ingame are an obvious cat and mouse issue, but there is a solution so trivial and sooooo obvious to anyone that even takes a glancing look at the problem can point it out
20:43 < bridge> <learath2> My grandmother who has no technical background could probably come up with the solution were you to put it into the correct analogy
20:43 < bridge> <kebscs> accounts
20:43 < bridge> <kebscs> but they have to be perfectly implemented too with quic so we wait another 10 years
20:43 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, I have said too much. If I talk more I'll be in big trouble
20:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's not what granny would say
20:44 < bridge> <syrinok> Keep talking, if the team has a problem, I'm sure they'll listen, in the end, you're a very respectable admin and the entire community knows it
20:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> we might get a Learath3 at some point
20:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> fear sounds like a primitive instrument to be ruled by, but it works.
20:45 < bridge> <syrinok> Fucked up world if Learath gets demoted
20:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> don't fear
20:45 < bridge> <syrinok> I for one quit
20:46 < bridge> <syrinok> Wait guys, I already quit
20:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> He just dramatizes it a bit
20:46 < bridge> <syrinok> SHIT
20:46 < bridge> <learath2> I wouldn't get demoted I was just joking about that. But I do not enjoy conflict
20:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> welcome in the white boi club, Skeith
20:47 < bridge> <syrinok> I think I told deen on the forums to grow a pair of balls once when he wanted to shutdown DDNet
20:47 < bridge> <syrinok> I'm extending this to you, Learath 🍺
20:47 < bridge> <syrinok> :greenthing:
20:48 < bridge> <learath2> I have no intention of quitting, or doing anything really. If we can agree that you'll get banned for posting links to bots, I'll gladly implement it
20:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
20:49 < bridge> <syrinok> This was before I was mod and one of the reasons I was almost declined :kek:
20:49 < bridge> <jxsl13> *start of ad* use my banserver utility for banning spambots on all ingame servers and give me feedback, in case features are needed *end of ad*
20:49 < bridge> <learath2> So you should direct your advocacy to getting us to the consensus that there is no legitimate reason to post some substrings in public chat
20:49 < bridge> <syrinok> gdin my love, you allowed me to be the best I could be
20:49 < bridge> <jxsl13> *shamelessly advertising*
20:49 < bridge> <melon> Dinner was online on Naufrage 4
20:49 < bridge> <melon> And I almost cried
20:49 < bridge> <melon> Seeing him again
20:49 < bridge> <syrinok> damn
20:49 < bridge> <melon> I miss gdin
20:50 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya, I can get gdin to connect at any time usually, I just DM him, it's too ez
20:50 < bridge> <melon> Damn
20:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> o
20:50 < bridge> <syrinok> We go way back
20:50 < bridge> <melon> That's one reason I wouldn't really enjoy becoming admin at any time
20:50 < bridge> <melon> I love having discussions
20:50 < bridge> <syrinok> How many spanks do you think it'll take on hein
20:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> gb dinner back pog
20:51 < bridge> <learath2> It's not spanks you need, it's just to debate him on it and convince him of something I couldn't in 2 years with solid arguments
20:51 < bridge> <melon> I think Heinrich is just a little fed up, given he hasn't been on discord for a good time
20:51 < bridge> <syrinok> Bro, I'm the master debater
20:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually heinrich is the master debater
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Just pm robyte, he is deluxe admin
20:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> he will hit u everywhere
20:52 < bridge> <learath2> But, you are not allowed to get angry, no mean words, nothing but pure logical arguments
20:52 < bridge> <syrinok> fuck
20:52 < bridge> <melon> It depends on the person I discuss with
20:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats where heinrich wins
20:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a screenshot of him saying fuck on this discord
20:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> rare event
20:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i think i lost it
20:52 < bridge> <syrinok> I get too invested and end up getting heated
20:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
20:53 < bridge> <melon> @davide my beloved
20:53 < bridge> <melon> :(
20:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> same, its why i cant be mod or admin and also because im lazy as fuck and only do things here when i want to do them
20:53 < bridge> <melon> You should see mod chat from his earlier times :justatest:
20:54 < bridge> <melon> Anyway, enough talking around the topic. When do we get political ?
20:54 < bridge> <syrinok> Also if I'm debating about something I think I'm 10000% right :greenthing:
20:55 < bridge> <learath2> A lot of people who think they are good at debating are not really good at debating. You are not allowed to get passionate at all
20:55 < bridge> <melon> I love having heated arguments, one of the things I enjoy on texting
20:55 < bridge> <melon> I love having heated arguments, one of the things I enjoy on testing
20:55 < bridge> <melon> People constantly want to tell you that you suck
20:55 < bridge> <melon> :monkalaugh:
20:55 < bridge> <louis> always remember to add in ragebait to your takes
20:55 < bridge> <melon> I drop in a coke here and there
20:55 < bridge> <melon> That's usually enough
20:56 < bridge> <syrinok> I throw in humor
20:56 < bridge> <syrinok> A little sprinkledink
20:56 < bridge> <learath2> Another issue is that the argument is not completely baseless. If it were it'd be trivial to argue against
20:57 < bridge> <syrinok> #logs lear
20:57 < bridge> <melon> I enjoy having arguments even if I loose, it just means I can improve and do better in the next one
20:57 < bridge> <syrinok> weirdo
20:58 < bridge> <learath2> You have to dig deep into what each course of action leads to and what actions it might lead to by 3rd parties and what counter actions would be required and why in one situation the counter action is more trivial than the other
20:58 < bridge> <syrinok> #general
20:58 < bridge> <syrinok> HELP
20:59 < bridge> <learath2> And after all that is done, you have ethics to discuss and finally at the end of the day, the only thing that changed is that it's a easier to be annoying to the author of the spambot
20:59 < bridge> <melon> I helped
20:59 < bridge> <syrinok> that guy wasn't the only one that posted it, prob more spammers inc
20:59 < bridge> <melon> Yeah I muted two
20:59 < bridge> <learath2> And after all that is done, you have ethics to discuss and finally at the end of the day, the only thing that changed is that it's a bit easier to be annoying to the author of the spambot
21:01 < bridge> <melon> I wish we could have people who know their stuff improve us in that regard instead of you admins being forced to do it (speaking of AB for example)
21:01 < bridge> <learath2> It is technically an unsolveable problem I mean, google with their millions didn't solve it
21:01 < bridge> <melon> Apart from noby but dude hasn't opened his laptop in the last 2 months again
21:01 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya noby gone af
21:01 < bridge> <melon> He answeres like every 3 months
21:01 < bridge> <melon> But he answers!
21:01 < bridge> <syrinok> yep
21:02 < bridge> <learath2> We really should find a new antibot engineer to take over
21:02 < bridge> <melon> ChillerDragon is cooking up his one :cat_cracked_hehe:
21:02 < bridge> <learath2> Hey I hear people are actually working on effective anti-tas measures, so maybe at least that will happen
21:03 < bridge> <melon> Kog has a good solution but it's not really suitable for ddnet sadly
21:03 < bridge> <syrinok> I like my idea for antibot measures!
21:03 < bridge> <syrinok> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/1263223077077254165/1357903305669607584
21:03 < bridge> <melon> :nouis:
21:03 < bridge> <learath2> We discussed this one at the meetup, we didn't really want to do that
21:04 < bridge> <melon> Yeah it also doesn't really make sense, it won't work because ddnet is not as sensitive as kog
21:04 < bridge> <syrinok> It's at the bottom of that wall of text
21:04 < bridge> <melon> Yeah it also doesn't really make sense, it won't really work because ddnet is not as sensitive as kog
21:04 < bridge> <learath2> Do not elaborate at all about it if any of you know anything about it
21:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i vote for chiller as our anti freespeech commissioner
21:04 < bridge> <melon> I know all about, I won't evaluate about
21:04 < bridge> <melon> Just saying it makes no sense xD
21:04 < bridge> <learath2> I just wanted to say we know their solution and we don't think it's a good fit for us
21:04 < bridge> <syrinok> I think leaving it entirely to moderators is too much
21:05 < bridge> <melon> Keep in mind, I'm the rat for all communities at once
21:05 < bridge> <melon> :monkalaugh:
21:05 < bridge> <learath2> TAS? Yeah no way, that needs to be solved by an automated system
21:06 < bridge> <syrinok> I like the idea of ghosts being public, and linking dealing with it to accounts
21:06 < bridge> <syrinok> Having a reputation system etc.
21:06 < bridge> <teero777> BTW if we actually allow physics changes for season 2 please let me be in charge
21:06 < bridge> <teero777> there is so much dumb code in the physics
21:06 < bridge> <teero777> just slow ass code that can't be made faster mostly because of rounding errors
21:06 < bridge> <learath2> Linking accounts to runs is probably the biggest upcoming drama ever
21:07 < bridge> <melon> Ahahahahahh
21:07 < bridge> <melon> RiiC99
21:07 < bridge> <learath2> It'll be a battle of proportions never seen before in ddnet history. People will call peoples parents slurs that I won't know exists
21:08 < bridge> <melon> Yeah I'm hyped for the upcoming discussion and workload
21:08 < bridge> <syrinok> Why don't we just start fresh? :D
21:08 < bridge> <teero777> now if we had a single ruler then this would not be a problem
21:08 < bridge> <syrinok> Surely no drama that way :D
21:08 < bridge> <teero777> monarchy ftw
21:08 < bridge> <learath2> That's why the only semi-successful attempt at accounts has been jupstars attempt which pretty much completely sidestepped the problem 😄
21:08 < bridge> <syrinok> legacy runs and legacy points! yay!
21:09 < bridge> <teero777> i mean no one is doing anything because they can't do anything xd
21:09 < bridge> <learath2> Surely they won't ship me a pipebomb, surely
21:09 < bridge> <teero777> administration has to initiate this
21:09 < bridge> <syrinok> All of that shit is already meaningless in the grand sceme of things! Rip the bandaid wahoooooooooooooo
21:10 < bridge> <syrinok> It's as meaingless as keeping them around as legacy!
21:10 < bridge> <syrinok> So nothing has changed
21:10 < bridge> <learath2> Well @jupeyy_keks is pretty much done, assuming we don't need accounts linked to ranks, it's only waiting on QUIC which also doesn't seem to have much work left
21:11 < bridge> <learath2> So it only required heinrich to have some extra time and we are there. Accounts, yaay. Accounts that don't really do much, but accounts nonetheless
21:11 < bridge> <syrinok> Don't link points or accounts to anything, names aren't linked to fucking anything, it's all just floating in the wind. Add accounts, and things that are properly attached to these accounts, call it a day.
21:11 < bridge> <syrinok> It's the only real way to do it
21:11 < bridge> <teero777> ofc they have to be linked? xd
21:11 < bridge> <syrinok> Don't link points or ranks to anything, names aren't linked to fucking anything, it's all just floating in the wind. Add accounts, and things that are properly attached to these accounts, call it a day.
21:12 < bridge> <teero777> just like accounts in other games
21:12 < bridge> <teero777> the design decisions can't be that hard
21:12 < bridge> <syrinok> Then we don't call them points or ranks, we call them something new, we confuse the playerbase
21:12 < bridge> <learath2> That's the camp I will be on when the promised day cometh
21:12 < bridge> <syrinok> But you acquire these points and ranks the same way, they can just be called pointies and rankies!
21:12 < bridge> <melon> Call it pp
21:13 < bridge> <melon> Like osu
21:13 < bridge> <syrinok> I love pp!
21:13 < bridge> <melon> I have 10.87K pp
21:13 < bridge> <syrinok> Can I look at your pp
21:13 < bridge> <learath2> The internal drama will be even more epic when people notice that we can't really ban by these accounts that contain no ranks nor any obstacle to creation 😛
21:14 < bridge> <melon> :monkalaugh: :monkalaugh: :monkalaugh: :monkalaugh:
21:14 < bridge> <syrinok> Wait, accounts are meaningless this whole frickin time?
21:14 < bridge> <learath2> Thankfully steam does take some measures, so we could punish people by not allowing them to play with an account linked to a certain steam account ever again
21:15 < bridge> <syrinok> If you're reading this evil doers: DO NOT link to steam
21:15 < bridge> <learath2> I guess we can technically also ban emails
21:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The account server supports whitelisted email domains
21:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We could simply move the verification part to the email providers xD
21:16 < bridge> <syrinok> are we sure hein would allow this
21:16 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, these were also already litigated in the past. I'm like that dude Keith from attack on titan
21:16 < bridge> <syrinok> He may use this very obscure email provider
21:17 < bridge> <learath2> I got this one pre-approved, worry not
21:17 < bridge> <syrinok> This alone would definitely help
21:18 < bridge> <syrinok> We could add more measures in the future!
21:18 < bridge> <syrinok> HOPE IS REAL
21:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Realistically we'd need account only servers for anything that isn't Linear/Multeasymap/AiP-Gores
21:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> To have an impact
21:18 < bridge> <syrinok> Learath, we simply pipebomb the people that would likely pipebomb you
21:19 < bridge> <learath2> Since that is not happening in a billion billion years. I have other plans in mind
21:19 < bridge> <syrinok> Wait Learth, do you think I'd pipebomb you
21:19 < bridge> <syrinok> Wait Learath, do you think I'd pipebomb you
21:19 < bridge> <learath2> Many many types of trust score, moderation tools that allow moderating by those scores
21:20 < bridge> <syrinok> I already sent my pipebomb out of fear
21:20 < bridge> <learath2> I would never condone violence
21:20 < bridge> <syrinok> Sorry
21:22 < bridge> <learath2> I somehow made rice that is simultaneously over and undercooked
21:23 < bridge> <syrinok> Eat half of it out of spite
22:51 < bridge> <kebscs> where in the code are server settings loaded to the client?
22:52 < bridge> <robyt3> `CGameClient::LoadMapSettings`
22:53 < bridge> <kebscs> like server settings, not map
22:53 < bridge> <kebscs> how does client know about g_Config.m_SvDeepfly  in character.cpp
22:53 < bridge> <kebscs> or does it just use default value
22:54 < bridge> <robyt3> That's the same, `CFGFLAG_GAME`
22:54 < bridge> <robyt3> It doesn't know about server settings being changed outside of the map at the moment
22:55 < bridge> <kebscs> alright ty
22:55 < bridge> <kebscs> that would explain why the prediction is broken
22:55 < bridge> <robyt3> #7589
22:55 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7589
23:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Permanent bans suck
23:43 < bridge> <chairn> uh, kinda sounds like big brother implemented in ddnet
23:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yep yep, it's time for a social credit system
