11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> tomorrow im getting 32gb more of ram
11:21 < bridge> <cyberFighter> u dont need it
11:21 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i also dont need 32gb
11:21 < bridge> <cyberFighter> ive yet to go past like 10gb
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> kekw
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1220317219985031249/GJLKa1rawAECvWy.png?ex=660e7ff9&is=65fc0af9&hm=b2c946e974235c75daa846e7636c7f9a9f9448a1d8716ba4458dfe9d86cd48f8&
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> use agpl guys
11:25 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i mean what do u actually need more ram for
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> compiling
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> faster
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i went OOM compiling big rust and llvm projects
11:26 < bridge> <cyberFighter> does it take long or smth
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> with 32gb
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> @cyberfighter when u have a cpu with high core count u need more ram
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> because each thread uses ram
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have 24 cores
11:26 < bridge> <cyberFighter> wtf
11:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1220317798690193449/image.png?ex=660e8083&is=65fc0b83&hm=9218847299e2de7b5ae7366207a665315c9cc23db38c55912d547303c0035b9b&
11:27 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i have 6 i think
11:27 < bridge> <cyberFighter> but sometimes it shows as 12 on linux
11:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> 6 cores 12 threads
11:28 < bridge> <cyberFighter> ohk
11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i have compiled my kernel with zen4
11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i fixed the wifi/bt thing
11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> would it be crazy to enable -o3
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> probs yes
12:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> What was the issue ?
12:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> Out of Mana ? Damn you weak
12:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> @scrumplex thoughts ?
12:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt have the bt as module and didnt load the firmware
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> Ah - i remember having to so some Kernel tinkering (idk how to word it correctly) because it didnt function properly
12:36 < bridge> <scrumplex> sad
12:37 < bridge> <scrumplex> People when large companies use their permissively licensed code:
12:37 < bridge> <scrumplex> <surprised pikachu>
12:39 < bridge> <scrumplex> Arch security person commented on the commit lol https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/0b34396924eca4edc524469886dc5be6c77ec4ed#commitcomment-140058219
12:39 < bridge> <learath2> For kernel?
12:43 < bridge> <learath2> Tough luck, all the hosters will just use old still bsd licensed versions of redis
12:43 < bridge> <learath2> If you suspect you'll go moneybrained in the future, permissive licenses are not for you
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
12:47 < bridge> <learath2> I wouldn't. Kernel uses too many weird tricks
14:30 < bridge> <peter0x44> There is a reason BSD is the "cuck license"
14:50 < bridge> <avolicious> Or use alternatives like https://github.com/Snapchat/KeyDB or https://www.dragonflydb.io/
14:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Dragonfly - blazingly fast 🔥
14:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```cpp
14:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> import std;
14:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
14:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> int main() {
14:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
14:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     std::println("Hello World"); 
14:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
14:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
14:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ``` cpp doesn't even look that scary with c++23 :justatest:
15:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hell nah
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> `std::format` and co is the best thing to happen to c++ in a decade
15:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> But ranges and views will be in my nightmares
15:02 < bridge> <learath2> They are actually not that bad after you get a bit more used to them
15:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> They look so cursed
15:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> they have a good format func now ?
15:04 < bridge> <learath2> `std::format("It is {:%H:%M} now", std::chrono::system_clock::now())`
15:05 < bridge> <learath2> It's python 3 style format with a lot of extra customization points
15:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I saw it can format vecs and stufd
15:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> But can i format struct somehow?
15:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ^^ah, cool
15:06 < bridge> <learath2> By implementing `std::formatter` for your type you can get it to format anything
15:06 < bridge> <learath2> You can even parse the spec as you like
15:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Oh, dat's pog
15:06 < bridge> <learath2> E.g. for chrono zoned_times you have chrono format specifiers like %H:%M
15:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Sadly most of code based will move to c++23 after 50 years
15:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Sadly most of code bases will move to c++23 after 50 years
15:07 < bridge> <learath2> Format is C++20
15:07 < bridge> <learath2> So only 30 years
15:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :santatrollet:
15:08 < bridge> <learath2> Concepts are also enjoyable, though the lack of callable type traits in the STL even in C++23 is very sad
15:09 < bridge> <learath2> Coroutines are fun to use but both clang and gcc seem to have a lot of trouble optimizing them. So your coroutines need to be large enough that the saving and switching of context is negligible
15:10 < bridge> <learath2> Future of C++ looks bright, now if only we could move towards it a little quicker
15:12 < bridge> <learath2> One thing I still haven't tried is modules. Maybe I should give those a go too
16:20 < bridge> <vappy19> Too many smurfs, leaderboards gone
16:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> as other games show, account system can even encourage smurfs
16:23 < bridge> <vappy19> IP accounts like in Osu!
16:23 < bridge> <vappy19> :)
16:58 < bridge> <teero777> IPs can easily be changed :D
16:59 < bridge> <vappy19> VPN is banned hmm
17:00 < bridge> <teero777> I'm not talking about VPNs :)
17:01 < bridge> <Peakies> account system on IP or mac is not possible 🙂
17:15 < bridge> <peter0x44> It's possible... But it's not useful
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> c++ catching up to rust
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/03/21/Rust-1.77.0.html
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> async fn fib(n: u32) -> u32 {
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki>    match n {
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki>        0 | 1 => 1,
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki>        _ => Box::pin(fib(n-1)).await + Box::pin(fib(n-2)).await
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki>    }
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> this now works
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Async functions previously could not call themselves due to a compiler limitation. In 1.77, that limitation has been lifted, so recursive calls are permitted so long as they use some form of indirection to avoid an infinite size for the state of the function.
18:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 1.77.0 stabilizes offset_of! for struct fields, which provides access to the byte offset of the relevant public field of a struct. This macro is most useful when the offset of a field is required without an existing instance of a type. Implementing such a macro is already possible on stable, but without an instance of the type the implementation would require tricky unsafe code which makes it easy to accidentally introduce undefined behavior.
18:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
18:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Users can now access the offset of a public field with offset_of!(StructName, field). This expands to a usize expression with the offset in bytes from the start of the struct.
20:36 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> hi! i encountered this problem more times in my life, in this place its usual that only 1 pixel and dont let you go up. can you put here pls that stuff that only let you pass from only one direction? would make this part better. thanks for letting me say this

21:38 < bridge> <matodor> no, random personalities (player, skin, color body, color feet) with minimum 50hours playtime
21:38 < bridge> <matodor> no, random personalities (player+skin+color body,+color feet pair) with minimum 50hours playtime
21:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i was talking about the player's skin
21:39 < bridge> <matodor> no, random personalities (player+skin+color body+color feet pair) with minimum 50hours playtime
21:41 < bridge> <matodor> If you play with two skins or colors one of them can be randomly selected
21:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> oh ok
21:52 < bridge> <ar1gin> I recommend using weighted randomizer and country filter as 1/2 of tees are chineese. I love the idea btw 👍
