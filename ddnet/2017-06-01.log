18:01 <@Nimda> Where am I by Deeper just released on Solo at 2017-06-01 17:57
21:04 < laxa> Hey guys, I have a question about ddnet
21:05 < laxa> the game is taking ages to load the first map I am going to play on
21:05 < laxa> then after, the loads are a bit faster
21:05 < laxa> I changed my computer for something really better and that didn't improved
21:05 < laxa> I am wondering if it's because I have lots of screenshots/demos/maps
21:05 < laxa> which one would be responsible for that kind of load time ?
21:06 <@deen> hi laxa
21:06 < laxa> hi deen
21:06 <@deen> I've never heard about that issue
21:06 <@deen> You could try moving all your skins away, then screens, demos, maps etc
21:06 < laxa> my teeworlds data folder is 9Gb
21:06 <@deen> and see which it is
21:06 < laxa> I like to keep everything actually
21:07 < laxa> Yeah, that's true, but I was lazy and you might have had the answer ^^
21:07 <@deen> I have to delete my demo recordings every few days. when you have ddnet client running all day goes to a few GB all the time
21:07 < laxa> 1032 demo files
21:07 < laxa> 4783 maps
21:08 < laxa> 1523 ghosts
21:08 <@deen> could be the ghosts too
21:08 <@deen> that would make sense for the client to scan all your ghosts
21:08 < laxa> and 1219 screenshots
21:08 <@deen> to find out if you have one that fits for the map
21:08 < laxa> actually, I don't understand why that would be a reason
21:08 <@deen> and after the first run it's cached in RAM
21:08 < laxa> cause maps have a crc, no need to scan the whole directory
21:08 <@deen> not sure, haven't touched that code ever
21:09 <@deen> it could also be texture compression in settings, but lower probability than all your files
21:09 < laxa> I highly doubt, I have a really high end computer
21:10 < laxa> feels like the load time was just the same between new and old computer
21:10 < laxa> well, apparently ghosts are the reason
21:10 < laxa> might be possible to improve the algo I guess
21:11 <@deen> ok, reasonable
21:11 < laxa> is the windows 10 x64 build working ?
21:11 <@deen> why not?
21:12 < laxa> well, last time I tried to compile x64 on windows, bam config file was kind of broken and libraries were missing
21:13 <@deen> ah, they might not work in visual studio
21:13 <@deen> i don't have that, so can't test
21:13 < laxa> good thing, ghosts aren't searched recursively
21:14 <@deen> so it opens each ghost file
21:14 <@deen> and reads the header inside to parse it
21:15 <@deen> CMenus::GhostlistFetchCallback
21:16 < laxa> well, crc and mapname are saved in the filename
21:17 < laxa> but I guess this is fucked up if a map has an "_" inside its name :s
21:17 <@deen> Or a player name with _ etc
21:18 <@deen> but we could at least check that the map name starts correctly
21:18 <@deen> should be pretty easy, will do that
21:22 <@deen> That makes me wonder, are map names escaped?
21:22 <@deen> Don't tell me you can just call a map $MFT or /
21:23 <@deen> ../../
21:23 < laxa> haha, I actually have no ideq
21:23 < laxa> but that would be funny
21:23 <@deen> I mean, crashing client from server is easy
21:23 <@deen> but crashing windows would be worse

21:28 < laxa> wow, that was fast ^^
21:28 < laxa> Nice deen, thanks !

21:33 <@deen> laxa: https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-10.6.1-win64.zip
21:34 <@deen> or wait for the updater i guess^^
21:34 < laxa> I build the 32 bits version
21:35 < laxa> but I guess that no matter what, I am just beeing picky, that won't change anything performance wise
21:35 <@deen> really?
21:35 < laxa> 800 fps right now
21:35 <@deen> oh, you mean 32/64, not the ghosts change
21:35 < laxa> I already built the ghost change :)
21:35 <@deen> well, some things are faster with x86, some with x86-64
21:36 < laxa> alright
21:36 < laxa> your change makes things way faster :p
21:36 <@deen> good
