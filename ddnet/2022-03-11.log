00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> I would but i'm a web developer
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> i cant understand c++
07:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> c++ isn’t too different from most of the web languages. The code reads mostly the same
07:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats simply not true
07:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but not an excuse being "web dev" to not learn more
08:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> So i have a huge problem and i cant find why. When i move my mouse my fps drops on a HUGE amount. Like from 3000 to under 100
08:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> So i have a huge problem and i cant find why. When i move my mouse my fps drops on a HUGE amount. Like from 3000 to under 100
08:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> Then i updated my graphics driver now i dont even get 1k fps anymore and fps still drops when i move my mouse
08:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont move ur mouse then :troll:
08:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> :justatest:
08:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @HappyFray does trying fullscreen help
08:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u play on borderless
08:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know what could cause this tho
08:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe @Not Keks knows
08:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> i play on borderless but doesnt help sadly :c
08:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks nice pfp btw
08:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @HappyFray try an older version
08:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or nightly
08:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> i play on nightly.
08:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
08:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> try the latest stable
08:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe its a bug in nightly
08:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what does gfx_opengl_major say btw
08:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on nightly
08:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> same on latest release 
08:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> on latest gfx_opengl_major = 1
08:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> on night same
08:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> same on latest release 
08:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> on latest gfx_opengl_major = 1
08:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> on nightly same
08:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
08:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is ur pc rly old?
08:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> no it just happened yesterday like i played and it started to happen
08:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> try setting
08:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gfx_opengl_major 3
08:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> only in ddnet or in other games too
08:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> didnt fixed
08:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but did u retart
08:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> uhm good question i try
08:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> restart
08:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> a lot.
08:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with the new setting
08:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok
08:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im out of ideas
08:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> only ddnet i tried at the new game aperture desk job and on minecraft
08:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> thats how it looks like
08:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/951748950405288007/2022-03-11_08-49-27.mp4
08:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> i capped at 300 fps that you can see better.
10:06 <+ChillerDragon> ryo you mentioned once that you use a youtube-dl fork. Why is that?
10:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yt-dlp is better
10:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I think the backstory was that youtube-dl development slowed down and PRs were not merged as much
10:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I had some videos that didn't work in youtube-dl, so that's why I switched
10:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this
10:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp
10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Hm always sad to see proects split up. But I guess not merging prs is an issue.
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cxx.rs/
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can use this to begin ddnet migration to rust
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30627495
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> Wait, DDNet is being written in Rust?
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> Wait, DDNet is being rewritten in Rust?
12:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no im joking
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga i made a pr to ur twmap tool
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its mainly to update its deps and fix some deprecated stuff
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i recommend u use <https://crates.io/crates/cargo-edit> in the future
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> makes it easier to keep track
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my tool that parses the http masters showed this lmao
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/951803183024447528/unknown.png
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> poop emoji
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> merged, thanks!
13:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> i have a qol suggestion what about showing teams in server browser?
14:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga does twmap allow creating a new map?
14:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as in starting from nothing
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to try to learn some maze gen algorithms with it xd
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess creating a TwMap struct from scratch
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://docs.rs/twmap/0.6.0/twmap/struct.TwMap.html#method.empty>
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i should have looked more
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> found it
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/951830598647955456/unknown.png
14:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> epic
14:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if ur using rust and want even better error reporting i recommend <https://docs.rs/eyre/latest/eyre/>
14:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga i know this lib is probs was not initially meant for this but here is a nitpick:
14:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/951831824156459089/unknown.png
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this assumes there is always a physics group
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it shouldnt unwrap the result
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not rusty :feelsbadman:
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (i know i need to add a physics group)
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/951832005543362651/unknown.png
14:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> many of the functions on the map require that the map is 'valid'. this function is really small tho, feel free to do a merge request
14:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but the library should then report an error when the map is invalid no?
14:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see you have thiserror as a dep already
14:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> creating a enum for such common errors should be easy
14:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i can  try to do it
14:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> usually library code that contains lot of unwrap is seen as bad
14:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> I think this one can just return an option, no?
14:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
14:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> find() already returns a option
14:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> yup
14:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > panic!("Data is still compressed, reference unwrap unsuccessful")
14:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> these panics should also be errors
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> why? that is basically the same as the `unwrap` methods on options
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/951833958595854366/unknown.png
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you should try to never panic in library
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not recoverable from the user side unless using catch_unwind
14:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which no one should ever do
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> you are using the library incorrectly if you get that panic
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you should not be able to use the library incorrectly
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or even if u do it incorrectly u shouldnt get a panic
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> but I don't see how a user of this library would want to match against that error. if that person matches that error then something is wrong
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> rust is scary
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and he can find it out with an error
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> and if that person would just not match the error and do unwrap on the error then its not much use
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga u just dont match that error
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its rly common to do main() -> Result
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can unwrap the error in main with ?
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it will report it (and end the app)
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is how its done
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not with panics usually
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so the user has way more control
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> yo the function is literally called `unwrap`, you can match the enum yourself if you want
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is what i did in my app, i unwraped at main an error i didnt want to match cuz its unrecoverable for me
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/951834761792458752/unknown.png
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> same as with `option`, no?
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but that doesnt mean a panic should be there
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> why not?
14:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> its an `unwrap` method, the programmer is at fault if used incorrectly
14:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-03-to-panic-or-not-to-panic.html
14:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well maybe for that method yes i guess
14:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> still i dont like that design
14:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> you could write a `get` method that returns an option or smth, but returning an option/error on an `unwrap` method seems silly to me
14:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga since this struct has 2 members that are not visible outside its impossible to create them from an external crate sadly
14:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/951838298257625168/unknown.png
14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > error: cannot construct `twmap::GameTile` with struct literal syntax due to inaccessible fields
14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (you can keep those private by providing and alt way to create this struct e.g a new() methid
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Im sry if im annoying :feelsbadman:
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Damn mobile doest render the emoji
14:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> you could try the `GameTile::new` function ^^
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> My autocomplete didnt show it
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ill check later
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES2_FrenchThink:
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no, you didnt say install arch yet
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tried clean config?
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tried fullscreen?
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> laptop? does f1 purple text mention the GPU you want to actually use?
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> pc on high performance?
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tried downgrade the GPU driver(if there was an update)?
17:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> ok like i played and it happened out of nowhere. I tried every of that except downgrade. I tried upgrade driver actually. instead of downgrade
17:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> Im not playing on laptop and i dont have a bad pc
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> when you restarted, did you shutdown and turned on again
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or actual restart?
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in windows there is a difference in:
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> **right click** windows icon
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> restart
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and **open over windows icon**
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> restart
17:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the first also cleans the windows caches
17:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/getfile/952896
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> @HappyFray make sure there are no other windows open in the background to prevent desktop system trying to grab mouse to the hidden windows
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> for instance, i know discord window makes me lag if it stays open
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> both dont works and i also restarted with cmd shutdown /r
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> i already tried to kill every process except needed
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> maybe you can try system restoration
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i guess thats the moment to install linux
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> maybe xD
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no but srsly.. either you did smth
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or your hardware somehow degraded xd
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, its possible that some part just broke out
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nouaa> Does alt+F4 clean the cachés?
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mhh his disk was full, maybe demo recording caused it
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nouaa> Does alt+F4 clean the caches ?
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno, i just read an article a few years ago that restart != restart xD
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nouaa> Windows sux
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nouaa> 😂
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://www.howtogeek.com/349114/shutting-down-doesnt-fully-shut-down-windows-10-but-restarting-it-does/
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lol no idea why that picture poped up
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> `shutdown /s /f /t 0`
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets spam all available options and lets go
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> well
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> fuck it lets go
17:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> nope. I even tried disable fastboot and stuff so its really a full restart ^^
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok, well i dunno if there still is smth that can help
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe move your auto demos into a dir "old_auto" or smth
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe windows struggles opening the file to write
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe rename you whole Teeworlds config dir to Teeworlds2
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> ok sure. I now download a fully new client aswell from website.
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> alright
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the best is that this would prob  fix it
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @HappyFray  what GPU are you using?
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> 160
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> 1060
18:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> i mean it got better now it doesnt drop below 100 anymore. while moving mouse. without moving mouse 4 digit fps counter
18:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> <- soon™️
18:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> ah nvm now its getting worse again.
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tried a different USB port for the mouse
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> nope wait
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe there is smth really wrong with your motherboard xD
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @HappyFray Are you running on Windows 11?
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> no
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> not supported for 1600x
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> tried 4 different. usb 3.1 usb 3.0 usb 2.0 and front usb
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> tried 4 different. usb 3.1 usb 3.0 usb 2.0 and front usb
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> still no change
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> tried 3 different.  usb 3.0 usb 2.0 and front usb
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> still no change
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @HappyFray  on what OS are you running?
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> win 10
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> enabling modern opengl doesnt help?
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> can you try in recovery mode?
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and restarting the client
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> even with gl1 his pc should render this shitty game at over 1k fps xd
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> recovery mode? i mean sure i can try
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> it does i have highest peaks at around 3-4k
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> just if i move my mouse . its lower 2 digit
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> how much free space your disk have?
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> tried that hours ago
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> overall around 2TB
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> on my systemdrive its around 200GB atm. Game is installed on systemdrive aswell
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> overall around 2TB
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> on my systemdrive its exactly 162GB atm. Game is installed on systemdrive aswell
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> main reason is that youtube-dl is capped at around 60kb/s for me, while yt-dlp use full bandwidth. One technical difference is that yt-dlp emulates android browser agent which seems to have less limitation from youtube
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno how it relates to mouse movement, but i defs read some "horror" stories about input lag and motherboards (tho i never experienced them xd)
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I'd really try to unplug anything that isnt important (and maybe change mouse if you or your brother/family has one)
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> if it doesn't act like this on other games, this kinda rule out hardware malfunction
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> depends if you notice it in other games
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> if it doesn't act like this on other games, this kinda rules/ out hardware malfunction
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> if it doesn't act like this on other games, this kinda rules out hardware malfunction
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 300fps in minecraft are different to 300fps in ddnet
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean who can play minecraft modded with more than 10 fps xDD
18:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @HappyFray Just a random idea... Reinstall opengl driver https://developer.nvidia.com/opengl-driver then restart the computer and change the ddnet setting (send a screenshot of the settings here)
18:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> chuck norris' computer has steady 60fps
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_interrupt_controller
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe this is failing
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> now comes the ryo-os expert
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks i learnt about this from the rust os dev
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> would be nice to monitor system cpu usage
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have my own interrupt handler
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the keyboard works
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> *cough* *cough* In my os, i fxed this easy issue
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cough cough
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> best fix is, unplug from electricy and wait 10 seconds xd
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> router restart issue solving
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think it's better to wash it before plugging it back in
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> water + soap is very effective
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> if you want extra cleanness, add some acetone
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ahh, a propos clean pc 
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> clean the dust
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fän> Is there an official list of master servers that are used to queue the game server over udp?
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> master{n}.teeworlds.com?
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> best jupstar practise:
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> use a bicycle air pump and blow into the metalic frame from the cooler
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> n ranging from 0 to 3 or 1 to 4
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fän> No.
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fän> Not for DDNet master at least
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> you cant believe how much dust there is inside xD
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fän> I am also aware of master1.ddnet.tw and master2.ddnet.tw, those do not seem to perform the udp query itself though
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fän> I am also aware of master1.ddnet.tw, master2.ddnet.tw and master3.ddnet.tw, those do not seem to perform the udp query itself though
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the ddnet master server tool queries them from teeworlds master server
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the teeworlds master servers are the ones where the servers are actually registered to (internet tab)
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fän> I don't think teeworlds master queries servers
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fän> they're just used to register, and the client itself then pings
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ddnet queries them from teeworlds
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fän> they're just used to register, and the client itself then queries when requested
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fän> which ddnet client doesn't do
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes but now the ddnet https tool does that
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fän> Ok then
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the client nowadays uses a static file
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> @HappyFray is your pc still alive?
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fän> Doesn't seem like master1-3 are the IPs used for performing the query unfortunately
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://master1.ddnet.tw/ddnet/15/servers.json
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this is what the tool generates
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fän> Yes indeed
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nouaa> hey i was wondering if the dyn-cam will be "removed" one day?
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fän> but this info is being queried over udp
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wtf? XD
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i play full dyn
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nouaa> https://tenor.com/view/okay-smile-ok-happy-gif-14150032
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nouaa> u good?
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes, but ddnet has a server list for kog and ddnet anyway
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its only for the servers in internet tab
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nouaa> how can you even play with it xD
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think heinrich wanted to allow to register over HTTPs some day
18:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> fng ez
18:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gores static, but i played all fly maps on ddnet with full dyn just for fun xd
18:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Fän> That doesn't really help at this time unfortunately, but fine, I'll just scrape these IPs then
18:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> So actually no 😂 but recovery mode fixed the issue
18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> After restart something bad happened
18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/951895424900411493/2D321AEB-9C0F-4A20-82BF-FA29A78F19C2.jpg
18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> Im fucked 😂
18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wtf xD
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what did uninstall it, a virus? XD
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> Pressing any key does nothing btw
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> a anti virus tool? XD
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> No i actually have an idea why this happened but no idea to fix it 😂
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> sorry, i don't speak german...
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> he is missing a file
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> which is deleted now and he has to start recovery
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> I think not only a file
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> you uninstalled windowsß Xd
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> time to format disk
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> install linux
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it will be better
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u only play ddnet its better too
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more perf
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> true
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> system calls are cheaper
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> No if you Open msconfig you can change your installed Windows. I think it Tries to Open a not existing one Right now
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and ddnet calls network stuff every frame
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> waste like 20-30% cpu perf on windows xd
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/554329039561818123/654328747708645417/unknown.png
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ja clar
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ez ger
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> got a better way to get notified of network input on windows?
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'd just put it into a different thread xd
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> yo, i just want to be sure so i ask you guys, teeworlds is using his own protocol based on TCP to make communicate `client <--> server`
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> yo, i just want to be sure so i ask you guys, teeworlds is using his own protocol based on TCP to make communicate `client <--> server` ?
20:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> udp
20:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> ah ok so its based on udp, ty
20:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gandi (domain registar)send me this email
20:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Dear Gandi customer,

20:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder how a domain name registration uses computer, energy etc
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i call it bullshit
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> domain registration is probs a 1 time thing
20:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez excuse xd
20:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they take it
20:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> root dns servers 🙂
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> OK 3 hours later my pc is back !
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> congrats 👍
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> https://tenor.com/view/water-cooling-gif-24158468
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> Yeah thanks but teeworlds still lagging so cause recovery mode made it work i think its a software problem so well im gonna kill every single process till it works.
21:51  * Konsti slaps Ryozuki- around a bit with a large fishbot
22:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> discord causing the problem.
22:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> Discord somehow caused a lot of weird problems
22:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> Discord somehow caused/causes a lot of weird problems
22:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> even if minimized?
