00:04 < bridge> <Teero> ? there was never a question
00:05 < bridge> <Teero> obviously it's not supposed to crash. but you said that it doesn't look like the whole assert message, so i said you should see for yourself.
00:09 < bridge> <Ewan> ok
00:09 < bridge> <Ewan> > Is the client supposed to crash if it comes across an invalid .demo file?
00:09 < bridge> <Ewan> was not sure since u told me to try it myself
00:09 < bridge> <Ewan> there was a question but it was rhetorical
00:10 < bridge> <Ewan> idk why u have to be nasty
05:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
05:53 < bridge> <Ewan> gm

10:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Morning. What GUI app except browser do you have open right now and why do you dislike it?
10:17 < bridge> <Teero> discord, discord
10:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> true story bro
10:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> trash app
10:18 < ChillerDragon> ddnet
10:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ugliest app on my desktop.. so true story too
10:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the gameplay is superb
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 8k native gaming without laggs
10:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sick
10:19 < ChillerDragon> not sure if i dislike it
10:19 < ChillerDragon> but ddnet is basically the only gui app i launch next to my browser
10:20 < ChillerDragon> occasional wireshark and other random tools
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i already rewrote ddnet
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i cannot do that again
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> even tho i should
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I still have so many ideas
10:20 < ChillerDragon> no ddnet is fine
10:20 < ChillerDragon> please rewrite minecraft in rust
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nah
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nah
10:21 < ChillerDragon> and counter striker
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no more 3d games xd
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i accepted that i am bad at 3d modelling
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my last 3d game was well
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> let's not talk about it
10:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what about 4d games?
10:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is easier
10:22 < bridge> <robyt3> Should be fixed in 19.5 and latest master
10:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can just say this isn't ugly.. it's 4d
10:23 < bridge> <Assa> ferdium, discord
10:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ferdium?
10:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf
10:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is that
10:24 < bridge> <Assa> it's a tool to combine multiple messengers to one
10:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean sounds cool, but man, who thought that is a nice name
10:25 < bridge> <Assa> at first it was ferdi, but ferdi developer went mad and closed source, so ferdium was the FOSS followup
10:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh typescript
10:25 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** jupsti can i say "wayland" ?
10:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so it needs electron
10:25 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
10:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xDDD
10:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> before i rewrite wayland, i'd probs write an own graphics driver
10:26 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so u lookin for new project?
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> at least i am looking for inspiration
10:26 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** libreoffice
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in theory i have a project i'd love to do, but i know it takes me at least 8 years
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so dunno
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> libreoffice jajaaja
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> axaxaxax
10:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jupeyy_keks write a goofy compiler? üòÆ
10:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jupeyy_keks write a goofy compiler? :\o
10:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** gui compiler
10:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jupeyy_keks write a goofy compiler? \:o
10:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** scratch programming language ide
10:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i think discord was the best answer so far
10:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** go write me a new wire client please
10:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a compiler that turns electron app into native apps with 3MiB RAM usage
10:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** the electron one is a bit clunky
10:29 < bridge> <Assa> I am not running much other applications, the only other one is steam, but we love steam
10:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** do we?
10:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i hate that steam is slow
10:30 < bridge> <Assa> at least more than all other gamestore platforms combined
10:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i love that it's easy to play games on it
10:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i think pacman is a better gamestore
10:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> heroic games launcher
10:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that is electron too i think
10:30 < bridge> <Assa> don't know that one, I am comparing to origin (EA) or that ubisoft one (what was the name again)? blizzards also sucks
10:32 < bridge> <Assa> we should like steam, because as far as i can tell it's currently the best alternative for linux gaming
10:32 < bridge> <Assa> due to proton
10:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can play all games fine in heroic games launcher with proton
10:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just that u need steam drm
10:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so in the end u still have steam
10:33 < bridge> <Assa> putting that on my list, thx ‚úçÔ∏è
11:00 < bridge> <aegisub> ffmpeg
11:42 < ChillerDragon> btw robi the skin loading thing you did is noticable in 0.6
11:42 < ChillerDragon> it wasnt before
11:43 < ChillerDragon> i spawn with default skin sometimes even for like a full second
11:43 < ChillerDragon> `./DDNet "connect localhost"`
13:16 < bridge> <Assa> can you put an arbitrary command into ddnet like this?
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
13:18 < bridge> <Assa> how do I start a demo from f1 cli ?
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> start_demo name or smth
13:19 < bridge> <Assa> I tested demo_play which was not working
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah demo_play
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> should work
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is unpause
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just play
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> without demo_
13:20 < bridge> <Assa> it's just play
13:20 < bridge> <Assa> yeah thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
13:23 < bridge> <Assa> perfect, now I can fully autobenchmark with "play demos/Abyss-Benchmark.demo; exec benchmark-Abyss.cfg" for example
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh u did that by hand? xd
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we have a benchmarking test suite setup
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that also just starts the demo from cli
13:31 < bridge> <Assa> yes I went a bit further, now I have everything automated and I just need to add a demo and it benchmarks everything for every client I want to
13:31 < bridge> <Assa> just starting a demo and executing the benchmark command was the last manual step
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> today i encountered the first really bad clippy bug:
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/2928
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am surprised it's known since 2018 and nobody cares
14:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1428718016379486318/image.png?ex=68f384d7&is=68f23357&hm=fdf259c2be9dcf5787f3be084e185ca05641f8be351b2f7dae73ea65bbe539ec&
14:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> how has op done this
14:46 < bridge> <Assa> is there a way to make the client wait for 2 seconds? I need the nvidia overlay to disappear because it severly impacts fps xD
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then disable it
14:51 < bridge> <Assa> most hidden option ever, thanks
15:00 < bridge> <Assa> time to benchmark all of ddnet back to version 10 :p
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i like that project
15:19 < bridge> <Assa> unfortunately I can only collect benchmarks like this starting from 15.4
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> patch it in
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
15:33 < bridge> <Assa> which version added Vulkan support?
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 16
15:33 < bridge> <Teero> what? how
15:34 < bridge> <Teero> I'm pretty sure it was there earlier no?
15:34 < bridge> <Teero> I have some old 15.8 client and I'm pretty sure it has vulkan
15:34 < bridge> <Teero> hnm
15:34 < bridge> <Assa> hmm 15.4 was 2020, so 5 years ago
15:46 < bridge> <Assa> yeah lovely starting an old client overwrites your gfx config ^^
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> change storage.cfg
15:48 < bridge> <Assa> 15.9 has no support for different backends* except it has a "use modern opengl" button
15:48 < bridge> <Assa> so the first version supporting vulkan was indeed 16.0
16:10 < bridge> <Assa> I can already tell that there is a regression in ctf1
16:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Schade
16:17 < bridge> <Assa> must have happened between 16.0 and 17.4, and I didn't work on this before in this versions
17:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Schade
17:25 < bridge> <Assa> - guess where vulkan backend was implemented
17:25 < bridge> <Assa> - guess where a big regression was
17:25 < bridge> <Assa> - guess where I started reworking the rendering
17:25 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1428765930153971712/DDNet-benchmarks.png?ex=68f3b176&is=68f25ff6&hm=3d2b1fde59d8e65d7ff5a7e963e31391568827c9357b348ac1004610ab1cdb2d&
17:26 < bridge> <Assa> I still see a small regression between 16.9 and 17.0 which we probably didn't fix/address
17:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I still want to see low percentile values üëÄ
17:29 < bridge> <Assa> will come, let me eat my Tortellini first
17:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I guess I could make a tool myself but my system is a bit odd with hybrid graphics (an Nvidia Optimus laptop)
17:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> performs really badly at high fps on X11
17:30 < bridge> <Assa> The data is already collected, I just need to calculate the values for you
17:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> clearly we need an automated performance testing suite so that we can have dozens of people run it on their systems :tee_thinking:
17:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah seems unlikely
17:35 < bridge> <Assa> did that rn xD
17:35 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** how yall rate my variable naming? `CResponse *pRequest = nullptr`
17:36 < bridge> <Assa> only problem is, it's very slow, 30 seconds per demo per version, so I start the collection process and come back later
17:37 < bridge> <Assa> "irresponsible"
17:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah I suppose you wouldn't get that many points on your graph by hand
17:38 < bridge> <Assa> no xD
17:38 < bridge> <Assa> also you can repeat the same process with a different backend
17:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Does it run on Windows?
17:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I was thinking testing on Android would be a massive pain but now that I think of it it's fine as long as you use debug tools from a PC
17:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> What a fool I was for thinking of android phones as proper computers by themselves
17:43 < bridge> <Assa> I can send you the link in the repo
17:44 < bridge> <Assa> I can send you the link of the repo, I'll push an update first
17:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> show with entities too
17:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 17.2 added bevier curves, so ig some bug was added there
17:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> To start working on a port I'd have to set up a Windows system first :justatest:
17:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> data analysis would be fun tho :)
17:46 < bridge> <Assa> it should work everwhere* (except maybe android)
17:50 < bridge> <Assa> @inv41idu53rn4m3 you mean like this?
17:50 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1428772214131527821/DDNet-benchmarks-worst-0.001.png?ex=68f3b751&is=68f265d1&hm=83217feae64136d11463ace9fb3a692dec38308d45d493f779264d68b7d9c3dc&
17:50 < bridge> <Assa> worst 0.01 looks much more stable
17:51 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1428772346038063349/DDNet-benchmarks-worst-0.01.png?ex=68f3b770&is=68f265f0&hm=6256a145a5d51d68860250535a571929196c0178aaf97c42a587b350a7a6a226&
17:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> leet
17:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> :)
17:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Glad to see it looks similar, but that downturn for Abyss on the latest change seems a lot more pronounced
17:54 < bridge> <Assa> the latest change is the quad clustering, it's expected, that it benefits on extreme cases the most, while others see small losses
17:55 < bridge> <Assa> robustness is much much more valuable here
17:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah a small loss is expected, which is why I'm interested in Abyss specifically taking a much bigger dive in the low percentile values than others
17:56 < bridge> <Assa> if you take a look at abyss, you might see why it's part of this benchmark xD
17:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah it's got some girth
17:56 < bridge> <Assa> like Aoe must have told to himself: Lets tell the world how good I can master the editor
17:57 < bridge> <Assa> same for KingsLeap: Lets show the world, how much I abuse twmap
17:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> seeing KingsLeap that high up there makes me respect it even more :)
17:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's a really pretty map :deen_star:
17:59 < bridge> <Assa> lastly, every client used here is a download from the homepage, the last one is selfbuild, there might be differences just by different compilers
17:59 < bridge> <Assa> there is one part at the top where fps might drop to ~1000
17:59 < bridge> <Assa> there is one part at the top where fps might drop to ~1000 on my PC
17:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> clearly we must calculate envelopes on the GPU
18:00 < bridge> <Assa> watch igpus die
18:00 < bridge> <Assa> burst into flames
18:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> The graph shows convincing overall minimum performance increase
18:03 < bridge> <cellegenrih> So this means your methods on improving the rendering is actually working out pretty well
18:03 < bridge> <Assa> I know, but the biggest contribution still comes from jupey by implementing vulkan
18:04 < bridge> <Assa> I like how the second worst map became the best over time xD
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> show graphs with entities
18:07 < bridge> <Assa> do you just want to keep my PC busy?
18:07 < bridge> <Assa> @inv41idu53rn4m3 if you want to try yourself: https://github.com/AssassinTee/ddnet-benchmarks
18:08 < bridge> <Assa> and no, I won't rewrite this in rust üëé
18:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> > and ctf1 due to a moderator request
18:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> xd
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no, i am ofc more interested in entities for gemen
18:09 < bridge> <Assa> I am not sure if we want to optimize against this
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ?
18:10 < bridge> <Assa> I can let my PC running when I am at not at home later
18:10 < bridge> <Assa> like I wish more people would actually play without entities
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can have your dream
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's still more interesting for pro play
18:11 < bridge> <Assa> do you want only entities or like 50% overlay?
18:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I prefer not using entities but still end up using entities like 60% of the time :(
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 100% physics
18:14 < bridge> <Assa> yeah ubuntu seems not to work really well rn
18:18 < bridge> <Assa> going to let that run on my latop first and make it more os independend
18:32 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> What where is this ctf1 quote from?
18:32 < bridge> <Assa> from my benchmarking repo, and the moderator is jupey
18:32 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> Ah the benchmark readme
18:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> woah jupi on ctf
18:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I played dm1 today btw
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am a moderator
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sick
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> where can i ban irc bridge
18:37 < bridge> <Assa> should be maintainer and not moderator
18:38 < bridge> <Assa> I keep confusing words with the same starting letter
18:38 < bridge> <Assa> idk why I do that, probably something in how my brain orders stuff
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah some ppl call me jupeyy
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf
18:39 < bridge> <Assa> others call you Arschkeks
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ne
18:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I mean, he does somewhat moderate contributions to the codebase :bluekitty:
18:40 < bridge> <Assa> you are the great bringer of vulkan, our harbinger
18:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> amen
18:45 < bridge> <Assa> laptop is melting on abyss on 17.x :justatest:
18:46 < bridge> <Assa> at least the annoying windows firewall is gone
18:47 < bridge> <b l u e  b e n c i e> ok i will
18:47 < bridge> <Assa> have fun üôÇ the script part is not the slowest part, it's the benchmark collection itself but what do I know
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> hey
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> im alive
19:05 < bridge> <Assa> Hi alive :justatest:

21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> hello
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> are you still
21:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> y
21:23 < bridge> <Ewan> how is it going
21:25 < bridge> <Ewan> https://discourse.nixos.org/t/andurils-threat-is-existential/70811
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's weekend, hurray.
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how bout you
21:34 < bridge> <Ewan> pretty good
21:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i took both the dogs on individual walks
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> epyc
21:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont think my stepmom is taking their dog on walks anymore? she is just relying on me to do it
21:35 < bridge> <Ewan> very annoying
21:35 < bridge> <Ewan> my dog wants to go fast and theirs wants to go very slow
21:35 < bridge> <Ewan> if i go out with both i end up with my arms stretched in opposite directions
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> training
21:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess
21:37 < bridge> <Ewan> youtube seems broken on my computer
21:37 < bridge> <Ewan> before i would search and click on a video, but i think they are using the js history API in a weird way because the url doesn't change when i click a video (it would not load all the way)
21:37 < bridge> <Ewan> now i can't even search
21:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> use freetube
21:38 < bridge> <Ewan> good idea
21:39 < bridge> <Ewan> i wish it was less ugly
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ugly and sometimes loads very long
21:40 < bridge> <Ewan> nvm it's good
21:40 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1428830134894592061/image.png?ex=68f3ed42&is=68f29bc2&hm=7d2c4bf244ec2cc55d7bbc85d3942784be7dcb678ad0bba892c0dbcea8d6d2ed&
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah much better
21:52 < bridge> <Tezcan> Ewan, are you ok
21:53 < bridge> <Ewan> [hi](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1406663602181640212.webp?size=48&name=hi)
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he didnt buy a RGB monitor just to use grey scale
21:58 < bridge> <Assa> seeing this I'd prefer a GB monitor instead :pepeW:
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it looks like this

22:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> joa
22:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did not improveme my life
22:04 < bridge> <Ewan> when is this ai bubble gonna burst man
22:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what makes you think it will burst
22:04 < bridge> <Ewan> the way they fund its development is not sustainable
22:04 < bridge> <Ewan> how can nvidia be worth more than the entire pharmaceutical industry rn
22:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> potential
22:05 < bridge> <Ewan> yes they make very nice and high demand chips but everyone who is buying them is going into debt doing so
22:05 < bridge> <Ewan> and the schmucks that keep paying for it will eventually get wise to what is going on
22:05 < bridge> <Ewan> and even if not it'll rapidly accelerate inflation
22:10 < bridge> <Ewan> you have heard about the roundtripping
22:34 < bridge> <Ewan> did we fix it? :D
22:34 < bridge> <Ewan> @robyt3 the PR of mine that got reverted should do the trick if the build env is up to date
22:35 < bridge> <b l u e  b e n c i e> i thought it was reverted because deen's mingw is old
22:35 < bridge> <Ewan> it did
22:38 < bridge> <robyt3> This problem seems unrelated to `libssp-0.dll` if you mean that PR
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> it is the same
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> not the same DLL but they are both built in now
22:39 < bridge> <robyt3> So we should also not ship `libwinpthread-1.dll` anymore?
22:39 < bridge> <Ewan> i can't test from here but i'm pretty sure
22:40 < bridge> <robyt3> The only reason we have it is for libopusfile AFAICT, so we'd have to recompile that specifically with a newer version
22:40 < bridge> <Ewan> the whole ddnet libs repo is really unneccesary imo
22:40 < bridge> <Ewan> [hi](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1406663602181640212.webp?size=48&name=hi)
22:41 < bridge> <robyt3> Then it wouldn't really be feasible to have the Windows and Android CI
22:42 < bridge> <robyt3> Compiling the libraries in every CI run would take way too long
22:42 < bridge> <b l u e  b e n c i e> i like the libs repo, tho i wish we'd ship mysql/mariadb :PeepoSweat:
22:59 < bridge> <Ewan> don't you use MSYS2
22:59 < bridge> <Ewan> you know that you definitely don't have to do that
22:59 < bridge> <Ewan> msys2 CI is very easy
23:10 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't know if all the libraries are available in MSYS2, but the CI doesn't seem to find them. Building the libraries for Android takes like 30-60 minutes, and you also get rate-limited from downloading/cloning the code after a few attempts
23:12 < bridge> <Ewan> they are
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i can write a script
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> hold on
23:16 < bridge> <robyt3> Then our cmake can't find most of them
23:16 < bridge> <robyt3> I have all the dependencies installed
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't know what to tell you
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> it works just fine for me
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i rarely checkout ddnet libs
23:17 < bridge> <robyt3> `SDL2 not found (using bundled version)`, `mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2-2.32.10-1 is up to date`
23:17 < bridge> <Ewan> which env are you in
23:18 < bridge> <robyt3> mingw64
23:18 < bridge> <robyt3> Some libraries like zlib and ssl can be found
23:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i have been using ucrt64 for a while
23:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i think i touched on the difference but with mingw64 you're just using msvcrt instead of the universal c runtime built into windows
23:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i do not beleive that is hot pink
