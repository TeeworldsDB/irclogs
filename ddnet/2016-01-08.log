12:28 < tyurd> hello. i am running on ubuntu mate 15.10 an have a problem with running teeworlds on fullscreen. dimensions are 1920x1080 and I have two screens. left one dimensions as already said and the right one should be 1080x1024. my problem now is, that teeworlds is in center of both screens instead just on my left screen. does anyone of you know what I have to do, to fix that? thank you.
12:40 < Henningstone> I have exactly the same problem, also Ubuntu (normal, not MATE) 15.10! My screen resolutions are different, but teeworlds is also stuck in the middle of both screens. That is really annoying, so until I know a better solution, I use borderless windows instead of fullscreen, that works for me.
12:41 < tyurd> Same here.
14:11 <@deen> the solution would be sdl2, which is nearly finished for DDNet
14:12 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/305
14:13 < Henningstone> Since 0.7 has SDL2, there is no problem indeed. Happy to hear that it will come for DDNet soon ^-^ But for vanilla 0.6 it really sucks...
