00:40 < eeeee> is ddnet server valgrind-clean atm?
00:44 < Savander> goood night
00:44 < Savander> ;)
00:54 < Spyker> deen, here is a nuub called teeworlds admin who spam and change ip all time, he is insulting artkis dyslate france etc.... can you block him? impossible to play... too much spam
00:54 < Spyker> now like 10 teeworlds admin in the server
00:55 < Spyker> teeworlds admin in nickname
00:56 <@deen> Spyker: hi
00:56 < eeeee> if somebody there has rcon you can just password the server for like 10 minutes, he'll likely get bored and not come back
00:58 <@deen> looks like that guy has a lot of ips
00:59 < Spyker> thanks deen, nice admin... i have to go now bb!
01:00 <@deen> eeeee: ehm, good question. last time i checked was long ago, and I only checked for memory leaks I think. what do you have in mind?
01:00 < eeeee> deen: can you look up some of that guy's ip in http://www.spamhaus.org/lookup/ ?
01:01 < eeeee> i'm interested in how often such people use proxies as opposed to just reconnecting and getting different address from the isp
01:01 <@deen> he's just reconnecting
01:01 < eeeee> how long does it take him to reconnect?
01:02 <@deen> just a second
01:03 < eeeee> about valgrind, it reports some still reachable stuff on mac os (but most of it from *Mach* libs), i was wondering if it's a mac os thing or a known tw issue
01:06 <@deen> how do you run it?
01:06 < eeeee> just valgrind --leak-check=full ./DDNet-Server_x86_64_d
01:07 <@deen> I get a few "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)"
01:08 < eeeee> yeah that thing has been in tw forever
01:08 <@deen> and "Use of uninitialised value of size 8"
01:08 <@deen> in SendPacket
01:08 <@deen> nothing else
01:09 < eeeee> when you stop the server it will report the blocks that weren't freed
01:09 <@deen> oh, right^^
01:09 <@deen> getaddrinfo losing a lot^^
01:10 <@deen> only getaddrinfo
01:10 < eeeee> okay good to know
01:10 <@deen> wait, do they actually get lost or was that a misreport by valgrind?
01:10 <@deen> because leaking 6 KB in a few minutes already would be bad
01:10 < eeeee> i can take a look
01:11 < eeeee> but have to filter out all this macos crap
01:11 <@deen> I remember that I took a look before, just don't remember my conclusion^^
01:11 <@deen> net_host_lookup (system.c:922)
01:12 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/valgrind.txt
01:13 <@deen> should probably call freeaddrinfo() earlier if result != 0
01:13 < eeeee> yep
01:15 <@deen> nope, doesn't change anything
01:16 <@deen> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=116526
01:17 <@deen> hm no, looks fixed^^
01:17 <@deen> it also leaks on mac osx or is it my weird compile of glibc?
01:17 < eeeee> would hope so, it's been >10 years :D
01:17 < eeeee> i also found that in my mac os report 
01:17 <@deen> this looks more recent: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eglibc/+bug/1364584
01:17 < eeeee> will try the freeaddrinfo thing
01:21 < eeeee> yeah doesn't help on mac os as well
01:21 < eeeee> still leaking
01:26 <@deen> it's weird
01:26 <@deen> we use getaddrinfo and freeaddrinfo in the exact same way as in the example in the man page
01:26 <@deen> and the example from the man page does NOT leak according to valgrind
01:26 < eeeee> huh
01:27 < eeeee> maybe it leaks only on specific types of addr
01:27 <@deen> or valgrind is misreporting?
01:28 < eeeee> that's easy to check
01:28 < Learath2> remove all addr related stuff check if it sill leaks ?
01:29 < eeeee> call getaddrinfo and freeaddrinfo over 9000 times and watch the mem usage :P
01:29 < Learath2> or that :D
01:30 < Learath2> for(;;){getaddrinfo(); freeaddrinfo();} 
01:30 <@deen> it couldn't have to do with being C code inside of C++?
01:31 <@deen> I don't know how valgrind works and if it could have problems with that
01:31 < Learath2> YAY autoupdate works finally
01:31 < eeeee> can't you compile your manpage example with c++ and check it?
01:32 <@deen> I did, works as well
01:32 <@deen> Learath2: great!
01:32 < Learath2> deen: needs some tidying up and removing of weird debug messages
01:33 <@deen> getaddrinfo is really weird
01:33 < Learath2> dbg_msg("FUCK", "THIS SHIT %s", aVersion);
01:33 <@deen> if I do "while(1) e = getaddrinfo(host, NULL, &hints, &result);"
01:33 <@deen> it actually leaks memory
01:34 <@deen> if I also call freeaddrinfo it seems to leak as well, for about 30 seconds, and then stops leaking
01:35 < Learath2> thats really weird
01:35 < eeeee> yeah whatever. doesn't sound like something worth wasting time on
01:36 <@deen> I guess that was my old result as well :P
01:37 < eeeee> here's what it looks like on mac os http://pastie.org/private/kzcvgl90henpxuv80unaa
01:40 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/vxnggw
01:40 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 55bfd2c def: Always call freeaddrinfo
10:55 < eeeee> got websocket protocol working in tw server \m/ 
10:56 < eeeee> still has to figure out the net_socket_read_wait part, otherwise ping to localhost is around 35ms :S
11:03 < eeeee> haha also serverbrowser is kinda useless because it takes like a second to negotiate websockets session
13:07 < Nimda> Generic World by Loop just released on Brutal at 2014-12-28 13:07
13:15 <@deen> eeeee: definitely need a cached serverbrowser of ddnet servers :P
17:23 < Learath2> deen: should i restart the client automatically ?
17:23 < Learath2> after an update
17:23 <@deen> Learath2: yes, but give a warning before, as it happens now
17:23 < Learath2> Do you want to restart now ? (Yes) (No) 
17:23 < Learath2> good enough ?
17:24 <@deen> No, before the update even, I think
17:25 <@deen> "An update to DDNet client is available. Do you want to update now? This will restart the client."
17:25 < Learath2> I do already ask before the update deen
17:26 <@deen> ok, good
17:26 <@deen> that should be good enough i think
17:56 <@deen> I made http://ddnet.tw/stats a bit faster
18:00 <@deen> hm, and less accurate^^
18:12 < Nimda> #wontfix by Waschlappen & Broken just released on Moderate at 2014-12-28 18:08
18:54 < Savander> maybe, you should add possibility to choose the date ( e.g. from 2014-12-25 t o 2014-12-28 ) with more accurate stats :P?
19:38 < Muttley> Deen, any interrest for a DDNet NL addition ?
22:43 <@deen> Muttley: hm, ping from Netherland to GER should be pretty good I guess
22:45 < Muttley>  deen i know, but just as an extra ;-)
22:45 <@deen> can you guarantee good ddos protection?
22:45 <@deen> otherwise it would be more of a pain than help
22:45 <@deen> european ddnet servers get ddos attacked a lot
22:49 <@deen> So, 2 people have their computer beeping at random times in DDNet client
22:49 <@deen> anyone know what that is?
22:53 < Savander> keyboard failure?
22:55 < eeeee> bell character in console?
23:06 <@deen> eeeee: aaaah, that would be fun!
23:07 <@deen> eeeee: Maybe someone is running around and spamming bell character on all servers!
23:07 <@deen> should probably just filter that out 
23:27 <@deen> Savander: ideally ddnet.tw/stats would use highstock with dynamically loaded data. not sure if that's worth all the work though^^
23:27 < Savander> in counter-strike 1.6 you was able to open cdrom
23:27 <@deen> Savander: haha
23:27 < Savander> rlt
23:27 < Savander> rly
23:27 < Savander> via server
23:27 < Savander> :P
23:28 <@deen> something like this: http://www.highcharts.com/stock/demo/lazy-loading
23:28 <@deen> you can zoom in and it loads more data
23:28 < Savander> yeee
23:28 < Savander> in google stats it looks simillar ;d
23:29 <@deen> if you can translate ddnet.tw/stats to work like that I'd be glad^^
23:30 < eeeee> bell character might not be malicious, maybe unicode support is just broken in terminal and it sees 0x07 (or whatever the BEL code is) which is actually part of some unicode character
23:30 <@deen> sigh, right
23:30 <@deen> we *did* change the unicode stuff in windows recently
23:30 <@deen> there was a pull request by bear
23:31 <@deen> ah no, by heinrich5991 
23:31 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/92cdb156794496b27a709face5df28f7090ee0fc
