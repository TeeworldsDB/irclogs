09:23 <@deen> Cool, my old university :D > ~c0d3d3v@nat-wh-nan.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de
14:02 <@deen> Yesterday 281 races were finished on DDNet, lowest number since March 31, 2014!
14:04 <+laxadedi> well, only brutal maps are released
14:04 <+laxadedi> !stats
14:06 <@deen> no, servers were getting hammered with DoS attacks
14:08 <@deen> the most recent release even was a 1 star oldschool map
19:09 <@Nimda> Looney by ☆.Sυsнι♪ just released on Novice at 2016-10-12 19:02
19:57 <+laxa> I am getting DDOS also
19:57 <+laxa> since more than 1 hour
19:57 <+laxa> small ddos, but having huge loss on my server atm
19:57 <+laxa> I don't know how I can figure anything about the attack
19:59 <@EastByte> well, what's the network load of your server?
20:00 <@EastByte> if the traffic rate is not near to the limit, it's probably the ddos-protection causing packet-loss
20:01 <@EastByte> in which case there really is no way to get information about the attack :p
20:52 <+laxa> EastByte: alright, thank you :)
22:13 <+luca> so anoying if you wanna play tw
22:22 <+laxa> turns out I am being ddos by UDP on TS3 server
22:24 <+ochristi> :s
22:25 <+laxa> since 18h40
22:25 <+laxa> ddnet still under ddos ?
22:27 <+luca> since days i guess? always if i wanna play, the servers are lagging
22:28 <+luca> For me from 18:00 not playable any more
22:29 <+c0d3d3v> luca:  Maybe thats a local problem ^^ where do you live ?
22:30 <+luca> livin in germany...bute using some vpn :D
22:30 <+luca> Ye it maybe is...but it feels like iddos
22:31 <+c0d3d3v> Ich glaube wenn du mit VPN zockst ist es normal dass es laggt ^^
22:33 <+c0d3d3v> Why do you play with VPN ?
22:37 <@deen> c0d3d3v: hi
22:37 <@deen> c0d3d3v: i studied at KIT
22:40 <+c0d3d3v> deen:  Is your brother Daniel Fe***ng ?
22:40 <@deen> yeah
22:40 <+Henningstone> wow, censoring that out was the most useless thing ever. Who doesn't know deen's name? :o
22:41 <+c0d3d3v> deen:  I study now with him at the DHBW :) 
22:41 <@deen> hey, not everyone can do a "whois ddnet.tw"
22:41 <+Henningstone> :3
22:42 <@deen> c0d3d3v: cool
22:42 <+c0d3d3v> :P deen did not post his full name here in the IRC ... so why should I do it 
22:43 <+Henningstone> also true... but you post your own full name apparently ;)
22:43 <+c0d3d3v> yop
22:46 <+c0d3d3v> deen Did you finish your Master at the KIT ?
22:46 <@deen> yeah
22:49 <+c0d3d3v> for which company do you work now?
22:49 <@deen> SAP in Walldorf, see also http://felsin9.de/nnis btw
22:50 <+Henningstone> there! he did it! I see his name right on my screen :S
22:59 <+fstd> that .de/nnis is a cute idea
23:01 <+c0d3d3v> true  :3
23:02 <+fstd> makes me want to have the domain fs.td again :(
23:02 <@deen> 2 letters, nice
23:02 <+fstd> (impossible since td.'s policy is that 2nd level domains have to be at least 3 characters long...)
23:04 <@deen> that reminds me that i wanted hook.racing
23:05 <@deen> but too expensive
23:07 <+fstd> mhm
23:07 <+fstd> lol now td.'s registrar is even offline
23:07 <+fstd> supposed to be http://www.sotel.td according to IANA
23:08 <+fstd> sotel.td isn't even a domain, wtf
23:11 <+fstd> so it's nic.td now.  can someone speaking french confirm that this:
23:11 <+fstd> Comment enregistrer un nom de domaine?
23:11 <+fstd> Page en cours de construction...
23:11 <+fstd> means what i think it means?
23:12 <@deen> looks very professional
23:30 <+c0d3d3v> deen:  what is your opinion  to the elixir lang?
23:32 <@deen> haven't used it
23:51 <+laxa> fstd: hum ?
23:51 <+laxa> Comme enregistrer un nom de domaine => how to register a domain name 
23:52 <+laxa> Page en cours de construction => Page under construction
