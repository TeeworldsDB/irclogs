03:46 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> @Learath2 i think i invest 10 bucks
03:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> can you pls go hack an exchange or sth so it starts dipping so I can get more
12:13 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> create own coin

13:05 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> hehe tru
15:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> New DDNet Client update with ingame Miner! Earn Points for finishing maps is oldschool, earn points for mining!
15:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :D!
16:04 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> Isn't that why TW client always used 100% cpu?
16:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> üòÆ
16:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://hastebin.com/exaxevurir.sql
16:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> seems like i get an error when cmake downloades googletest
16:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> seems like i get an error when cmake downloads googletest
16:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki this should fix it: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/959
16:19 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> nag @Learath2 about it if you want it merged
16:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> you should also add a option to specifically dissable gtest
16:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> option(DOWNLOAD_GTEST "Download and compile GTest" OFF) #${AUTO_DEPENDENCIES_DEFAULT})
16:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> instead of using autodeps
16:19 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> -DDOWNLOAD_GTEST OFF
16:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> uh
16:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> -DDOWNLOAD_GTEST=OFF
16:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> to much typing
16:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> or disable it in the config
16:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> then wait for the PR
16:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ill wait for it
16:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> disabled gtest for now
16:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> üôÇ
16:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> üëç
16:20 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: was it not disabled as default?
16:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> not on windows
16:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> because no windows user is going to have deps installed
16:21 <+Learath2> is it disabled as default with the PR?
16:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> no
16:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but it fails gracefully if it doesn't work
16:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> i.e. it will not hinder compilation of the rest
16:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> also idk why it fails to compile
16:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> or wathever
16:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> your git seems broken
16:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> look at the error message
16:21 <+Learath2> doesn't make sense to me, you want to do tests you either do -DDOWNLOAD_GTEST=ON or have gtest, if not make test failing makes more sense
16:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> git submodule does not work as expected
16:21 <+Learath2> then cmake failing
16:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> git version 2.14.1.windows.1
16:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> is this outdated?
16:22 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I don't know
16:22 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: cmake won't fail with the new PR
16:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> well latest is 2.15
16:22 <@heinrich5991> but it'll still allow people to run tests without doing any configuration on windows
16:22 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: but it still runs gtest related steps
16:23 <@heinrich5991> yes
16:23 <@heinrich5991> only on first run or when CMakeLists.txt changes
16:23 <@heinrich5991> afk for quite some time :)
16:24 <+Learath2> many people building don't care about the tests tho :/
16:24 <@heinrich5991> so where's the problem?
16:24 <@heinrich5991> it will download gtest
16:24 <+Learath2> they are getting the steps done whether they like it or not :D
16:24 <@heinrich5991> yes
16:24 <@heinrich5991> they can configure it if they care
16:24 <@heinrich5991> anyway, afk for quite some time
16:24 <+Learath2> sure, i'll merge it
16:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> hmm
16:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> seems like running it 2 times made it work
16:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> all so weird
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> 
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/385453389443497984/Screenshot_4.png
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> this opengl 3.3 error still there :o
18:34 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> @deen i compiled with bam now, no more floating point effects <34
18:34 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> @deen i compiled with bam now, no more floating point effects ‚ù§
18:36 <@deen> weird, so cmake is passing wrong parameters
18:36 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> on windows btw
18:36 <@deen> probably a log from cmake build would help us
18:36 <@deen> and from bam
18:37 <@deen> so that we can compare
18:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Konsti> @ZimE delete Windows, use Linux :feelsgoodman:
18:42 <+nemo2> heh. I keep windows around even though I've been a 100% linux user since 2001
18:42 <+nemo2> just in case I need to return the laptop really
18:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> woah, in 2001 I had first computer
18:43 <+nemo2> seems silly to throw away something with some marginal value.  So I go into windows, turn off as many services as I can, turn off restore points, remove swap, turn on full drive compression, uninstall any preinstalled stuff.
18:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> without network connection D:
18:43 <+nemo2> Then defrag
18:43 <+nemo2> and then shrink the partition down
18:43 <+nemo2> used to be I could defrag in safe mode but that seems no longer possible
18:43 <+nemo2> usually gets windows down to like 20 gigs or so. still a waste of space but, eh...
18:44 <+nemo2> Savander: heh.  my very very first laptop was bought for me by my mom in 1996 ‚ò∫  my very very first computer tho was a trash-80
18:44 <+nemo2> (TRS-80)
18:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i was born in 1996.
18:44 <+nemo2> O_o
18:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :D:D
18:44  * nemo2 feels old
18:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> wew im from 2000
18:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> that special year
18:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I remember, that we had windows 95 in these times
18:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> And noone from my family, knows about Linux
18:46 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> u are never 2000 @RyO's xd
18:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ?
18:46 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> u are never 2000 @Ryozuki  xd
18:46 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ur like 25 yrs old m8
18:46 <+nemo2> heh.  there was a time I had every DOS command memorised. was super scornful of wyswig document tools. wp51 for-ever who would ever want a tool where your formatting marks are invisible
18:46 <+nemo2> but did end up on windows for a few years
18:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i'm from 2000 want it or not
18:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ü§∑
18:46 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> fake news
18:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> im never older than u lel
18:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> why not?
18:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> because it feels wrong
18:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> xd
18:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Does it matter ?!  üòÉ
18:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i guess no ._.
18:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> not my fault i'm from 2000 :D
18:48 <+nemo2> Savander: you know, my first (crappy) game program is almost a decade older than you ‚ò∫  I was showing it to heinrich5991 the other day. 
18:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ohh i want to see it too
18:48 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> lal
18:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like from 1986 ?
18:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I mean, it's very interesting
18:49 <+nemo2> https://m8y.org/maze.bas
18:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It was hard to learn program those days
18:49 <+nemo2> actually. not a decade older... more like... hm.
18:49 <+nemo2> 6 years older I guess
18:49 <+nemo2> hard to say. rescued it from an old floppy and didn't note down the date
18:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Understandable
18:49 <+nemo2> still runs fine in dosbox + qbasic ‚ò∫
18:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think, in Poland
18:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it was pretty hard to has computer in 90s
18:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yeah my fathers didn't even had one
18:50 <+nemo2> there was a real incentive to learn to program at the time since my first DOS PC had exactly 2 games
18:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> pretty expensive
18:50 <+nemo2> nibbles and gorillas
18:50 <+nemo2> so made games out of sheer boredom w/ the options
18:51 <+nemo2> It was neat that nibbles and gorillas were so easily modifiable tho - could learn basic just by screwing with their code
18:51 <+nemo2> we'd make like overpowered bananas and weird cities
18:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> What was the language, you used in your maze?
18:51 <+nemo2> BASIC
18:51 <+nemo2> it's not really a maze
18:52 <+nemo2> I was a kid. didn't know maze algorithms
18:52 <+nemo2> enemy is not very smart either
18:53 <+nemo2> Savander: if you really wanna try it can help you get qbi, send me a /msg ‚ò∫
18:53 <+nemo2> no idea what network you are on right now
18:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> The problem is, that i don't  have IRC just discord üòõ no /msg func
18:54 <+nemo2> ah
18:54 <+nemo2> oh well
18:54 <+nemo2> Savander:  https://hedgewars.org
18:54 <+nemo2> use the chat link on the header ‚ò∫
18:54 <+nemo2> and. IRC foreva
18:54 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/yw0wi/b72699a706.png
18:54 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> xd
18:54 <+nemo2> yeah. that was my win screen
18:54 <+nemo2> I was an angsty youngster at the time
18:55 <+nemo2> I'm sure I thought it was edgy
18:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> haha
18:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I will, but later üòÉ I have to go now
18:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> how old r u nemo2? o.O
18:55 <+nemo2> apparently a lot older than you kids üòù
18:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ikr
18:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but how old?
18:56 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> .____.
18:56 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> do u still play teewoods nemo2?
18:56 <+nemo2> I do in fact play teeworlds, sometiems
18:56 <+nemo2> ddnet was new
18:56 <+nemo2> heinrich5991 introduced me to it last week
18:56 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> thats kewl
18:56 <+nemo2> is more fun than teeworlds IMO
18:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but, I have to say. That I will never call myself as a Programmer. To be honest üòÑ At least, not in next 10 years
18:57 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> teeworlds is more fun than teeworlds?
18:57 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> gg
18:57 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> is ur teewoods name also nemo2?
18:57 <+nemo2> well. heinrich5991 only showed me one map
18:57 <+nemo2> but it was more puzzle/strategy than teeworlds was
18:57 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> teeworlds = teeworlds mate
18:57 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> xd
18:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think, you talking about modification to teeworlds, DDRace
18:58 <+nemo2> yes
18:58 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> its still teeworlds el
18:58 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> its still teeworlds lel
18:58 <+nemo2> well. code has forked
18:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> That's right, it's more interesting
18:58 <+nemo2> reason I'm addicted to Hedgewars and still contributing code after a decade is that the strategy aspect.
18:58 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i can play it with vanillla teewoods client
18:58 <+nemo2> teeworlds I mostly just jumped around and shot wildly
18:58 <+nemo2> maybe wasn't very good at it
18:58 <+nemo2> but didn't hold my attention as well
18:59 <+nemo2> this fork seems a lot more fun
18:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Teeworlds is pretty hard to skill up
18:59 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> it is
18:59 <+nemo2> heh.
18:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think, that's why people stay to this game for a longer period
18:59 <+nemo2> he did have to explain to me how to get through the maze
18:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Like, I started with Teeworlds 10 years ago
18:59 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ur tw player since 10 yrs?
18:59 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> lel
18:59 <+nemo2> it's also probably just I've never been a huge fan of RTS as a genre
19:00 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> thats long
19:00 <+nemo2> I normally play TBS and RTS
19:00 <+nemo2> er
19:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yes, in 2008 in january or so..
19:00 <+nemo2> not a huge fan of *FPS* as a genre
19:00 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> kewl
19:00 <+nemo2> typo
19:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Starcraft 1?
19:00 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> dooldejump
19:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or less dynamic?
19:01 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> doodlejump
19:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I used to play StarCraft 2, it was very fun time
19:01 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> if i edit messages they dont get fixed in irc chat am i right?
19:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but a bit to fast imo
19:01 <+nemo2> I do like starcraft
19:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Yes, bot will send next message
19:01 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> if i edit messages they dont get fixed in irc chat am i right? (EDIT: hellu nemo2 can u hear me? o.O)
19:01 <+nemo2> at the time starcraft came out I switched quickly to total annihilation
19:01 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon every time you edit your message, the bot will resend it
19:02 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ah kk
19:02 <+nemo2> which had waaaaay better mechanics
19:02 <+nemo2> Spring is the FOSS version of that these days
19:02 <+nemo2> and warcraft ofc before starcraft
19:02 <+nemo2> I lost a warcraft tournament in college due to final battle being same day as date w/ SO ‚ò∫
19:03 <+nemo2> If you guys are up for TA:Spring btw would be happy to update my build.  
19:03 <+nemo2> haven't played it in a little while
19:03 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> basic sytnax looks great btw nemo2
19:03 <+nemo2> basic syntax of?
19:04 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> nemo: afk again :/ can talk about crosscompilation this evening maybe?
19:04 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ur game
19:04 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> maze.bas
19:04 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: oh. that'd be great
19:04 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/yw0RQ/b693d08bf9.png
19:04 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: yeah you saw we had an OSX user asking again
19:04 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> especially that
19:04 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> what is it doing?
19:04 <+nemo2> ChillerDragon: just some win or loss graphic I imagine
19:04 <+nemo2> ChillerDragon: /msg me and you can try it ‚ò∫ 
19:05 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> /msg
19:05 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> xd
19:05 <+nemo2> I'm obv kinda proud and embarassed of my kid code at same time
19:05 <+nemo2> you can see for example I didn't really grasp functions
19:05 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> im to lazy to install some haxxor embedded alien system dos machine
19:05 <+nemo2> O_o
19:05 <+nemo2> sudo apt-get install dosbox
19:05 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> sudo apt-get unilstall windows_fucking_10
19:05 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> xd
19:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> virtualbox
19:06 <+nemo2> that's a good start
19:06 <+nemo2> or dualboot
19:06 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> nono
19:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I used to have dualboot
19:06 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i prefer buying new hardware for new os
19:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> never used linux
19:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :D:D
19:06 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> 1 os = 1 hardware
19:06 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> or lill chillidreguhn gez crazy
19:07 <+nemo2> Savander: why not buy like an intel NUC?
19:07 <+nemo2> Savander: or... just a dirt cheap laptop - there were some very functional blackfriday deals for laptops at around $150
19:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Yea, but actually im looking for first job after school
19:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and in Poland, those "cheap laptopts"
19:07 <+nemo2> if it can run windows 10 it can sure as hell run linux
19:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> are pretty exepensive
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> due to our salary
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> üòõ P
19:08 <+nemo2> raspberry pi or NUC then
19:09 <+nemo2> there's a lot of cheap arm-based computing these days
19:09 <+nemo2> so long as you have a screen to plug it into
19:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Probably I will try someday
19:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I was thinking about raspberry
19:10 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i have nuu screen
19:11 <+nemo2> hm. I wonder if teeworlds could run on gaming consoles
19:12 <+nemo2> seems from its design to be less memory intensive than hedgewars
19:12 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: isn't pixel based right?
19:12 <+nemo2> our biggest mem cost is the collision array and land textures
19:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i think it's square + circles
23:45 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: yes, we're tile-based
23:46 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: how do you save the collision? tightly packed?
23:48 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: collision is simply a 2 byte array.  so a traditional 1024x2048 map uses 4 megs of RAM
23:48 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: whiiiich nowdays is really not that much ‚ò∫
23:49 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: we did in fact get it running on first generation iphone. although with 1024x1024 map limit - I think we could probably have done 2048x1024 tho
23:50 <+nemo2> Maps/ClimbHome/mask.png: PNG image data, 2048 x 32768, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced
23:50 <+nemo2> that's the most extreme one so far
23:50 <+nemo2> 128MiB of RAM to load
23:51 <@heinrich5991> why is it a two-byte array?
23:51 <+nemo2> as opposed to what
23:52 <+nemo2> It used to be 4 bytes, I decided to crank it down since we didn't actually need that many
23:52 <@heinrich5991> 1 byte?
23:52 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: ah. no. it stores terrain type

23:54 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: things are actually getting a bit tight as it is
23:54 <+eeeee> in teewebs i had an optimization to only store the game layer as a bitmap (for fast collision tests), and all other layers as rle packed since rendering scans them sequentially and overhead is not that large for that
23:57 <+nemo2> eeeee: yeah. we actually have 2 arrays. one for rendering and one for collision
23:58 <+nemo2> we've considered RLE for the non-collision one, but haven't bothered yet
23:58 <+eeeee> would be nice to research better data structures for collision as well
23:58 <+nemo2> eeeee: actually we are rather wasteful since we have 2 bytes for the collision terrain flags, and 4 bytes for the pixel data
23:59 <+nemo2> eeeee: in addition though there's also the gl textures
23:59 <+nemo2> but at least we don't create those for empty areas
23:59 <+nemo2> the one we should crank down is the pixel data. RLE would help there.
23:59 <+nemo2> at this point probably won't get fixed tho
