00:05 <@deen> "Lets pretend that a church or daycare decides to have a LAN party for the kids there. Lets also pretend that the church and/or daycare follows Free Software values. Assuming that they want to use a game which is completely FOSS, there are only a couple of choices for LAN. Because of the WTF emotion, Teeworlds won't be one of them"
00:05 <@deen> ok^^
00:06 <@deen> "If the group decides to edit the emotions graphic file but not edit the code, then although the game will be clean for them, the kids might want to download the game for themselves. When they play the game they will notice the WTF symbol and wonder what it means. Their innocence is lost shortly after..."
00:06 <@deen> pure comedy
00:06 < Savander> lol
00:08 <@deen> "oh, and we should remove also all weapons, they are cruel."

00:31 < Savander> good night !:) :D
00:36 <@heinrich5991> deen: in case you're still here, it should be fixed now ._.
00:37 <@deen> heinrich5991: hi =)
00:37 <@heinrich5991> hi :)
00:37 <@heinrich5991> (not rebased though)
00:37 <@deen> want to rebase?
00:37 <@deen> or should i do it?
00:37 <@heinrich5991> I'll do it, unless you absolutely like rebasing ^^
00:38 <@deen> no, i don't
00:38 <@deen> go ahead, I'll try to find the next bug
00:38 <@heinrich5991> ok :)
00:38 <@heinrich5991> rebase onto master I suppose, not sdl2-try3?
00:38 <@deen> right, master
00:38 <@deen> sdl2 will not be in the next release
00:38 <@heinrich5991> k
00:45 <@deen> still have to figure out the mouse problems
00:45 <@deen> i really like that the same key bindings work with any keyboard layout now
00:45 <@deen> not in tw 0.7 sdl2, but ddnet, fixed that today
00:58 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Chairn opened pull request #306: Added custom background in entities mod. (master...pr_custom_background) http://git.io/vshHF
01:00 < Chairn> custom_background pr created ^^
01:00 <@deen> we saw, while you were away :P
01:00 < Chairn> yeah, got a timeout while writing the pr :o
01:02 < Chairn> i didnt found any bug, but there may be some ^^
01:21 <@deen> ok, heinrich5991's PR still buggy for me =/
01:26 <@heinrich5991> this is not the code quality I want to be known for :<
01:38 <@deen> Chairn: i made some comments, all in all pretty cool
01:41 < Chairn> about menu, i was thinking that it starts to be pretty full on ddnet page :D
01:41 < Chairn> but ill look into it
01:45 <@deen> well, we could split it into a new menu
01:45 <@deen> or remove stuff no one uses
01:55 < Chairn> about reusing, yes indeed, and i think its really easy
02:02 < Chairn> i think we can merge Cmapimages and cmaplayers
02:03 < Chairn> its not used anywhere else than gameclient
07:08 < chairn> tw ui is insane
13:01 <@heinrich5991> deen: rebased and ready to go
13:01 <@heinrich5991> sorry it took so long
13:01 <@deen> heinrich5991: i'll take another look!
13:01 <@deen> no worries and thanks for all the good work

13:10 < uchar> hi!
13:10 <@deen> hi uchar ^^
13:11 <@heinrich5991> hi :)
13:11 <@heinrich5991> what's up?
13:11 < uchar> how go greenlight (tthe super hero)?¿
13:11 < uchar> hi heinrich5991 & deen... pssss i'm a litle bored..
13:11 < uchar> litle best bit?
13:11 < uchar> :\
13:11 < uchar> xD
13:12 <@deen> fewer yes votes on steam now, not sure if we'll make it
13:12 <@heinrich5991> average top 100 is fewer yes votes than no votes though
13:13 <@heinrich5991> I believe that's normal
13:13 < uchar> yeah and only have two days on green no?
13:13 <@heinrich5991> so far only two days on greenlight
13:13 < uchar> time to time... the goal isn't impossible
13:15 < uchar> but.. i prefer a best "plugin" system on teeworlds that upload all "good" mod of the game to steam
13:15 < uchar> :B
13:15 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 13 new commits to master: http://git.io/vGvgj
13:15 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master a3246ed heinrich5991: Save the config into the map when the server loads the map
13:15 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 7bd0f27 SushiTee: saving server settings within the map and loading them on init
13:15 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master c025dc2 SushiTee: saving server settings within the map and loading them on init
13:15 <@heinrich5991> uchar: perhaps ddnet can become this :)
13:16 <@heinrich5991> I doubt you'll convince the teeworlds devs, but I'm sure you could try with deen :P
13:16 < uchar> xD
13:16 <@EastByte> deen: only need to figure out how the scrollbar works, then I think I'm done
13:16 <@deen> EastByte: yay, release coming closer
13:16 < uchar> teeworlds devs = Oy no? or exists other "official" devs?
13:17 <@heinrich5991> uchar: the only guy with access to the source code = oy
13:17 < uchar> oy its a friend of Magnus?
13:17 < uchar> uh?
13:17 < uchar> xD
13:17 <@heinrich5991> uchar: people who would have a say in that â€“ more people :)
13:18 <@heinrich5991> he also developed teeworlds when matricks was the main developer
13:18 < uchar> ajam..
13:18 < uchar> i don't know the "history" of Oy and teeworlds xD
13:19 <@deen> heinrich5991: i tried it but i want to make sure: when a server is old version and can't open maps with config included, it will still run perfectly fine (except without config of course)?
13:20 <@heinrich5991> deen: yes
13:20 <@deen> great
13:20 <@heinrich5991> it's just a new field in the CMapItemInfo struct
13:20 <@heinrich5991> the old servers just ignore it
13:21 <@deen> ah, only the .cfg is used, not .map.cfg, right?
13:21 <@deen> for ddnet that's fine, but other people might call it .map.cfg (haven't seen anyone do that)
13:21 <@heinrich5991> .map.cfg is for your map specific non-game config
13:22 <@heinrich5991> which I thought you needed for ddnet
13:22 <@deen> yeah, i do
13:22 <@deen> it's alright for me, just wondering
13:22 <@heinrich5991> I display a warning and a hint
13:23 <@heinrich5991> can't execute game command ...
13:23 <@heinrich5991> hint: try putting it into map.cfg instead of map.map.cfg
13:23 <@deen> great
13:27 <@deen> heinrich5991: hm. there's always a .map.temp.pid file created, but it's empty?
13:27 <@deen> and it's never removed
13:29 <@heinrich5991> yea. no problem should arise due to that. will fix it so it doesn't create the file
13:40 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #307: Fix temp file creation in case no temp file is needed (master...pr_ddnet_map_settings_no_temp_file) http://git.io/vGvie
13:40 <@heinrich5991> deen: ^
13:50 <@EastByte> deen: http://eastbit.net/priv/27_Aug-15-13_49.png
13:50 <@EastByte> good so far?
13:51 <@EastByte> maybe a different format for the date
13:55 <@deen> yes, 2014-04-09 12:34:51
13:56 <@deen> not sure why TW stores it in such a weird way, at the bottom in "Created" as well
13:56 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/vGv7Q

13:56 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 53cb4d0 Dennis Felsing: Merge pull request #307 from heinrich5991/pr_ddnet_map_settings_no_temp_file...
13:59 <@EastByte> Probably because of alphabetical sorting
14:00 <@deen> my format sorts well too
14:04 <@EastByte> But it has chars you dont wanna have in filenames
14:05 <@deen> i don't mean the entries in filename
14:07 <@EastByte> well matricks probably was too lazy to add another str_timestamp function
14:07 <@EastByte> or whoever worked on demos
14:07 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vGvNg
14:07 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 37812d9 def: Use map config in Kobra 4
14:07 <@EastByte> so are we replacing/converting all map files now?
14:08 <@deen> I'm doing that now I think
14:10 <@heinrich5991> it should basically be a ./config_store_d <all map files>
14:13 <@EastByte> one commit per convert would be crazy :p
14:13 <@deen> well, so far i can't compile config_stor^^
14:13 <@deen> on the server at least
14:14 <@deen> lots of errors with websocket
14:14 <@deen> dunno why websockets even gets pulled in there
14:16 <@deen> cleaned the bam.lua and objs and it worked
14:17 <@deen> ok, running now, this will take some time on this slow server
14:26 <@deen> oh well, have to do it again, config_store doesn't overwrite files it has no write permissions on^^
14:28 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vGfIP
14:28 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master d8a93ec def: Add config_store and config_retrieve to releases
14:28 <@deen> EastByte: we also need to adapt the release process a bit to store the map config
14:29 <@EastByte> hm
14:29 < Savander> what is it?
14:29 < Savander> what it does?
14:41 <@EastByte> it is something and it does things
14:41 < Savander> cool
14:41 <@EastByte> storing map configs inside of the mapfile
14:54 < o_be_one> hellow :)
14:54 <@EastByte> hi
15:05 <@deen> heinrich5991: more bugs!
15:05 <@heinrich5991> what kind of bugs?
15:05 <@deen> Stereotype 3.map with a config just saying sv_pauseable 1
15:06 <@deen> and the config doesn't get stores
15:06 <@deen> stored*
15:06 <@heinrich5991> does it have a newline at end of file?
15:06 <@deen> even though sv_pauseable is CFGFLAG_GAME
15:06 <@deen> yes
15:07 <@heinrich5991> (whether sv_pausable if CFGFLAG_GAME should not matter in theory, the tool views the config as an array of lines)
15:08 <@heinrich5991> deen: and the output of the config_store command is just normal, config_retrieve however says that nothing was there?
15:09 <@deen> config_retrieve doesn'T say anything, but doesn't produce a cfg file, right
15:09 <@heinrich5991> is the map and the config in the repo?
15:09 <@heinrich5991> (the map repo?)
15:09 <@deen> yes
15:09 <@deen> well, i just removed the configs, haha
15:10 <@deen> but i think this is a more general problem
15:12 <@deen> because i see this on many maps
15:12 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east opened pull request #308: Sorting demos by name and date (Column listbox) (master...mapsort) http://git.io/vGf5f
15:15 <@heinrich5991> deen: that a config is not stored at all? only one-line configs getting hurt?
15:15 < Shiki_> EastByte: could you please attach ui screenshots to your PR? I'm really curious how it looks but have no access to machine on which I can compile the client :(
15:15 <@deen> it's not stored at all, i tried with 2 lines, also didnt'work
15:16 <@EastByte> Shiki_: I will
15:16 < Shiki_> nice, thanks!
15:16 <@deen> heinrich5991: maybe it's because these maps are really old and have some other format
15:16 <@deen> i've only seen it on old maps
15:17 <@heinrich5991> thanks, that's a hint
15:17 <@deen> Yeah, Kobra 4 works reliably, Stereotype 3 not
15:17 <@heinrich5991> it's probably on maps which don't have a MapItemInfo yet
15:17 <@deen> i guess I could load and save those maps in editor
15:17 <@heinrich5991> didn't consider that. will fix it
15:17 <@deen> thanks
15:18 <@EastByte> Shiki_: updated
15:18 <@deen> yep, after a load-save in editor it works
15:18 < Shiki_> thanks!
15:19 <@deen> EastByte: thanks for fixing the Created date too =)
15:19 <@EastByte> no problem :)
15:19 <@deen> EastByte: but filenames are still stores with 2014-06-27_23-19-37 right?
15:19 <@EastByte> yes
15:19 <@deen> because we indeed don't want spaces and colons in our filenames
15:19 <@heinrich5991> colons are not even allowed on windows
15:20 <@EastByte> we have str_timestamp_ex() now (accepts custom date and date format as parameter)
15:21 < Shiki_> hm, can't see it in the code -- does it use stable sort?
15:22 < o_be_one> !help
15:22 <@deen> yay, now we have everything for a release!
15:22 <@deen> have to test EastByte's PR
15:23 <@EastByte> not sure, I just modified the < operator to suite for sorting by date
15:23 < Shiki_> ah, ok
15:23 < o_be_one> arf too bad that we cant get server information by nimda :/
15:23 <@deen> i don't think i've ever compiled ddnet as often as in the last 2 days
15:23 <@deen> switching between branches and recompiling all day
15:24 <@EastByte> laxa, add server info requests pls
15:24 < Shiki_> I noticed that sorting on tabs in serverbrowser isn't stable, I hope the one on demobrowser is
15:25 <@EastByte> not sure what stable means
15:25 <@deen> EastByte: works great for me
15:25 < o_be_one> is there an online TW server list ?
15:25 < Shiki_> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability
15:25 <@EastByte> o_be_one: my json api: http://ebeur.eastbit.net:8888/server/95.172.92.151/8303/
15:26 < o_be_one> nice :)
15:26 < o_be_one> could do the job for what i want
15:26 <@EastByte> nice
15:27 <@deen> ddos attack numbers are really down since the GER block servers are gone
15:27 <@EastByte> and since I set up super cool filters
15:27 <@deen> oh, you did?^
15:27 < o_be_one> thank you EastByte i wanted to know how many players i have on V3R, cause from yesterday idk why they all are back in my server oO
15:27 <@deen> o_be_one: my educated guess would be that the other server was ddosed and null-routed
15:28 < o_be_one> deen: i'm able to check how many ddos i get on my servers ...
15:28 <@EastByte> deen: the latest one were the tcp ack rate limit filter
15:28 <@deen> but last attack was 5 days ago
15:28 <@deen> that's pretty great
15:28 < o_be_one> deen: yes probably, i'll get a game ddos soon, i'm talking about it with my manager
15:28 <@EastByte> yep
15:28 < Savander> maybe because 
15:28 < Savander> a lot of newcomers
15:28 < Savander> and they fill blockers too!
15:28 < Savander> HA!
15:29 <@EastByte> o_be_one: WolfAlex is waiting for MC-32, wanna reserve one for him? :p
15:29 < o_be_one> well ive just got one attack 20 days ago on V3R, hope it will continue to stay stable
15:29 < Savander> EastByte, isPlayer in your api means
15:30 < Savander> Playing / spectator
15:30 < Savander> ?
15:30 < o_be_one> lol EastByte unfortunetly i cant i think ^^ but theres a "availability monitor" online ive seen
15:30 <@EastByte> Savander: haha, I don't know
15:30 <@EastByte> I guess ingame playing
15:31 < Savander> lol
15:31 < o_be_one> maybe we can ask to Nimda owner to add a way to ask to EastByte api for server info ?
15:31 <@EastByte> I just did, laxa:
15:31 < o_be_one> x)
15:32 < Savander> yes EastByte 
15:32 < Savander> spectator/playing

15:35 <@EastByte> ehm, what to display?
15:35 <@deen> for people who can't refresh server browser for example and want to search for their friends
15:35 <@deen> all servers :P
15:35 <@EastByte> ah
15:35 <@deen> with players
15:36 < o_be_one>  deen but to shown only ddnet servers or all servers ?
15:36 < o_be_one> oh
15:36 < o_be_one> ok all servers
15:36 < o_be_one> awesome :D

15:37 <@EastByte> o_be_one: recently fixed a bug
15:37 <@EastByte> works again
15:37 <@deen> o_be_one: on ddnet.tw it says "Try it out in your brower"
15:37 < o_be_one> ok nice :)
15:40 <@deen> damn, this DDNet release will be big
15:41 <@EastByte> o_be_one: have you kept your ddnet servers uptodate?
15:42 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: that broke my browser
15:42 <@heinrich5991> it just kept resetting my mouse to the middle of the screen
15:42 <@heinrich5991> after I closed the tab
15:42 <@deen> heinrich5991: yeah, it does that^^
15:42 <@EastByte> it's eeeee's client
15:42 <@deen> i would consider that a browser bug though
15:43 <@EastByte> I just need to press escape to get out
15:43 <@EastByte> but the mouse catching still is shitty
15:44 <@deen> heinrich5991: is it easy to fix?
15:44 <@deen> (the config_store problem)

15:58 <@deen> then only a whitelist of vanilla skins is shown
15:59 < WolfAlex> ah nice! thx
15:59 <@deen> heinrich5991: i found another bug :P
15:59 <@heinrich5991> ok
15:59 <@heinrich5991> what's the next bug? :)
15:59 <@deen> when i run ./config_store for each map, it says "configs coincide"
15:59 <@deen> but if i pass multiple maps, that stops working for many maps
16:00 <@heinrich5991> it says that if you pass the maps individually but not if you pass them together?
16:00 <@deen> yes
16:00 <@heinrich5991> that's weird
16:00 <@deen> if i pass them together, it updates the map again and again
16:00 <@heinrich5991> they should be completely separated ^^
16:01 <@deen> I also couldn't figure it out in the source code yet
16:01 <@deen> You can test it with Aim 5.0 and Aim 6.0 for example
16:03 <@heinrich5991> whcih config files do you use?
16:03 <@deen> both just contain "sv_pauseable 1"
16:04 <@deen> maybe some variable being reused, like a static one?
16:06 <@heinrich5991> well, it sounds like that
16:06 <@heinrich5991> or some uninitialized variable
16:18 <@heinrich5991> found it
16:18 <@deen> great!

16:23 < Learath2> must say i do not enjoy working with strings in teeworlds after nim :D
16:24 <@deen> Learath2: haha
16:24 <@deen> Learath2: but the strings in TW are often on stack, that's pretty sweet performance wise
16:24 <@heinrich5991> yea, a thing rust lacks..
16:24 <@heinrich5991> good handling of fixed size arrays

16:31 < Learath2> btw deen while updating we are losing the win64 build
16:31 <@deen> Learath2: nooooo
16:31 <@deen> Learath2: we're not going to lose that!
16:31 < Learath2> you forgot to add the executable name to the updater tho 
16:32 <@deen> huh?

16:33 <@deen> you can add a comment there to clarify
16:34 < uchar> how manage mac and linux binaries if have the same name?
16:34 <@deen> mac has no updater :P
16:34 < uchar> ahh ok :P
16:37 <@deen> EastByte: you broke something :P
16:38 <@deen> up and down arrow keys don't work in serverbrowser anymore
16:39 < Learath2> nearly done with the dll stuff
16:39 <@deen> Learath2: so you want it in 9.0 too^^
16:40 < Learath2> nah im not risking it again
16:40 <@deen> ok
16:40 < Learath2> il just test it for a bit
16:40 <@deen> EastByte: ok, it was the code you commented out here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/308/files#diff-3287b2addb72598cfece115cfba5ded8R219

16:42 < Learath2> deen: what does GetBinaryPath do exactly ?
16:43 <@deen> give you the path to the binary file?
16:43 <@deen> because previously we just assumed it's in the current  directory
16:43 <@deen> which didn't work so well
16:45 <@EastByte> ah I forgot to revert changes on serverbrowser
16:45 <@deen> EastByte: done already, no worries. but can you add the keys to demo browser?
16:46 <@deen> pretty useful to quickly scan the demos
16:47 <@EastByte> let me see
16:51 < Shiki_> EastByte: just wondering, were you working on something great with server browser? :)
16:52 <@deen> I'll be afk for 2 hours, release then. test the current master branch please =)
16:52 <@deen> (and the new features)
16:56 < Learath2> apparently unordered_map is c++11
16:57 <@EastByte> Shiki_: didn't work on the serverbrowser, no
17:01 <@heinrich5991> deen: did it work now? :)
17:01 <@heinrich5991> the map conversion?

17:26 < laxa> EastByte: yes ?
17:26 <@EastByte> mind adding server info request to Nimda ?
17:27 < laxa> no time today, maybe later
17:27 < laxa> open an issue on github
17:27 < laxa> or you might even copy the code from the !twp, no need to change a lot to have server info I guess
17:27 <@EastByte> okayy
17:28 < Nimda> Seasons by Knight :3 just released on Novice at 2015-08-27 17:24
17:57 < Chairn> hopefully you were there deen to correct some of my mistakes ^^
17:57 < Chairn> about white space, ive configured git to replace crlf by lf when pushing
17:57 < Chairn> so normally, wont happend again
17:58 < Chairn> and im really not comfortable with tw ui in menus_settings ^^
18:06 <@EastByte> Chairn: btw. did the strange timeout bug appear lately?
18:06 < Chairn> i dont know, i got timeout all the day, but not only tw ^^
18:07 < Chairn> seems like my wifi got some problems
18:07 <@EastByte> oh, that would be the reason why it happened to you in the first place
18:40 < o_be_one> hey
18:40 < o_be_one> whos wanted MC32 ?
18:40 < o_be_one> WolfAlex: ?

18:43 < o_be_one> same spec for MC32, but available to public in 1 or 2 hours
18:43 < o_be_one> normally, cross fingers :p
18:43 < WolfAlex> o_be_one: also for german customers?
18:43 < WolfAlex> o_be_one: because, idk why, but price for germans is higher
18:43 < o_be_one> i think german use France so you can expect yes
18:44 < o_be_one> Germans is in Euro, thats curious oO
18:44 <@EastByte> why?
18:45 < WolfAlex> EastByte: germans use more traffic 
18:45 < WolfAlex> ._.
18:45 < o_be_one> cause informations i have says its same price everywhere :/
18:45 < o_be_one> but i could be wrong
18:46 < Savander> vat?
18:46 < o_be_one> well btw i hope it will be available for you WolfAlex 
18:46 < Savander> maybe highter in germany
18:46 < o_be_one> possibly, Sadale

18:48 < Savander> :c
18:48 < o_be_one> sorry WolfAlex i mean DS 2016, DS for Dedicated Server
18:48 < Savander> not cool ;c
18:49 < WolfAlex> o_be_one: ah thats why the servers are all the time sold out? xD
18:52 < o_be_one> well OVH has not released to public MC32 if i remember well, theres just SoYouStart out of stock
18:52 < o_be_one> but they say 2016 DS will be available in 1 to 2 hours ... And if informations i got are good, it seems that it will take 10 days to get MC32
19:04 < WolfAlex> o_be_one: whats different about the 2016 DS compared to the 2015 ones?
19:05 < o_be_one> about game ? nothing, for other, many improvements but im not allowed to tell more :/
19:09 < Donate4DDNet> hi

19:13 <@deen> full 1 hour livestream, in german
19:13 <@deen> this sunday at 20:00
19:13 <@deen> heinrich5991: works perfectly!
19:14 < Donate4DDNet> yeah i'll come but not play it i'm too bad
19:14 <@deen> it's a really easy map, everyone can finish
19:14 <@deen> but the best time wins
19:14 <@deen> so it doesn't hurt to finish it 1-2 times and then watch  the pros =)
19:14 < Donate4DDNet> no the 1st finish !?

21:17 <@EastByte> \o/
21:17 <@EastByte> o\
21:17 <@deen> i enjoyed the stl error when I tried to print a void
21:18 < Learath2> i need a data structure that would allow me to associate a string to a bool
21:18 < Learath2> what is it ?
21:18 < Learath2> maybe ill just get a linked list 
21:21 <@deen> this kind of error: https://gist.github.com/def-/ba69332428410781a29c
21:21 < Learath2> well that one looks obv
21:21 < Learath2> but is huge for a simple error
21:22 <@deen> Learath2: so basically you just want to store strings :P
21:22 <@deen> Learath2: and ask whether a string is stored
21:23 <@deen> that's a set
21:23 <@deen> hash set
21:23 < Learath2> i want to store a string->bool relation ship
21:23 < Learath2> relationship
21:23 <@deen> sure, when a string is in your HashSet[string], then it's true, otherwise false
21:23 <@deen> and then you can insert and remove them
21:23 < Learath2> i dont know the entire set of strings
21:23 <@deen> if you really want to store booleans, HashTable[string, bool]
21:25 < Learath2> its for the updater filename,download(true)/remove(false)

22:01 < Learath2> hoped it would work doesnt quite work will fix tomorrow
22:10 <@deen> Learath2: why do you always change so much in the updater? =/ I'm afraid of every single change in the updater
22:10 <@deen> i thought we just wanted to add dll support and not touch anything (should never touch updater without good reason)
22:14 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] nzyuzin closed pull request #312: [RFC] Add UI slider to set dynamic camera sens (master...master) http://git.io/vGkW5
22:15 <@deen> Someone had a bunch of client suggestions: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2138
22:17 <@EastByte> hmm
22:18 < Savander> deen, 
22:18 < Savander> points on Savander and on BumBumeq 
22:18 < Savander> are wrong
22:18 < Savander> on website it's k
22:18 < Savander> but ingame
22:18 < Savander> not
22:19 <@deen> Savander: yeah, let me update
22:19 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vGkw1
22:19 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master f46767c def: Fix: Mousesens in UI independent of Dyncam
22:19 < Savander> :)
22:19 <@deen> EastByte: next time you can do that, just run scripts/recalculate-points.py
22:20 <@deen> happens when maps change their star rating or people are renamed
22:20 <@deen> but can only be updated 20-40 min later so i usually forget :P
22:21 < Learath2> deen: the old way we did it felt like it had a bug but if you want i can just add the dll stuff
22:21 < Savander> ^^
22:22 <@deen> Learath2: ok, if you're improving it, good
22:22 < Savander> why after 20-40 minutes?
22:22 < Savander> security reasons?:D
22:22 <@deen> Learath2: i just wouldn't dare myself^^
22:22 <@EastByte> deen: hmkay
22:22 < Chairn> oh
22:22 < Learath2> I was kinda scared we would hit that bug and idk what would happen if we did
22:22 < Chairn> updating erased my autoexec.cfg
22:22 <@deen> Chairn: yeah, sorry about that
22:22 < Learath2> a file that is both on the download and remove list
22:23 < Chairn> hopefully, i have a backup ^^
22:23 <@deen> Chairn: i think everyone should look at the autoexec_server.cfg instead
22:23 < Chairn> deen: isnt there a new autoexec name?
22:23 < Chairn> i have autoexec_server.cfg, but there is one for client?
22:23 < Chairn> autoexec_client?
22:23 <@deen> yes
22:23 < Chairn> k
22:23 < Chairn> hum
22:24 < Chairn> you added lots of comments in server.cfg
22:24 <@deen> Soreu did most of that
22:25 <@deen> aaargh, so many mistakes while releasing^^
22:25 <@deen> luckily nothing that can't be fixed
22:26 < Chairn> lol, that change log :D
22:26 < Chairn> it doesnt fit on my screen
22:26 <@deen> in client?
22:27 < Chairn> client & browser
22:27 <@deen> what resolution do you have?
22:27 < Chairn> in client, i just have the top 3
22:27 < Chairn> 1366*768
22:27 < Chairn> because there's steam & tournament above in client
22:27 <@deen> for me it fits in that resolution
22:27 <@deen> weird, do you use another font?
22:28 <@deen> or is it a windows-only problem?
22:28 < Chairn> looks like its double spaced
22:28 <@deen> ooooh
22:28 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/1366.png
22:29 <@deen> looks fine to me
22:29 < Chairn> yes, but only top3 ^^
22:29 <@deen> ?
22:29 <@deen> that's the entire text
22:29 < Chairn> i thought you were talking about browser ^^
22:30 <@deen> browser i don't care :P
22:30 < Chairn> [Server] New autoexec_server.cfg instead of autoexec.cfg (with Soreu)
22:30 < Chairn> you didnt add new autoexec_client.cfg instead of autoexec.cfg
22:30 <@deen> yeah, most won't need it
22:30 < Savander> they still can use
22:30 < Savander> autoexec.cfg
22:30 <@deen> you can just set things in the regular settings
22:31 <@deen> i only use it to set password so i don'T need to enter it on ddnet test servers
22:31 < Chairn> [Server] Fix: Prevent solo finish when saving, i missed that commit i think
22:31 <@deen> i tried to hide it with a non-obvious commit name :P
22:32 <@deen> evil people scan ddnet's commits and use that info to attack servers
22:32 < Savander> rogyl
22:33 < Savander> Hide cheats inside commits
22:33 < Savander> (y)
22:35 < WolfAlex> o_be_one: nothing :/ 
22:36 < WolfAlex> o_be_one: btw. look prices in german are way higher https://www.ovh.ie/dedicated_servers/enterprise/ https://www.ovh.de/dedicated_server/enterprise/
22:36 <@deen> WolfAlex: +20% taxes
22:36 <@deen> WolfAlex: i think in France they always write prizes without taxes, in Germany with
22:36 < WolfAlex> ah
22:37 <@deen> and for german customers they're legally bound to include them
22:37 < Chairn> deen: in france, all prices are tax included
22:37 <@deen> Chairn: not on OVH website :P
22:37 < Chairn> maybe its different if you're from abroad
22:37 < WolfAlex> (by default, the prices displayed are inclusive of the UK VAT in force) .
22:37 < WolfAlex> the page says on the bottom
22:38 <@deen> or you actually pay +20% in german taxes, dunno^^
22:39 <@deen> OVH is the only hoster where i noticed this
22:39 < WolfAlex> unfair :(
22:41 < Chairn> +20% is vat in france as well ^^
22:41 < o_be_one> ues WolfAlex idk what happend
22:41 < o_be_one> deen: in France all prices are with taxes, but for OVH the main price is without and just in bot of this you have with
22:42 < WolfAlex> germans have to pay a 10â‚¬+ premium on dedis, i really don't understand why
22:42 < o_be_one> HT means without, TTC means with
22:42 <@deen> WolfAlex: see, on the french site it says HT: https://www.ovh.com/fr/serveurs_dedies/enterprise/
22:42 <@deen> HT = without taxes
22:42 < WolfAlex> oh
22:43 < o_be_one> well they dont shown with taxes anymore
22:44 < Chairn> HT = Hors Taxes(without taxs); TTC = Total Tout Compris(Total all included)
22:44 < o_be_one> just made the calcul, its same price with taxe, WolfAlex 
22:44 < WolfAlex> oh yea
22:44 < o_be_one> well idk how much is Deutch taxes
22:44 < o_be_one> but i think for FR its 15.6 if i remember well
22:45 < Chairn> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2142 , i think he posted wrong place, or is there ddnet block server in other location maybe?
22:45 < Chairn> o_be_one: vat was 19.6
22:45 <@deen> Chairn: sure, we have block servers in other locations
22:45 < Chairn> but now i think its 20
22:46 <@deen> Chairn: but the guy is from France, so he probably is talking about the r0x.fr server
22:46 <@deen> o_be_one: your call :P
22:49 < o_be_one> :D
22:50 < o_be_one> i think it not from my servers
22:50 < o_be_one> cause i have no admins that abuse, thats curious
22:50 < o_be_one> ive just 1 active admin
22:50 <@deen> i searched for pepe servers and only found yours
22:50 <@deen> oooh
22:51 <@deen> There's a fake "DDNet EUR - DALEK BLOCKER" server
22:51 <@deen> which EastByte could rename, but didn't
22:51 <@deen> because it runs on his server :P
22:51 <@EastByte> WolfAlex: is "DDNet EUR - DALEK BLOCKER" jxsl's server?
22:51 < o_be_one> oh its him -_-
22:52 < o_be_one> he is really boring
22:52 < WolfAlex> uhm EastByte 
22:52 < WolfAlex> is that one of my ips?
22:52 <@EastByte> yep
22:52 < WolfAlex> then yes
22:52 <@EastByte> then I'll ask him to rename it
22:52 < o_be_one> it's not what happened -_- i hate these crying players
22:52 < o_be_one> and, curiously, its not his ingame name.
22:53 < WolfAlex> EastByte: just rename it yourself, he know that i dont like faking names ._.
22:53 < WolfAlex> +s
22:54 < o_be_one> oh no, it's not from me :o (im reading lol)
22:54 < o_be_one> not my kind of action
22:55 <@EastByte> $ grep -nri "DDNet EUR" ./
22:55 <@EastByte> muhahah
22:56 <@deen> EastByte: as i said, the guy even told me it's fine to rename it and he did it in server rcon, i just think he  doesn't know how to change it permanently
22:56 <@EastByte> kk
22:57 < o_be_one> maybe we can make a "blocker" section in ddnet forum for me x) ?
22:57 < o_be_one> ahahah
22:57 <@deen> sure, i don't mind
22:57 <@deen> maybe we could also add your block servers to ddnet server view (but i'm not sure)
22:57 <@deen> (don't want to attract ddos attacks)
22:58 <@deen> so many people contributed to the current release, crazy
23:01 < o_be_one> deen you can try maybe ? if i keep name of my servers, maybe it could keep you away from DDoS ?
23:02 <@deen> EastByte or anyone else have a thought about this?
23:03 <@deen> o_be_one: only the block servers or what?
23:03 <@EastByte> hmmmm
23:03 < o_be_one> ive just blockers, ive one poor ddrace and one poor openfng, without players, so just blockers will be awesome for me
23:03 < o_be_one> i'll make a disclaimer like "not official ddnet" if you want, or "not managed by DDNet", something like that, if it could help
23:05 < o_be_one> i dont want to give problems to DDNet, but it will better for "stable game" for players to show it in DDNet, i think ...
23:07 <@EastByte> I'm okay with it
23:09 < o_be_one> i wanted to ask, why there is no "rename" rcon command ?
23:09 < o_be_one> something that allow to rename a player an block his change nick ability for like 5 or 10 mins
23:10 <@deen> because no one wrote it? :P
23:10 < o_be_one> could be a good way against "hard" fakers
23:10 < o_be_one> ahah ok i understand :p
23:10 <@deen> i just kick them instead if they don't understand
23:10 < o_be_one> you kick for all kind of faking (faking an other ingame player for example) or just for faking staff ?
23:11 < WolfAlex> deen: ... ddnet is executing server_autoexec even when i specify a file with -f ?
23:13 <@deen> WolfAlex: i think so, hmm
23:13 <@deen> (it was the same for autoexec.cfg)
23:14 < WolfAlex> but now there is per default an server_autoexec
23:14 <@deen> there always was a default autoexec.cfg
23:14 <@deen> now it just has more settings
23:14 <@deen> i think most people will just edit it and never even find out about -f
23:15 <@deen> if you know about -f, you can move it away for now
23:15 <@deen> but we can change the behaviour i guess, so that when -f is specified, autoexecs aren't opened
23:19 <@deen> Wooooo, sdl2 fixed
23:21 < WolfAlex> deen: well, better don't change default behaviour
23:21 < WolfAlex> thats something that annoys me every time
23:22 <@deen> WolfAlex: yeah, we don't depend on it at ddnet, so i don't care either way, but someone always complains when something changes
23:22 < WolfAlex> like /r works only on ground but not on stoppers, next update it works on stoppers ._. 
23:22 <@deen> well, i would say it was a bug that it didn't work on stoppers
23:23 < WolfAlex> yea we should write a 'default behaviour' page for ddnet, all that that does NOT change without notice
23:23 < WolfAlex> everyting else should be considerd 'a bug' 
23:25 <@deen> WolfAlex: that's a bit formal, we're not exactly writing the software for a space ship here :P
23:25 < WolfAlex> hm 
23:26 <@deen> we also don't have any tests in the source code for example
23:26 <@deen> except "it compiles"
23:26 < WolfAlex> xD
23:28 < uchar> The worst think for the ddnet future it's the vanilla compatibility.... i say xDD
23:32 < uchar> and the team start broken these compatibility with the demos... only need advance xD
