06:23 < shorefire> deen: you around?
13:52 < laxa> deen: you changed the rank page ?
13:54 <@deen> hi
13:54 <@deen> i wanted to add flags
13:54 <@deen> for the favorite server
13:54 <@deen> but it looked awkward to have 50 GER flags on each page
13:55 <@deen> but yeah, i also made a few more finishes visible, looks weird probably
13:57 < laxa> well, you should increase the number of Points (last month) and Points (last week) too
13:57 < laxa> so it doesn't look weird :p
14:04 < CookieMichal> Do you have any template for simple single HTML page?
14:07 <@deen> for ddnet.tw or in general?
14:09 < CookieMichal> general
14:09 < CookieMichal> simple site with 3 lines of text and logo xd
14:10 < CookieMichal> I found html site builder ^^

15:12 < CookieMichal> Savander: Co to takiego? :o
15:13 < EastByte> Powered by phpBB® Forum Software © phpBB Group 
15:13 < EastByte> hm
15:13 < CookieMichal> Oh xd

15:14 < CookieMichal> My burning board 2 lite forum was attacked by french bot :/
15:14 < EastByte> spaming?
15:14 < EastByte> looks like you didn't ask the tw question in registration :D

15:15 < CookieMichal> EastByte: I want to change my forum software ;)
15:15 < CookieMichal> Savander: :DD
15:16 < Savander> ;d
15:16 < Savander> moze
15:16 < Savander> sobie na to podmienie ;]
15:16 <@deen> EastByte: sometimes it asks "What does ddnet stand for?"
15:16 <@deen> and some people don't know and ask me ingame...
15:16 <@deen> even though it's right on the website in big letters
15:19 < Savander> ;]
15:20 < CookieMichal> Hahah :D
15:29 <@deen> Noone complained that the ddnet mysql database stopped working in the last version
15:29 <@deen> i think noone uses it
15:30 < EastByte> I'm to lazy to set up a database
15:30 < EastByte> too*
15:38 < CookieMichal> Gotta go to ts
15:38 < CookieMichal> 3

15:45 < EastByte> nice weather?
15:45 < EastByte> it's raining here
17:54 < Savander> ;]
18:13 < laxa> Finally, finished ROCKET-BELT
18:13 < laxa> And I am in top 10 finishers of Solo maps !
18:14 < CookieMichal> and you are mean
18:15 < laxa> Those french people don't like to be disturbed by some strangers.
18:15 < laxa> Is it so hard to understand ?
18:15 < Savander> nolife
18:15 < CookieMichal> U didn't have to move me
18:15 < CookieMichal> I was just listening
18:15 < CookieMichal> Is it so hard to understand?
18:15 < laxa> It can be disturbing to others.
18:16 < CookieMichal> It wasn't
18:16 < CookieMichal> xD
18:56 < Savander> laxa
18:56 < laxa> Savander: yeah ?
18:56 < Savander> i fixed this
18:56 < Savander> 'Max players seen online'
18:56 < Savander> meh
18:56 < Savander> :P
18:56 < laxa> Nice :) !
18:57 < Savander> it was simple...
18:57 < Savander> nvm
18:57 < Savander> :D
18:57 < Savander> when my map will be released! :C
18:57 < Savander> :((
18:58 < Savander> i'm  impatient
18:58 < Savander> es
18:58 < Savander> :(
19:02 < laxa> deen: nice, I am getting funvote by EryX now.
19:45 < laxa> deen: if a tee is timeouted, is he counted in the vote needed ?
19:48 <@deen> depends
19:48 < laxa> what about afk tees ?
19:48 <@deen> if his eyes are normal yes, if they are sleepy no
20:04 < CookieMichal> deen: 645654 wants to talk with you
20:06 <@deen> no
20:10 < Savander> NO
20:10 < Savander> :D
21:35 < laxa> Savander: why don't you use screen + irssi on your vps/dedi ?
21:35 < Savander> Sav _>
21:35 < Savander> its my bot
21:35 < Savander> xD
21:36 < Savander> but i prefer
21:36 < Savander> webchat
21:36 < Savander> on windows
21:36 < laxa> Just use putty then...
21:36 < Savander> no
21:36 < laxa> Use a real client ?
21:36 <@deen> use netcat!
21:37 < Savander_> what is it
21:37 < Savander_> ?
21:37 <@deen> "netcat is a simple unix utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using TCP or UDP protocol."
21:37 <@deen> so you have to do everything your irc client would do by hand
21:38 < Savander_> can't
21:38 <@deen> Only the ping packets are bad
21:38 <@deen> because you have to quickly pong back or the server disconnects you
21:39 < laxa> deen: I hate that ddnet doesn't have a demo feature yet :(.
21:39 < laxa> I am seeking for aufnahmetest 3 demo
21:39 < laxa> or video
21:39 < laxa> I think cenarrius's record is on youtube
21:39 < laxa> but those retards can't use tag on youtube apparently
21:41 <@deen> laxa: then write it yourself!
21:41 < laxa> xD
21:41 < laxa> deen: you could make an upload feature like we used to have on ddmax...
21:43 <@deen> no, that's stupid
21:43 < laxa> Hum ?!
21:44 <@deen> wouldn't be used much
21:44 < laxa> then merge code from teerace into ddnet
21:44 < laxa> and have an auto-demo record from server
21:47 <@deen> i guarantee you the GER servers would lag all the time then
21:47 <@deen> but we had this discussion multiple times before
21:47 < laxa> let me think about a nice idea then
21:48 <@deen> ...
21:49 < laxa> What ? :(
21:50 < laxa> You could put all demos into RAM instead of file
21:50 <@deen> i don't feel like sitting here and implementing your ideas all day
21:50 < laxa> And write to HDD at the end if ranks is top5 or toP5
21:57 <@deen> and the pros who don't want their demos online will just stop playing
21:57 <@deen> also we don't have chat filters for demos so far
22:02 < laxa> you don't generally chat when you get top5/top10 rank
22:02 <@deen> but other people on the server do
22:02 <@deen> and they definitely do not want their on-server chats to be online
22:03 <@deen> as a demo
22:03 < laxa> let me make a test on teerace
22:07 < laxa> ok
22:07 < laxa> teerace demo server record doesn't save chat input
23:52 < laxa> Quite happy, I finished Aufnahmetest 3 !
