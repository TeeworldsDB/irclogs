21:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @melona.3650 the pipeline fixed itself
21:19 <+bridge> <estguy> Would it be possible to make the dummy connecting also stay in server queue and have the 5sec limit when the server is full?
21:20 <+bridge> <estguy> this would possibly lessen the amount of dummy players at full servers xd
21:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mhh? how does this make sense?
21:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the dummy only tries to connect for a few seconds and then you have to manually click connect again
21:22 <+bridge> <estguy> it doesn't xd
21:23 <+bridge> <estguy> since when does everything have to make sense
21:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but maybe a connect queue generally would be nice.. but currently our network isn't really build for it
21:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> would be more fair than arbitrary 5 second reconnect
21:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or 128slot server ðŸ˜¬
21:29 <+bridge> <teero777> rust physics needed xd
21:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i guess GER servers could handle it
21:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but backward compability
21:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> pew
21:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> X11 is 40 years old
21:45 <+bridge> <estguy> how often does it let you connect dummy though?
21:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> today
22:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> what do i do when udp seems to be filtered
22:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> my power went out and now i can't reconnect
22:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> try to turn of your power off and on again
22:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> try to turn your power off and on again
22:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> i just wanna win
22:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> internet ðŸ¥º
22:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> my internet is dying now
22:26 <+bridge> <eptic535> Hello Fellas, I wanted to implement Rainbow on my Server.. Can anyone help?
23:05 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Are laser doors predicted nowadays in DDNet?
23:05 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> The client has the switch number, no?

23:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> sadly no
