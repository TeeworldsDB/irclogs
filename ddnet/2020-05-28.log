00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> have run count in practice mode of /r is never used?
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> runs in practice mode do not count
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> how do you remove it though
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> i thought killing would do it
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> currently: join a different team
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> lame
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rust most loved again
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ./practice broken on some maps
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> such as: Yo'ci (/r doesn't work with deepfreeze)
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> additionally, in parts where a powerup is changed, failing past the powerup could mean your whole team fails in practice mode
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> for example, if there was a hammerfly part through a freeze to unfreeze, followed by hammer off tile to hookfly, failing past the hookfly would mean your team dies because you no longer have the hammer for the hammerfly part
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> Finally, rescue on a lot of insane/brutal 4*/5\* maps does not work very well if there are kill tiles in the map because killing would kill everyone and you would need to /r very fast
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the practice mode is very good for some maps, but does not work for others. I think a good way to fix this would to use /setspawn or allow players to /disablekill
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 this looks interesting: https://github.com/calccrypto/uint128_t
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or @Jupstar âœª
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> For the powerup changes, i think a good way to fix it would to give commands like /enable hammeroff, etc.

08:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> lmao you also cant save

08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut did `std::bitset`Â attack your family or something?
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ZombieToad were you in a team?
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> @deen its solo map
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That was less issues then I expecte
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> d
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen can you also kill players that leave practice teams in #2218?
12:24 <+Konsti> ban cheaters
13:19 <+Konsti> i suggest adding totele command for t0 :danAmazing:
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> Konsthings
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> FYI, our release build times
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/715530547392282674/screenshot-20200528134207.png
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Can be viewed in about:tracing in Chrome/Chromium
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/715530631450460200/ddnet-release.json
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is this pause?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Waiting for a dependency usually
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is this ninja or make?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ninja
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> with ninjatracing: https://github.com/nico/ninjatracing
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, those are all the small executables, they wait for system.c to link it in
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and block the rest of the queue by doing so
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> theoretically it could start a job not depending on these
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yep, that would be smart
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. surely ninja doesn't pick jobs that still have unmet dependencies while there are others that are ready? oO
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe everything depends on BASE being there?
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that loses ~600ms of build time
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. maybe one can get ninja to ouptu the dependency graph
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> -t graph
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> -t browse is nicer for browsing (but only works with python aliased to python2 for me)
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Everything has a dependency on "engine-shared (order-only)"
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but only the linkings i think, hmm
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen quick question about #2212, sv_practice can change at runtime, what should happen to teams already in practice mode?
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should we maybe kill those teams?
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> is it possible to use kill bind for rescue instead of /r when practice enabled? we can just use /kill for kill
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 atm they stay in practice
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's a bit harsh to kill them
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen is that fine? we would be disabling teams if we discover a bug with it, maybe we should just kill the people in practice
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sv_team 0 also doesn't kill teams
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, I guess we can keep the same behaviour then
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but yeah, feel free to improve it later
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll merge #2212 if you think it's ready
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks!
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i mean there are many more possible improvements, but can do them separately
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> #2218*
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜„
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i just didn't want to keep conflicting with myself
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One issue with bors is that it's slow, I get distracted while waiting for it to merge
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you need to wait for the merge?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to deploy it too
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, no idea
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bors could really use some optimization
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like in this case the base branch compiles, the PR itself compiles, there is no batching, thus it could just be merged without a staging branch waiting for build
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the pull request is not based on master right now
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it has to test it again
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the optimization you mentioned should be implemented, there's no point to run the tests again if master has not changed since the PR
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 will you deploy it?
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 btw github api exposes a `merge_commit_sha`Â which shows a hypothetical merge, I wonder if that could be used to do this somehow
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 CHN seems to have trouble setting `BUILD_RPATH`
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> is there any better way to get access to gameconsole  at CEditor than 'CGameClient *pGameClient = (CGameClient *)Kernel()->RequestInterface<IGameClient>();' ?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> is there any better way to get access to CGameConsole at CEditor than 'CGameClient *pGameClient = (CGameClient *)Kernel()->RequestInterface<IGameClient>();' ?
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> (I`d like to make it work in editor)
19:19 <@deen> @BannZay There should be pGameClient already, I don't see a better way
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> well, okay, how do I set it? I failed to inject it via ctor/OnInit without modifying engine classes
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I mean, I cant get rid of this cast. I dont know how to set it in first place
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 details?
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ArMor> hmm
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ArMor> I think there is a way to improve the dummy hammer fly code
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ArMor> maybe make it only hammer when it touches the player
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ArMor> and make it track its movement(from the local maybe)
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ArMor> if it's not a bad idea
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ArMor> someone could point me to where in ther code it is and i try my best to conterbute
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 `-- Can't set BUILD_RPATH in CMake before 3.8, pass -Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN' manually if you wish to emulate this. Or just install a newer version of CMake...`
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, needs `LDFLAGS=-Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN'`, but I guess I already set it?
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh yep you did
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The cmake output just concerned me, didn't see the LDFLAGS
