08:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning to everyone less python users
08:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> today i decided to hate on em dont mind me

08:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Evil
08:27 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hello
08:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We should invent darkpython
08:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe that is a niche
08:27 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i identify the players  after they leave and rejoin ??
08:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ip
08:27 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> all the ip's here is dynamic, like me
08:28 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> little noise on the internet and your ip is changed :poggers2:
08:29 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and what is CUuid used for ?
08:29 < bridge> <Ewan> morning
08:29 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs a uuid
08:29 < bridge> <Ewan> google it
08:30 < bridge> <Ewan> basically a number you can depend on always being unique
08:30 < bridge> <Ewan> universally unique identifier
08:31 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> cool
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i see this on uuid_manager.h
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> struct CUuid
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> {
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     unsigned char m_aData[16];
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     bool operator==(const CUuid &Other) const;
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     bool operator!=(const CUuid &Other) const;
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     bool operator<(const CUuid &Other) const;
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> };
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is uuid generated for every tee who connected to your server ?
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i see this on uuid_manager.h
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> struct CUuid
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> {
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     unsigned char m_aData[16];
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     bool operator==(const CUuid &Other) const;
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     bool operator!=(const CUuid &Other) const;
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     bool operator<(const CUuid &Other) const;
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> };
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
08:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is uuid generated for every tee who  ever connected to your server ?
08:35 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i really don't like to bother the players to register with chat command like /register and /log
08:39 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i see somewhere at the client side uuid get generated randomly, is that uuid is the same at the client and server side for each player ?
08:49 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i see somewhere at the client side or shared, uuid get generated randomly, is that uuid is the same at the client and server side for each player ?
08:49 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i see somewhere at the client side or shared, uuid get generated randomly, is that uuid the same at the client and server side for each player ?
08:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> a uuid can be used for identification of whatever basically. it's a universally unique identifier
08:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I can not really recommend that for authentication. The things the client sends all might change
08:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hi zilera
08:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ali
08:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i dont use Threads, but Instagram sometimes shows some Threads and I've just seen one saying "halts m@ul sagen bevor man youtube werbung √ºberspringt>>>" and I had to laugh a little
08:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
08:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @reitw sneaky
08:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Recommend them to use a client with password manager and automatic login hehe
09:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is everything is shared folder, shared between server and client side ?
09:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> no, it's just shared code
09:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> both programs run individually and share nothing

09:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @mamad_melanin what do you have to say to your defense
09:41 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> as tesla said, you can find the secret of the universe in 3, 6, 9
09:42 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if i found another bug on my server, i cant fix it, i just shutdown the server and run
09:43 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> leave the project and make a new one
09:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> you can tryout the server 185.164.73.109:8303
09:50 < bridge> <DDNet> 185.164.73.109:8303 is not a DDNet or KoG server.
10:02 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but your idea is cool to find a team to play with
10:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> even tho almost nobody used lfg channel on this server
10:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> don't worry maybe they all dummy players
10:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i dont care if anyone would use it, i just wanna finish this project. i like it a lot. and it will be my first "big" project for portfolio :owo:

10:16 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> thank you bro, i think i found the crash bug when a player attempts to join the spectator
10:16 < bridge> <kekomonter> Time to crash server
10:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> why did u remove that if statement
10:18 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i think i was experimenting with something and forgot to put it back
10:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what about putting // in front of lines

11:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i want to implement a bank system for my server, write and read accounts to/from a file, what is the correct way to do it, do i better of using system.h methods like str_format(...), or using std:: methods ?
11:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i just want to do it in a right way
11:09 < bridge> <reitw> real people reinstall OS to change map
11:10 < bridge> <reitw> there's no new year screenshot map ?
11:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'd use std. But if you want to stick to ddnet style, use base
13:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @.alexander_ I'm trying to use open graph for a link preview with an image. The image has to be provided using an url, do you know how i can provide an image in a specific path, e.g. ddnet.org/images/x.png which I can then use ?
13:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> (I'm using Vue, if that matters)
13:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> nvm
13:23 < bridge> <kekomonter> Use sql

15:59 < bridge> <Ewan> -11c out but i sit and enjoy the balcony
15:59 < bridge> <Ewan> chilly even with my 2 pairs of pants and coat
16:25 < bridge> <vappy19> Where u from?
16:25 < bridge> <Ewan> united states
16:25 < bridge> <vappy19> Which zone :0?
16:25 < bridge> <Ewan> Colorado
16:25 < bridge> <Ewan> mountain time
16:27 < bridge> <vappy19> Oooh beauty zone i think ‚ú®
16:28 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> im gonna use files with c++
16:28 < bridge> <kekomonter> You can use sql with C++
16:28 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i get the size of the string, but i have only a pointer to it's firs element ?
16:29 < bridge> <kekomonter> str_length
16:29 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> str_lenght(pointer) ?
16:29 < bridge> <kekomonter> Yap
16:29 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i love you
16:30 < bridge> <kekomonter> I have small example of accounts with sqlite here: https://github.com/Myr-13/MMOTeeReloaded
16:30 < bridge> <kekomonter> (My shity mmo mode based on ddnet xd)
16:33 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> pets, crafting ? whaat ?
16:33 < bridge> <kekomonter> Yep
16:33 < bridge> <Ewan> myr sql is rly easy to use
16:33 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean
16:33 < bridge> <Ewan> uh
16:33 < bridge> <Ewan> cosmos
16:34 < bridge> <Ewan> :owo:
16:34 < bridge> <kekomonter> Maybe I will rewrite this to lua and create custom client with lua support and dynamicly downloading of content xd
16:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> you gonna make the next generation of teeworlds
16:34 < bridge> <Ewan> make sure this is a real heap allocated string tho and not just a ptr to the first of a char array
16:35 < bridge> <Ewan> if it has no null terminating character then it will do lots of bad things
16:35 < bridge> <kekomonter> I think no, a lot of dudes here don't like lua
16:35 < bridge> <Ewan> report wrong size/count until it reaches another \0 which isn‚Äôt that string‚Äôs/segfault
16:36 < bridge> <Ewan> you can use str_length on malloc‚Äôd strings but prefer to use sizeof with statically sized strings like is usually done in ddnet
16:36 < bridge> <Ewan> char String[16];
16:36 < bridge> <Ewan> sizeof(String) // 16
16:38 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> so, they are not dudes
16:39 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i love the language as long as it's not c++
16:41 < bridge> <devinci24> that's... not a heap allocated string? and char arrays afaik should always be null terminated. (or the null could be before the end of the allocation which would mean the size is actually smoller)
16:41 < bridge> <devinci24> Idk how str_lenght works tho ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
16:41 < bridge> <Ewan> what
16:41 < bridge> <Ewan> that is a stack string
16:41 < bridge> <devinci24> y
16:41 < bridge> <Ewan> you're not supposed to use str_length on stack allocated strings
16:41 < bridge> <Ewan> even if it works it's a waste of time
16:41 < bridge> <devinci24> ohh okay
16:42 < bridge> <Ewan> do use it on heap allocated strings
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> char *pString = static_cast<char *>(malloc(64));
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> str_copy(pString, "this is a string allocated on the heap"); // i think that all str_* functions will ensure null termination when necessary
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> str_length(pString); // 64
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> also don't do this in ddnet codebase ^
16:44 < bridge> <Ewan> reviewers will go for the jugular
16:45 < bridge> <devinci24> can you do a c cast on the ddnet codebase instead of a static one?
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> void CGameContext::ConRegister(IConsole::IResult *pResult, void *pUserData)
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> {
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     CGameContext *pSelf = (CGameContext *)pUserData;
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     if(!CheckClientID(pResult->m_ClientID))
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     return;
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     if(str_length(pResult->GetString(0)) > 20)
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     {
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         pSelf->Console()->Print(IConsole::OUTPUT_LEVEL_STANDARD, "chatresp", "try something shorter for username, less than 21");
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         return;
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     }
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     if(str_length(pResult->GetString(1)) > 20)
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     {
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         pSelf->Console()->Print(IConsole::OUTPUT_LEVEL_STANDARD, "chatresp", "try something shorter for password, less than 21");
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         return;
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     }
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     // pSelf->SendBroadcast(p1char, pResult->m_ClientID);
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> }
16:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
16:46 < bridge> <Ewan> u will get shit for it
16:46 < bridge> <Ewan> is unnecessary
16:46 < bridge> <devinci24> :justatest:
16:46 < bridge> <Ewan> very rarely is there a situation where you actually need a c cast anyway
16:46 < bridge> <devinci24> well, isn't the code equivalent there
16:46 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> c++
16:46 < bridge> <Ewan> the c cast is ambiguous
16:46 < bridge> <Ewan> why have ambiguity
16:46 < bridge> <Ewan> probably should use a static cast here
16:47 < bridge> <devinci24> wdym ambiguous. (char *)malloc(64) doesn't seem ambigous. I don't really care though it was just out of curiosity
16:47 < bridge> <Ewan> a c cast basically just tries most of the casting methods until one works
16:48 < bridge> <devinci24> what
16:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> for *pself ?
16:48 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
16:48 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
16:48 < bridge> <Ewan>     CGameContext *pSelf = static_cast<CGameContext *>(pUserData);
16:48 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
16:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i just copy the existing code on code base
16:49 < bridge> <kekomonter> This will work without static cast
16:49 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i just copied the existing code on code base
16:49 < bridge> <Ewan> it will work but clang tidy will yell at u in most configs
16:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i think only reason ddnet's doesn't is bcs c cast is already so abundant in code base
16:49 < bridge> <Ewan> doesn't mean it should be used
17:01 < bridge> <Ewan> oic u mean in this scenario lol
17:01 < bridge> <Ewan> it isn't ambiguous here but the nature of the c cast has potential to be
17:04 < bridge> <Ewan> see "Explanation" <https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/cast>
17:04 < bridge> <Ewan> and it's not different in cpp <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/explicit_cast>
17:04 < bridge> <Ewan> >  If there is exactly one expression in parentheses, this cast expression is exactly equivalent to the corresponding C-style cast expression.
17:06 < ChillerDragon> @mamad_melanin why cap password at 20 characters?
17:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i just don't want to get too long
17:06 < bridge> <Ewan> u can cap higher
17:06 < ChillerDragon> 20 is too long?
17:07 < ChillerDragon> imo 64 should be minimum as allowed length
17:07 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how much is consider good ?
17:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i would prob do at like 96
17:07 < ChillerDragon> how long do you consider problematic?
17:07 < bridge> <Ewan> or 100 works just as well xd
17:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 5gb is just as good
17:08 < ChillerDragon> 5gb is a bit intense o.O
17:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i just wanna look at them in a text file, each of them looking good, not to long
17:08 < ChillerDragon> also if register happens via chat there is a max len on chat messages
17:08 < bridge> <patiga> I use the harry potter book series as my password, hbu?
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I use the movies
17:09 < ChillerDragon> i use sha1sum of harry potter 2 thumbnail img
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Binary PW ftw
17:09 < ChillerDragon> thats 41 characters
17:10 < bridge> <patiga> Jup do you at least flip the movies upside down? else I'll steal all your accounts rn
17:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The most secure PW for tw ingame chat is invalid utf8
17:10 < ChillerDragon> xxxD
17:10 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
17:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah opengl textures xd
17:10 < ChillerDragon> jopsti logging in gets flagged as ddos
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But not in Germany, where internet speed is basically infinity
17:13 < bridge> <Ewan> what's the best residential internet u can get
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Depends on region
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But I can get 
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 250/40
17:14 < bridge> <patiga> (in GB)
17:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Jotta bytes
17:15 < bridge> <Ewan> jupstar is that Gb
17:15 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That would be awesome
17:15 < bridge> <Ewan> but we get 1000/40 residential internet
17:16 < bridge> <Ewan> and there's a 2G plan too iirc
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I can get that too but only cable internet
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Red flag for me
17:16 < bridge> <Ewan> cable internet?
17:17 < bridge> <Ewan> unless u have ftth which i find unlikely then there's coax somewhere in ur route
17:17 < bridge> <Ewan> it's residential
17:18 < bridge> <Ewan> apparently hotel ip is banned from kog
17:23 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what is the variable to user path like .local/share/ddnet
17:25 < bridge> <Ewan> im sure u can get it but u should instead use IStorage apis
17:26 < bridge> <Ewan> data dir
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Internet that is not DSL or fiber
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable
17:31 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i already using std:: for file handling
17:32 < bridge> <Ewan> then you can use CStorage::GetDataDir or something like that
17:32 < bridge> <Ewan> let me look it up
17:32 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://codedoc.ddnet.org/classCStorage.html#a88abb05318f2a73fb2bf2101056d8e52>
17:32 < bridge> <Ewan> FindDatadir
17:33 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> wow, there is ddracenetwork docs
17:33 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> why i am not aware of it
17:33 < bridge> <Ewan> it's just automatically made from the doxygen comments
17:34 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not particularly enlightening
17:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> thank you
17:34 < bridge> <Ewan> it lets u navigate the api with some ease tho
17:35 < bridge> <Ewan> but like functions are not documented particularly well, even if they do have comments they do not really explain anything about how to use it in a more big-picture sense
20:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> gh removed lines changed from contributors graphs :/
22:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> WTF why. Time to switch
22:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Where to go?
22:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I heard gitlab has an open source version
22:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
22:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which many open source projects actually use
22:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I maintained that at work
22:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs okay
22:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i see line changes still
22:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Scrumplex codeberg also peeked my interest
22:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I only see additions/deletions, but not combined
22:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
22:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it had combined at some point
22:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont remember fishy memory xd
22:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> with additions in green above the middle, deletions in red below
22:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> use codeberg
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why do u see it
22:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://codeberg.org/
22:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> its open source too
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1194390779829956669/image.png?ex=65b02e18&is=659db918&hm=8c267fd1ae021b5e7982a96fbe1b07a9eeeff62af30586a77beb9c773f04b1c4&
22:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> got a codeberg vs gitlab comparison?
22:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> the source https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo
22:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> top right has a combobox
22:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @jupeyy_keks
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well the advantage of github is simply that the project has more visibility
22:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 first one is obvious, gitlab is a for profit company iirc, codeberg is a non profit
22:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://ruky.me/2022/10/17/codeberg-a-github-alternative-from-europe/
22:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Leave project there for discovery. But put redirect links in description
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont get which combobox u mean
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> combobox = dropdown with free typing
22:25 < bridge> <robyt3> Did GitHub find more past data somewhere and add it to the graph? I don't remember the data going all the way back until 2008. It also tracks commits by matricks again somehow, which it didn't do before.
22:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> true
22:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> epic gamer moment
22:27 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Codeberg cool
22:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> interesting. I only had one on another repo, but not ddnet
22:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and apparently only a dropdown, no free typing
22:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> They use AI to hallucinate additional stats axaxaxax
22:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So when move ddnet to codeberg?
22:30 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Codeberg is cool and all, but discoverability is bad :(
22:31 < bridge> <Scrumplex> better than GitLab though
22:31 < bridge> <Scrumplex> GitLab search is useless
22:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Keep a repo on GitHub for marketing but point it to codeberg. Seems good enough to me Scrumplex also how many new ddnet players found it while browsing their GitHub for you page. We can also add a ‚Äûmake sure to star on GitHub‚Äú note to the codeberg readme
22:45 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Probably not many. But sadly most people already have a GitHub account and probably wouldn't bother creating a Codeberg account. People are sadly lazy and every obstacle decreases the likelihood of getting contributions
22:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That might be true. Then we just bridge prs lmao
22:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Era of bridges
22:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that doesn't sound like discoverability though
22:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> more like the good old network effect, like e.g. from facebook back in the times
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and that from you. the person that uses github as chat instance, email provider, stay-in-contact-network to oldschool ppl
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòÇ
22:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cloud storage not to forget
22:56 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> + for codeberg - open source policy letsgo
22:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think Scrumplex argued in favor of open source policy for ddnet communities
22:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill make a github like platform that only accepts agpl
22:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think fsf has one
22:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> AGPL ...
22:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the license of non-freedom
22:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=coreutils
22:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> the license enforcing free dom
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> free, but not liberated
22:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://savannah.gnu.org/
22:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> We host free projects that run on free operating systems and without any proprietary software dependencies.
22:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> Hosting requirements
22:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> Our service runs with 100% free software, including itself.
23:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice, now don't look like 1998 xddd
23:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> > No dependencies on nonfree software
23:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
23:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> To be hosted on Savannah, your project must be free software, and it must be kept independent of any nonfree software. The package must not refer the user to any nonfree software; in other words, it must not say anything that in our judgment is likely to lead or steer users towards any nonfree software. In particular, it must not automatically download or install any nonfree software. For more info, see References to Non-Free Software and Documenta
23:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
23:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> The program should deliver its full functionality and convenience on a completely free platform based on a free operating system, such as GNU/Linux, working entirely with other free software. Otherwise, it would be an inducement to install nonfree operating systems or other nonfree software.
23:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
23:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> It is ok for the program to run on nonfree platforms or nonfree operating systems, and to work with well-known nonfree applications, in addition to working with free software, provided it gives the free software at least as good support as it gives to nonfree counterparts. In other words, at no time, in no way, should your program put free software users at a disadvantage compared to those willing to use proprietary software.
23:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> so based
23:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds like ddnet would still fit, I think?
23:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs ddnet's freedom is a superset of theirs
23:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
23:02 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Yes. Ideally we would all be using open code forges like Codeberg. But we don't live in that ideal world. As long as you don't make yourself dependent on GitHub I don't really see too much of a problem. It's a matter of compromises
23:03 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Paradox of tolerance!
23:04 < ChillerDragon> yea jopsti i spend more time on github than in ddnet the last few years. Basically all data i own is either backed up or stored exclusively on github. I browse github for cheap dopamine like others browse tiktok. I love the design and never gave gitlab a chance. But still would like to switch the more ms breaks it
23:04 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Copyleft does not tolerate the intolerant (or in other words, doesn't tolerate making code proprietary)
23:04 < ChillerDragon> its closed source and it starts to also become ugly
23:07 < ChillerDragon> sounds like heinrich he is also not tolerating intolerance claimbing bladiblu tolerance paradoxon
23:07 < ChillerDragon> claiming*
23:08 < ChillerDragon> if you enforce freedom/tolerance you are not freeing/tolerating
23:09 < ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ whats your opinion on tolerating toxic people that do not tolerate others?
23:10 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> https://tenor.com/view/robot-congratulations-you-are-rescued-please-gif-17932648
23:11 < bridge> <Scrumplex> I feel like you are missing a don't here
23:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno, depends on the grade of toxicity
23:13 < bridge> <Scrumplex> From my experience GPL/AGPL only really affects companies. If you are hacking on software for your own use, the license doesn't even matter
23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the aliens that kill humanity can then use my public domain code, but not AGPL. i'd say this is so future proof
23:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's only a game tho, bcs the same rules as for companies apply
23:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you force freedom with AGPL you take the freedom from people to go closed source.
23:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
23:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you enforce tolerance you do not tolerate specific groups your self. As in you do not tolerate groups that do not tolerate others.
23:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can change the laws
23:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the copyrights lift after some decades
23:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> They don‚Äôt? You should know you come from minecraft land! Everything is GPL there.
23:17 < bridge> <cipy29> TIL minecraft is based
23:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> nah, not minecraft, only minecraft mods
23:18 < bridge> <cipy29> Ah, okay
23:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea Minecraft it self is more of a other weirdness. It‚Äôs basically open source but illegal to publish source
23:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's not open-source
23:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's written in Java. Nobody wants that code anywayüò¨
23:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> open-source guarantees you to have the right to modify the code
23:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can publish tooling to decompile Minecraft. And mojang provides mappings to restore method and class names.
23:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source
23:19 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> thats basically easy made reverse engineering, not open source
23:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok the it‚Äôs wrong word
23:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> source-available, maybe
23:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not reverse engineering
23:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Straight up official symbols
23:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You get full on code
23:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can also edit the code but do not publish the mojang code along sides your edits
23:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So imo you even have the right to modify the code
23:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well with your private copy u can do lot of stuff
23:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> With the public too
23:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean as soon as you made a private copy
23:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We need xxxx for lawyers day
23:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> To discuss grey zones xd
23:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> scrumplex already rq the convo because I talk too much bs about mc axaxaxa
23:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Every day is lawyer day when lawyer jopsti is here
23:27 < bridge> <Scrumplex> nah i was just getting ready for bed
23:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im trying that since 40 min alr
23:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im procrastinating sleep
23:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Whole new level laziness
23:30 < bridge> <Scrumplex> What do you mean here
23:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Every mc mod I see on GitHub is GPL
23:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Then there are also a few closed source projects. I wonder if you know some drama where people can not enforce their GPL
23:34 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Yeah but wdym by "they don't"
23:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah
23:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You said they don‚Äôt matter
23:34 < bridge> <Ewan> gjgnhgbgnfj
23:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I wonder if they really do not matter and if you have some stories
23:34 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> mixing a germanized way of saying "h√§ bist du dir sicher? immerhin: *content*" in english is confusing sometimes - happens to me aswell
23:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How to say it in English?
23:35 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Yeah what I meany is licenses don't matter if you use the code yourself and don't publish it. Like I can write a tool that uses GPL code and never release its source code as long as I don't release any binaries either
23:36 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Obviously once something is published you need to deal with licenses
23:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> are you sure they dont? since: *content*
23:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i think its just the order in which you say stuff that matter's here, the wording itself was correct
23:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Um oke too tired xd
23:37 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> fair enough :D
23:37 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> good night y'all!
23:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh yea of course
23:38 < bridge> <Scrumplex> GPL is quite interesting in the context of Minecraft.
23:38 < bridge> <Scrumplex> 
23:38 < bridge> <Scrumplex> There is no legal precedent about Minecraft mods' GPL enforceability, because they are effectively "linking" (using terms from the license text itself) against proprietary code
23:38 < bridge> <Scrumplex> 
23:38 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Though technically they do use a permissively licensed shim layer (like Fabric Intermediary Mappings)
23:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Closed source licenses is next level shit. As in the license text is closed source. So nobody can know the license.
23:39 < bridge> <Scrumplex> You know what is the worst OSI-approved "open source" license?
23:39 < bridge> <Scrumplex> MS-PL
23:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wat it do
23:40 < bridge> <Scrumplex> It is a copyleft license like the GPL. BUT it doesn't require you to disclose source code
23:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> GPL can like proprietary right? But not vice versa?
23:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What does it require?
23:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> GPL can link proprietary right? But not vice versa?
23:41 < bridge> <Scrumplex> This means you can't use MS-PL code in a GPL codebase, because both are viral.
23:41 < bridge> <Scrumplex> 
23:41 < bridge> <Scrumplex> But you can just make a MS-PL codebase proprietary
23:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs trol
23:41 < bridge> <Scrumplex> So it's easier and less headache to just keep it proprietary
23:41 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Nope. Both are disallowed
23:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh that‚Äôs news to me
23:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Interesting
23:42 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Though you can always bypass the GPL by doing things in runtime
23:42 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Licenses are always about distribution
23:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's unclear: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GNU_General_Public_License&oldid=1194394122#Linking_and_derived_works
23:42 < bridge> <Scrumplex> If the proprietary code is distributed separately and is loaded dynamically by the GPL code, then it's fine
23:43 < bridge> <learath2> How on earth is MSPL a copyleft license without disclosure requirements?
23:44 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Copyleft just means that you have to use the same license
23:44 < bridge> <Scrumplex> > https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1194411111110418524 @learath2

23:44 < bridge> <Scrumplex> How on earth is MSPL a copyleft license without disclosure requirements?
23:44 < bridge> <Scrumplex> 
23:44 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Copyleft just means that you have to keep using the same license
23:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that doesn't appear to be true: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft
23:44 < bridge> <scrumplex> Why did element break my reply
23:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I noticed too
23:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > Copyleft is the legal technique of granting certain freedoms over copies of copyrighted works with the requirement that the same rights be preserved in derivative works.
23:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It arrived fine then it broke later xd
23:46 < bridge> <Scrumplex> I guess Copyleft is specifically for freedoms then.
23:46 < bridge> <Scrumplex> 
23:46 < bridge> <Scrumplex> I guess just calling it viral then?
23:46 < bridge> <Scrumplex> If we just replaced freedoms with rights it would fit in
23:47 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Either way. MS-PL encourages proprietary code. It's worse than permissive IMO
23:51 < bridge> <Scrumplex> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_Source_Initiative
23:51 < bridge> <Scrumplex> 
23:51 < bridge> <Scrumplex> MS-PL is called Copyleft here.
23:51 < bridge> <Scrumplex> ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
23:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the citation in that sentence doesn't contain the word 'copyleft'
23:52 < bridge> <kaffeine0> > It also tracks commits by matricks again somehow
23:52 < bridge> <kaffeine0> GitHub matches committer/author email in the commits with all emails in users https://github.com/settings/emails. The commits from 2007 (teewars-0.3.0) have matricks current gmail address, so matricks's "contribution" could be easily tracked from the very first moment.
23:52 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Maybe matricks removed/hidden his gmail address from the account, and re-added the mail recently.
23:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but yea, the wikipedia page says so‚Ä¶
23:53 < bridge> <kaffeine0> > It also tracks commits by matricks again somehow
23:53 < bridge> <kaffeine0> GitHub matches committer/author email in the commits with all emails in users https://github.com/settings/emails. The commits from 2007 (teewars-0.3.0) have matricks current gmail address, so matricks's "contribution" could be easily tracked from the very first moment.
23:53 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Maybe matricks removed/hidden his gmail address from the account, and re-added it recently.
23:53 < bridge> <Scrumplex> True. Not sure. I think the definition is a bit fuzzy as it was mostly influenced by the GPL
23:54 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Copyleft for me just means that something has to retain its license
23:55 < bridge> <Scrumplex> I guess we could call MS-PL a hybrid license
23:55 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Or just Anti-GPL license ^^
