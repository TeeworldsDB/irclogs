13:50 <@heinrich5991> deen: sorry for bothering you, but it seems you're still the only one around who knows how to do releases. :/ could you do another one so that the username/password thing could be used on ddnet servers?
13:51 <@deen> heinrich5991: well, I'm the only one with a build server set up
13:51 <@deen> I don't really have time right now, maybe later this evening
13:51 <@heinrich5991> k, thanks
13:51 <@heinrich5991> deen: the build server is the thing that compiles for different OSs?
13:52 <@deen> yeah, just a script and a few build environments
14:21 <@deen> and a VM for Mac
14:21 <@deen> I could help someone else set that up if they're interested
14:22 <@deen> but releasing is not so difficult for me, a few min of work and a few min of checking that everything worked
14:23 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vy2Kt
14:23 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 4e39aea Dennis Felsing: Version 10.4.3
14:36 <@deen> heinrich5991: released
14:36 <@heinrich5991> thanks!
14:40 < necropotame> I will try to create a VM dedicated to releases for DDNet and TeeUniverse. Then one will just have to download it to execute the release script.
14:40 <@heinrich5991> maybe you could get an explanation from deen for that :)
14:41 <@heinrich5991> I'm also interested in that explanation, but don't have time right now ...
14:44 <@deen> I use this: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/ddnet-release.sh
14:44 <@deen> Windows works with archlinux mingw packages
14:44 <@deen> Linux is built in an old Debian chroot
14:45 <@deen> and Mac is a qemu VM
14:45 <@deen> oh, and android is currently disabled, would be great if someone could get sdl2 working
14:58 < Ryozuki> it's me the only one that can't connect to a ger server?
15:03 <@heinrich5991> I cannot connect
15:03 <@EastByte> yup, ddos
18:17 < Learath2> i wanted to do scripts/hash_passwords in nim :P
20:11 < Ryozuki> @Learath2, you got some questions :P https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4996
