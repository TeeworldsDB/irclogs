01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> I'll try this approach. Even though I have to do some research.
02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Not Keks do you ever delete some of your branch 😄 ?
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> way so many https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/branches
08:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I need chaos
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> hey, after updating ddnet, i wanted to test this new vulkan thingy, unfortunately my client won't start anymore. is there a problem with it?
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> drivers up to date
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what is your GPU?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> OS?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> exact driver version?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> wind10, gtx 1060 rog strix 6gb
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> and lemme check for the driver v
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> steam version?
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> is it ddnet 16.0.2 latest update?
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> hum, not the steam version, and i don't remember the exact version of the game
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> and as i cant open it anymore, i cant check
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> can you quickly download 16.0.2 from website and see if that works?
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> yep
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thanks
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @deen btw downloads say DDNet 16.0.1 but its download link is 16.0.2
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> there is only 16.0.1 on the website
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-16.0.2-win64.zip
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> here the header is wrong
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> alright
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> btw, driver version of the gpu : 512.15
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sounds good
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> same with this one
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok one last question, do you have many skins installed ?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> yes xD
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok,
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>  %appdata%/Teeworlds/settings_ddnet.cfg
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> open the file and remove `gfx_backend vulkan` from it
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> you can also PM the file to me maybe,
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do you remember where you downloaded the skins?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and how many are they?
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> from skin.tw, and +100,
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> from skin.tw, and +100
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> check your pm
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 100-1000 are not a lot 😄
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but 1000+ can get problematic xD
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> but I had some skins with high quality, and that can slow down the client
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah true
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean if you have time, rename skins directory to skins2 try vulkan again and see if that fixes it or not 😄
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then I know it is caused by this 😄
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> when the GPU is not available for around 2 seconds, windows sends a timeout with vulkan
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> I tried to remove most of the skins, but it's the same
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> oh ok thanks for testing
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> am i the only one with that issue?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not the only, but there are only very few
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and for some reason all nvidia, but other nvidia users have no problem
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its really random xd
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but since your driver is latest it should be fine actually :/
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> btw i also tested it on gtx 1060
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also on win10
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> weird stuff xD
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> 😅
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> if you figure out what's wrong, feel free to ask :greenthing:
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok 😄
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah you had fsaa on, that's something i should test to on my local gtx 1060
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> oh, it works without
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> i set the fsaa to 0 and it opens correctly
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 😮
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok THANKS alot
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> if i set it to 1, it works, but above it doessnt
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok thanks again
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> https://tenor.com/view/mr-bean-bean-rowan-atkinson-atkinson-smiling-gif-22135030
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think on 1, the vulkan backend ignores it
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> since only step 2 works
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 0, 2,4 and so on
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Not Keks you want me to test <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4937> on win7?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> would be nice yes
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> is it part of latest release?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> in game screenshots works !! ❤️
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/960195906450362448/screenshot_2022-04-03_17-15-14.png
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> lemme try video convert
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh wait, does this mean you dont have to unfocus and refocus ddnet to screenshot anymore?
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yes, the in game command screenshots works
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> :heartw:
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> video convert as well @Not Keks , nice works 😉
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/960196291793674300/deepdrag_2022-03-26_17-20-27.demo.mp4
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Would it be possible to have groups for the groups so they work as groups with subgroups (the current groups we have), so it's easier to manage them when you are using many of them
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Theoretically yes, would require some ddnet only extension for groups, or create something like a workspace for a map that contains additional data that is not saved inside the map file itself
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> But there is almost no editor work currently from anybody, so i dunno if this will ever happen
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Ok :<
