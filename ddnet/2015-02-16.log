00:17 <@deen> WolfAlex: pong
00:17 < WolfAlex> is is a bug that if i open 2 clients
00:17 < WolfAlex> and press strg + shift + q
00:17 < WolfAlex> that both clients are closed?
00:18 <@deen> no idea^^
00:18 <@deen> same in vanilla i guess
00:41 < eeeee> guess that was meant as a panic button
00:41 < eeeee> like when you're playing at work/school and then suddenly a boss/prof comes in
00:44 < eeeee> deen: graz on getting popular

15:46 < laxadedi> !en-fr test
15:46 < laxadedi> hummmmmm
15:50 < o_be_one> hellow :)
15:51 < laxadedi> !help
15:51 < laxadedi> someone disabled nimda on the channel ?
15:52 < Mahdi> Hello
15:52 < laxadedi> apparently deen banned her :(
15:52 < Mahdi> I have a problem
15:53 < Mahdi> in both ddnet 7 and 7.1 my fps would decrease after a while playing
15:54 <@deen> Mahdi: that's weird
15:54 <@deen> laxadedi: yeah, after nimda spammed all the time
15:55 < Mahdi> deen, yes, it didn't used to happen in older versions
15:55 < Mahdi> but in the 2 latest ones, it happens
15:55 < laxadedi> you can disable the plugin only ^^
15:55 <@deen> Mahdi: can you download an old version and check?
15:55 < Mahdi> deen, ok
15:55 <@deen> Mahdi: anyone else reporting this?
15:55 <@deen> i can't imagine what's causing this
15:56 < Mahdi> deen,  yes, I checked ddnet forum and somebody else had this issue too
15:56 <@deen> link?
15:57 < Mahdi> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1063
15:57 <@deen> he has the same with teeworlds vanilla
15:57 <@deen> so it's not a ddnet 7.0 problem
15:58 < Mahdi> I tried the default client and I didn't have the problem
15:58 < laxadedi> deen: !config ddnetstatus enabled no
15:58 < laxadedi> then you can unban nimda :p
15:58 < laxadedi> or I can remove the bot from the chan too
15:59 <@deen> well, i always forget how to unban too
15:59 <@deen>  /ban works, but /unban not, not very intuitive
15:59 < laxadedi> hummmm
15:59 <@deen> ah, it's /unban 1
16:00 < laxadedi> !config ddnetstatus enabled no/yes
16:00 < Nimda> You have to be an operator in this channel to use !config.
17:11 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
17:12 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
18:16 < Spyker> HELLO
18:19 <@EastByte> HI
19:20 < eeeee> deen: i think you should compile without websockets for distribution, as i can't imagine how could that be useful for anyone
19:20 < eeeee> the only thing it would do is increase the potential attack surface
19:22 < eeeee> you might want to release the server with websockets after i publish the js client and we establish some infrastructure for discovery of third party websocket servers
19:22 < eeeee> like a websockets master or something
19:22 <@deen> ok, sounds right. i already released without websockets^^
