11:52 < Hamid_Jigool> By default, Teeworlds compiles the game target, i.e. the client and server. Available targets are: - game (client and server) - client - server - tools - masterserver  E.g. to build the tools and master server in release mode use following arguments:  $ ../bam/bam conf=release tools masterserver
11:52 < Hamid_Jigool> is it realy?
12:01 < Hamid_Jigool> sorry im back

14:54 < Hamid_Jigool> hello again my dears :D
14:54 < Hamid_Jigool> i change my windows server to Linux
14:54 < Hamid_Jigool> now i run Sql DDnet server
14:55 < Hamid_Jigool> when that want to connect to localhost Mysql database send me this error
14:55 < Hamid_Jigool> MySQL Error: Access denied for user 'jahesh'@'localhost' (using password: NO)
14:55 < Hamid_Jigool> whats this? what can i do to fix it?
14:55 < Hamid_Jigool> please help me
14:55 < Hamid_Jigool> :-S
15:07 < Hamid_Jigool> im sorry im back
15:07 < Hamid_Jigool> anyone help me? :D
15:09 <+o_be_one> You have the error in the message : using password: NO
15:10 < Hamid_Jigool> what is this? Mysql user is root and it has password
15:12 <+o_be_one> yes but in your command line to log in you dont give password
15:12 <+o_be_one> and as use your use jahesh and not root
15:13 < Hamid_Jigool> no my linux user is jahes
15:13 < Hamid_Jigool> my Mysql user is root
15:13 <@heinrich5991> mysql says you tried to log in as *mysql* user jahesh
15:14 <@heinrich5991> you probably have to specify somewhere that you want to log in as root
15:14 < Hamid_Jigool> no
15:14 < Hamid_Jigool> see my config
15:14 < Hamid_Jigool> sv_sql_user "root"
15:14 < Hamid_Jigool> it use root in Tee Config
15:17 < Hamid_Jigool> im confus :((
15:22 < Hamid_Jigool> im creates user with name "jahesh" in mysql with all previlage but again show me this eror
15:22 < Hamid_Jigool> ah :-(
15:24 <+o_be_one> Hamid_Jigool: we have translated the error you have for you, now you are able to seek why it works like that :)
15:24 <+o_be_one> yes cause you dont enter a password
15:25 < Hamid_Jigool> what? im set password for that... i set for it again now
15:25 < Hamid_Jigool> :|
15:27 <+o_be_one> mysql server side is possibly ok, your error says that the clients who's connecting to mysql server doesnt give all informations
15:27 <+o_be_one> so it could be that ddnet doesnt use login and password to login your mysql server
15:28 < Hamid_Jigool> this mean DDnet have some problem with that?
15:29 <+o_be_one> maybe your conf file is not correct, cause DDNet runs this kind of conf
15:32 < Hamid_Jigool> see my conf: http://pastebin.com/HaPWmjuJ
15:33 < Hamid_Jigool> is that have problem?
15:34 <+o_be_one> ive never used mysql feature i have to say
15:35 <+o_be_one> if you remove sv_sql_user it must use nameless
15:35 <+o_be_one> maybe try to see if it understand your conf
15:35 <@heinrich5991> you should change your passwords now
15:35 <+o_be_one> if you edit your conf with Windows and use linux to host your server, things like that could happen :/
15:35 <@heinrich5991> if you have that on an online server
15:36 <+o_be_one> the password is "test" x)
15:36 <+o_be_one> something like that, i think he will not keep it :p
15:36 < Hamid_Jigool> no i chane it to test
15:36 < Hamid_Jigool> :D
15:37 < Hamid_Jigool> huummmm
15:37 < Hamid_Jigool> im dont instaled some plugin like libmysql
15:37 < Hamid_Jigool> on linux
15:37 < Hamid_Jigool> maybee for that?
15:40 < Hamid_Jigool> no.... im change the password and test it again
15:41 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: I ment the rcon passwords
15:42 < Hamid_Jigool> i must change my rcon pass?
15:42 <@heinrich5991> if you use those rcon passwords on a real server, yes. becuase all the people in this channel now know those passwords
15:43 < Hamid_Jigool> aha... its no problem... in this time server not run by mysql
15:43 < Hamid_Jigool> how people join us?
15:43 < Hamid_Jigool> :|
15:43 <+o_be_one> you have a sql error, so there's a client that is asking to connect to your mysql server, so your linux has what is needed to connect to sql (prob mysql-client)
15:44 <+o_be_one> try mysql -h localhost -u USER -p
15:44 < Hamid_Jigool> sudo apt-get install (get me name of a mysql-client.. thank xD)
15:44 <+o_be_one> dont add password at the end of line it will ask
15:44 <+o_be_one> change USER by root or other existing user
15:44 <+o_be_one> you already have mysqlclient
15:44 <+o_be_one> cause ddnet is able to contact your mysql server
15:45 < Hamid_Jigool> mysql -h localhost -u jahesh -p
15:45 <+o_be_one> the error you have is not "i cant contact a mysql server" but "i've connecter to mysql server, it asked me for user, ive say 'jahesh', it asked for password, i've let it blank"
15:45 <+o_be_one> yes Hamid_Jigool you can try that you can reach your sql server by this way
15:45 <+o_be_one> you'll enter mysql cli
15:47 < Hamid_Jigool> when i use "mysql -h localhost -u jahesh -p" it ask me password.. i type it and connect | mysql>
15:47 < Hamid_Jigool> so now what can i do? :|
15:48 < Hamid_Jigool> so you say that i must remove password of jahesh?
15:48 < Hamid_Jigool> i leave it blank for DDnet?
15:48 < Hamid_Jigool> :|
15:52 <+o_be_one> so you're SQL is ok
15:52 <+o_be_one> i havent said you MUST remove, i've said you can try to see what will happend
15:53 <+o_be_one> your SQL server works, and your linux is ready to query it, your problem is really about ddnet conf
15:53 <+o_be_one> do you edit your conf by Windows (maybe using Filezilla) ?
15:53 < Hamid_Jigool> maybe its for bad compile?
15:53 < Hamid_Jigool> ye
15:54 < Hamid_Jigool> by filezilla
15:54 <+o_be_one> maybe you just have shitty windows cars that Linux is not able to understand
15:54 <+o_be_one> you can try dos2unix your conf file
15:55 <+o_be_one> what is the editor you use, Hamid_Jigool ?
15:55 <+o_be_one> by filezila, notepad++ ?
15:55 < Hamid_Jigool> notpad++
15:58 <+o_be_one> well idk very well notepad++, but look how to use it with UTF8 charset
15:58 <+o_be_one> it could help
15:59 < Hamid_Jigool> its UTF8 without BOM
16:00 <+o_be_one> thats curious that it not reads your sql conf line
16:01 < Hamid_Jigool> so i must change it to UTF8?
16:02 < Hamid_Jigool> i change it but again show me error
16:02 <+o_be_one> yes you have to use UTF8
16:02 < Hamid_Jigool> i change it but again error
16:02 <+o_be_one> and maybe that Notepad++ have what is needed to check its in unix format
16:03 < Hamid_Jigool> sudo nano autoexec.cfg ---->> can i create a file by this command that created by linux?
16:05 < Hamid_Jigool> oooh yeee
16:05 < Hamid_Jigool> i creat config file by linux
16:05 < Hamid_Jigool> error change to : [16-01-25 10:05:07][server]: failed to load map. mapname='Kobra 4'
16:09 < Hamid_Jigool> it dont read autoexec_server.cfg .... why?
16:13 <+o_be_one> the start command is like "./ddnet -f YOUCONF.cfg"
16:48 < Hamid_Jigool> sorryy.. i was afk
16:49 < Hamid_Jigool> i fix it but
16:49 < Hamid_Jigool> again show me 
16:49 < Hamid_Jigool> [16-01-25 10:48:21][SQL]: MySQL Error: Access denied for user 'jahesh'@'localhost' (using password: NO)
16:49 < Hamid_Jigool> i created autoexec_server.cfg by linux
16:49 < Hamid_Jigool> but again show me error
16:50 <+o_be_one> are you sure the ddnet server load this file ?
16:51 < Hamid_Jigool> yes
16:51 <+o_be_one> what happens if you do the start command (maybe ./ddnet) with -f parameter like ./ddnet -f autoexec_server.cfg ?
16:51 < Hamid_Jigool> i teke you log
16:51 <+o_be_one> k
16:56 < Hamid_Jigool> sorry im dropet
16:57 < Hamid_Jigool> http://pastebin.com/9Yyv0M30
16:57 < Hamid_Jigool> here my log
16:58 < Hamid_Jigool> see that
17:00 < laxadedi> Hamid_Jigool: server log ?
17:00 < laxadedi> you are trying to use mysql and you don't use a password
17:00 < laxadedi> apparently, either you need to setup a password on your mysql account
17:00 < laxadedi> or maybe the function isn't working with an empty password
17:01 < Hamid_Jigool> Mysql (user: jahesh , pass: test123@hamin)
17:02 < Hamid_Jigool> i set for that passs but show me this error
17:02 < laxadedi> change your password now
17:02 < laxadedi> x)
17:03 < laxadedi> try to do: `mysql -u root -p`
17:03 < laxadedi> then type your password
17:03 < laxadedi> if that works correctly
17:03 < laxadedi> then you forgot to configure the mysql password in your server configuration file
17:03 < Hamid_Jigool> corently work... ask me pass and succesful login
17:03 < laxadedi> then you forgot mysql line in your config file
17:04 < Hamid_Jigool> you mean autoexec_server.cfg?
17:04 < laxadedi> the configuration file used with your -f yes
17:05 < laxadedi> on ddrace server the option is called `sv_sql_pw`
17:05 < laxadedi> maybe it's different on ddnet
17:05 < Hamid_Jigool> http://pastebin.com/HaPWmjuJ
17:05 < Hamid_Jigool> see my config
17:05 < laxadedi> you should find out that configuration name
17:05 < Hamid_Jigool> my config is ok
17:05 < Hamid_Jigool> see that
17:05 < Hamid_Jigool> so now what?
17:06 < laxadedi> use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost
17:06 < laxadedi> that might be that
17:06 < laxadedi> without quotes
17:06 < laxadedi> anyway, gotta go
17:06 < Hamid_Jigool> ok let me test it
17:06 < laxadedi> maybe that all your settings have the correct key name
17:07 < laxadedi> And PLEASE, Stop pasting sensitive information
17:07 < laxadedi> that's really really bad thing to do no matter what
17:07 < laxadedi> especially on a public IRC channel
17:07 < Hamid_Jigool> my server is lock :D
17:08 < laxadedi> yeah, you'll forget to change rcon password and will have trouble later on :D
17:08 < laxadedi> You should never do it, point.
17:08 < laxadedi> HF & GL :)
17:08 < Hamid_Jigool> no my server dont be start currently yet.. i have mysql error :)
17:09 < Hamid_Jigool> nop
