01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meow~> hey guys i reinstalled windows and since then i cant start tw
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meow~> im getting this message

08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 @Not Keks another with av1 support
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I need
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://hurl.dev/
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> found this today
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> made in rust
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a rly simple language to test http endpoints
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> poggers
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> curl-like
10:46 <+ChillerDragon> So who wants to explain int packing to me? :) Seems like calling AddInt() can produce something that is between 1 and 4 bytes big o.O
10:46 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds/blob/858107875d51d3e5278847fa12d64ca14832be24/src/engine/shared/compression.cpp#L7-L29 this does not really help me ._.
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> Oh wait i think i got it the comment is actually really helpful. Its n amount of bytes and every bytes first bit says if there is another one coming? And the very first byte has a additional sign bit
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> Wow does that mean that the tw protocol can pack smol numbers in one byte and big ass long long long numbers in x amount of bytes? I mean it probably breaks if it overflows a integer due to the usage of the ``int`` type in the C++ code. But it looks like the tw protocol it self supports very big numbers o.O
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> did i get that correctly?
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's the idea. Smol number dont need to waste 4 entire byte
10:52 <+ChillerDragon> poggers protocol
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you understand the idea or should I explain btw?
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> is what i explained correct? if yes im good
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes is correct. Only thing I'd add is that the LSBs end up in the MSBs in the packed format. So reading visually you wouldn't read left to right 😄
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> LSB wot 
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> also signed bit 1 is negative right?
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Least significant bit
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep
11:00 <+ChillerDragon> BIT!?
11:00 <+ChillerDragon> not byte?
11:01 <+ChillerDragon> so the integer ``2`` gets packed as the bits ``00000010`` or ``01000000``
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Byte, byte, byte. Sorryyy I just woke up 😄
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> ok so for numbers < 255 nothing weird? :)
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> as soon as its two bytes big it gets swapped
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> i see
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> thanks a lot
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well no
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> wot
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Only 6 bits fit in the first packed byte
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> ah true
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So not 255
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> yea i see
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> wait i need to know the number
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> 127 ?
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> ``01111111`` is 127
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 2^6
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> ah no not 7
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> 6
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> so 63
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> First byte also has sign
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> ``00111111``
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> yeye
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> wanted to test u
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> lov u babe
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes up until that, nothing weird. After that you'll get 10111111 00000001
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 10000000 00000001 that is, sorry :/
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> ye ima do if num < 63 :D and todo "10000000 00000001" thanks :)
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can just check the extended bit of the first byte. If it's not set, no magic
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> they call me the ascii artist
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1667556717.png
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> Now i finally understand how I could get away without doing int packing and unpacking because the packed numbers 0-63 are basically the normal integers 0-63
11:17 <+ChillerDragon> hm maybe i didnt get it yet. My packer give me 3 as result for packing 3 and packing -1
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's twos complement at work
11:20 <+ChillerDragon> ok poggers got it working 
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> i now can do postivie and negative numbers from -63 to 63 ... i think
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> im so gonna sell a book on this topic
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> -1 = 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So you also invert the bits before you pack them, otherwise -1 would need 4 bytes instead of 1 like we planned
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For negatives that is
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> na i aint inverting stuff yet because i only support 1 byte numbers
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to, for 1 byte negatives too
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> so my -1 is 01000001
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> i say its minus with second bit and i say its 1, no?
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Your -1 should be 01000000 😄
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> fak why
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> what is -0 then? xd
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Check the libtw2 docs
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Two's complement
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is no -0
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> omg xd
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> m life is lie
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are sign and magnitude representations that do have a -0 tho I know no implementation that uses them 😛
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bincode has some pretty good ideas too
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1038036565676539974/image.png
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/bincode-org/bincode/blob/trunk/docs/spec.md#intencoding>
11:28 <+ChillerDragon> okay fixed thanks 
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess their varint wastes a little space but is more performant as a result
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > A compact encoder / decoder pair that uses a binary zero-fluff encoding scheme. The size of the encoded object will be the same or smaller than the size that the object takes up in memory in a running Rust program.
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 it doesnt waste space
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/bincode-org/bincode
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Bincode is invariant over byte-order, making an exchange between different architectures possible. It is also rather space efficient, as it stores no metadata like struct field names in the output format and writes long streams of binary data without needing any potentially size-increasing encoding.
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, am I misreading the scheme? That literal 251 there in the first case wastes the first byte.
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the literal is part of the value
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How could it be? Not all numbers in that range end with the bit pattern 251
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It looks to me like u between 251 and 2^16 get encoded to 3 bytes?
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I'll read it later but I don't get how this can be strictly smaller size than the int itself
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm not sure now
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe they misdocumented it. I'll just look at the code later
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like what gamers use is this anyway
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/google/flatbuffers
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Protobufwhen?
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> flatbuffers is better than protobuf for games
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I always thought protobuf was too thick of a library
12:22 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 are you interested in a dump where your dissector marked a vanilla 0.7 servers resend request as malformed? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1667560928.png
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> You probably never tested that since its a unhappy path. My client sent a broken startinfo packet and thus the server responded in a unsual way
12:26 <+ChillerDragon> here it is in case you want it :) https://zillyhuhn.com/tmp/srv_request_resend_startinfo.pcap
13:47 <+ChillerDragon> GetString and GetInt is a bit inconsistent huh? Should be either GetStr and GetInt or GetString and GetIneteger ._.
13:48 <+ChillerDragon> or maybe consistent in the C++ world with ``std::string`` and ``int``
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: yes, I'm interested
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do report bugs for these
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is there a reason we ship integration_test.sh with our release?
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I would guess it's accidental
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we also ship the .supp files
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> let me check
14:38 <+ChillerDragon> yay ddnet shipping bash code poggers
14:38 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 do you need an issue in libtw2 or are you good now with what i sent?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/issues/66
14:40 <+ChillerDragon> ah good
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon why is 0.7 so important to you btw?
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I mean, if u just want to port the good stuff from 0.7, why not simply do that?
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oy been inactive for over 6 months again.
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> To me 0.7 compability is a step backwards, since then we have another outdated network impl
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Instead why not make ddnets network better, invest time in the next gen
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He is a unionist
15:24 <+ChillerDragon> yes what learath said
15:24 <+ChillerDragon> idc about 0.7 i dont even like the protocol changes xd
15:24 <+ChillerDragon> i just want one united community and be able to play ctf again :)
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok chillerdragon ❤️ unite the world
15:25 <+ChillerDragon> UwU
15:25 <+ChillerDragon> also jopstar can i crash on your couch -15% amd stonk is costing me da rent
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u still have them?
15:26 <+ChillerDragon> yes
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Didn't the 7xxx announcement go well for them?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i guess their ryzen cpus are too bad
15:27 <+ChillerDragon> i sold all my orangs that were mostly usless anyways and my moms life insurance to buy more amd
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in 7 days the datacenter stuff comes
15:27 <+ChillerDragon> okok
15:27 <+ChillerDragon> i will find more moni and rebuy then 
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
15:27 <+ChillerDragon> thanks financial advisor jopstar
15:28 <+ChillerDragon> ima turn off irc now to save electricity cost
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought their pricing was extremely competitive, especially for gaming
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the CPUs are rather expensive actually
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the 5000 series was much better value
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was talking about gpus
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah cpus are out there
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They need to bump them down if they want to compete
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> GPUs are fine, basically like always
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not the best
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not the worst
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> good price
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Their flagship pretty much matches 4090 amost, uses only 300W, isn't the size of my forearm and is 400$ cheaper MSRP. I think that's a great deal
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but RTX still behind quite a bit
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tho I guess their RT performance is still shit and they don't have good fake upscale like nvidia
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ^^
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway, to me the new GPUs are defs attractive, but the stock market is a thing for itself anyway
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But on the other hand. I don't like ai upscale magic so that's a small downside to me 😄
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the stock market doesnt really reflect if AMD will make more money 😄
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tbh i also dunno if i like or dislike it
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but given how fast AI improves, it might just be a matter of time until i like it
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I do love RT tho, sad that amd is so fat behind
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Far*
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I also would have loved to see better productivity performance, but amd just doesnt seem to care about that at all
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they do a lot actually
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rocm is a killer
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its simply not polished enough yet
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> especially not used in enough software yet
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe they need to advertise better 😛
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd say AMD is actually a really good software company
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> FSR is used by so many games
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> DLSS could only dream of it xD
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But FSR is a far cry from dlss 2.0
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dlss 2.0 looks like pure magic with it's temporal reuse
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes we'll see with FSR 3 in 2023
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dlss 3.0 looks ugly asf tho. The fake frames are so bad imo
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I tried using rocm with hip once but my gpu didn't support it.
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mine does
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> finally good blender performance xD
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5917
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Review again ty
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> This will allow to know the most famous skins kek
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And 0.7 players
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd love to use that information to display a tee here too
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1038116423802826752/image.png
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but the space is already pretty small
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1038116975420911666/image.png
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i made a ddnet_settings.cfg vim syntax file
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its highlighted
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> sheeeeesh
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You can even show it in the afk position if its afk
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And also the team
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it means master will work more slowly right :troll:
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I would personally rather see the tee than best time
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> player flag can be much smaller for sure
17:03 <+ChillerDragon> YO RUBY DEVS! The library yall been waiting for: https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds-client
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont like ruby
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ppl say rust has weird syntax, they havent looked at ruby
17:05 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok ruby devs
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://tenor.com/view/palla-deserto-desert-hot-gif-6014273
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ok ruby devs
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://tenor.com/view/palla-deserto-desert-hot-gif-6014273
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but cool idea chiller
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this will allow me to maybe write the same on rust
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> understanding the protocol can be a bit tedious
17:06 <+ChillerDragon> im protocol pro now
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chiller
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> put this on the wikipedia
17:06 <+ChillerDragon> da
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wiki.ddnet.org
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> under resources article
17:07 <+ChillerDragon> its not ready for publish quite yet
17:07 <+ChillerDragon> but i got other stuff for that
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Resources#Tool_and_libraries
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its ok
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if its not ready
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just put it there
17:07 <+ChillerDragon> ah wait
17:07 <+ChillerDragon> u got al my other stuff alr xd
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
17:07 <+ChillerDragon> i thought nobody knew swarfeys undergound typehack project
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> @Not Keks i get `vulkan: warning: requested presentation mode was not available. falling back to mailbox / fifo relaxed.` spammed on console when i start the client. what is it?
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can u send me ur blog post link
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that means wayland doest support immediate mode yet
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> these nobos
17:08 <+ChillerDragon> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/
17:08 <+ChillerDragon> that one is also very WIP
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> the merge request u sent?
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this happens when u tab out
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> minimize the window, or resize it etc
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chiller
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can you put a published date
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on the blog
17:09 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki the thing is my ruby lib is so WIP i might change the repo name etc 
17:09 <+ChillerDragon> i did
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> important for the future
17:09 <+ChillerDragon> put 2022
17:09 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:09 <+ChillerDragon> at the bottom
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i need a more exact
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for ordering in the wiki
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there are more 2022 posts
17:09 <+ChillerDragon> can i update on edit?

17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     Tue, 01 Nov 2022 07:34:30 GMT
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill use this for now
17:10 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:10 <+ChillerDragon> oke
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can update it if u want
17:10 <+ChillerDragon> ok so i do nothing for now :D
17:11 <+ChillerDragon> that wiki collection is rly cool! 
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u request a archive.org archive?
17:11 <+ChillerDragon> wot?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in case u disappear
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> archive.org stays forever
17:11 <+ChillerDragon> so does github right?
17:12 <+ChillerDragon> my blog is not that cool yet i dont mind it being lost if all my devices and github explode at the same time
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i requested one
17:12 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> archive.org has more posibilities
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://web.archive.org/web/20221104161218/https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/
17:13 <+ChillerDragon> pog
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i think i should make our frontend aware of all 4 modes anyway
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mailbox might actually be interesting for ppl that dont want the dealy of vsync but no tearing
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mailbox might actually be interesting for ppl that dont want the delay of vsync but no tearing
17:15 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki wow this is rly good https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Resources#Tool_and_libraries ! whats the advertisement strategy for this at the moment?
17:17 <+ChillerDragon> LAMO my weebly website is there hahahaha
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Wdym by advert
17:18 <+ChillerDragon> how do ppl find this nice resource list?
17:19 <+ChillerDragon> how do you promote it?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Click wiki button on the ddnet client
17:20 <+ChillerDragon> It has rly good stuff. And i feel many of those things are not found by ppl that are interested because they belive it does not exist
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Or the wiki link on the ddnet page
17:20 <+ChillerDragon> ok so the wiki is advertised by ddnet ye i see
17:20 <+ChillerDragon> lool this is cool! https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/DDRaceNetwork
17:20 <+ChillerDragon> arch pog
17:22 <+ChillerDragon> it feels like all the stuff is quite recent. Is this because the wiki is new and the old stuff wasnt added yet or is forgotten already? Or did the tw community produce more content in the last 2 years than in the last 20 years?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> This existed before the current wiki
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I think some stuff is already ported
17:25 <+ChillerDragon> yea but i mean the content in the wiki is overall very new
17:25 <+ChillerDragon> but yea maybe the old stuff is not that interesting anyways
17:26 <+ChillerDragon> like a 0.5 serverinfo tool written in pascal or something like that xd
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Macos ci failed on my pr kek
17:27 <+ChillerDragon> :apple: :troll:
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its so weird
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i wonder if macos finds a different python install than the one from brew
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why is macos always broken 😦
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2139911
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Bug 2139911 (CVE-2022-43995) - CVE-2022-43995 sudo: heap-based overflow with very small passwords
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> overflow kek
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ... rust? kek
17:28 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:28 <+ChillerDragon> go ryo rewrite sudo in rust
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Sudo 1.8.0 through 1.9.12, with the crypt() password backend, contains a plugins/sudoers/auth/passwd.c array-out-of-bounds error that can result in a heap-based buffer over-read. This can be triggered by arbitrary local users with access to Sudo by entering a password of seven characters or fewer. The impact could vary depending on the compiler and processor architecture.
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> already exists
17:30 <+ChillerDragon> okay next project rewrite tw client in bash
17:30 <+ChillerDragon> but udp is hard in bash
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> learn elixir
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or nim
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> write a verified tw server in some language
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe coq
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> distributed ddnet using erlang
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> BEAM
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> nobody knows it, i added it there myself welp
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> (plug https://github.com/swarfey/tw-chatonly/)
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I find it a bit weird that you called the npm package teeworlds
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Lol true
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> xd was pretty tired when i took that name and i thought since nobody else took it, why not take it
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it's not teeworlds, it's just some third-party library implementing parts of the teeworlds protocol
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 maybe u should reserve ddnet and teeworlds on crates.io xd
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> yes, i understand that, its the first time anybody saying something about the npmjs name now tho
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> name it deenworlds
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> if you want to create a npmjs package and name your package that, i can free it for you but i doubt many people will
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I reserved ddnet while I made the rust PR
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> nobody knows it, i added it there myself
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> Can someone say that to the dude who blocks "teeworlds" ruby lib name since 2013 with masterserver stuff xd https://rubygems.org/gems/teeworlds
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could probably contact the author
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> doubt he is still alive
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> that was 2013 he probably is a grandpa now
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> true, he probably still knows jesus
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why are u a ruby fan now chiller?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as far as im aware its not typed and slow
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> always have been
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> its not typed
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> but still faster than python
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> chiller only uses languages that remind him that he is rich
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> yea the missing types make me really nervouse
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> DIAMONDS!
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> FAKIN SHINY RICH ASS DIAMONDS > some rust
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> change my mind
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I now also did teeworlds on crates.io, although that is probably unneeded
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> look at my amazing library collection: https://crates.io/users/heinrich5991
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> weird flex
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://crates.io/users/edg-l
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im more famous
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://crates.io/users/edg-l?sort=downloads>
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> rustfluencer
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my top crate has 3400 downloads
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> if you actually want to create a worthy npmjs package, i can free it for you but i doubt anyone will
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> all bos
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> t
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://lib.rs/~edg-l/dash
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://lib.rs/~heinrich5991/dash
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 lib.rs has this neat feature
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it tells u badly maintained crates
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> thats nice
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 can u do cargo owner --add edg-l
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on ddnet and teeworlds
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just in case kek
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> lmao
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> was about to say it
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> +1 ryo for president
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bus factor 2
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> instead of 1
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> ryo is so gonna publish hentai on teeworlds crate if he gets access hrhrhrhr
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> frfr
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wanna brag! my top crate (on a different account) has >100k downloads 🙂
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What crate is it?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hidding stuff uh
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's kinda connecting my identities
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A second life as a superhero. FOSSman
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha
18:15 <+ChillerDragon> lmao
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Someone want to let https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6006 in? Then CI is fixed again
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just also saw it by chance
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes 🙂
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I often dont bors r+ stuff cuz i dont wanna mess up in case i missed smtg
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But i always see heinrich do it so
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you mean?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're not supposed to r+ your own stuff if you mean that
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> LGTM!
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I mean otherw
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Otherw
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Omfg mobile
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1038153319727763466/unknown.png
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I review the code but i often dont bors cuz i think i may miss smth
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you review the code and think it's fine, you can try doing bors r+ 😉
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest: ok
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Be bold! As the wikipedia says :BASED:
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold>
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mfw I need to take a test on 60 pages of chemical lab safety document because the computer labs and the chemical labs can be accessed with the same authorization
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Lmao
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> huge merge incoming
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Why would someone want to keep a "linear history" in git
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It makes prs so annoying
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/hurl/pull/952
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I lost my will to proceed further tbh
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Also just noticed its a repo from Orange
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The isp lmao
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a linear git history might make it easier to understand bisecting
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But everytime master changes u require all open prs to rebase
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Crazy
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> This can become a never ending tail chasing
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If the pr author takes its time
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it's weird that they ask the PR author to do i
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it's weird that they ask the PR author to do it
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they could rebase themselves
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which they can't because they apparently also want the commit to be signed by the PR author
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but at that point they're just shooting themselves in the foot
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> they can rebase commits without changing the authorship
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not without breaking the signature
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise the signature would be worthless
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> damn
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> was wondering what H-M-H was up to
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he is making a whole OS in rust
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/H-M-H/Weylus
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 4 sponsors pog
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not  OS
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> got confused
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >Weylus turns your tablet or smart phone into a graphic tablet/touch screen for your computer!
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Weylus in action with Xournal++:
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a fellow rust enjoyer
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> couldn't play osu! on it tho. The latency would be too high
