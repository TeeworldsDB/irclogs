00:13 < savander> Hi
00:16 < savander> v
00:17 <@deen> hi
00:17 <@deen> savander: try out opus!
00:17 < savander> g
00:17 < savander> Im on phone now :c
00:19 < savander> Btw what it do?
00:19 < savander> It makes map lighter?
00:20 <@deen> it's the replacement for wavpack in map sounds
00:20 < savander> With less audii quality?
00:20 <@deen> yes, much smaller maps
00:20 <@deen> quality is good
00:21 < savander> Ahm, so i'll save map.with this codec
00:21 < savander> Yes?
00:21 < laxa> !fr-de redevance
00:21 <@deen> yes
00:21 < Nimda> Translation: Geb√ºhren
00:21 <@deen> hm
00:21 <@deen> you save audio files with the codec
00:21 <@deen> and then you put the opus audio inside the map
00:21 <@deen> and it's small and with music!
00:21 < savander> Ahh
00:21 < savander> :p
00:21 < savander> :ppp
00:22 < savander> Nice :3
00:22 < savander> So now i'll make guitar
00:22 < savander> In teewprlds
00:22 < savander> Or piano xd
00:22 <@deen> ^^
00:22 < savander> Or not!
00:22 < savander> ?
00:22 < savander> Its possible to play music
00:23 < savander> Wheb you enter area?
00:23 <@deen> not when you enter
00:23 <@deen> but the music can be restricted to an area
00:23 <@deen> so you don't hear it outside of there
00:23 <@deen> when you're too far away
00:23 < savander> Ye i know that
00:23 < savander> Hmm :D
00:24 < savander> Ok, so lets make welcome message
00:24 < savander> For ddnet xD
00:24 <@deen> ^^
00:24 < savander> Not rly hard
00:24 < savander> Eastbyte, do it !
00:25 <@deen> he's sleeping!
00:25 < savander> Record your.voice
00:25 < savander> Meh
00:25 < savander> ;D
00:26 < savander> But
00:27 < savander> It should have option, when you enter area then music will be played
00:27 < savander> :pp
00:27 <@deen> switches are server-only, music/images client-only
00:27 <@deen> so that's a bit difficult
00:27 < savander> Ah :c
00:28 < savander> But no switchers, just when you into this area  with music
00:29 < savander> Then it will be played
00:29 < savander> Nvm, have to go
00:29 <@deen> good night
00:29 < savander> Im tired ;p
00:29 < savander> Bye :)

09:31 < hannibal> well, i'm starving
09:58 < laxadedi> Don't you have breakfast or something if you are hungry ?
10:02 < hannibal> at the office, but yes, i found something :D
10:03 <@deen> maybe i should just remove it, before more people get the idea to make wavpack maps
10:04 <@deen> release*, not remove

10:06 <@deen> good morning
10:06 <@EastByte> deen: does the vote option balance thing work?
10:06 <@deen> EastByte: you didn't test it!?
10:06 <@deen> i tested a bit and it seemed to work
10:06 <@EastByte> I did...
10:06 <@deen> i even tested on a real ddnet server!
10:06 <@EastByte> good :)
10:08 < laxadedi> xD
10:12 < Tobii> deen: what bit- and samplerate should i use for the opus files? dont sounds very well for me and sometimes skips 1-2 seconds...
10:13 < KinG_> hi all
10:13 <@deen> Tobii: oh? that sounds bad
10:13 <@deen> it worked for me with any file i threw at it
10:13 <@deen> can you send me the file?
10:18 < Tobii> deen: join the server i'm on
10:19 <@deen> 5 MB wow^^
10:19 < Tobii> ^^
10:19 < Tobii> with smaller files it also didn't work
10:20 < xRoThx_> Yo

10:51 < hannibal> did you add this emote selection next to the emoticons? :D
10:51 <@deen> no
10:51 < hannibal> oh so sad
10:51 < hannibal> :D
10:51 <@deen> no one even asked unsigned char* if we may take it
10:52 < hannibal> this is true. i saw him online just yesterday
10:52 < hannibal> but i know that i would use them all the time. but there's no hurry 
10:55 < GoJEGrEEN> hi deen 
10:55 <@deen> hi GoJEGrEEN 
10:56 < GoJEGrEEN> in which commit you add this ? int CSound::DecodeOpus(int SampleID, const void *pData, unsigned DataSize)
10:56 < GoJEGrEEN> i cant find that commit
10:56 <@deen> don't know, not long ago
10:56 <@deen> it was in the sound branch
10:56 <@deen> so it was a merge commit in the ddrace64 branch
10:56 <@deen> i have to go again, GoJEGrEEN. you always come at bad times^^
10:56 <@deen> bye

12:25 < nuborn> hi
12:32 < cris272> hi nuborn
13:27 < KinG_> hi all
14:32 < DoNe> hi
14:33 < DoNe> has somebody added a tile to a map layer for server?
14:33 < DoNe> i wonder why entities are created with the layer as argument if the index is right
14:34 < DoNe> they could be only created if the tile is in the right layer
14:37 < DoNe> code can be found there: game/server/mapcontroller.cpp IGameController::OnEntity
14:38 < DoNe> gamecontroller.cpp*
14:51 < DoNe> hi bear
14:51 < BeaR> hey
14:52 < DoNe> have u added a map tile to server?
14:52 < BeaR> huh?
14:52 < DoNe> uhm i wonder if you already added a new mapping tile for server
14:53 < BeaR> In ddnet or generally if I have ever done this :D?
14:53 < DoNe> generally
14:53 < BeaR> y
14:53 < DoNe> i wonder why entities are created with the layer as argument if the index is right
14:53 < DoNe>  they could be only created if the tile is in the right layer
14:54 < DoNe> game/server/gamecontroller.cpp IGameController::OnEntity line 335
14:55 < DoNe> a dragger will be created if the index of the tile is right and the layer the tile is in will be given to the entitiy
14:55 < DoNe> the entity will only do something if it is in the right layer
14:55 < DoNe> thats dump
14:56 < BeaR> this is only for dragger, isn't it?
14:57 < DoNe> this line is only for dragger
14:57 < DoNe> i dont know if any other tile has this index
14:57 < DoNe> ah could be that the dragger has to work in game and front layer
14:58 < BeaR> not sure, never worked with draggers, would need to dive deeper in the source (:
14:59 < DoNe> i just gonna check if the layer is right before i add my new entity
14:59 < DoNe> why should i create useless objects
15:07 < BeaR> could be also added due to differ projectiles from normal weapons and draggers, dunno \o/
17:03 <@EastByte> yay back home

19:37 <@EastByte> but eur is located in fra :P
19:49 <@deen> laxa: i killed FRA
19:49 <@deen> don't want so many servers in europe
19:52 < laxa> when was FRA removed from the json list ?

19:54 < Nimda_1716> DDNet Chile went down!
19:55 < Nimda_1716> DDNet Chile went back online!
20:12 <@deen> laxa: yesterday night, i wrote something like "cleaned up the servers!"
20:15 <@deen> EastByte: can't trigger the bug =/
20:20 <@EastByte> okay, I created a new tw root ant put everything fresh from ddnet master in it
20:20 <@EastByte> now it doesn't crash
20:20 <@deen> ok, good
20:20 <@EastByte> but
20:20 <@EastByte> the map sound fucked up :/
20:21 <@deen> =/
20:21 <@EastByte> only hear scratch noises
20:21 <@deen> i don't have any problems
20:22 <@EastByte> ahhh
20:22 <@EastByte> I understand
20:22 <@EastByte> deen: can you join my server?
20:23 <@deen> can't find you
20:23 <@EastByte> oh im nameless
20:23 <@deen> nice, segfaulted^^
20:24 <@EastByte> I'm pretty sure about the problem
20:24 <@deen> yes?!
20:24 <@EastByte> the noises stop when I reach the start line
20:24 <@EastByte> I have 1200 min servertime
20:24 <@deen> oh
20:25 <@EastByte> so the audio bugs after some time
20:25 <@EastByte> but why does it crash
20:25 < xRoThx_> Is it possible to remake Teeworlds in Java? 
20:25 < xRoThx_> Or is that kind off impossible
20:25 <@EastByte> it's possible yes
20:26 < xRoThx_> Nobody ever tried? Because I think Java is easyer 
20:27 <@EastByte> there were people who tried
20:27 <@EastByte> but it's much work
20:27 <@deen> well, i would never have started ddnet if teeworlds was written in java
20:28 < xRoThx_> Why not? 
20:28 <@EastByte> java can be really painful
20:28 <@EastByte> and it's not the kind of language developers want to use
20:28 <@deen> and it wouldn't run well on my computer
20:29 < xRoThx_> Okay
20:29 < xRoThx_> Why did you start DDNet? 
20:29 <@deen> someone bought a server but couldn't set it up
20:29 <@EastByte> ^^
20:29 <@deen> so i set it up for him and that became ddnet
20:30 < xRoThx_> Okay, Great story
20:30 < xRoThx_> Make an e-book about it. DDNet's Fairly tale 
20:31 < xRoThx_> But a good guy like you shouldn't carry all costs
20:31 < xRoThx_> *all the costs you carry atm
20:31 <@deen> EastByte: any idea how to fix this?
20:31 <@deen> xRoThx_: what costs? you're paying the main server now^^
20:32 < xRoThx_> So you have no costs anymore? 
20:32 < xRoThx_> Great
20:32 <@deen> just a few servers
20:32 <@deen> only 2 actually
20:32 <@deen> RUS and Chile
20:32 < xRoThx_> You should moneytize ddnet
20:32 <@EastByte> deen: BeaR did the audio loop thing right?
20:32 <@deen> never
20:32 <@deen> EastByte: i sure hope so =/
20:33 <@EastByte> :)
20:33 <@EastByte> it'll be easy to fix I bet
20:33 < xRoThx_> Like allowing teeserver.de to put a banner on your website, or make it possible for players or clans to get a private server by sponsoring you
20:34 <@EastByte> well, not easy to find a proper sponsor
20:35 < xRoThx_> Guess you did. Exept I came to you instead of finding it
20:35 <@deen> most sponsors want to much
20:36 < laxa> xRoThx_: if you wanna do some good to teeworlds, recode it from scratch in C++
20:36 <@deen> i wouldn't do advertisements for companies or stuff like that
20:37 <@EastByte> beside ddnet ger was a 10eur/moth vps with 10gbit link
20:37 <@EastByte> so what cost?
20:37 < xRoThx_> deen: Sponsors shouldn't want too much. SPONSOR. Not buying advertisement
20:38 < xRoThx_> Just named in the credits should be enough I think
20:41 <@EastByte> xRoThx_: you said you want to offer free/paid servers in the future?
20:41 < xRoThx_> Might be
20:42 <@EastByte> you could get in conflict with G@mer then^^
20:43 <@EastByte> deen: get BeaR here, now! :)
20:43 < xRoThx_> g@mer is for teeserver.de
20:43 <@EastByte> yea
20:43 < xRoThx_> And I am not planning on building a system like his one
20:44 < xRoThx_> my hosting would be through skype/ basic website
20:44 < xRoThx_> Or some kind of partnership or so ;)
20:45 <@EastByte> well okay
21:07 < eeeee> in soviet ddnet companies do advertisements for YOU
21:29 < NooBxGockeL> Hey guys i have a Problem, im recently switched to Linux Mint 17 (debian based) and have trouble running DDNet client or standard Teeworlds... I have a dual Monitor setup and configured it as TwinView but when i open Teeworlds it stretches its fullscreen mode over both monitors. And if i use the borderless window it attaches to the secondary monitor... Any ideas ? (sorry for walloftext)
21:30 <@EastByte> change resolution
21:30 < NooBxGockeL> yes i did but then "borderless window it attaches to the secondary monitor(wrong one)"
21:30 <@deen> just move it over?
21:31 < NooBxGockeL> how can you move a borderless window ? I tried using taskbar but not working
21:31 <@EastByte> maybe your windowmanager has a shortcut
21:32 <@deen> hm, ping 120 on GER
21:32 <@deen> so much for solving that problem^^
21:32 <@EastByte> 43 like always
21:33 <@deen> what isP?
21:33 <@deen> isp*
21:33 <@EastByte> ewe
21:33 <@deen> i think only telekom is affected
21:33 <@EastByte> might be
22:04 <@deen> BeaR: we're experiencing some sound problems
22:04 <@deen> and hi =)
22:04 < BeaR> hi =)
22:05 <@deen> BeaR: they asked us to design one of the questions for your Haskell assignments :P
22:05 < BeaR> what kind of problems? (currently fiddling with haskell xd)
22:05 < BeaR> :D
22:05 <@deen> I'm currently correcting the exercises of 50 people...
22:05 <@deen> gonna take me all night
22:06 <@deen> when the server time is big, the looping seems to make problems
22:06 <@deen> EastByte and I get segfaults
22:06 < BeaR> hm
22:06 <@deen> try the Kobra 3 Solo map on the server "by east"
22:07 <@EastByte> in fact there are two
22:07 <@deen> maybe you have an idea why this happens
22:07 <@EastByte> it's because of the gametime
22:07 < BeaR> could be, teeworlds tick system is a bit confusing :d
22:08 <@EastByte> it's much easier two understand then your sound stuff <.<
22:08 < BeaR> no (:
22:08 <@EastByte> :) yes
22:08 <@deen> ¬∞Õú¬∞
22:08 < BeaR> need to update my repo for debugging (:
22:10 < Spyker> hello.... deen? are you online?
22:10 <@deen> hi
22:11 < Spyker> hi, can you say me new test password for load my old map on new pc?
22:11 < Spyker> the older doesnt work...
22:11 <@deen> name of the map?
22:11 < Spyker> NinjaDreams
22:11 < Spyker> or something like this
22:11 < Spyker> i need to fix the end and the map is done!
22:11 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/NinjaDreams.map
22:11 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/maps/NinjaDreams.map
22:12 < Spyker> i tested it like 20 times with sui/miku/evil cat
22:12 < KinG_> hey all i'm finally back on windows 
22:12 < Spyker> thanks deen :D i fix the end and the map is done...
22:13 <@deen> hi KinG_ 
22:13 < KinG_> i can't how it feels to be on windows after all problems i had with linux xD
22:13 < KinG_> i can't say*
22:14 < BeaR> east: give back server for testing pls :D
22:14 < BeaR> ah nvm
22:14 <@EastByte> :D
22:20 < Spyker> deen, i fixed the end, now map can be tested... i need to do something on ddnet.tw or just upload it....
22:21 <@deen> Spyker: make a thread in forum
22:22 < BeaR> good old signed integers ._.
22:23 <@EastByte> BeaR: explain
22:23 <@deen> better use Haskell Integers!
22:27 < BeaR> EastByte: at high values, the calculated offset get's out of integer range and in combination with modulo, will return negative values, which causes segfaults
22:28 <@EastByte> ah use unsigned integers then :)
22:29 <@deen> everyone makes the same mistakes, it's crazy
22:30 <@EastByte> that's why I want to avoid signed integers
22:30 < BeaR> haskell or c++ ? :)
22:30 <@deen> my haskell students^^
22:30 <@deen> nice that you found the source of the segfault, BeaR 
22:34 < BeaR> hm what's the corresponding unsigned type to int64 :d?
22:35 <@EastByte> unsigned long long
22:35 <@EastByte> iirc
22:35 <@EastByte> because tw doesnt need a typedef for that :P
22:37 < eeeee> or you can be a hipster and use uint_fast64_t
22:38 < BeaR> nah prefer uint64_t
22:38 < eeeee> but it's not even fast :P
22:38 < BeaR> to feed the inconsistency
22:39 < eeeee> s/inconsistency/diversity
22:44 < BeaR> hm now i'm hearing ugly dubstep, need to revert fix :<
22:45 <@EastByte> :)
22:45 <@EastByte> it's funky dubstep

23:23 <@EastByte> naufrage2 finished...
23:23 <@deen> wow, nice
23:23 <@deen> that's a hard map
23:23 <@EastByte> second brutal map :)
23:23 <@EastByte> yea, got pulled the whole map
23:23 <@EastByte> fun nevertheless
23:30 <@deen> BeaR: we have another bug
23:30 <@deen> sometimes some people hear sound, sometimes not
23:31 <@deen> on the test server right now, kintaro's new map
23:35 <@deen> ok, delay doesn't work
23:35 <@deen> when you set delay, it sometimes doesn't work
23:51 < laxa> !fr-en well said
23:51 < Nimda_1716> Translation: discuter
23:51 < laxa> !en-de well said
23:51 < Nimda_1716> Translation: gut gesagt
23:52 < BeaR> deen: can I see the map ?
23:52 <@deen> sure
23:52 <@deen> pw in pm
23:53 <@deen> it has so many sounds
23:53 <@deen> i think the sound gets enqueued again and again
23:53 <@deen> and thus is never played
23:53 < laxa> !fr-de Bien dis !
23:53 < Nimda_1716> Translation: Gut gesagt!
23:53 <@deen> because IsValid() always returns false because it hasn't started playing yet
23:58 < BeaR> hm probably too much sounds, cant allocate a new voice
23:58 <@deen> oh
23:58 < BeaR> with delay, it will be allocated later
23:59 <@deen> but is it normal that sounds get created every frame?
23:59 < BeaR> so you can't hear it
23:59 < BeaR> they wont :d
23:59 <@deen> so you can't add 10-20 sounds on a map?
23:59 <@deen> or what's the limit?
