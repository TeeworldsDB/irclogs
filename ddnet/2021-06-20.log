00:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @jao on $ready, with which function does the ddnet bot find the most recent map file in the channel to use?
04:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> BTW this stop xp anyway? Saw somewhere in code it uses http, but maybe bcs of a different reason?
04:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> BTW this drop xp anyway? Saw somewhere in code it uses http, but maybe bcs of a different reason?

06:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :kek: how else would those netcafe people connect to the serverlist
09:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Never Among Us> you scratch cat
09:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <vahema> ||@Moderator|| Can you improve the clan system?, for example, a player must have a certain score to create a clan, the founder can and assign any person to the clan.
09:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <vahema> Can you improve the clan system?, for example, a player must have a certain score to create a clan, the founder can and assign any person to the clan.
09:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @vahema probably not. it's just a text field, it's ok to keep it simple. we don't even have accounts, so how would you track clan membership?
11:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just updated aur to 15.5.3 but im getting an error compiling due to tests: https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/8NZbQ5HWCK/
11:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> In member function â€˜void CTestInfo::DeleteTestStorageFilesOnSuccess()â€™:
11:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> error: â€˜sortâ€™ is not a member of â€˜stdâ€™; did you mean â€˜qsortâ€™?
11:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mainly this
11:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen know anything?
11:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just searched cppref and sort definitly exists xD
11:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i also have a question
11:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is there a way to pipe stdin to a command somehow, like to answer prompts mid-command
11:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> cus there's a systemd service that i have but it prompts for an option partway
11:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what do u mean by command
11:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> check out xargs(1)
11:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> specifically, im trying to run ./TerrariaServer with systemd but it asks for a number (world selection)
11:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh, alright
11:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @lynn are u into tshock?
11:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i made some plugins for that back in the days
11:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
11:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> they want me to use tshock lol
11:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ill set it up soon... someone is already duping
11:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ofc u should use tshock
11:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> any other option is bad
11:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah i didnt realize how important it was
11:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki thanks, will fix
11:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> WHY DOES SYSTEMD KEEP LIKE A MILLION LINES OF LOGS
11:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> journalctl just crashed my terminal session
11:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki try again
11:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does this update the tar.xz?
11:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess u want me to test the branch
11:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen it works
11:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur pr
11:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, right. I didn't update the tar.xz
11:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> meh, that's a bit messy to update
11:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its also probs cached so its better to make a new version
11:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
11:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (well i probs can put a subtick or whathever it is called)
11:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nah, I'll release it
11:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 15.4 ðŸ‘€
13:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these people can surely visit https sites in a browser in an internet cafe, no?
13:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> two of them can
13:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> one of them can't
13:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Three of them don't know how to use browser.
13:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they literally can't visit an https site in the browser?
13:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oof
13:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is the one that confuses me
13:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Ye
13:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> They don't know what a browser is
13:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ask them to open facebook
13:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they don't even look at bilibili?
13:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> They probably just go to these places and click on the game
13:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or the chinese equivalent
13:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Probably they just use phones. And I think qq have these services built-in
13:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, qq is the monopoly dream
13:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Ye
13:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think we need you to go to such an internet cafe ðŸ˜„
13:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> But I think maybe the two that can visit https site are still getting mitm since some Chinese browser intentionally let insecure site through?
13:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> make sure to bring an oscilloscope and a hoodie to blend into the crowd
13:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :justatest:
13:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but really:
13:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you don't want to visit such an internet cafe, do you maybe know someone with minimal technical ability that could go?
13:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd guess the visit isn't that expensive, but I can probably pay it if that's the problem
13:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :justatest: ye cost isn't the problem.
13:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie don't know someone who might go? ^^
13:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> not really
13:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I'm not usually with kids
13:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I say we just wait. There got to be someone that knows how to check ssl eventually.
13:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <afterfx> uhm
13:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <afterfx> my ddnet client gets crashed
13:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <afterfx> before the gui comes
13:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <afterfx> on mac os
13:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> oof
13:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> try 2 ounces of whiskey before going, it helps a lot with social anxiety ðŸ˜„
13:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :kek:
13:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I don't drink either
13:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I must be so boring
13:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Try 15.4 from ddnet.tw/downloads
13:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, I have just the thing for you. St John's wort is basically a mood regulator in herbal form, and it's part of traditional chinese medicine
13:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :justatest:
13:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> discord on macOS is being weird again
13:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I right clicked a message it deleted another
13:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> tbh I thought you would help the poor guy crashing before dealing with me.
13:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Also irc never forgets
13:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I don't have much advice for him ðŸ˜›
13:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ðŸ˜³
13:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
13:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 do you think we could get some kind of crashreporting?
13:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> telemetry time
13:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> china loves it :pepeH:
13:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder how u make a crash report stuff
13:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can be a button to press
13:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or something like a template message, that can be posted by the user
14:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> https://github.com/bchavez/BugTrap
14:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> games based on X-Ray game engine use this
14:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> for bug reports
14:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets just add a try catch on mina
14:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> main
14:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> + segfault handler
14:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do steam and ddnet.tw releases have debug symbols?
14:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was looking at crashpad for a while, it is very doable
14:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/chromium/crashpad
14:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh: google
14:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no
14:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can strip and keep the symbols
14:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> would be cool yeah
14:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> especially bcs this doesnt increase the release by like 50mb xd
14:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should btw even if we dont do crashpad
14:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can read windows and mac error reports with it
14:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the function name would already be gold indeed xd
14:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i feel like its a bug not inside the client, if it only happens on macos
14:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or maybe its some macos specific code we have there
14:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> this is the best one so far
14:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> @heinrich5991

14:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> oh wait. wrong url. i'm stupid.
14:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it doesnâ€™t

14:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> hmm. he's gone before i can let him click "detail"...
14:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie what brwser is this?
14:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> chinese ones
14:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but yea, the certificate looks wrong
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ye.
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> also the second row says 360 isn't trusting this root
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oof
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it's still displaying the green lock?
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so they're MITMing in the internet cafe and our curl doesn't pick up on the additionally trusted CAs
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> it says it may stop trusting it in the future
14:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> so it still counts as trusted for now
14:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So our curl is working as designed ðŸ˜„
14:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where does our trust source for curl come from?
14:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not from the OS? we're not shipping root CAs, are we?
14:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> maybe the machine has 360 (firewall + antivirus thing. although i don't like these) and it's blocking the cert system wise
14:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> has 360 installed *
14:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sigh, I'm wondering if we should fall back to http if https is broken. Probably still better than the old udp server info
14:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds less useful than falling back to insecure https
14:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> what sensitive information do we really have in the list tho
14:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't think I like such a fallback either way
14:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah right, we could just allow https without valid certificate
14:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, globalsign organisation validation ca - sa256 - g2 is a real CA, apparently?
14:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> apparently
14:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> can you fake a cert name? for example the netcafe have a central server that repackage all http/https request and resign them.
14:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, you can
14:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> is that a possible thing to do
14:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it'd need to be set as trusted in the OS (very possible in the internet cafe setting)
14:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> maybe they are doing that and installed the root ca themselves on their machine
14:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye. but why isn't our curl picking that root CA up?
14:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> the 360 thing maybe
14:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we're not shipping our own root CA store AFAIK
14:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> that's my guess
14:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we are not anymore
14:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> so they (the netcafe) installed their own cert in the machine but still using a firewall that isn't trusting their cert.
14:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :justatest:
14:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> tbh it is not so bad to let me keep telling them to use http override on a case by case bases. that part is much easier to let them paste a link into a browser for some reason.
14:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how ðŸ˜„
14:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll eat something
14:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> idk either
15:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> just had some crawfish
15:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> heinrich do be rich tho
22:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27572746
22:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is actually incredible
22:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1 au = distance from earth to sun
22:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a dward planet passing by so close like as if it were asteroid
22:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and from what i read it will be rly bright
22:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2031 tho
22:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
22:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dward -> dwarf
22:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Saturn ranges from being about 7 to 11 AU away from Earth. Voyager 1 is 152 AU away. This object is excitingly close and will be fun to study.
22:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> But 11 au is still incredible far. We will just notice it as a stat then?
22:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
22:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> saturn is aroudn 11 au too
22:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its like having another planet in the solar system
22:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if u can see it with bare eye
22:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> But 11 au is still incredible far. We will just notice it as a star then?
22:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Ah i was thinking it would be big or good visible since you said it will be really bright
