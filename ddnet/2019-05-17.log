07:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 do you remember when you said its not possible to have working bullet tiles + vanilla shotgun, or the curved gun and the ddrace gun at the same time for different tees? well, i did it :)
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> fokko since you developer in ddnet you break lots of shit in blockworlds
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, basically nothing
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> try to join blockworlds and go in shop
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> thats the result of your commits
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what is wrong?
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> antiping is broken now in ddnet client!!!! fps break x 10000
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> gj
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not my fault
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut @Schulzer you both complained about binds the last time around, can you take a look at the latest version, see how it feels?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Sure, not right now but later
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Schulzer> imo it's a little bit better, but the problem still stands, that i can't use the debug mode while playing because strg+shift blocks my complete input (I'm sure you know about that) @Learath2
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 definietely better! :)
21:59 <@heinrich5991> @fokkonaut how did you do it?
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How should I explain
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut I don't know, you did it ^^
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you send to the client?
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Wanna take a look at the code?
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not really, I wanted an easy explanation of what you do ^^
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I use the normal calculation for vanilla shotgun and gun (because faking curvature is way harder than faking the straight pistol projectile or the straight shotgun bullet) and for the ddrace gun/shotgun bullet tile it calculates a stable position and then moves that position manually (not with the vanilla CalcPos function). I have added tuning for speed and lifetime, which are ca <message clipped>
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it resets the position every 4 ticks, to avoid that jumpy thing
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you have some slight deviation from the path for the straight bullets in the client prediction?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, they work just fine
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you avoid these deviations in some way or do you resend often enough so that they're not noticeable?
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Not noticeable ^-^
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if you look very very closely you see them for gun, but its Just too small
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> shotgun bullets work fine for almost every tuning
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it doesnt matter, shotgun_speed 1 or 2000, the bullets have their own ddrace_shotgun_speed value, and they are not looking odd or something
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and ofc in low speed demos you can see that they disappear every 4th tick, but ingame you cant notice
