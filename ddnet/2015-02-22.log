02:34 < Nocsis> Heyo. Ist @deen gerade ansprechbar? :3
02:36 < Nocsis> Gerade nicht? Dann versuch ichs morgen nochmal :/
09:13 <@EastByte> deen: can I dump the processed nim syntax tree before compilation?
09:13 <@EastByte> to check what macros actually did
12:33 <@deen> EastByte: at least at the end of a macro you can do "echo result.repr"
12:40 <@EastByte> cool, works
12:49 <@deen> would still be nice to print the entire file after all macros and templates were expanded. someone should implement that
12:49 <@deen> should be reasonably easy, just "echo result.repr" on the whole AST
12:49 <@deen> and it's related to the awesome nimfmt gsoc idea
12:50 <@deen> This is funny, I read the Haskell-Cafe mailing list and see my nim code posted on it^^
12:50 <@EastByte> well, I simply thought about the -E option in gcc
12:50 <@EastByte> ^^
12:51 <@deen> https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/haskell-cafe/z05AAGpEzow/1XPruTTxchYJ =)
12:52 <@EastByte> "Well... I don't think anyone would consider this horrendous thing, idiomatic haskell..."
12:52 <@deen> yeah, it's really horrible, that code
12:52 <@deen> but it's a benchmark, so they tried to make it performant
12:52 <@EastByte> ah
12:53 <@deen> the nice thing about the nim code was that I just made it more tidy and that sped it up as well :P
12:53 <@EastByte> so ugly, but the solution to go
12:53 <@EastByte> nice
12:53  * BeaR_ doesn't even understand some parts of the syntax
12:53  * EastByte doesn't know haskell at all
12:53 < BeaR_> :p
12:53 <@EastByte> :q
12:54 <@EastByte> I'm hunrgy
15:02 < Nimda> Aim 7.0 by Aoe just released on Brutal at 2015-02-22 14:59
16:06 <@EastByte> deen: btw. what was the last state on 128pl?
16:06 <@deen> EastByte: not to do it
16:06 <@deen> i had it sort of working
16:07 <@deen> a few things were missing
16:07 <@EastByte> I was bored and tested it http://eastbit.net/priv/screenshot_2015-02-22_16-01-35.png
16:07 <@EastByte> 28% cpu for me
16:07 <@deen> nice
16:07 <@deen> =)
16:08 <@deen> so, do you want to fix it up?
16:08 <@deen> it would be nice for tournaments, but with all the attacks I'm not sure
16:08 <@EastByte> weren't there some core performance issues?
16:08 <@deen> aaaaaand people would really lag on it
16:08 <@deen> people already complain that they lag with 64 players
16:09 <@EastByte> I'm still not sure whether 128pl is a good idea
16:09 <@deen> yeah, i don#t think it is
16:11 <@EastByte> but I would like to know why end when the client would lagg
16:12 < spyker> hello!
16:12 <@EastByte> hello spyker 
16:12 <@deen> EastByte: yes, would be important to analyze, even for 64 player performance
16:12 <@deen> maybe too much network traffic is sent
16:12 < spyker> deen
16:12 < spyker> i have a question :I
16:12 <@deen> or collision stuff
16:12 <@deen> hi spyker 
16:12 < spyker> can you change all my ranks and points from Spyker to sk|Spyker
16:12 <@EastByte> deen: for me justice 2 doesn't render smoothly
16:12 <@deen> spyker: no
16:13 < spyker> why not :C
16:13 <@deen> EastByte: lots of layers and graphics stuff, right?
16:13 <@EastByte> yea
16:13 <@deen> spyker: because it's annoying. use the clan tag to write your clan, not the name
16:13 < spyker> :C but all clans have it
16:14 <@deen> no
16:14 <@EastByte> Quintessenz doesn't :D
16:14 <@deen> i only did it for gB and that was admittedly a mistake
16:14 <@deen> i didn't move any clan names for months
16:15 <@deen> spyker: best tell your clan to not use "sk|" in the name
16:16 <@deen> otherwise you can do it as mB does, they just left their old points and now collect new ones with mB|...
16:16 < spyker> oka
16:16 < spyker> see ya!
16:16 <@deen> bye
16:17 < Learath2> deen: is clan tag displayed ? like in chat 
16:17 <@deen> Learath2: not in chat, but in scoreboard
16:18 < Learath2> maybe we should append clantags to the beginning of the names so they get the visibility they want from changing their names and we get to not have to change ranks 
16:19 <@EastByte> probably would cause a shitstorm
16:20 <@EastByte> "I left that clan months befor!!!"
16:20 < Learath2> not to the ranks
16:20 < Learath2> display it on chat and stuff 
16:20 <@EastByte> dynamicly?
16:21 < Learath2> instead of Learath2: hi [Clantag]Learath2: hi and when someone prints out rank it should just display his current clan
16:21 < Learath2> dont think we store the last clan of people tho do we :P
16:21 <@EastByte> hmm yea
16:21 <@EastByte> still questionable
16:22 < Learath2> trying to make everyone happy is hard :P
16:22 <@EastByte> you need to store the clan somehow
16:22 <@EastByte> rather impossible :P
16:43 <@EastByte> deen: there are cpu peaks on ddnet.tw Gavelines
16:43 <@EastByte> doing anything special there?
16:43 <@deen> EastByte: there are always cpu peaks there^^
16:44 <@deen> it's just the website server and eveything cpu intensive runs with nice -n19
16:44 <@EastByte> hmkay
16:44 <@deen> i don't really care about keeping cpu down, since no game servers are running there
16:45 <@deen> i also test nim programs there sometimes, and all kinds of other stuff^^
16:45 <@EastByte> ah^^
17:21  * EastByte is chasing vali and teemo on fly to the moon
17:35 <@EastByte> and know we are forced to play together...
17:53 <@EastByte> and now we finished
17:54 <@deen> haha
17:55 <@deen> 2 hours until tournament
17:58 <@deen> anyone want to analyze broken demos? they make the demo viewer go 100% cpu
17:58 <@deen> http://a.pomf.se/kbjfuc.demo
17:59 <@deen> and no screen update happens anymore
18:13 <@EastByte> demo analysing is my job I guess?
18:13 <@deen> if you want to
18:14 <@deen> i guess it's a broken demo
18:14 <@deen> but would be nice if some recovery was possible
18:14 <@deen> the guy says many of his demos have this problem
18:14 <@EastByte> isn't that the guy of the last demo I analysed?
18:14 <@deen> haha
18:14 <@deen> is it?
18:14 <@EastByte> I think so
18:15 <@EastByte> maybe his disk really is broken :D
18:15 <@EastByte> haha
18:56 <@deen> Tournament preparation time!
18:56 <@deen> 1 hour left
18:59 < BeaR_> heh totally forgot it
18:59 < BeaR_> shame on me ):
19:05 <@deen> I see heinrich5991 in every Rust thread
19:09 < Learath2> I see deen in everything about nim :)
19:10 <@deen> :P
20:17 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
20:17 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 694
20:17 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 711 users online at 2014-12-21 20:13:02
20:57 <@EastByte> deen: stream by users in teamspeak is a nice idea
20:57 <@EastByte> well they shouldn't play with gametiles only
20:57 <@EastByte> that kinda sucks
20:59 <@deen> ^^
20:59 < WolfAlex> deen: next time you should probably use the checkpoints to check who is leading :D
21:00 <@EastByte> oh didn't someone want to implement that?
21:05 <@EastByte> "the longest time was 57 minutes"
21:05 <@EastByte> WolfAlex: was that us?
21:05 < WolfAlex> no
21:06 <@EastByte> k
21:06 < Muttley> wasnt me
21:06 <@EastByte> and I thought you brought us some medal :D
21:06 < Muttley> ;-)
21:06 < Muttley> i made it in less then 50 ;-)
21:06 < Muttley> 49 minutes to be exact
21:06 < Muttley> xD
21:07 <@EastByte> 45min
21:09 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/tournaments/34/
21:09 <@deen> Here you see all times^^
21:10 < Muttley> 43minutes
21:11 < Muttley> cool xD
21:11 < Muttley> thought it was 49
21:17 < Nimda> Jvice by Vasten100 just released on Moderate at 2015-02-22 19:58
21:59 < khar_> kim injas?
22:00 <@deen> khar_: please?
22:00 <@deen> what does that mean?
22:04 <@deen> what's going on here?
22:04 < boz> what?
22:04 <@deen> many people joining :P
22:05 < JOJO> if dont like we cant leave here :P deen
22:06 < JOJO> we can*
22:07 <@deen> nono, it's ok^^
22:08 <@deen> I'm just wondering where everyone is coming from suddenly!
22:11 <@heinrich5991> deen: where did this sudden realization come from? :)
22:12 <@deen> heinrich5991: the new HN thread on Rust and Nim
22:12 <@deen> everyone was talking about Rust anyway
22:13 <@deen> Nim only popular in Japan: https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=nim-lang&src=typd
22:14 <@deen> Rust really reminds me of Haskell
22:14 <@EastByte> realization?
22:14 <@deen> the realization that heinrich5991 is commenting in every Rust thread everywhere, even before I find them
22:14 <@EastByte> ah^^
22:15 <@EastByte> deen: and I'm seeing your name in every thread that's nim related
22:16 <@deen> I wish there was an easy way to track keywords as they appear anywhere on the internet
22:16 <@deen> google search has some feature like this, but doesn't seem to work at all for me
22:16 <@EastByte> like in facebook?
22:16 <@deen> i don't know what facebook does
22:16 <@EastByte> "your name has been tagged..."
22:16 <@deen> yeah
22:17 <@deen> send me a mail when someone posts something about "ddracenetwork" or "nim-lang"
22:17 <@deen> i often find interesting stuff a few weeks too late
22:17 <@deen> someone should make a service like this, if it doesn't exist
22:18 <@heinrich5991> deen: just browsing hacker news regularly and commenting here and there :)
22:18 <@EastByte> here and there... and everywhere
22:18 <@deen> heinrich5991: i've seen you on r/rust too i think :P
22:21 <@deen> I wish Nim had a real financial backer like Mozilla =/
22:22 <@deen> Would be nice to work on Nim full-time, also bugs are queuing up like crazy
22:24 <@deen> At the start of Tournament had nice 100 Mbit/s outgoing from maps.ddnet.tw for some time :P
22:25 <@deen> ~250 people downloaded the map from there at the same time
22:25 < eeeee> did someone say CDN?
22:25 <@deen> ^^
22:26 <@deen> not really a problem I'd say
22:26 < eeeee> but hopefully ddnet will outgrow that soon ^^
22:26 <@deen> I doubt it
22:26 < eeeee> why
22:26 <@deen> growth has been stagnant recently
22:26 < eeeee> is it also not a goal?
22:26 <@deen> Just look at the player graphs: http://ddnet.tw/stats/
22:27 <@deen> maybe a very slight growth, but that's all
22:27 <@deen> I'd like for ddnet to grow
22:28 <@EastByte> hmm
22:28 <@deen> i just don't have any big plans on how to do it
22:29 <@deen> getting into steam greenlight might be a way
22:29 <@deen> I'm more focussed on making Nim grow
22:30 <@deen> seems to work much better too :P
22:30 < eeeee> and then bundle ddnet client with it :P
22:30 <@deen> with less work and no ddos attacks
22:30 <@deen> eeeee: well, your JS client would be nice
22:30 <@EastByte> well, one idea I had to reach new players
22:30 <@deen> eeeee: could even submit it to HN and r/programming i think
22:30 <@deen> :P
22:31 <@EastByte> using the webclient to make some tutorial ddracing
22:31 <@deen> EastByte: great idea
22:31 < eeeee> well its nothing noteworthy really, after mozilla proted a whole humblebundle of games
22:31 <@deen> someone needs to make a tutorial level
22:31 <@deen> eeeee: with online games?
22:31 < eeeee> yes
22:31 <@deen> oh =/
22:31 <@deen> well, it's noteworthy for me, i'd try to submit it anyway
22:32 < eeeee> https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/10/14/play-awesome-indie-games-directly-in-firefox-including-the-award-winning-ftl/
22:32 <@deen> any plan for when the js client is released?
22:32 < eeeee> idk i'm pretty swamped at work
22:32 <@deen> EastByte: so we need a tutorial level with some help programmed into the client directly
22:32 <@EastByte> yea
22:32 < eeeee> i think i'll have time to work on it next weekend
22:33 <@deen> eeeee: sure, no hurry. I'm just impatient
22:33 <@deen> EastByte: want to do it yourself or post about it on ddnet forum?^^
22:33 <@EastByte> hmm
22:33 <@EastByte> would probably a good idea to post about it first
22:34 < eeeee> i agree that we badly need a tutorial
22:34 <@deen> maybe someone has cool ideas about how to make it
22:34 <@deen> ddnet is not noob-friendly AT ALL
22:34 < eeeee> don't see how a new player can possibly figure out what to do otherwise
22:35 <@EastByte> for me the next three weeks are really stressfull, apart from this I have final exams in april^^
22:35 < eeeee> even in vanilla ctf sometimes people would join red team and try to shoot other red tees
22:35 < eeeee> seen that many times :D
22:35 <@EastByte> :D
22:35 <@EastByte> sometimes they look like bots
22:35 <@EastByte> trying to understand the engine
22:36 <@deen> i don't know, i love games without explanations
22:36 <@deen> but i guess most people don't
22:36 <@deen> just join a server, watch what others do, ask around a bit
22:37 < eeeee> might work of ddnet was a bit more intuitive
22:37 <@deen> hmpf
22:37 <@deen> most noobs can't even figure out how to join
22:37 <@deen> and if they do, they can't figure out how to kill
22:37 < eeeee> like if your tee was actually rendered as frozen instead of becoming a ninja
22:37 <@deen> haha
22:38 <@EastByte> I think the webclient is the key for noob friendliness
22:38 <@EastByte> we could rework the ui
22:39 < eeeee> i showed the web client to a couple friends who've never seen tw before, and they couldnt quite grasp the concept of becoming a ninja until i explained
22:39 <@EastByte> it's not that easy :D
22:39 < eeeee> yeah also due to the lack of freeze prediction
22:39 <@EastByte> ^
22:39 <@deen> well, the pros wouldn't accept freeze prediction
22:40 < eeeee> could throw in another checkbox somewhere
22:40 <@deen> at least the buggy one we had. and a perfect freeze prediction is difficult
22:40 <@EastByte> ^ I still don't understand why
22:40 < eeeee> you'd have to do all the server logic on the client i guess
22:40 <@deen> me neither, i didn't implement it :P
22:40 <@EastByte> :D
22:40 <@deen> but it didn't work
22:41 < eeeee> we had a perfect freeze prediction in ddwar
22:42 < eeeee> was possible because it didnt have any fancy ddrace features
22:42 <@deen> and if you have perfect freeze prediction, a freeze animation is easy too
22:42 < eeeee> yep thats why we had it :)
22:42 <@deen> what fancy features prevent prediction?
22:43 <@EastByte> "they couldnt quite grasp the concept of becoming a ninja until i explained", ah you talked about freeze
22:43 < eeeee> like plasma balls which thaw you
22:44 <@EastByte> how hard would it be to implement the server engine into the client?
22:45 < eeeee> pretty hard i guess
22:45 < eeeee> not practical if it's just for adding freeze prediction
22:45 <@EastByte> nah
22:45 <@EastByte> I'm talking about playing solo
22:45 <@EastByte> a tutorial map for example
22:45 <@deen> EastByte: that sounds doable
22:46 <@deen> but maybe players will be a bit weirded out when they suddenly have ping on real servers =/
22:46 <@EastByte> on a local server we probably should simulate latency
22:46 <@deen> haha
22:46 <@EastByte> (configurable)
22:46 <@deen> no
22:46 <@EastByte> why not?
22:46 < eeeee> why can't we just have a tutorial server?
22:47 <@deen> eeeee: yes, easier, better
22:47 <@EastByte> well
22:47 <@deen> just have one in each location and have the client connect to the one with lowest ping
22:47 <@deen> because that's where people will play later
22:47 <@deen> so they get to practice with their real ping
23:01 <@EastByte> 0.7 coming in 2015 seems to be realistic
23:03 < WolfAlex> deen: what are your plans if 0.7 gets released? :3
23:05 <@deen> WolfAlex: no idea
23:07 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: I thought about contacting Sushitee the same you just did with Oy^^
23:08 <@EastByte> github makes it kinda hard
23:14 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: we had private messages before
23:14 <@heinrich5991> they were removed at some point
23:18 < eeeee> 0.7 getting released would suck
23:19 < eeeee> i'd totally go onto official forums and create a thread about how vanilla is killing ddrace
23:19 < eeeee> ;D
23:19 <@EastByte> troll
23:20 <@EastByte> I think 0.7 won't really affect ddnet
23:21 <@deen> yeah, ddnet would just keep running as it does now
23:21 <@deen> we could think about switching over to 0.7 if they have some nice stuff
23:21 < eeeee> maybe we can build in a compatibility layer for 0.7 into ddnet client :>
23:21 <@EastByte> stuff like nice protocol changes
23:21 <@deen> eeeee: i tried that before, and got both to connect
23:21 < eeeee> protocol changes? sounds awesome!
23:21 < eeeee> thats exactly what all players want ;)
23:21 <@EastByte> deen: did it work?
23:22 <@deen> EastByte: a bit
23:22 <@EastByte> eeeee: increasing security
23:22 <@deen> but then i gave up because i didn't believe 0.7 would come out
23:22 < eeeee> deen: yeah me and hein did similar experiments
23:22 <@EastByte> being compatible with all tw versions would be an ideal solution
23:23 < eeeee> EastByte: i dont see how security is of any concern right now
23:23 < eeeee> ddnet client seems to work just fine
23:23 < eeeee> i'd get it if they added some account system or a way to work around ddos or sth
23:24 <@EastByte> ddnet already worked on that to prevent lower ip spoofing flaws
23:24 <@EastByte> -prevent
23:24 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: I built a compatiblity layer :)
23:24 <@heinrich5991> but not for soemthing as complicated as ddrace
23:24 < eeeee> everyone and their mom has built a compat layer
23:24 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: ddrace, complicated?
23:25 < eeeee> so yeah, i guess we'd be able to just do that
23:25 <@EastByte> ddrace didn't really change the protocol
23:26 < eeeee> our players would just keep using ddnet client
23:26 < eeeee> and vanilla guys can do whatever the fuck they want
23:26 <@EastByte> and we have a webclient :)
23:27 < eeeee> which is kinda irrelevant since vanilla wouldn't merge websockets anyway :)
23:27 <@deen> why not?! it's awesome
23:27 <@EastByte> I'm talking about ddnet
23:27 < eeeee> i mean irrelevent to 0.7
23:27 <@EastByte> but it's our chance to have something independent from vanilla and other modifications
23:28 <@EastByte> -other
23:29 <@EastByte> deen: matricks problably doesn't like that at all^^
23:29 <@EastByte> neither asm.js nor websockets
23:30 <@heinrich5991> has yet to be shown
23:30 < eeeee> yeah idk, we could try i guess. have to actually finish the js first.
23:31 < eeeee> there's a bunch of tiny issues to be ironed out
23:31 < eeeee> but they take a ridiculous amount of time
23:32 <@EastByte> ah, and there was the thing about webrtc and unrealiable frame protocol
23:32 <@EastByte> still have no idea how well that works
23:33 <@deen> eeeee: or just release it as it is and tell people to go fork themselves
23:34 < eeeee> yeah i guess it works reasonably okay-ish in chrome
23:34 < eeeee> so i could just say only chrome is supported atm
23:35 <@EastByte> eeeee: what was your url again?
23:35 < eeeee> http://tw.qwe123.info/d.html
23:35 <@EastByte> ty
