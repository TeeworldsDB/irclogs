16:17 < o_be_one> hello folks :)
16:19 <@deen> hi
16:23 < o_be_one> deen> 5 € sent => 4.40 € received
16:23 < o_be_one> the tips you talk is to send directly to you, not via the button right ?
16:23 <@deen> right
16:24 < o_be_one> nice i'm able to read :D !
16:24 <@deen> i think paypal is forced by law to offer a free way to send money in some countries
16:24 < o_be_one> deen: how many you "lost" in fee when we send directly ?
16:24 <@deen> and they only offer it in those countries
16:24 < o_be_one> i think fee was on my side, 0.10$ cad
16:24 <@deen> usa and germany afaik
16:25 < o_be_one> Canada to Canada it's free, but not to other country
16:25 <@deen> o_be_one: i got your full 10 CAD
16:25 <@deen> no fees
16:26 <@deen> except the fee to exchange it to euros of course
16:28 < o_be_one> ok thats nice, fee was on my side
16:28 < o_be_one> i pay 10.10$ ^^
16:28 <@deen> ^^
16:28 < o_be_one> Paypal tells me about that
16:28 <@deen> still betterthan what it costs to send something per bitcoin
16:28 < o_be_one> its not too much i think
16:33 < o_be_one> hey nice funding page :D !
16:34 < o_be_one> woaw GER1 is too expansive, serious !!! :o
16:34 <@deen> 30 € / month?
16:34 <@deen> that's pretty cheap considering the ddos protection
16:34 < o_be_one> oh its for the year
16:35 < o_be_one> but xrothx was not sponsoring GER1, deen ? oO
16:35 <@deen> he was, but now he suddenly stopped
16:35 <@deen> i don't know why, the server may shut down any moment
16:35 <@deen> i told him to transfer it to my account but he hasn't
16:35 < o_be_one> oh >.<
16:36 < o_be_one> and i imagine you want to stay at ufo or i cant remember the name
16:37 <@deen> nfoservers, yeah
16:37 <@deen> haven't seen a better hoster yet
16:37 < o_be_one> yes they are well protected, just a little heavier ping
16:37 <@deen> higher ping? i don't think so
16:37 < o_be_one> but to be well-protected it's not a problem
16:38 < o_be_one> yes there is 10 to 20ms more than at ovh
16:38 <@deen> for you maybe
16:38 < o_be_one> it's easy to confirm that ^^
16:38 <@deen> not for our players
16:38 < o_be_one> no for ger too
16:38 <@deen> nope
16:38 < o_be_one> we did the comparison with some ger players
16:38 <@deen> which ovh servers?
16:38 < o_be_one> (and i got some complaint about this)
16:38 < o_be_one> my french servers (remember i was the previous host of V3R ..)
16:39 <@deen> i tried all 3 ovh locations in europe, they all had worse ping for our players
16:39 < o_be_one> thats curious, we didn't seen the same, but i can imagine it can depends of players ..
16:40 < o_be_one> internap is great and have good peering, just maybe less peering than OVH ? I dont know if we can get the information
16:40 < o_be_one> but anyway, it's just to talk and understand ^^
16:40 <@deen> only DTAG has problematic peering to internap, and that seems to be gone now as well
16:40 <@deen> players with good connections have ping < 10 on GER1
16:42 < o_be_one> really ? i must take a look ive never seen someone with less than 10ms ... kpro998 was with better ping on OVH, i was jalous of his ping on ovh servers :p
16:43 < o_be_one> and yes about Canada we got 30 more ms, i have 95ms on OVH servers, 125ms on NFO servers
16:44 <@deen> doesn't matter anyway, the ddos protection of OVH didn't work at all
16:44 < o_be_one> but it's maybe cause of peering agreement, OVH and Videotron made a good peering together
16:45 < o_be_one> yes it's true
16:45 <@deen> so you have better ping to ddnet.tw than ger.ddnet.tw?
16:45 <@deen> ddnet.tw is still at OVH
16:46 <@deen> our EUR test servers and website
16:47 < o_be_one> i'll try and tell you
16:47 < o_be_one> but my servers are at OVH too ^^
16:49 < o_be_one> thats curious there is not much host at internap frankfurt Oo
16:50 <@deen> huh?
16:50 < o_be_one> i was looking for cheaper hosting than nfoservers at internap DC in frankfurt
16:51 < o_be_one> and thats curious there is not a better ping since internap is at Montreal tool Oo
16:51 <@deen> internap has a dc in frankfurt?
16:53 < o_be_one> nfoserver says "Frankfurt (InterNAP)" in hosting, but internap website say its at amsterdam or london, i cant see frankfurt
16:53 <@deen> right^
16:53 <@deen> so they are at some other datacenter in frankfurt, but that's somehow connected to internap
16:54 < o_be_one> yeah maybe
16:54 <@deen> never figured out how that works exactly what they'r doing
16:54 < o_be_one> oh i was curious to know if the GER1 is running Linux or Windows ? Cause ive heard about Windows in the past
16:54 <@deen> we have linux everywhere
16:54 < o_be_one> ok
16:56 < o_be_one> did you know that Google Cloud has hosting in Belgium oO ?
17:06 <@deen> no, but then i never heard of Google Cloud either
17:08 < o_be_one> oh, its name Google Compute Engine, it's cloud solution
17:08 < o_be_one> sometime i think i must try to host on it, cause Google DDoS protection should be awesome ... Its 9$/month for the smallet vcore dedicated
17:45 < o_be_one> ok i took Google cloud to try, i'm really to curious x)
18:38 < o_be_one> 99ms to Google Cloud (same with OVH, not bad)
18:38 < o_be_one> (Google Cloud hosted in Europe)
19:36 < Learath2> TIL nim doesnt like a sequence to be modified while iterating over it
19:46 <@deen> right
19:49 < Learath2> deen: if you have time can you tell me whats the problem with this ? https://gist.github.com/3cd999eeae165813db79
19:58 < BeaR_> ddnet beer fund is raising (:
20:51 <@deen> Learath2: should be "num = num div i"
20:51 <@deen> div is for int division, / for float division
20:51 < eeeee> pascal ftw
20:51 <@deen> and res should be "res = 0'i64" 
20:52 <@deen> BeaR_: beer fund or bear fund? :P
20:52 < BeaR_> :P
20:52 < BeaR_> is 0'i64 the same as 0.i64 ?
20:52 <@deen> Learath2: ah, i see you asked on #nim already^^
20:53 <@deen> BeaR_: there is no 0.i64 in nim, but there's 0.int64
20:53 <@deen> and 0i64 works too
20:53 <@deen> the ' is optional
20:53 < BeaR_> lol
20:54 <@deen> 0i64 is a literal of int64 type, while 0.int64 is an int literal that's converted to int64
20:55 < BeaR_> hm makes sense
20:55 < BeaR_> still a bit confusing
20:55 <@deen> how so?
20:57 < BeaR_> more about consistency, would drop the 0i64 / 0'i64
20:57 <@deen> nono, that's necessary
20:58 < BeaR_> why?
20:58 <@deen> when you're on a 32bit system ints are int32, so an int literal could not express the numbers of an int64 literal
20:58 <@deen> at least i think so, haven't tried^^
20:59 < Learath2> just noticed i need a way bigger prime list which i cant possibly generate with my code
20:59 < BeaR_> hm I thought int literals are handled as int64 intern if I remember correctly
20:59 < BeaR_> (but I don't really know anything about the nim compiler)
21:05 < BeaR_> https://github.com/super-massive-black-holes/AstroNimy ^^
21:12 <@deen> BeaR_: not using units
21:12 <@deen> i should've fixed my units library: https://github.com/def-/nim-units
21:15 < Learath2> deen: does sequences have a way to look at the last element without removing it (peek)
21:17 <@deen> Learath2: x[^1]?
21:19 < Learath2> deen: thanks where would I find such stuff tho ?
21:19 <@deen> hopefully in the tutorial, otherwise add it please^^
21:20 <@deen> it's pretty new
21:20 <@deen> http://nim-lang.org/docs/system.html#^,int
21:20 < Learath2> couldnt find it in neither the tut nor the manual
21:21 < BeaR_> eh
