08:57 <+ChillerDragon> when i saw matrix
08:59 <+ChillerDragon> yo @heinrich5991 i suck at wireshark filters did you by any chance have some filter that reduces the noise in tw7 traffics dumps like getting rid of all input and snap messages that spam out every tick. And only keep the more rare packets that also include chat/rcon/broadcast etc
09:00 <+ChillerDragon> ah fak that senetence makes no sense sometimes i miss msg edits xd
11:18 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 daily python trivia what does this return? `isinstance(False, int)`
11:22 < bridge> <murpi> False is not an instance of int ðŸ‘€
11:23 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1680427379.png
11:23 <+ChillerDragon> get fucked
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> i love how my linter recommended `isinstance` over `type()` and then `isinstance()` is drunk af
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> chillerdragorees
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> jopsta
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> can u rebase again if not too much work
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> oke sir
11:26 <+ChillerDragon> `error: pathspec 'master' did not match any file(s) known to git
11:26 <+ChillerDragon> deen the woke debil
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> also jopsta i have allow maintainer edits so u can rebase my pr 
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah but i only use pure git, so i'd need to add your repo and stuff
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> tho its worth it ðŸ˜‰
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> git gud
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> fr can i somehow alias main to master? xd
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> main is better
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> get used to the better stuff
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> idc which is better
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> master is used in all repos i work in but the data repo
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> get used to your RTX 4090 bro
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> wot
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> i got GTX 980 xd

11:33 <+ChillerDragon> i get plenty of ded acss
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but even more scary
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> often it just works xD
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> where i can not reset pw
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> because the email bound to it got inactivity deleted xd
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if i cant reset i just assume they deleted my acc
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> thats how i lost ma fakin mc account
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> for scam emails i don't care ðŸ˜„
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well rip
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> but how do you know which sites you signed up for?
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u can recover it if u paid with paypal
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> just need the username and the paypal transaction ID
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> i sent notch coins per mail back in the day
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i saved them in my browser
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> ew
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and since i want to move completely to key files, i currently try to delete as much as i can
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so i dont need to care anymore ðŸ˜„
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> key files?
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> key pass
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> password manager
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u know
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> a
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> when cleanup tw accounts u signed up for?
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1680428153.png
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i had a clans.de account
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> which was cool back when tw clans were cool
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sadly the website itself died xD
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> hf gl deleting your kog lvl account
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lol
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i remember there were such servers
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> do they still exist?
11:37 < bridge> <Ewan> why is main better
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> no but they still sell ur acc to amazon
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it fits better logically
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> and leak ur pw on clubpenguin hacker formus
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> its the main branch
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> its called masterrace for a reason
11:37 < bridge> <Ewan> it's the master branch
11:37 < bridge> <Ewan> because other branches should feed into it eventually
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> and feature branches should be called slave branches
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but master would imply other branches are less powerful or smth
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> they are jopsta
11:38 < bridge> <Ewan> cuz they are
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> master all the way
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> develop is cring
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> :banhammer:
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> no yea honestly i agree w jupsti
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> often the cool stuff is not developed in main branch ;9
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> but i mozzle memoried da fak out of master
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> i can type master w 1 finger and 0 brain cells in 1 nano second
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> and type main like my grandma
11:39 < bridge> <Ewan> same
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> freedesktop uses main
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so its more hipster anyway
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> but who uses freedesktop
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and hipster and jupstar close words
11:40 <+ChillerDragon> jupjapjappyster
11:40 <+ChillerDragon> i pay for my desktop
11:40 <+ChillerDragon> i have gnome pro
11:43 <+ChillerDragon> @murpi here u got another shot `isinstance(0.5, int)`
11:45 < bridge> <gerdoe> float is other primitive-like type afair and can't be an int instance but who knows xd
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> float != int
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> bool == int
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> poggies
11:45 < bridge> <murpi> WTH
11:46 < bridge> <murpi> Uninstalling
11:46 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:54 < bridge> <murpi> Ah, 0 and 1 were the official representation for truth values prior to py 2.3
11:56 <+ChillerDragon> legacy juice
11:56 <+ChillerDragon> but then why bother breaking stuff in py3 and not cleanig this shit up xd
11:58 < bridge> <Robyt3> @deen Seems like master branch is missing the Version 16.9 commit https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6467/commits/17e5841a0100b913264d310666d4e93a38026752
12:04 < bridge> <deen> thanks, fixed
12:53 < bridge> <ReiTW> u store logins in a txt file, rip
12:55 < bridge> <gerdoe> its all hashed :greenthing:
12:55 < bridge> <ReiTW> I've used keepass before, but switched to bitwarden for my personal accounts with a yubikey as 2fa
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> maybe i should use kwalletmanager. then its built into my desktop environment ez
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but never used it and it kinda was annoying for some reason i fotgot a while ago
12:59 < bridge> <ReiTW> does it support yubikey
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dont even know what that is bra xd
13:00 < bridge> <ReiTW> physical 2fa
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> a usb stick
13:00 < bridge> <ReiTW> https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/
13:00 < bridge> <ReiTW> yes
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, would need to look it up
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i has a dbus interface, but i dunno how it interacts with other key managers xd
13:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> now only firefox needs to get better. and i am epic free ganster like ryozuki
13:13 < bridge> <Alexander> I've made a mistake of using my first ever email which i use for almost everything for bitwarden too
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> on the other hand, chromium is a free pkg under debian
13:13 < bridge> <Alexander> And it had like 7 breaches
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so i guess its ok too xd
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> why is it bad?
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i only used keepass databases yet
13:14 < bridge> <Alexander> I recently got an email that someone from like russia or ukraine tried to log into my bitwarden account and failed
13:14 < bridge> <Alexander> I mean ip is russia or ukraine, could be a vpn
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ah so bitwarden is an online tool?
13:14 < bridge> <Alexander> Yes but you can selfhost it
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i guess as long as your master pw is secure enough they wont hack anyway xd
13:15 < bridge> <Alexander> Really good master password + authy
13:15 < bridge> <Alexander> But having an unknown email could add to security
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> except bank details, i saved many passwords in chrome directly over my google account
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i wouldnt call that more secure xD
13:16 < bridge> <Alexander> I dont understand
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> when logged into a chrome instance it saves passwords into your google account
13:16 < bridge> <Alexander> I always disable that feature lol
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i wanted to get away from that for a longer time now, but always was to lazy, now i use chromium
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so its basically the same just that i save my passwords outside
13:17 < bridge> <Alexander> How is chromium
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> its basically chrome
13:17 < bridge> <Alexander> I use brave
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> just without google integration
13:17 < bridge> <Alexander> Epic
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i mean its still made by google, if you care about it, tho most browsers are directly or indirectly created by google ðŸ˜„
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> edge uses the same backend. apple uses some fork
13:18 < bridge> <Alexander> Yeah but brave uses chromium too
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i c
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> firefox is also heavily funded by google xD
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> google controls the internet
13:19 < bridge> <Alexander> Yeah
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> konqueror uses true webkit, ez
13:19 < bridge> <Alexander> Going back to netscape
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the good old middle ages
13:20 < bridge> <Alexander> Im just gonna say
13:20 < bridge> <Alexander> Fuck javascript
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> js has its peak rn
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i wonder what comes next
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lmao i love videos like these:
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNSoPa-XQN0
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i am really hobbyless xd
14:00 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> I have like 4 paper books about delphi from my parents and it barely made it to the top 8 ðŸ˜­
14:00 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> Never used them tho :troll:
15:58 < bridge> <Alexander> webassembly?
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> probably
16:17 < bridge> <Alexander> i hope it's not as bad at things as javascript is
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well its kind of an emulator
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it has more performance pontential and it is free from a set programming language
16:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but its defs still much slower than native execution
16:21 < bridge> <Alexander> javascript is just annoying
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u misunderstand what webassembly is
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> by saying that
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> webassembly is not a programming language
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u dont code in it
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its a target for compiles
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> compilers*
16:27 < bridge> <Alexander> ah
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> e.g rust can compile to webassembly
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> c++
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> etc
16:27 < bridge> <Alexander> yeah i understand
16:27 < bridge> <Alexander> so nothing will change for me
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it will in that javascript may become useless
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> because wasm is faster
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and u can use any language u like
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> instead of being forced to use js
16:28 < bridge> <Alexander> i like javascript syntax though
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> @ReiTW i was close to rolling my own crypto xd but then decided its not worth the effort to protect my passwords if someone gets access to my disk there are far more sensitive files than those
18:45 <+ChillerDragon> where are the windows client crash logs and are they opt in?
18:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> In dumps folder in the config directory
18:47 <+ChillerDragon> ty
18:47 <+ChillerDragon> is it always on?
18:48 < bridge> <Robyt3> Crash logs are always enabled, but some crashes are not caught
18:48 <+ChillerDragon> wait are they behaving the same on linux?
18:48 <+ChillerDragon> ah indeed i have a assert log file 
18:57 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 sorri for all the pings sir. But im just wondering how mature the rust bridge is in ddnet. I assume the code is the documentation? xd Could i already get started with writing my client `CComponent` files in rust you know the client thingies like hud.cpp/broadcast.cpp/motd.cpp/chat.cpp etc?
