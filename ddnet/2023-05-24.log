00:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> time to slep
00:04 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
00:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You would not have thought of what?
00:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
00:14 < bridge> <Learath2> what is this dude making anyway?
00:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: of the email change reset procedure
04:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Vulkan has dynamic rendering support, which simplifies the Renderpass stuff. Also ofc this has overhead. Additionally he can use a library to simplify it if he wants
05:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering.html
07:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> some ffxiv plugin related to rendering, i think related to reshade but with support for stuff like better normals? i forgot
07:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Brainwashed by Microsoft xd
07:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
07:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye happens
07:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks this is my grip, most games use c#, and lot of m$$ fanatics like c#
07:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and ofc modding for them is c#
07:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ans tooling
07:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but i am madness, i use rudt
07:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rust
07:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah quite possible^^
07:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i am motivated to learn vulkan again
07:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Good luck
07:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks what rust lib resembles more the c api, or should i use a safe and correct one that avoisa mistakes
07:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for learning
07:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i remember there is ash and vulkano
07:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh. Depends on what exactly u want to achieve.. do u want to understand the concepts of creating pipelines and render pass etc.
07:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or do u want to learn how to optimize something to fit exactly to your needs
07:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Purely rendering wise, VK is probably not much better than opengl
07:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But for emulators it's the perfect match. BCS if it's control
07:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wanna understand vulkan
07:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so i dont need to search what a PSP is or ask u what i asked
07:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> PSO*
07:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my god mobile
07:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I guess I'd start with pure Vulkan. And if u want to do something greater u can still switch to higher level abstractions again
07:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U'll probably find more tutorials anyway
07:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Because CPP dominated field
08:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
08:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Invalidating the revert link sent per mail I mean
08:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sending a notification email to the old seems obvious doesn’t it? But yea properly invalidating it when it happens multiple times is something I would not have implemented if I were to build it.

08:51 < bridge> <Voxel> no i mean
08:51 < bridge> <Voxel> oh
08:51 < bridge> <Voxel> so its also an icon?
08:52 < bridge> <Ewan> what
08:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
08:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
09:04 < bridge> <Voxel> this also sucks

09:16 <+ChillerDragon> nice teeish!
09:17 <+ChillerDragon> @Voxel did you just made those or what is that? looks nice
09:17 < bridge> <Voxel> i made these
09:17 < bridge> <Voxel> idk
09:17 <+ChillerDragon> pog
09:17 <+ChillerDragon> can i buy?
09:17 < bridge> <Voxel> i j
09:17 < bridge> <Voxel> you dont have to buy these i can just, give you the file LOL
09:17 <+ChillerDragon> nice can you give me 6 files so i dont have to gimp split them
09:18 < bridge> <Voxel> yeah
09:18 <+ChillerDragon> pog pog
09:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> giving file is not enough
09:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> put a license
09:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cc-by-sa for example
09:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
09:19 < bridge> <Voxel> yeayea i know
09:20 < bridge> <Voxel> how do i send?
09:21 < bridge> <Voxel> do i just drop a ZIP file in here
09:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that works
09:25 < bridge> <Voxel> !c please tell me if anything looks weird

09:25 < bridge> <Voxel> wait does irc client even support file uploads
09:26 < bridge> <Robyt3> should work, it's just a download link to discords website that get's displayed differently in discord
09:26 < bridge> <Voxel> ah
09:26 < bridge> <Robyt3> should work, it's just a download link to discord's website that gets displayed differently in discord
09:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> .pdf
09:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> trol voxel
09:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks a lot worked fine looks good on my machine
09:33 < bridge> <Voxel> common practice for graphic designs to send .pdfs to their clients
09:33 < bridge> <Voxel> *designers
09:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok mr professional
09:37 < bridge> <Learath2> How dare you use the jupstar argument to defeat him?
09:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats the internet
09:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ddnet is like a company, i just consulted the local vulkaner
09:38 < bridge> <Learath2> Btw vulkan docs look so amazing wtf
09:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it loads so slow xD
09:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 they even have a xml with the api
09:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so stuff like  ash crate
09:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is generated from it
09:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> correct bindings
09:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ez
09:39 < bridge> <Learath2> So comprehensive it's like better than a whole standard
09:39 < bridge> <Learath2> Can't you grab a local copy of it?
09:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> probably, but i am fine with it, on desktop its ok. but on my old mobile it takes minimum 10 seconds xD
09:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3/html/vkspec.html#_working_group_contributors_to_vulkan
09:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
09:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's interesting how much contributions even come from google
09:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "that aint work on android bra"
09:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: is there an equivalent to python wheels for ruby?
09:53 < ws-client> <awdaaaaaq> wat was wheels about again?
09:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> opsi that was my dev tab xd
09:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> precompiled binaries so my libtw2 huffman users don't have to have rust installed
09:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ahm
09:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> probably
09:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my ruby huffman gem requires a c++ compiler
09:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which is super common for ruby gems so maybe rust would be fine too
09:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki if u understand this diagram while coding vk, i'd say u got the idea
09:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
09:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it basically shows all stuff u also do when coding:
09:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> define the pipeline layout
09:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> allocate descriptor sets
09:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> allocate resources(memory, etc.)
10:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the programmable shader stages
10:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and how exactly you have to use memory fences, semaphores etc. with this pipeline "diagram"

10:01 < bridge> <Learath2> https://github.com/luislavena/gem-compiler something like this maybe? @heinrich5991
10:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 this seems helpful https://github.com/flavorjones/ruby-c-extensions-explained/tree/main/precompiled
10:01 < bridge> <Learath2> It's not quite wheels tbf but you can generate a gem that just downloads a binary
10:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> virus
10:03 < bridge> <Learath2> You
10:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ye, both links seem helpful. thanks!
10:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the one i sent was used for sqlite2-ruby https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/releases/tag/v1.5.0.rc1
10:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 3*
10:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Make sure to fallback to compiling if no architecure is matching
10:08 < ws-client> <awdaaaaaqawd> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684915691.png
10:08 < ws-client> <awdaaaaaqawd> thanks a lot @Voxel
10:09 < bridge> <Voxel> no problem
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Could someone leak some discord emote images preferably in high res?
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :pepeH: would be nice
10:12 < ws-client> <Voxel> Dang. Website isn't updated yet.

10:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > We have added native support for additional archive formats, including tar, 7-zip, rar, gz and many others using the libarchive open-source project. You now can get improved performance of archive functionality during compression on Windows.
10:15 < bridge> <Learath2> Why are you making this bizarre irc discord hybrid anyway chiller?
10:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it does seem a little unnecessary ^^
10:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's definitely too little chat apps out there
10:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk i thought its funni was meant as a 20min trol project to see if i can do it
10:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but now i kinda like it
10:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i do not like the other irc frontends
10:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> windows now supports more archive formats 😮
10:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and having a web client has some perks like image display etc
10:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> notifications
10:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> now that we have the full range of archive formats
10:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what would be the preferred archive format for custom file formats?
10:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> still zip, probably?
10:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe with better compression
10:19 < bridge> <Learath2> They only had zip and rar, right?
10:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> only zip
10:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg i just bought winrar license
10:20 < bridge> <Voxel> oh god now in the entire os??
10:21 < bridge> <Voxel> not only is that bloat it gives off the vibe my pc's going to take over my hardware and become sentient
10:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nice
10:21 < bridge> <Voxel> "ads in settings? windows, install gentoo"
10:21 < bridge> <Voxel> "im sorry, user. im afraid i cant do that"
10:23 < bridge> <Learath2> Perfect time to jump ship from windows
10:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and only limited zip support. I wonder if they have better support now
10:27 < bridge> <deen> @Ryozuki I think an out-of-date list of releases on github is worse than none: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/releases Do you mind if I delete it again? As I said, I don't want to maintain it manually
10:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ok
10:31 < bridge> <Voxel> windows 10 is safe.... for now....
10:35 < bridge> <Learath2> Better safe than sorry. Migrate to linux now
10:39 < bridge> <Voxel> no
10:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon4> @Voxel your images are live on https://chat.zillyhuhn.com/ :rocket:
10:43 < ws-client> <ryo> ok
10:45 < ws-client> <Voxel> No they arent
10:45 < ws-client> <Voxel> One second
10:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> reload the page?
10:47 < ws-client> <deen> Still not live
10:51 < bridge> <Learath2> This webclient with no authentication that lets you pick any nick is definitely not going to end up abused 😄
10:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684918259.png
10:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> works fine for me
10:51 < bridge> <Voxel> oh so that IS an icon
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> those are the ones you made
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dont u recognize em? xd
10:52 < bridge> <Voxel> no the bot one at the bottom
10:52 < bridge> <Learath2> You need to size them better tho, that rocket is massive
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Maybe in comarison to your rocket its massive
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :p
10:53 < bridge> <Learath2> I hope your webclient breaks
10:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :c why
10:53 < bridge> <Voxel> Mean !
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Robyt3 when i scroll the server browser, i always see the hovered element from the previous frame above/under where my cursor is
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> basically the hovered element moved but is still considered hovered
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez to see with mices with fast scroll
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also with vsync, so not tearing related
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> (I have smooth scroll off)
11:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> might be related to immediate mode UI always lagging one frame behind?
11:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> should be instant normally
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe its some optimization for smooth scroll to not recalculate the hover element
12:08 < bridge> <Robyt3> only seems to happen specifically when smooth scrolling is off
13:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> fun that it was exactly a year ago 😄
13:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah 😄
13:28 < ws-client> <guess> what is this :0
13:59 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, I don't get why that breaks
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki what was the async handler crate again u send a few days ago
14:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `std::bitset` too small
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i cant find 😄
14:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> for `TEAM_SUPER == 64`
14:03 < bridge> <Learath2> But then so was out integer from before the bitset. What was happening then?
14:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> probably shift outside of the integer?
14:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. wrong team selected
14:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> pollster
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ty
14:03 < bridge> <Learath2> Ah, I guess that's possible
15:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks did u rly try vulkano
15:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> apparently they have the same versions ofg the functions with a _unchecked, and they claim that if the normal version works, its safe and u can swap to the unchecked
15:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1110915663855370311/image.png
15:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they dont appear in the docs intentionally btw
15:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so u may have missed em
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i didnt try it
15:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u can also opt out of the builtin sync mechanism they use
15:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and use ur own
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it's obvious that u can't do the same, at least not in what u'd call safe
15:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk, i think vulkano has a nice goal, only allow u to do safe correct stuff according to the spec
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how do u want to make a memory fence safe without making everything "more" complex?
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes that's nice indeed
15:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> anyway
15:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think im gonna learn it with vulkano
15:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its nice to know errors early
15:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i wont do obscure things probs
15:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i dont know what i am doing
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can also enable these layers with normal vulkan
15:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> anyway
15:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
15:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > Can handle synchronization on the GPU side for you (unless you choose to do that yourself), as this aspect of Vulkan is both annoying to handle and error-prone. Dependencies between submissions are automatically detected, and semaphores are managed automatically. The behavior of the library can be customized thanks to unsafe trait implementations.
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> biggest troll in history
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> learath the biggest troll, do u agree?
15:23 < bridge> <Learath2> Also an easy review opportunity, you can go "goto, declined, wontfix"
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd be surprised if we dont have a clang-tidy check
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what u actually want is a lambda
15:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 wait doesnt rcon auth happen after joining
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> return false if goto is not called
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else true
15:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's just reusing the rcon passwords for reserved slots
15:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh goto
15:26 < bridge> <Learath2> It doesn't auth, I thought about using it to pre-auth too but mods might want to sneak on to the server
15:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ur evil learath
15:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> as a witch
15:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we should burn u
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDDDDDDD
15:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in rust its ok cuz its not spelled goto but break 'label'
15:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so its fine
15:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in rust its ok cuz its not spelled goto but break 'label
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this also isnt a loop
15:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> true
15:27 < bridge> <Learath2> I could have made an extremely ugly extra one use function or duplicated branches or inverted branches but I thought this would be an amazing place to demonstrate the power of goto and how pretty it can make code
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lambda
15:27 < bridge> <Learath2> Bask in it's glorious power to break out of blocks
15:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks u can use it here anyway i think
15:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to return to a outer scope
15:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he is using goto to quit 2 scopes
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> learath has no math brain
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he uses weird jumps
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pls don't fail my clang-tidy
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pls don't fail my clang-tidy
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pls don't fail my clang-tidy
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pls don't fail my clang-tidy
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pls don't fail my clang-tidy
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pls don't fail my clang-tidy
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pls don't fail my clang-tidy
15:29 < bridge> <Learath2> I could have used an ugly lambda, but I decided to demonstrate the glorious demonized goto
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```rust
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> fn main() {
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     'outer: loop {
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki>         println!("Entered the outer loop");
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki>         'inner: loop {
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki>             println!("Entered the inner loop");
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki>             // This would break only the inner loop
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki>             //break;
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki>             // This breaks the outer loop
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki>             break 'outer;
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki>         }
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki>         println!("This point will never be reached");
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     }
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     println!("Exited the outer loop");
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> }
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in rust its fine cuz its not goto
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its break
15:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> imho still not always the best solution, really depends on complexity of the loop
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tension increases as clang-tidy comes to compile the server code
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> comes close
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 do u rq, if goto fails?
15:36 < bridge> <Learath2> I doubt it will, but I'd be disappointed in whoever wrote the rules
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd be surprised if it doesn't
15:37 < bridge> <Learath2> Ah, actually these will be the only 2 gotos in the code it might be there then
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> EPIC
15:37 < bridge> <Learath2> `cppcoreguidelines-avoid-goto` yeah disappointed in all of you

15:39 < bridge> <Learath2> Too much education is as bad as no education it seems
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😂 😂 😂
15:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5235
15:39 < bridge> <Learath2> B.S., M.S., Ph.D. yet unable to follow a simple `goto`
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> one thing less to care
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😉
15:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lerato fellow goto enjoyer pog
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can always say, but in these 10 lines of code its easy to follow
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> !c >.<
15:40 < chillerbot> ChillerDragon
15:41 < bridge> <Learath2> Exactly, use your common sense instead of some old dudes guidelines that he stole from math people
15:41 < bridge> <Learath2> In these 10 lines of code, in this exact usecase it's the better pattern
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then the code is a design flaw 😂
15:42 < bridge> <Learath2> No
15:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ur flawed jopsti
15:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> goto is top10 underrated keywords
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> goto school
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> true, indeed a good keyword
15:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
15:44 < bridge> <Learath2> If I was any less confident in being right about this I might be concerned about how against it you are
15:44 < bridge> <Learath2> Anyway, I'll flip it around and make it ugly just as you like, dw
15:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> If the devil would encrypt the hell? would it be shell?
15:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> as in secure hell?
15:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> like sftp etc
15:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okok wasnt funi i go
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can just repeat what i said last time.
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I generally am not the biggest fan of uncontrolled jumps, this includes:
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> return
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> break
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and all the other stuff my brain forgot now
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with return i ofc mean return mid func
15:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think an early return is more readable than an if branch covering the whole function
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> an early return is different: it's basically an if else
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> around the whole function
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u mean with early, directly at the start of the function
15:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, you're okay with `return`s if they're easily translatable intto huge if-else blocks?
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am ok with returns that don't destroy the flow of a function
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so if the if else is mid function
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no
15:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nono
15:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> return is evil
15:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we must use out pointers
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wat
15:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> fn(a,b,c, *result)
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah, ez
15:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks i think csharp has a keyword
15:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> out x
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> instead of reference
15:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/out-parameter-modifier
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cool shit
15:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```csharp
15:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> void Method(out int answer, out string message, out string? stillNull)
15:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> {
15:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     answer = 44;
15:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     message = "I've been returned";
15:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     stillNull = null;
15:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> }
15:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is it write only?
15:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> imho its better rust
15:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just use tuples
15:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think c# simply doesnt have first class tuples
15:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah in rust for example u can code without using `return`
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> isnt that epic
15:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xdd
15:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u just omitting it written
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no
15:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its implicit at end of scopes
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's what i mean
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it guarantees that the flow isn't destroyed
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> aslong u dont secretly use ?
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> aslong u dont secretly use `?`
15:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ?
15:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks i made ryocrater, to learn vulkan
15:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im gonna make some simple renderer or smth
15:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im such a pro with names
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sounds nice
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> crater sounds like the german word Krater, which is basically the opposite of a Vulkan
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which is also a german word
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_crater
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u such a genius
16:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:06 < bridge> <Patiga> I wrote a raytracer using vulkano. considering it was my first rendering project, it must've been quite nice to work with ^^
16:06 < bridge> <Patiga> maybe they didn't exist back then, but I don't remember seeing those _unchecked methods
16:06 < bridge> <Patiga> my approach was taking the triangle example, understanding it and expanding it, that worked well :)
16:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they existed
16:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the unchecked methods are hidden from the docs
16:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to see them u have to build the docs urself
16:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> wit the feature document_unckeched
16:07 < bridge> <Patiga> interesting approach ^^
16:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its more cuz the function does essentially the same, without checks, and it would cluttler  the docs with lot of repeated functions iirc
16:07 < bridge> <Patiga> does literally every function have a _unchecked variant, or is that guesswork. I guess it would clutter the docs either way
16:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think the first
16:07 < bridge> <Patiga> huh interesting
16:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe not all
16:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but rust analyzer should show u them
16:08 < bridge> <Patiga> thats handy ofc
16:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> raytracer as in global illumination?
16:09 < bridge> <Patiga> I kinda with that wgpu would also introduce a `_unchecked` variant for certain methods
16:10 < bridge> <Patiga> yea :)
16:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice
16:10 < bridge> <Patiga> I recall some details and it wasn't written all that well in some aspects xd
16:11 < bridge> <Patiga> like the ray directions
16:12 < bridge> <Patiga> we didn't simply calculate them in the fragment shader from the position on the screen, nonono
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> twgpu also is kindof a ray tracer 😉
16:13 < bridge> <Patiga> we had a texture as big as the viewport that had the direction vector for each pixel of the screen which we updated whenever the screen size changes
16:13 < bridge> <Patiga> heh, I guess ^^
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you study computer graphics?
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or why `we`
16:14 < bridge> <Patiga> yea, was a group project with a friend
16:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> >  It can also be used to trace the path of sound waves in a similar fashion to light waves, making it a viable option for more immersive sound design in video games by rendering realistic reverberation and echoes.
16:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> do u think this is used
16:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in games
16:15 < bridge> <Learath2> iirc EFT uses some ray tracing for it's sounds
16:15 < bridge> <Patiga> but I don't study computer graphics specifically, was just one course which piqued my interest
16:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> wats eft
16:16 < bridge> <Learath2> Escape From Tarkov
16:16 < bridge> <Learath2> Or was it DayZ hmm
16:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> iwant arma 4
16:17 < bridge> <Learath2> https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/lykr0t/comment/gpu457b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button apparently GW2 had something like it huh
16:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this reminded me, the metro exodus game has one of the best impls of using raytracing from nvidia
16:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its pretty simple iirc, they simply did not calculate the raytraces every frame like all games stupidly do
16:24 < bridge> <Learath2> Mh, sounds very bad for frame pacing though
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> all other devs were so stupid, why didnt they do it like them 😂
16:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/in-depth-technical-dive-into-metro-exodus-pc-enhanced-edition
16:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> here is the explanation
16:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i explain it badly dont mind me
16:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is a nice blog
16:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 4a is the dev
16:26 < bridge> <Learath2> You seem to love your ad populums
16:27 < bridge> <Learath2> will give it a look during tea hour, sounds interesting
16:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sry i forgot everything about latin
16:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> enlighten me
16:28 < bridge> <Learath2> it's just good old bandwagon fallacy, the fact that all the other devs didn't do it doesn't imply that they are smarter (nor does it imply that they are stupid)
16:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it was an answer to "like all games stupidly do"
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd well most do
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is why rtx is unusable
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in most games
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> like hogwarts
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they simply slap rtx
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dont reason about it
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in exodus its actually usable
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> check the steam reviews
16:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what do they do at a 180° turnaround?
16:32 < bridge> <Learath2> I thought you were implying that it's not stupid to do with the :lol:
16:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no, i just decided to use smileys everywhere now
16:33 < bridge> <Learath2> Whether it's stupid or not idk, but the fact that everyone does it is not a valid argument is all I wanted to say 😛
16:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 😄
16:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> smileys are eerie
16:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
16:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> weeb emojis better
16:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or troll

17:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pog pog my new pc arrived
17:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😮
17:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> amazing
17:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it so loud -.-
17:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> has fakin water cool shit and noise such bs
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can turn coolers down
17:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my old pc is silent af and it has dry cooler that never broke
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bro no joke, i once forgot to plugin my cpu fan
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> didint notice for 2 weeks xD
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if passive cooler is big enough, ez
17:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do i look like a chiller?
17:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> go into you UEFI and make it more silent
17:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk how cooler works
17:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> doesnt it then get hot or smsn?
17:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why isnt default sensible?
17:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it gets hot, but if u target 70° it should be fine
17:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 70!?
17:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
17:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my old is 40 max when hot af
17:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it ususally vibes at 28
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well then target 60
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or simply test it out
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but 70° should be fine without degradation
17:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im scared i melt my hardware xd
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> most modern CPUs are tested 24/7 at like 90°
17:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so chill
17:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I just realized i can do the arch install via ssh idk why i never did something like that its so nice
17:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684940921.png
17:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> chiller
17:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why intel
17:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> best single core cpu
17:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> according to gutefrage net
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> iks de
17:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
17:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> did u check out the new ryzen ones
17:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> all benchmarks i saw this was best single core
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it depends on the games
17:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> AMD Ryzen™ 9 7950X
17:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Max. Boost Clock
17:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Up to 5.7GHz
17:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> holy shit i have never seen so many cores in htop xd
17:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its so fun to upgrade hardware after sooo many years
17:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 32 threads
17:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez
17:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
17:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> upgrade always fun
17:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but its hard to upgrade when i got good pc already
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tbf rn, amd is not really a better value
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ryzen 3d max are still over expensive
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> x3d
17:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> chiller got a 4090 to run his tw bots

17:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fan stopped omg
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on local empty server
17:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it alr diening
17:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i didnt even start arch install yet will take some time until i can launch tw but i will
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah and gfx_fullscreen 1
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and x11
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and linux
17:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i was thinking more about ponyOS
17:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> linux is too mainstream
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it aint hit 15k fps
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sell PC
17:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> gpu fun not running is normal
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to me, for 10$
17:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> fan
17:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jup i am on 4k tho
17:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wont matter
17:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i never saw more than 800fps in my life
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its a fucking 4090
17:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tf
17:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in worst case put it to full hd for the test
17:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dw ill use gimp to boost fps screenshot anyways
17:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah cl_background_entities ""
17:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so empty
17:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez
17:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rigged stats

17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> troll
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ofc not
17:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is it still cool to use legacy boot mode in 2023?
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
17:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pog
17:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i hate efi
17:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jupsti why local server?
17:23 < ws-client> <Jupstar> no other players
17:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there are online servers without players
17:23 < ws-client> <Jupstar> then go there idc :D
17:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok
17:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> still installing arch
17:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> BTW

17:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :hisnail:
17:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u dont have this chiller
17:33 < bridge> <Learath2> Y didn't you go for an amd cpu?
17:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because prefix
17:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 single core power is the best they say online
17:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1110953724408516618/768893210726367232.png

17:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ty
17:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which name?
17:33 < ws-client> <RustIsBetterThanC> :hisnail:
17:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ima add
17:33 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, but multicore is cool and I like how amd keeps their socket alive for longer
17:33 < bridge> <Learath2> Chipset*
17:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :fuckyousnail:
17:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also this
17:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1110953886866493481/691290240266141766.png
17:34 < ws-client> <RustIsBetterThanC> oh
17:34 < ws-client> <RustIsBetterThanC> u got it
17:34 < ws-client> <RustIsBetterThanC> xd
17:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> multicore is cool but single core is mostly a bottleneck isnt it
17:34 < bridge> <Learath2> <a:painpeko:974639276753055744>
17:34 < ws-client> <Jupstar> for gaming yes
17:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i only use this pc to play tw
17:34 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i thought so
17:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its way overkill
17:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for ddnet
17:34 < bridge> <Learath2> Ah nice, 69k fps
17:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
17:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
17:34 < ws-client> <Jupstar> its underkill
17:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> agree
17:35 < ws-client> <RustIsBetterThanC> agree
17:35 < bridge> <Learath2> You are getting close to being able to render onto reality itself
17:35 < ws-client> <RustIsBetterThanC> das
17:35 < ws-client> <RustIsBetterThanC> no multiline
17:35 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but im jealos when someone has 4090. i also want one, but i also want open source drivers
17:35 < ws-client> <Jupstar> so im doomed
17:35 < ws-client> <Jupstar> thanks amd
17:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i also struggled with that
17:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> amd having complicated names helped my decision xd
17:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> :hissnail:
17:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> fk
17:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon3> ah now reload worked
17:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon3> do they even show on discord?
17:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> nope
17:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> trash
17:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and what about :fire: ?
17:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ye
17:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so only basics no custom?
17:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ye that one shows
17:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and :rocket: too then
17:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ye
17:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see
17:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sad
17:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe the bridge should then replace them with image tags for discord
17:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk
17:39 < bridge> <Learath2> You can't send emoji like that, you need to use the custom emoji syntax
17:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can s/:hissnail/https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1110953724408516618/768893210726367232.png/
17:40 < bridge> <Learath2> `:hissnail:`
17:40 < bridge> <Learath2> damn, no idea how to escape it properly
17:40 < bridge> <Learath2> `\:hisnail:`
17:41 < bridge> <Learath2> `<\:hisnail:768893210726367232>`
17:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> <\:hisnail:768893210726367232>
17:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> dis work? xd
17:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> <:hisnail:768893210726367232>
17:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> or maybe this
17:41 < bridge> <Learath2> The last one worked
17:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> hm good to know
17:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> yea i should probably send those then
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hilarious that webhooks have access to emojis from other servers
18:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> wait wot?
18:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> isnt thet emoji from this server?
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its from private
18:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how can you use it?
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i have nitro
18:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rich
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yes
18:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that is indeed funny then
18:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so https://chat.zillyhuhn.com/ is basically free discord nitro
18:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pog
18:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we need more bridged channels
18:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pls
18:07 < ws-client> <Nouaa> 🍊
18:07 < bridge> <Nouaa> :justatest:
18:08 < ws-client> <Matodor> <@182902341119377409>
18:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh o
18:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do i need to blacklist pings?
18:09 < bridge> <Voxel> free discord nitro? now add themes
18:09 < bridge> <Voxel> jk
18:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
18:09 < ws-client> <Voxel> Testing on mobile
18:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i never did probably looks ass
18:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> send screen
18:10 < ws-client> <Voxel> Why are some icons squished?
18:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> honestly idk
18:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i spend 5min debugging
18:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> didnt get it and rq
18:10 < bridge> <Voxel> too big for screen. i can scroll down.
18:10 < bridge> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1110963088368349247/image0.jpg
18:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why did the image not preview -.-
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> !c make the chat open codable
18:11 < chillerbot> ChillerDragon
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so everyone can code it
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> absolutely not risk
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> y
18:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it used to be
18:11 < bridge> <Voxel> coding it so my messages bounce across the screen like a funny rubber ball
18:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it would render all messages sent as full html/css/js xd
18:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jopsti in case ur wondering how far i am with the fps test
18:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am starting arch install again from scratch because i picked wrong drive xd
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah ok
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> np
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> totally normal
18:54 < bridge> <Chairn> i don't mind goto in general, but in this specific case, it's clearly more confusing. At least, the function name is a good documentation 😉
18:55 < bridge> <Learath2> We clearly have differing opinions
18:55 < bridge> <Learath2> It's heaps clearer to me at a glance with the guard pattern than scrolling up to see what `CheckReservedAuth` might be doing
18:56 < ws-client> <RustyCexpert> isnt the function name telling it already?
18:56 < ws-client> <RustyCexpert> @Ryozuki
18:57 < ws-client> <RustyCexpert> !c hmm, have you found a name for your chat?
18:57 < ws-client> <RustyCexpert> YAC ?
18:58 < ws-client> <RustyCexpert> :hisnail:
18:59 < bridge> <Chairn> hmmm, so @people work but not emotes/emojis
18:59 < ws-client> <RustyCexpert> damn, where's my beautiful profile picture in here ?
18:59 < bridge> <Chairn> !c ^
18:59 < chillerbot> ChillerDragon
19:00 <+ChillerDragon> i dont think it ever gets a name
19:00 <+ChillerDragon> the frontend repo is called discord-irc and the backend irc-websockets
19:01 <+ChillerDragon> its not a real chat its just a irc client/wrapper basically
19:01 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc> ``time bash -c 'mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && ninja'``
19:02 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc> ddnet build became such bloat
19:02 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc> my first raspberry pi 1990 edition did build vanilla code base faster than this pc
19:02 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc> alone cloning the 30k commits and 7 submodules breaks my internet
19:02 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc> ``real    1m14.154s``
19:03 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc> ``user    3m37.487s``
19:03 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc> mostly doing rust downloads tho because the rust git thingy is slow and so is my internet
19:03 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc> jup i got ddnet i forgot the config pls resend
19:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
19:04 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc> i had mild panic because i got black screen when installing gnome xd
19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```

19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
19:04 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc> seems like this pc does not want to start without nvidia drivers :justatest: 
19:04 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc> fak
19:04 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc> i have no screenshot bind yet
19:05 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc> sec
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> client has built in support
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for screenshots
19:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not irc
19:09 < code-commander> hello
19:10 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc> o/
19:10 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684948225.png
19:10 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc> thats one line right? .-.
19:10 < code-commander> this is my very first time using irc
19:11 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> omg why does the image not preview anymore all bugged
19:11 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> im not sure if this soydev looking discord ripoff can be considered actual irc usage xd
19:11 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> did u use twitch chat before?
19:11 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> thats also irc
19:11 < code-commander> really?
19:11 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> it used to be 
19:11 < code-commander> i didn't know that
19:12 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> they extended it 
19:12 < code-commander> I haven't used twitch chat before
19:12 < code-commander> I don't really use twitch
19:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes one line

19:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dunno
19:16 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684948545.png
19:16 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> :justatest:
19:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> use pure ddnet for test
19:16 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> i do
19:16 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> but my fork
19:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh
19:16 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> its behind i think
19:16 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> its not 15k
19:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
19:16 < code-commander> what game is that?
19:16 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> im on fullhd btw
19:16 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> i plugged in only my smol 20$ trash screen
19:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in no way u at 3k fps at full hd
19:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that would be a laugher
19:17 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> uhm
19:17 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> what can i say xd
19:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did u restart after command?
19:17 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> no
19:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok do that and update to master
19:17 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> ok
19:17 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea i was behind
19:18 <+ChillerDragon> not better xd
19:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so
19:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> press f1 after client start
19:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> show purple text
19:21 <+ChillerDragon> ok xd
19:21 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684948869.png
19:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
19:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then u  join a server without weapons
19:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> go on kog server and vote ckisbzw1
19:23 <+ChillerDragon> i make map
19:23 <+ChillerDragon> i mapper
19:24 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684949048.png
19:24 <+ChillerDragon> i mean i expected nothing more xd
19:24 <+ChillerDragon> as i said i never saw more than 800 fps in my life
19:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bro
19:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u forgot to enable XMP?
19:25 <+ChillerDragon> wat
19:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in no world u have 4,5k fps on an empty mapo
19:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with my settings
19:25 <+ChillerDragon> what can i say xd
19:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u use gnome right?
19:25 <+ChillerDragon> yes
19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can u start tty2 and type startx
19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and start without gnome xd
19:26 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> xd
19:26 < ws-client> <Chiller@newpc2> lemme try
19:27 <+ChillerDragon> startx command not found
19:27 <+ChillerDragon> OMG the resoltuoin is ass i can t see shit xd
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xinit
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> initx
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> install openbox
19:29 <+ChillerDragon> omg what a effort
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bro
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i cant accept 4k fps
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with a pc double as good as mine
19:30 < bridge> <Learath2> gnome being the culprit would be very odd
19:30 <+ChillerDragon> how many u goit?`
19:30 <+ChillerDragon> i mean i also have nvidia
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i get 12k fps usually
19:30 <+ChillerDragon> and scuffed linux drivers
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if i have nothing running
19:30 <+ChillerDragon> nice
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can try with opengl 3.3
19:30 <+ChillerDragon> shouldv bought amd then i guess
19:30 <+ChillerDragon> ur switch to windows xd
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with that i also get around 10k fps
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> windows is slower
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> by design
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i want to blame gnome
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but just to be sure:
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u enabled XMP in UEFI?
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what does memory speed report
19:31 <+ChillerDragon> wat is that
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> memory clock speed
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let me see how to query in linux
19:31 <+ChillerDragon> i didnt do anything
19:32 <+ChillerDragon> i am fully confident its nvidia + linux
19:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sudo lshw -short -C memory
19:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no dude
19:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even with my old gtx 760 i got like 6k fps

19:32 <+ChillerDragon> with my old gtx 980 i get 800 fps
19:33 < bridge> <Learath2> even I get 5.2k or so in aip gores
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller did u compile in debug?
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> gnome cant be that bad
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> nah
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> release
19:33 < bridge> <Learath2> oh and this is a debug build
19:33 < bridge> <Learath2> let me try a release one
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> should i download from ddnet.org?
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> LMAO
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i swear it must be gnome, so i can laugh my ass off
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no wonder everyone hates linux when they install ubuntu xD
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> xd
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> ubuntu is way worse
19:34 < bridge> <Learath2> What map do you check on @Jupeyy_Keks ?
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> than debian or arch w gnome
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ckisbzw1
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> insane gores map
19:34 < bridge> <Learath2> which server even has that? kog?
19:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
19:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but usually i do it on lan server anyway
19:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but aip gores is good too
19:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> should be similar
19:36 <+ChillerDragon> i got openbox
19:36 <+ChillerDragon> its just a mouse
19:36 < bridge> <Learath2> mh, on release build I get about 5.4k, not much of a difference there
19:36 <+ChillerDragon> all black
19:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
19:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> right click
19:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> open terminal
19:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> start ddnet
19:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki how much do u get on gentoo?
19:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fps
19:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> around
19:36 < bridge> <Learath2> funfact I get 8k fps in opengl 3.3
19:37 < bridge> <Learath2> lol
19:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nvidia?
19:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cant test now
19:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im a mmo player i got a raid soon
19:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :santatrollet:
19:37 <+ChillerDragon> its just a mouseaaa
19:37 < bridge> <Learath2> yep gtx 1080
19:37 <+ChillerDragon> a
19:37 <+ChillerDragon> a
19:37 <+ChillerDragon> a shit
19:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mhh even that isnt impressive tbh
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> should be around 10k fps
19:38 <+ChillerDragon> hoiw to resize windows
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it was on my old AMD Vega
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well nvm tbh, it's purely CPU bottleneck
19:38 < bridge> <Learath2> gl3.3 performing better than vulkan isn't concerning?
19:38 <+ChillerDragon> it took fucking 20s to open termional everything is bugged
19:38 <+ChillerDragon> openbox suck ass
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah it is
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but that must be some nvidia weirdness xd
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on windows most ppl said it performed better
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> 17k fps
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> on Ton2 ddnet pub servwe4 weith playerts
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> xd
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> but i cant see shit
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> how to resize windows
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so its really GNOME?
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> AAA
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> found it
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that would be the funniest shit ever
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> finally
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> yea so openbox is reaaaaally bugged
19:39 < bridge> <Learath2> but yes it is sucking my cpu dry with your settings,
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> and it felt like windows 89
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah openbox sucks, but its almost no overhead xD
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> it took sooooo long to open gnome terminal and so on
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> but yea 17k fps
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epic
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> new record confirmed
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> make screenshot
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but go on empty server
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> hgow xd
19:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> F10
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> a
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> xd
19:41 <+ChillerDragon> fps dont get better
19:41 <+ChillerDragon> on empty
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well make screenshot tho
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i need for record
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is this opengl 3.3 now, or vulkan?
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can you try the other
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just to be sure
19:42 <+ChillerDragon> i like minimal but bro openbox makes me nervous af
19:42 <+ChillerDragon> i really wanna leave xd
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bro u dont need to use
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just do what i said then i leave u alone
19:42 <+ChillerDragon> rn
19:43 <+ChillerDragon> openbox mf hang it self
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nvidia problems
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :lol: 🇬 🇳 🇴 🇲 🇪 :lol:
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> !c do u switch to kde now?
19:44 < chillerbot> ChillerDragon
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> hm im honestly thinking about it xd
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> wow firefox just took 20secs to boot on gnome
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> fresh install
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> my life is cursed
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> r u using gnome in cpu mode or smth xd
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684950423.png
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> idk man
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> it never took that long to open ff

19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thanks
19:47 < bridge> <Voxel> !vox
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i need discord link so it stays forever
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> .-.
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> screenshot is so boring
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> xd
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> the number does funi flickering
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> i wouldnt be able to play with this fps on
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> the render cant keep up rendering the fps
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah u dont need to
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> use 1k fps, u should be able to play almost tearing free with that
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that was the reason for new pc, right?
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> yes
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> i mean new screen fixed tearing actually
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> but it introduced such a weird washing effect
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> that gave me major eye and head break
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> see if u can control monitor overwrite
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or ghosting
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> and also vim taking 10s to write a 200l file made me wanna buy new hardware xd
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> smth is brokn with ur setup
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> no doubt
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> too lazy to debug i just throw money at it
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> clever
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> ikr
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yea
19:55 < bridge> <Learath2> Chiller did you check gl vs vk?
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he rq, bcs he hates openbox xD
19:56 < bridge> <Learath2> Was it actually a gnome issue?
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe its a setting
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but defs bad defaults, if gnome issue
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anti gaming settings
19:56 < bridge> <Learath2> That is just bizarre, doesn't gnome just give up the screen completely in fullscreen?
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess the compositor can overwrite it
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it wants
19:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > <Chiller@newpc> mostly doing rust downloads tho because the rust git thingy is slow and so is my internet
19:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: install a newer rust version, the rust git thingy is gone there
19:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not yet by def
19:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> iirc
19:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> next version does
19:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> my nightly does it
19:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
20:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I did rustup defaults
20:11 < bridge> <Learath2> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/342454474117218334/1110993276338700368 seems it's time to make atleast a crude spam filter
20:12 < bridge> <Voxel> can you run rustup uninstall :troll:
20:12 < bridge> <Voxel> oh yeah someone bypassed the repeating number thing
20:12 < bridge> <Voxel> lol
20:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> This trash graphic card has only one hdmi port rip 3rd screen
20:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea same
20:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@Learath2)
20:15 < bridge> <Learath2> Why are you using hdmi and not dp?
20:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what are the differences between the two?
20:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s 10bucks screen
20:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It has only hdmi
20:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am tempted to use my old 4k as secondary but it’s pointless overkill
20:17 < bridge> <Robyt3> DP 2.0 would have a higher bandwidth than HDMI 2.1
20:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dp is an open standard
20:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and on a higher level, why do both exist?
20:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, nice
20:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok, but its weird
20:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#Cost
20:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dp better
20:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my 3080 has 3 dp
20:22 < bridge> <Learath2> DisplayPort supports multi stream transport, which means you can daisy chain monitors or run multiple monitors off of one cable
20:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1110996161709490176/image.png
20:22 < bridge> <ReiTW> hdmi too?
20:22 < bridge> <ReiTW> well prob less monitors, but you can have like 2 monitors for eg
20:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> does hdmi support hdr?
20:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean basically all TVs support it
20:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would be weird if not
20:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with display port u can have a real 8K display
20:24 < bridge> <Learath2> Are you sure? hdmi > 2.0 has the bandwidth for it but I've never seen it advertised, nor have I ever seen a hdmi demux
20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 8k 144hz
20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
20:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> at 75hz
20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rip
20:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1110996766410686564/image.png
20:25 < bridge> <Learath2> As far as google suggests hdmi can't do daisy chaining at any version
20:25 < bridge> <ReiTW> typically dell displays allows you to have 2 monitors
20:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1110997044602097724/image.png
20:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > High-resolution displays and multiple displays with a single connection, via a hub or daisy-chaining
20:26 < bridge> <Learath2> I have a dell monitor, it can do dp daisy chaining, I haven't seen hdmi daisy chaining on it though
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > HBR3 mode with 25.92 Gbit/s of effective video bandwidth, using CVT-R2 timings, allows eight simultaneous 1080p displays (1920 × 1080) @ 60 Hz, stereoscopic 4K UHD (3840 × 2160) @ 120 Hz, or 5120 × 2880 @ 60 Hz each using 24 bit RGB, and up to 8K UHD (7680 × 4320) @ 60 Hz using 4:2:0 subsampling[

20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> over hdmi
20:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i need 8k 480hz
20:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hdmi has royaltees
20:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dp is royaltee free
20:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i always find it weird, that manufactors accept stuff like this
20:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well
20:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its like windows
20:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ppl are forced to use it
20:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> due to popularity
20:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
20:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but why does it get popular in first place xD
20:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it doesnt feel like the competition is not there
20:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz no alternative existed
20:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i guess
20:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its basically, whoever enters first the market
20:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well maybe, yeah 😄
20:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> gets this huge advantage
20:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> until market settles
20:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> speaking like a capitalist
20:30 < bridge> <ReiTW> @Learath2
20:30 < bridge> <ReiTW> ah mybad was talking about thunderbolt
20:30 < bridge> <ReiTW> smth different
20:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nobo
20:31 < bridge> <ReiTW> I suck at multimedia :hollande:
20:31 < bridge> <Learath2> The other option at the time was dual link DVI, which was this clunky cable, I guess the hdmi founders saw an opportunity to make a sexy connector and use their oligopoly to make it a standard
20:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but like, why would the biggest players in the market not  be able to do this their own xD
20:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or they did
20:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and it was called HDMI xd
20:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:35 < bridge> <Learath2> this indeed
20:36 < bridge> <Learath2> ^^
20:36 < bridge> <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1110999716176605224/image.png
20:36 < bridge> <Learath2> That's basically the entire display market
20:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
20:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so get the money from the small companies
20:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice
20:37 < bridge> <Robyt3> Why is `cl_threadsoundloading` default `0`? Did threaded sound loading ever cause issues on any system? I think we could change the default to `1` and also remove the settings checkbox for this, because it doesn't seem relevant and understandable enough for users to be in the UI.
20:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> probs ancient windows users
20:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it was once an issue, when mem_alloc was not thread safe
20:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but that was like 5 years ago
20:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i have it on 1 since many years
20:39 < bridge> <Robyt3> hmm, we could rename the config variable to do a reset for all users and change it to `1`
20:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> should be safe
20:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we dont need to rename it
20:39 < bridge> <Robyt3> I also use `1` since always
20:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we dont save the default value
20:40 < bridge> <Robyt3> ah yeah
20:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we should™ get better config handling
20:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ^^
20:40 < bridge> <Learath2> try not to monetize standards challenge impossible difficulty
20:40 < bridge> <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111000804145500320/image.png
20:40 < bridge> <Robyt3> like json? or still using the old line-based system?
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but mpeg already sounds like a greedy comp
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😂
20:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> like a way to distinguish between unset and variables set explicitly to default
20:41 < bridge> <Learath2> Preferably still using the old line based system but with a way to distinguish unset
20:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> plus a way to save settings that the client doesn't need
20:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> plus a way to save settings that the client doesn't know about
20:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> someone ever implemented Future trait in rust theirself?
20:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> many times
20:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is there no way to move the underlaying self out?
20:43 < bridge> <Learath2> only for toy examples
20:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or why is it not possible
20:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `self: std::pin::Pin<&mut Self>`
20:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why does it need to use a ref
20:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's possible if you implement unpin, if I understand your question correctly
20:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok
20:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let me try that
20:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> implementing unpin is automatic
20:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> either your type is unpin or not
20:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> might be related or not to the last "attack" on Swarfey's server, but a bot named Admin_tee joined my server dfng. It's a bot because it gets timed out and it also joined ALIVE fng solo
20:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> it seemed to advertise a stream link
20:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I can provide logs if neccessary ;)
20:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> might be related or not to the last "attack" on Swarfey's server, but a bot named Admin_tee joined my server dfng. It's a bot because it gets timed out with 999 ping and it also joined ALIVE fng solo
20:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> DM me the IP please
20:47 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> it's multiple
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its currently connected to over 100 servers
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok somtimes twice
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe 50
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 85
20:49 < bridge> <ReiTW> ah looking at the screenshot he provided yesterday those are definetly proxies (not related to the thing u talk today)
20:49 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ah ok :)
20:49 < bridge> <Voxel> AAH! THIS ISSUE IS EVIL!
20:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why?
20:50 < bridge> <Voxel> #**666**0
20:50 < bridge> <Learath2> mh, what is the issue with this? do you want the ownership of the future to be passed to the poll method? The executor still needs the future though
20:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> wait for #**6666**
20:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 😄
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but doesnt it get a Poll as return
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that thing will have the ownership
20:52 < bridge> <Learath2> I mean they could have decided on that too yeah, that would also have been a viable option, but why tho?
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but maybe it works anyway
20:52 < bridge> <ReiTW> biggest question is what will happen after 9999
20:52 < bridge> <Learath2> Instead of enum Poll, it'd have to be a struct, with the future and the result of the poll, then the executor can take it back from that
20:52 < bridge> <ReiTW> will u all organize a party for celebrating the 10k issues
20:53 < bridge> <Learath2> Are you having an issue with something specific or just want to know why the choice btw?
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, i guess i assumed it doesnt work with pin
20:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i did this
20:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>         let mut a = Pin::new(&mut self.connecting);
20:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>         let mut b: Type = Type::None;
20:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>         std::mem::swap(&mut *a, &mut b);
20:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and compiler doesnt throw any error
20:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i'm fine
20:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it panics, rip
20:57 < bridge> <Learath2> Eh, too little context for me to understand what you are asking, maybe @heinrich5991 can dissect it
20:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this doesn't really do anything
20:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah wait
20:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try `mem::replace(&mut a, Type::None)`
20:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i need the content of the pinned data
20:59 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> done
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> somewhere in the code i call 
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> x.await
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and x holds the data i want, but x is actually 2 different paths
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> one path is a normal async block like we know it, there the impl for Future is easy
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the other is normal data. i just want to have the data without needing a Arc here
21:00 < bridge> <Learath2> Pin doesn't prevent you from modifying the content, it just means the Future can not move in memory
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well as long it doesnt access the memory twice
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'm ok with that
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the future
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the fake future 😂
21:01 < bridge> <Learath2> So you just want a future that resolves immediately?
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> basically yeah, to reduce code dublication
21:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `std::future::ready()`
21:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but yea, `mem::replace` would work for tha
21:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> t
21:02 < bridge> <Learath2> https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/future/fn.ready.html
21:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah
21:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> makes sense
21:02 < bridge> <Learath2> Not sure how optimized this is but it's actually already a thing 😄
21:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well thats too ez
21:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
21:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's in std too
21:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and not sure what you'd want to optimize there
21:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's just an option
21:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah thanks
21:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cleaner than moving memory around
21:05 < bridge> <Learath2> idk it might entail a move or sth, I haven't taken a look
21:05 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> hmm there are a lot of servers with "Admin_tee" in them but only 3 of them registered with the blue tick. Could this be resolved arlready in the latest ddnet server?
21:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> nothing to resolve there, really. official servers probably have proxy detection
21:06 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Ah ok nice
21:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> using rust tm
21:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i like toml
21:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/macro.pin.html
21:13 < bridge> <Learath2> What's nice about our current setup is how console commands and configuration is unified
21:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do u think it can create issues to block on a future inside a Future impl?
21:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the future is ready
21:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then just call poll on it
21:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you mean your `future::ready`?
21:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> just forward the call to that future
21:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i poll the future to poll the resulting future that gets the returning Poll?
21:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i use the result of the future to create a new future
21:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and thats what i currently poll
21:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you give me a bit of source?
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```rs
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let connection = tokio_tungstenite::accept_async(connection.block_on().0); //<-- this is a ready future for simpli
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>                 let ws_stream = pin!(connection).poll(cx);
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>                 ws_stream.map(|f| match f {
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>                     Ok(connection) => Ok(TungsteniteNetworkConnectionWrapper {
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>                         con: Arc::new(ConnectionType::Server(connection)),
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>                     }),
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>                     Err(err) => Err(err.to_string()),
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>                 })
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
21:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is this in a `Future` impl??
21:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is this in a `Future` impl?
21:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
21:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I question the reason why you want to implement it manually here
21:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> wouldn't it work properly if you'd just write this as an async function?
21:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but if you absolutely want to, call poll and unwrap the result
21:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah it's weird, but the websocket impl is a bit easier than quic
21:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so it's a bit hacky
21:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the network code wants a future here
21:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> an async function returns a future
21:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. no need to implement future manually if you just need a future
21:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh i guess i'll just call accept_async in the code before
21:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess i wanted the server and client connecting phase to look similar
21:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but maybe its too annoying
21:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the ws server wants a tcp accept first, then ws accept
21:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the ws client simply connects
21:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont even understand why they split it
21:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when i defs want a ws client anyway
21:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i read this
21:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/snapview/tokio-tungstenite/blob/master/examples/server.rs
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah nvm me, i'll just move the call
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anything else looks stupid xD
21:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can also combine two async functions into one, by writing an async function
21:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think I don't udnerstand the problem fully ^^
21:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah b ut i assume then i block other tcp accepts meanwhile?
21:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since the function doesnt return
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok last question
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> How to save a future as attribute of a struct
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Box<dyn Future>?
21:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oftne, you can't name the future's type, yes
21:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then it's `Box<dyn Future<Output=something>>`
21:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> otherwise, you could also name the future directly
21:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. `future::ready()` returns a known type
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but if its not ready
21:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> now we're definitely confused
21:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in theory i know the resulting type
21:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would Box create a useless heap object?
21:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
21:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mhh
21:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> unavoidable if you can't name the future's type
21:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but e.g. `tokio::sleep` returns a nameable type
21:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so type in a sense of an enum member?
21:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ready,
21:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not_ready,
21:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
21:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> whatever they are called
21:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the output type?
21:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
21:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ok
21:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so, e.g. `i32` is a type
21:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it implements `Debug`
21:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> similarly, `tokio::sleep`, returns a type named `Sleep` that implements `Future`
21:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or `std::future::ready` returns a type named `Ready` that implements `Future` as well
21:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but often, you'll deal with types you cannot name that also implement `Future`
21:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. when you write an async function, you'll get such an unnameable type
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why is that so tho?
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in this case at least
21:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because there's nothing like decltype in rust (yet)
21:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's a proposal to make that nameable
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i'll just use Box now
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anything else is too confusing
21:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds good 🙂
21:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> !jup what do you even Code all day
21:53 < chillerbot> @Jupstar ✪
21:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Omg bot
21:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah it’s Matrix being slow ofc
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i rarely (sadly) code on a new engine
21:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> !ping
21:54 < chillerbot> pong
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i want to use the engine for some personal stuff and later for ddnet playground
21:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> From scratch?
21:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> In rust?
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, but it's only a 2d engine, so nothing too fancy
21:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Hahhahahaha get fucked matrix ping pong takes like 2 minutes
21:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (<@749222324980416602_chillerbot>)
21:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Playground to add rust render code to ddnet?
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no
21:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd have already finished that, but since i use rust's enums it's too hard to port to c++
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i just want to play around with how i imagine ddnet... actually vanilla teeworlds as a first step
21:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What playground then
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then i rq
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's just a term to say "experimental"
21:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don’t get it
21:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How is your engine teeworlds related?
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on a playground i play around
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think u dont understand
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i reimplement teeworlds, but as i imagine it
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no backward compability
21:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no 0.7
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
21:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> With networking?
21:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 0.6 compatible?
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ofc not
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i use a completely new implemenation
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> using quic
21:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I see
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and i also want to support websockets, but actually for web compability
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> only
21:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How much you have?
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not so much for ddnet
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can join a server, jump around
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but the skin rendering isnt finished
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and the server would require to send the certificate somehow to the client
21:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wow that’s amazing
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rn i am cheating a bit xd
21:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Where can I run it?
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's not public rn
21:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> WTF
21:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> wdym, should be done as part of the tls handshake, no?
21:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Imagine doing not public
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the sha of the cert
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so the client can trust it
22:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
22:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And then not buying Nvidia
22:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm doing the public key directly, instead
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can release it, but its extremly unfinished
22:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Proprietary jupster
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and basically all commits are
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `u`
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
22:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So do
22:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Better than nothing
22:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I give you a star
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i can create  a snapshot if u want
22:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i dont want to maintain it
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or accept any kind of pr
22:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There is no maintenance
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i actually dont even want anyone to read it yet
22:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Where do you git push now?
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's very prototyping
22:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why not?
22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its very bad code xD
22:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Elitism
22:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes whatever then stay closed src until you ready but sounds interesting
22:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If bad code should not be published I would have to make 200 repos private
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can release it, i just dont want u to read it
22:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can test how amazingly fast the maps load
22:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Dw i can’t read
22:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs i put a lot of effort making every run at high speed
22:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds cool 🙂
22:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Does it load regular maps ?
22:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> (on modern hardware) xd

22:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how do a push the latest commit without history? 😅
22:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you could squash all the commits
22:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> other than that, not possible?
22:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but i dont want to destroy my commits yet 😄
22:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can squash everything on a branch
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> These days git checkout has a --orphan option that makes a branch with no history.

22:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it might require rust nightly, never tested without
22:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah was experimenting with wasm
22:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so u need to build the wasm thing in debug mode xD
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p ui
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> before building the project itself
22:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah and it has no prediciton, nothing
22:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> really just ported gamecore
22:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just dont use it lol
