07:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> For loop does have empty body
07:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
07:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its not enough context aware
07:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> it should suggest to remove it entirely cuz there is a {} after
07:14 < bridge> <totar> it gets formatted to
07:14 < bridge> <totar> ```cpp
07:14 < bridge> <totar> int i, sum = 0;
07:14 < bridge> <totar> for(i = 0; i < 5; i++)
07:14 < bridge> <totar>     ;
07:14 < bridge> <totar> {
07:14 < bridge> <totar>     i += sum;
07:14 < bridge> <totar> }
07:14 < bridge> <totar> ```
07:15 < bridge> <totar> for me, I didn't even have to press the format hotkey but that also does it
07:15 < bridge> <totar> it's actively impossible to write that code lol
07:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> what?
07:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> not everyone uses a format on save xD
07:16 < bridge> <totar> ok only sane people
07:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont
07:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> it can be distracting, i just format manually
07:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> am i insane? :justatest:
07:17 < bridge> <totar> I have format on line end, whenver I type ; it formats the line

07:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
07:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> are u awake at 7?
07:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> or u didnt sleep
07:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> im a degen and wake up at 7 on saturday

07:20 < bridge> <totar> I'm in america
07:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
07:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> ðŸ”«
07:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u are american or german?
07:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i default to german for devs, TIL xd
07:21 < bridge> <totar> american?
07:21 < bridge> <totar> you're not the only one
07:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u know gdin?
07:21 < bridge> <totar> zwelf asked me to go to teeworld developer meetup in germany
07:21 < bridge> <totar> yesterdayy
07:21 < bridge> <totar> yesterday
07:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh nice
07:22 < bridge> <totar> lol
07:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> it must be expensive for u tho
07:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> its expensive for me from bcn already xD
07:22 < bridge> <totar> only a little bit
07:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> but ill go
07:22 < bridge> <totar> not irl
07:25 < bridge> <louis> wow whos going
07:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> for now most german devs and me xD
07:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> hope learath comes i need to see the C man
07:36 < bridge> <eidderFsT> gerdev
07:55 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
08:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> come

10:23 < bridge> <hectavoxel> you're an ai generated old man?
11:13 < bridge> <louis> @robyt3 should methods like CEditor::AddSound also be not static then?

11:35 < bridge> <learath2> Aye
11:53 < bridge> <louis> nvm
11:54 < bridge> <louis> hall effects were that recent? i feel like i remember them being around for some time
11:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Haven't these been around since forever?
11:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> At least in keyboards they're absolutely ancient
11:55 < bridge> <learath2> They were around, console makers just havenâ€™t been using them so they can sell more controllers when the pots start failing inevitably
11:55 < bridge> <learath2> Dreamcast had hall effect joysticks
11:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> They also have the benefit of potentially being smoother yay
12:28 < bridge> <0xdeen> @gravitycontained Thanks!
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> furo is back
12:50 < bridge> <oxyzo.> back to sleep
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I sponsor you 50â‚¬ of your costs if you come xdd
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ah nice you port that after all
12:52 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it wasn't really a port i think
12:53 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i'm just trying, not sure if it'll work out tho, i feel like so many thing can go wrong
12:54 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ghost already doesn't work, and i'm still not sure how to deal with that
13:11 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> guys, i need to edit DDNet's code to do ip ban for every servers ?
13:11 < bridge> <nayzox_tw> or can i do a centralised firewall ':)
13:14 < bridge> <learath2> it builds it links, lets see if it crashes
13:14 < bridge> <eidderFsT> epic
13:31 < bridge> <learath2> I think it works question mark
13:32 < bridge> <eidderFsT> did you register a server
13:32 < bridge> <learath2> I can't really test it because can't open a port ðŸ˜„
13:32 < bridge> <eidderFsT> NAT moment
13:33 < bridge> <learath2> Well bigger issue is that idk the credentials to this modem
13:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> I don't even have a public IP from ISP
13:35 < bridge> <learath2> I made a pr with it, I'll pull it to some ddnet server, build and test it there
13:35 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ok
13:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> hi from andorra
13:45 < bridge> <learath2> @tsfreddie it works as far as I can see
13:45 < bridge> <learath2> I haven't tested all 256 slots though as idk how, you can mess around with it if you'd like, I gtg

15:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> ah its empty
15:33 < bridge> <zwelf2> yeah, I tried writing once, vut threw the code away. My first approach didn't work well.
15:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> what exactly didnt work well
15:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> is it possible to see the code?
15:37 < bridge> <louis> nice voice
15:37 < bridge> <louis> ddnet rs crashes when i switch desktops back and forth
15:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> same
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah it's a wayland bug
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> use WAYLAND_DISPLAY= ./ddnet-rs
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> as workaround
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah it's a wayland bug
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> use `WAYLAND_DISPLAY= ./ddnet-rs`
15:38 < bridge> <louis> could not find wayland compositor ðŸ˜¢
15:39 < bridge> <louis> also, i'm sort of confused with the direction you want to take ddnet-rs
15:40 < bridge> <soulyvevo> bruh it took me too much time to figure some of those stuff out
15:41 < bridge> <soulyvevo> and now i see a video that goes over the features
15:41 < bridge> <soulyvevo> ðŸ˜­
15:41 < bridge> <soulyvevo> ive spent like 20 minutes trying to figure out how those profile work lmao
15:41 < bridge> <soulyvevo> ive spent like 20 minutes trying to figure out how thoses profile work lmao
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i created an issue:
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/4073
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> let's see how they respond
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> watcha mean exactly?
15:45 < bridge> <louis> is it supposed to exist alongside current ddnet or etc etc :think_bot:
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The map & database, aswell as the ddnet physics are backward compatible. So it can coexist to the current ddnet without having any of its limitations
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I don't aim to replace ddnet, but if in the long run more players like this version I also wouldn't prevent it from happening ^^
15:48 < bridge> <louis> do u plan to keep the map system or maybe implement a classic map type along a better maybe more dynamic map type?
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> generally speaking i design the mod support so that you can use completely custom maps, with a completely different map format.
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> (this however requires a render mod too)
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But I am open to also extend the current one to fix issues with the current format and maybe make it flexible in some regards
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The good thing is that if you have the map in legacy format, you can always convert it to the new format
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so breaking changes can be done a bit easier

18:40 < ChillerDragon> @eidderFsT 0.7 name length support is broken at least in demos
18:41 < ChillerDragon> but yes in theory 0.7 supports 16 utf8 characters
18:41 < ChillerDragon> ``MAX_NAME_LENGTH=16,
18:41 < ChillerDragon> MAX_NAME_ARRAY_SIZE=MAX_NAME_LENGTH*UTF8_BYTE_LENGTH+1,
18:42 < ChillerDragon> ddnet did not extend 0.6 as far as i know and is capped at 16 bytes
18:43 < bridge> <eidderFsT> chillerdragon: check my ddnet pr #9476
18:43 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9476
18:45 < ChillerDragon> @ryozuki i agree manual formatting is much better
18:47 < ChillerDragon> too lazy to check that huge pr sorry
18:48 < bridge> <eidderFsT> :justatest:
18:52 < ChillerDragon> but i remember being annoyed by something name related. I think it really was the teeworlds 0.7 demos missing long name support.
18:59 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ye, so i avoided netmsg like a plague
19:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> solution: redesign the whole protocol from scratch
19:02 < bridge> <hectavoxel> b-b-but the backwards compatability!!
19:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> screw backwards compatibility
19:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> if it mattered ddnet would have supported teewars clients
19:06 < bridge> <hectavoxel> @chillerdragon i found your next project
19:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> xD
19:13 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> @tsfreddie can demos now show cursors in 18.9
19:14 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i wanted to check but i forgot and im not home now
19:17 < bridge> <syrinok> Yes
19:19 < bridge> <hectavoxel> does android client have the updater installed with it?
19:58 < bridge> <robyt3> no, that's not supported

22:16 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ddnet spitball idea:
22:16 < bridge> <hectavoxel> crates and batteries
22:16 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - Crates have already been thought of
22:16 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - Draggable entities that have the same physics as a tee. hammer throwing, hooking and dragging all apply
22:16 < bridge> <hectavoxel> 
22:16 < bridge> <hectavoxel> - Batteries are like crates except when you shoot or hammer it it sends out an electrical charge, basically hammering you. Useful for things like hammerflying or cool solo maps
22:17 < bridge> <kebscs> draggable stuff would be cool and probably possible to do, but backwards compatibility ðŸ™„
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> A simple fng mod using the patching approach:
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://youtu.be/BDYdIbmIN0s
22:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Is there already an issue on gh about the editor where if you select some tiles, and you have a brush, then if you select other layer, your brush will still show tiles from the previous layer but if you try to draw, the tiles will be different?
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @blaiszephyr chillerdragon:
22:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> why didn't you stream it :feelsbadman:
22:46 < bridge> <meloÆž> OMG I HAVE SOMETHING TO ANNOY MY WIFE WITH IN BED, LETS GOOO

22:49 < bridge> <hectavoxel> dude you know that random - symbol in game.png? just send that for any backwards compatability texture

23:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nice I did not expect it so soon. Added to watch later.
23:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Server side dummies with special skin for old clients?
23:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Pred would be weird for collisions but that's already the case for a number of things
23:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> (assuming we want crates to be, you know, square)
23:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I mean if you really want nice graphics you can send patched map files with extra textures and then have a quad using that texture, animated server side
23:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 
23:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Personally I would consider that overkill
23:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> (is this how KoG moving tiles work?)
