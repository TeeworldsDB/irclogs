09:20 <@deen> qutebrowser is the replacement for pentadactyl firefox addon, which is the replacement for vimperator firefox addon, which gave you nice keyboard-only vim-like controls
09:42 <@heinrich5991> gave?
09:42 <@heinrich5991> oh
09:43 <@deen> firefox only supports chrome addons now
09:43 <@heinrich5991> deen: may I suggest vimfx? it's quite nice. fstd uses it, too
09:43 <@deen> "VimFx is a legacy Firefox extension, which is not compatible with Firefox 57+."
09:44 <@heinrich5991> you're on 57 already?
09:44 <@heinrich5991> but yea, something has to change there :/
09:44 <@deen> I don't want to start learning new key binds and then switch again in a few months
09:44 <@deen> I never found anything other than pentadactyl usable for what it's worth
09:45 <@deen> but it made firefox terribly slow in the last years
09:45 <@heinrich5991> yep
09:45 <@heinrich5991> it's why I dropped it
09:45 <@deen> so I now use pure firefox with the default keyboard shortcuts, which can be quite annoying
09:46 <@deen> (have to use mouse)
09:49 <@heinrich5991> ok, vimfx is declared dead by its author
09:49 <@heinrich5991> it's not becoming a webext
11:26 <+fstd> >.>
11:26 <+fstd> i guess i'll stay on ff 54 for the foreseeable future
12:35 <+ochristi> there is a LTS version <57, which will stay around for ages
12:36 <+ochristi> ah they call it ESR
14:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Just asking, are you talking about cli-browsers ?
14:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> If yes, you feel it comfortable to use? I mean, im pretty new age user
14:30 <@heinrich5991> vimfx is a firefox addon
14:30 <@heinrich5991> so are pentadactyl, vimium etc.
14:41 <@deen> yes, it's very comfortable not having to move your hand to your mouse
14:48 <@heinrich5991> they add vim shortcuts to firefox
14:48 <@heinrich5991> the most important one probably being f
14:48 <@heinrich5991> which allows you to click a link, select a text entry, etc.
14:48 <@heinrich5991> you press f
14:48 <@heinrich5991> and then it'll overlay the screen with a lot of numbers/letters/whatever that you have to type to focus or click a link, text entry, etc.
14:49 <@heinrich5991> you can also type the link text if you want
14:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Okay, I get it. Full-keyboard controlled app
14:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> sounds cool
14:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> But first you have to memorize a lot commands
14:50 <@heinrich5991> no
14:50 <@heinrich5991> just "f"
14:50 <@heinrich5991> you could install vimfx and give it a try :)
14:50 <@heinrich5991> you can press ? to get help
14:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> In Chrome ?
14:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It's called Vimium, it is it?
15:00 <@heinrich5991> no, in firefox
15:00 <@heinrich5991> don't know vimium
15:00 <@heinrich5991> can't say that it's good or bad
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> ff even removed socks authentication :feelsbadman:
15:23 <@heinrich5991> you sure?
15:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> yes
15:23 <@heinrich5991> I see something like this in the settings dialog
15:24 <@heinrich5991> "Do not prompt for authentication if password is saved" in Connection Settings
15:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> yeah but it's not working, when i tired it
15:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> used foxyproxy before and now they state "Due to Firefox limitations, username/password authentication is not available with SOCKS proxy servers"
15:26 <@heinrich5991> so you didn't try the firefox one but the foxyproxy one? ^^
15:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> i did but i dont even get promped for authentication anymore
15:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> "Do not prompt for authentication if password is saved" disabled this
15:28 <@heinrich5991> mh, interesting
15:28 <@heinrich5991> it seems that firefox does indeed not support authentication for socks5
15:28 <@heinrich5991> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122752
15:28 <@heinrich5991> but hasn't supported it in 16 years either
15:29 <@heinrich5991> ok, not that clear
15:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> haven't used the inbuilt one before, but now it seems like there is no way to use socks with authentication anymore

20:38 <+borartr> hey guys, any chance left of getting my race map released on your servers? index said it would require further testing but no one other than him gave feedback since roughly 1.5 years
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> link the topic
20:42 <+borartr> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=3701&p=38737#p38737
20:45 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> I checked it a while ago, for a race map the map is cool, but I don't think for ddnet. (people will play in entities anyways, the map is kinda short, etc.) you should try to release it on unique servers, they have a bigger race audience anyways
20:45 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> try to contact tezcan, in-game or in ddnet forum
21:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> http://tezcan.lima-city.de/mapupload.php
21:25 <+borartr> k i will do thanks
