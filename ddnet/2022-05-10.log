00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> ahah
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> so dumb 😂
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTEiQx88B2U&ab_channel=LowLevelLearning
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> funny too
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> does anyone know the behaviour of being stuck in a corner?
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> whenever i'm stuck in a corner while hooking and i press f1
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> i stay stuck
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> but if i press the chat button, i get unstuck
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> doesn't the chat button instantly hold?
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> you mean, when hooking the ceiling, press f1, thren press f1 again, and then press chat? for me i stay hooked
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFnqD9hgGcc&ab_channel=RockusTeeworlds
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> i mean this
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> its a bug
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> its not a bug
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> are you holding keys down?
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> if i get stuck in the corner like that and press f1, i stay stuck
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> but if i press chat i get unstuck
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> yes
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> its because chat unstucks your keys
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> dont press the chat button
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> whenever you are holding a direction and hooked
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> it holds the keys, no?=
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> when you press the chat button your hook stays but not your movement keys
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> they do
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> oh ye they don't
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> you're right
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> of  course im right
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> thought this was server sided
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> i mean, it prob is
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> im always right about that i say it to everyone and absolutely no one believes me ever
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> its the #1 bug that should be fixed
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> i mean, it was like that before
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> i think they changed it to be like this
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> #4563
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4563
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> maybe with another client it works idk
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> #4653
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4653
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> lul
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> opening chat doesnt unstuck them
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> only closing chat does
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> even if you use esc to close it still unsticks the keys
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> so its the first chat opening that dooms you
02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> you can still use the console to chat tho
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> "say [message]"
03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> so why whenever i open chat i get unstuck?
03:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> bot client
04:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <destro> can some1 help me find a map
04:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <baby frog> no.
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iParano> i think it depends on what server you were, i know that when u open chat on DDNet servers, keys keep holding, but if you're on KoG servers, it doesnt !
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> u

12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Hey guys, I have this weird visual bug on my new map: A quad is somehow spawning a completly different quad. ( The card at the top left is spawning a jeton)
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/973530504462733312/Gores_of_Diamonds_bugged_left.demo.mp4
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> At first I thought the bug is in the jeton layer, but with info enabled you can see that none of the enveloped quads can be at the postion of the bugged quad as seen in the video.
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/973530898152710184/screenshot_2022-05-10_12-22-45.png
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> I than moved the card quad a bit to the right and the jeton would be spawned there.
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/973531097549901844/Gores_of_Diamonds_bugged_mid.demo.mp4
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Here is the map file
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/973531320514912296/Gores_of_Diamonds_buggedJeton.map
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> I even deleted the card quad that would spawn it and replaced it with a new one, but than the jeton just spawned at another card quad XD
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/973531670261170186/Gores_of_Diamonds_bugged_right.demo.mp4

13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> at what do I have to look xD I do not understand
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Ah now I see it, at the end there spawns an oval instead of a round poker chip
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> Yo ! what is the command for spamemote on my serveur please ?!
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> You mean `sv_emoticon_delay`?
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @mind does it still happen on a renderer other than vulkan? weird quads appearing in vulkan is a known issue
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> maybe i was searching for the wrong glitch. u mean that chip that appears out of nowhere on the left side ?
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> or did i miss something
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/973582358827642910/unknown.png

15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> i dont know how a vulcan error looks like, but i would check env 4
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> how does a vulcan error looks like ? is it the thing tsin postet about dynamic_dragger ?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> I checked the opengl 3.x renderes and it seems indeed to only happen with vulkan!
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> should be fixed in nightly tho
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Patiga can you check with ur tool how many maps have quad layers with quads, whos distance(whole bounding box distance, so basically from on end to the start of the other quad, not the mid distance or smth :D, visually seperated distance, dunno if there is a word lmao) is bigger than default zoomed screen space
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so e.g. 22.5 tiles(screen width) distance in the  x coordinate
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> Any idea why a server could crash here? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/490704b54344089bd1fb28d859d7398b4e8a0c0f/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L1868 maybe full ram or something like that?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why should it crash of full ram when it clears cache 😄
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just use asan xd
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or not reproducable?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <payroll6450> Hey,
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <payroll6450> Sup developers of DDNet,
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <payroll6450> do any of you guys have a gf?
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> i dont? can you sell me some hot singles near by?
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/973612646555328583/unknown.png
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> based
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> :gigachad:
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <payroll6450> That's sexist
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <payroll6450> (<@749222324980416602_=5bquakenet=5d=20=43hiller=44ragon>)
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <payroll6450> Ah, makes sense
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> deen has one
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but maybe its already his wife
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> heapoverflow o.O
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> learath is too sexy for the women on this planet
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <payroll6450> ...
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <payroll6450> Okay you guys are not troll-worthy
17:58 <+ChillerDragon> oh wow i could reproduce in ddnet thats surprising
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or ur just unfunny
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <payroll6450> I was trolling people and had ton of fun
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <payroll6450> (@Ryozuki)
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <payroll6450> you guys just counter-troll
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> imagine trying to troll with
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> > do any of you guys have a gf?
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> 
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> 2005 wants his jokes back
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> heads up bud, its 2022
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <payroll6450> the point is I was having fun
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> nowadays people troll with ddos
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <payroll6450> Nah that's boring
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Wow a real oldschool troll
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets take a picture
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats rare
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <payroll6450> What do you define a modern troll to be?
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> you mean the minimum distance between two quads of all quads in a quadslayer, not between any 2 quads in a quadslayer, right?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i actually want to see how many maps there are that use one quad layer with multiple quads whos quads are far away from each other
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> to see if there are any reproducable performance problems by not checking if the quad is actually visisble or not
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for 2-3 quads per layer its not worth it anyway
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, find quads layers thaz spread their quads far over the map
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> can do that at home
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if you want you could try too though, either in rust or python ^^
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i suck at both xd
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I mean maybe its enough to find the top 5 quads layers with the most amount of quads
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if we are a little lucky, those might just be good
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Ryozuki amd's refreshs are totally not worth it
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> :/
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> freesync?
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gpu refreshes
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> released today
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> uh what dat
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 6650 xt
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> etc
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://gizmodo.com/amd-radeon-rx-6000-xt-gpu-refresh-available-now-startin-1848902362
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt the nex 6950 xt beat the 3080 or smth
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or the 3090
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> new*
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 3080 probably yes
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 3090 would be nice
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > AMD says the RX 6950 XT with 16GB of VRAM is competing with the Nvidia RTX 3090 GPU and can put up a fight against the RTX 3090 Ti. Where AMD claims a clear victory is in performance-to-wattage ratio; the RX 6950 XT operates at 335W, whereas the RTX 3090 runs at 350W and the 3090 Ti at 450W.
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Based on AMD’s internal performance benchmarks, the RX 6950 XT topped the RTX 3090 in Doom Eternal, Far Cry 6, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Watch Dogs Legion, and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 3090 ti uses 450w
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> insane
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the mid ranges are worth less tho
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well im happy with my 6600 xt
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i can play anything at max
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since im at 1080
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it might suffer at higher res
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but u cant play minecraft raytracing xd
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with shaders it looks good anyway
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah i'd love to trade my vega64 vs 6600 xt, they are around same speed lvl
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but amd drivers are better for the newer cards
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> Thanks you !
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye it probs has some more benefits too
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its pcie4
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if that counts
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah counts
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well with a amd cpu
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> my mb is pcie4
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u have SAM
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/smart-access-memory
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its a 10% improvement

18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> next gen from amd comes end of the year
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> NVIDIA comes soon™️
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hope amd delivers
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> me2
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or nvidia finally goes open source xd
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just cant get to like nvidia
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah understandable
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but competition is important
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> else prices are getting way too high xd
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats also why i hope intel does good mid range GPUs
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> small lead for amd in high end would be insane, would change a lot 😄
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its also sad there is just 2 competitors
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on gpu and cpu
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tru
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks but doesnt amd does way more arm than nvidia
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i bet they dominate the mobile field
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or idk
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe its the other way around
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do they make ARM?
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or u mean vs ARM?
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who makes smartphone cpus?
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> qualcomm mostly
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and apple of
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> c
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but only for apple xd
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but qualcomm just sucks
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they are so far behind apple, its redicilous
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they arent even trying

19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> good luck chillerdragon
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Ty
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i stoped investing on crypto
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> now i just buy some real companies stocks
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> When others are fearful. Be greedy!
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I still hold some amd based on jupstars financial advice
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh ye
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i gotta buy amd before the release
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Priced in
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> Chiller dragon ! IItube told me that you could help him with his server!! can you help me with mine please?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes wat u need
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> Closely that
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> [chillerdragon](https://matrix.to/#/@chillerdragon:matrix.org)\: can you maybe fix the issue? i mean u just need to increase `NET_MAX_PAYLOAD` to whatever the 0.7 server info needs as maximum right=?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Who is it even sending 0.7 stuff to? I only connected 0.6 clients on my local server
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it chaces the server info
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for 0.7 clients
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and 0.7 probs uses a bit more for names or smth
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in worst case try doubling it
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or make it dynamic size
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i cannot help, or look in 0.7 code
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dunno if they have smth similar
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Im on bike. But I’ll try in a min. Just double
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in 0.7 code the value is a bit bigger is bit bigger that value
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in 0.7 code the value is a bit bigger
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what app do you guys use to trade public stocks
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tho dunno if thats enough xd
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Apps are cringe
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is robinhood okay again or were they getting cancelled for something
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I use local stock dealer from my park
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ah
19:31 <+ChillerDragon> e lol NET_MAX_PAYLOAD is smaller in vanilla
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> Ok i wait !
19:31 <+ChillerDragon> wait for wat?
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok but does it fix the problem if u increase the value?
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> no
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> i doubled it
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> didnt help
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok then its probs other bug
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> NET_MAX_PAYLOAD = NET_MAX_PACKETSIZE * 2,
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> ye :( sad noises
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which issue are you talking about?
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> #5084
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5084
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> "WRITE of size 1404 at 0x61b0002c9f08 thread T0"
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats why i thought its just a tiny bit too small
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 1404 is like 15 bytes to much or smth
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> Wait for help man ! If you agree sure
19:35 <+ChillerDragon> help with what 
19:35 <+ChillerDragon> idk if you use discord replys or somehting but i have no idea what you want @badoumed
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> For that 😄
19:35 <+ChillerDragon> what
19:35 <+ChillerDragon> replys dont get bridged
19:36 <+ChillerDragon> just buy a matrix client -.-
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why is the discord bridge so bad, telegram <--> matrix is much better
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> pretty much all features work xd
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> This is whats been bothering me quite alot lately aswell. Having to upgrade the PSU just to able to run any of the midrange gpus from nvidia nowdays is getting really pricey
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but u dont need a heater anymore
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that saves u some bucks
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: pls fix matrix bridge
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's open source and on github
19:37 <+ChillerDragon> because the repteloids are good telegram devs they want you to use their deep state messanger
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the 3090 ti is not midrange tho
19:38 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i suck at coding im not a dev
19:38 <+ChillerDragon> i fix printers as a living
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you are a dev
19:38 <+ChillerDragon> and typos in my freetime :D
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> 've ordered a 3080 few days ago just to be surprised by how much power it consumes, so I had to buy a new PSU just to be able to supply the new GPU
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> 800W PSU's are fucking expensive as hell aswell
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> Matrix is a client ?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> how many fps do you get in ddnet with vulkan now? 😄
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet/blob/fa4bcd5ec05c663e834a609eaf931df35cf46538/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L2147 this size is 1096 
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have a 750w psu
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> honestly if u can afford a 3080 u should get a good psu
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they will be safer
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> IIRC that's the bare minimum required to supply a proper system with a rtx 3080
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> vulkan is nice
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i feel like it runs smoother on an integrated GPU
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> from like 40-50 to 55
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I have a 150 W PSU with an overclocked 91 W CPU 😄 Probably quite close to the limit
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> electronics related question: if I have a 450W PSU and the DC converter I'm looking into would be 300W, would it not be able to handle the load without additional power from a battery source?
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I honestly only understand how volts work but not watts or amps
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its long since i did electronics
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but maybe thats what a capacitor does
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk i may be talking bullshit
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> seems like watts are like power
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but amps are like a measure of current
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> Would it be possible to get help? real help! if you want I'll pay you but I need real help! and that someone is really interested in what I need! it's been more than 4 hours that I block.
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it a bot client?
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> It's a serveur
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/973642715176788038/unknown.png
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh idk about windows
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe someone else can help
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ononono
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> start this :justatest:
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this is the block guy
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> @badoumed what do you need help with? If you want to host game servers i recommend using a linux host not windows. Its much simpler
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> nvm it's not the same guy
19:54 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar i think NET_MAX_PACKETSIZE is the issue here not NET_MAX_PAYLOAD
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/973644821887606830/unknown.png
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> I have my serveur
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> I have my server
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno, must be this line `unsigned char m_aData[NET_MAX_PAYLOAD];`
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> I need help for just présentation
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats where it copies too
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/973645016394260480/unknown.png
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> for this
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in worst case make the mem_copy with maximum(...)
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> Thanks for help !
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/973645150351949914/unknown.png
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'll introduce a type safe wrapper in #5075 for system
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we can also add this for mem_copy and do array size checks for array typed datatypes
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5075
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also for str_copy functions
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mem_copy with `min`
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah min
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but probs also not nice, possibly creates logic errors
19:59 <+ChillerDragon> @badoumed so what do u need
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, you could add a `dbg_assert`
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but then we still havent fix this particular issue 😄
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but yes
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> our editor is also pretty broken
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> Thanks for help !!!
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe we should clone the code and start rewriting components
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> smth like editor2 that lives next to the current one
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe we should clone the code and start rewriting parts of it
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> smth like editor2 that lives next to the current one
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @ChillerDragon, does your bot need to tag our prs all the time
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> can you maybe disable that
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> put the link in ` quotes or smth
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> may I ask why it annoys you? it doesn't generate notifications, I think
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why does it annoy you? it doesn't generate notifications, I think
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why should i care what chillerdragons bot cant merge
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i sometimes go in prs and read around, no need to cross link
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tho i blame github
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it should be a one way mention
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dont see why the mentioned pr should link it back
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> #1
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, it occupies screen space in the PR and that annoys you?
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i am annoyed that i see smth i am not interested in
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and mentions bot
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> is there any benefit that github does that to completly unrelated repos?
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> If we'd have an allow list or smth ok
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/973647727370047488/unknown.png
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whole neighbourhood electricity went off lol
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it helps collecting issues that depend on something
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> first time it happened living here
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. when you open an issue in SDL2
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its useful if its something important
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like sdl2
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes but i dunno
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but chiller is just spam
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> every single pr is a merge conflict for him
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its not useful to us
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do u think sdl2 devs click on ddnet and are like, AHH nice to know some random code base doesnt work
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its annoying
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its totally uninsteresting
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it's interesting to know that users of your library are affected
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but the issue is there for that
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i can mention ddnet in the issue instead the other way around
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno, i dont think it was ever useful for me
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not for the mentioned pr at least
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and i am totally ok it happens for same repos
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or repos in one organization or smth
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but why completly unrelated ones
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I kinda like it
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: can you make your bot mention a PR again? I blocked it from the ddnet organisation, so it might not show up anymore
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, actually it's already gone
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> seems to work, issue resolved
20:14 <+ChillerDragon> poggers
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice xd
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> handy that i use an extra account for it i guess
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> good to know that exists
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> trollerdragon
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> im not too sure my self if i even care about those conflicts :D 
20:20 <+ChillerDragon> I think i found the random value i have to increment to fix the issue but not sure if it makes sense to pr something based on pure guessing :D 
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or just dynamically allocate the memory for now
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the server wont miss the 10ns
20:22 <+ChillerDragon> i dont do dynamic memory
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u do
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean its a cahce, cant cahnge that often
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so dynamic memory is fine
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1652207004.png
21:35 < ***> Buffer Playback...
21:35 <+bridge> [20:50:49] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it uses try! a lot
21:35 <+bridge> [20:50:53] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which nowadays u just use ?
21:35 <+bridge> [20:51:22] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think someone refactored try! to ? for me
21:35 <+bridge> [20:52:10] [ddnet] <k2d222> Hey everyone, I recently started playing ddnet and I'm very much addicted 🙂
21:35 <+bridge> [20:52:11] [ddnet] <k2d222> I just finished a nice Proof-of-concept web map editor! 🗾 
21:35 <+bridge> [20:52:12] [ddnet] <k2d222> It allows **real-time**, **collaborative** map editing in a browser (using a rust server, canvas rendering and websocket)
21:35 <+bridge> [20:52:14] [ddnet] <k2d222> 
21:35 <+bridge> [20:52:15] [ddnet] <k2d222> Of course it is very minimal for now, I can only edit the Game layer tiles 🤷  But I hope to continue working on it for the next couple of weeks to release the code and a public server (I don't trust letting people connect to the server for now, the code is unstable) And if people are interested in collaborating on this project, I'll gladly accept any help ❤️
21:35 <+bridge> [20:52:16] [ddnet] <k2d222> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/973658727217500290/2022-05-10_20-14-26.mp4
21:35 <+ChillerDragon> [20:52:57] holy shit thats nice!
21:35 <+bridge> [20:53:06] [ddnet] <gerdoe> wow web port of mobile tee editor
21:35 <+bridge> [20:53:16] [ddnet] <gerdoe> looks neat af
21:35 <+ChillerDragon> [20:53:50] did you use some libs or did you code it from scratch?
21:35 <+bridge> [20:54:10] [ddnet] <k2d222> I was frustrated not to be able to design maps with my friends, as ddnet is collaborative in essence, that's where i got the idea
21:35 <+bridge> [20:54:27] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh nice
21:35 <+ChillerDragon> [20:54:46] u just completley crushed any motivation that was left to work on my web map editor haha
21:35 <+bridge> [20:54:48] [ddnet] <gerdoe> hm last problem with real time mapping is static .map
21:35 <+bridge> [20:54:55] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> same lol
21:35 <+bridge> [20:55:30] [ddnet] <k2d222> I used libtw2 at first for the map parsing but then I saw the writer is not finised/implemented? 
21:35 <+bridge> [20:55:30] [ddnet] <k2d222> So I rewrote a minimal serializer/deserializer
21:35 <+bridge> [20:55:33] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @k2d222 that looks really nice 😮
21:35 <+bridge> [20:56:01] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe check out twmap
21:35 <+bridge> [20:56:08] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iit even warns u about incorrect stuff
21:35 <+ChillerDragon> [20:56:51] i never understood webstockets and my canvas always got pixelated haha
21:35 <+bridge> [20:57:01] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobo
21:35 <+bridge> [20:57:07] [ddnet] <k2d222> ye I'll take a look at that I'm quite new to tw so I don't really know the ecosystem
21:35 <+bridge> [20:57:10] [ddnet] <gerdoe> ChillerDragon: webstockings
21:35 <+ChillerDragon> [20:57:16] mine was yeeting the whole map layer as json via a normal rest API and the performance is trash af
21:35 <+bridge> [20:57:41] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://docs.rs/twmap/0.7.0/twmap/
21:35 <+bridge> [20:57:57] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well there isnt much ecosystem
21:35 <+bridge> [20:57:58] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tbh xd
21:35 <+bridge> [20:58:43] [ddnet] <Patiga> @k2d222 awesome project :D
21:35 <+bridge> [20:59:15] [ddnet] <k2d222> Ok twmap looks amazing 😮 how did I not find it
21:35 <+ChillerDragon> [20:59:43] as i said it needs marketing
21:35 <+bridge> [21:00:26] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's @Patiga's, you can contact them if you need something
21:35 <+ChillerDragon> [21:01:21] @k2d222 where will you publish it and whats your handle? i need to follow you NOW 
21:35 <+ChillerDragon> [21:01:49] here? https://github.com/k2d222
21:35 <+bridge> [21:02:07] [ddnet] <k2d222> haha yes that's me 😉
21:35 <+ChillerDragon> [21:02:16] subbed
21:35 <+ChillerDragon> [21:02:18] bell activated
21:35 <+bridge> [21:03:04] [ddnet] <k2d222> I haven't released the code yet I just got it working and was excited to share it 😉 but yeah I'll publish the repo there I guess
21:35 <+ChillerDragon> [21:03:25] i wont miss it
21:35 <+bridge> [21:03:28] [ddnet] <Patiga> @k2d222 I will gladly answer any question you have if you encounter any :)
21:35 <+bridge> [21:03:35] [ddnet] <Patiga> I also hope that the docs are helpful
21:35 <+bridge> [21:07:23] [ddnet] <Patiga> well depending on what you do rust can be 1-2 magnitudes faster, so knowing rust is definitely nice :)
21:35 <+bridge> [21:07:24] [ddnet] <Patiga> for twmap-blender for example I needed to generate the mesh for the tilemaps. with the same algorithm it was ~80 times faster in rust, so I cheated and put that function into the python bindings ^^

21:35 <+bridge> [21:28:23] [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> wtf nice, well done  @Patiga
21:35 <+bridge> [21:30:22] [ddnet] <Patiga> thanks :D
21:35 <+bridge> [21:33:40] [ddnet] <Voxel> please make this a finished piece id love to use this
21:35 < ***> Playback Complete.

22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> wait 20 min than you can watch this xD https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5085
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> now online
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> @c0d3d3v is the netobject meant to for ones own player, or would it only be sent for others? was trying to think about what information that would be useful to send
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> only -> also
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> its send for all players in your field of view
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> including you
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @c0d3d3v your video has 480p and 1080p but my favorite 720p is missing, what is this racism?
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD youtube still process the video... you have to wait
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> it is send for all players in your field of view
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> including for your own tee
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 720p in 2022 lol
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> does this mean the ravie hud is finalized?
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I guess so, the layout is kinda random but whatever
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tell him a good layout then
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I mean in the image itself
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the hud has good layout ofc lol
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah ok
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> will also need to move the new shield thingies into it I think, saw that mentioned somewhere
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yep
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> in #5047
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5047
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Very good, I suggest to hide jump icons if it is default, equal 2.
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Add infinite symbol for infinite jumps (maybe you did and I missed).
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> And add last CP number!
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> last CP number is not gameplay related sounds more like debug stuff... that is already visible in ctr+shift+d
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> for example at https://youtu.be/gPTVj-s3pgc?t=260 4:20 endless jumps are active
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Endless jump could be represented in the jump line with the infinity near jump symbol. Example :
