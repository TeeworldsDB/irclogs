02:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 protonmail did not explain why they deleted my accounts. I assume it is because i created too many and its probably against their tos. I was trying to migrate away from gmail and i have hunderts of gmail accounts xd.
02:42 < bridge> <learath2> I’m 90% sure you are running many illegal businesses
02:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> google never did that
02:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and tos or not protonmail did not warn me once. And they blocked ALL my accounts without any way to recover them. I used them as signup and revovery email on other services so these kind of stunts from an email provider are unacceptable. If they want to limit the signups they should stop me from creating new ones not delete old ones.
03:08 < bridge> <louis> hundreds of gmail accounts? xd
03:24 < bridge> <soulyvevo> why do you even need so many accounts
04:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> see this if you didn't btw https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1260910976111476737

05:41 < bridge> <bushidoosolo> how to connect a gamepad to the game so that the hook works? I connected it and can only shoot, but the grappling hook doesn't work at all

08:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> am i cute :owo:
08:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> zenless zone zero btw
08:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk ps
08:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> im just a nerd coder
08:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> cant do art
08:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah gacha
08:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> let me find the thing first
08:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i seen it, cool graphics
08:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wish anime used zzz graphics
08:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> 3d anime i mean
08:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i wish non gacha game used zzz graphics
08:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kek:
08:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> the problem with 3d anime cgi is they still use like 10 fps to animate
08:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> like if they drawed it
08:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1261205192372916244/allofthem.png?ex=66921c5d&is=6690cadd&hm=9ed66d3b07afca92168221f6ab0e6fa74bca174bc926a4ecbbf53bc743be59e7&
08:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> less render time honestly
08:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1261205313592496138/Blender.png?ex=66921c7a&is=6690cafa&hm=8f8f7c5786731ce10d4342412f39bb3aceceda27c1be5de9b1f514a4abeb85b9&
08:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
08:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> u mustb e joking
08:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> probably
08:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> anime cgi isnt that expensive to render lmao
08:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> im sure its just old styled japanese thinking that 10 fps cgi = 10 fps manual drawing
08:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think anime cgi usually literally use the same  renderer as the blockbuster movies
08:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's the only one artists know mostly
08:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> western ones at least
08:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i do hate video games that also uses less frames tho
08:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but zzz is actually quite a lot of more works to make even if it is just simple interpolation. it takes significantly more effort to show the the key visual frame when there are so many frames around that one frame.
08:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> should've put "simple interpolation" in quotes
09:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr was it u who do stuff with CNC?
09:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://zoo.dev/text-to-cad
09:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> Yessir
09:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> look at that lol
09:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> Hmm, i dont Like it
09:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
09:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> why?
09:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz ai or another reason
09:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> The Things the AI can generate seem Like DIN EN ISO parts
09:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> Any good cam program has those
09:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> You Just Type in the ISO Part, anything more complex seems Like it would Just Break, dimensions would be wrong etc
09:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> ic
09:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I like to keep stuff clean and separated. For privacy, security and to avoid spam. Also I usually sign up multiple times on websites with different identities and emails. If I sign up for the first time to a service I don’t know I prefer to do so with an email that also does not let them know who I am.
09:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And I also prefer to not use any kind of spam filters or built in multi address features to keep the separation as strong as possible.

14:51 < bridge> <learath2> It still allows companies to correlate you. If you are running an international crime syndicate you need to be more careful
14:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> fair
15:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> your 3 categories sound good
15:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i prefer not all random websites i sign up on to be correlated to one email of mine. There are different level of sketchy sites i am forced to sign up for at work.
15:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have multiple private identities too

21:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @robyt3 you did some scoreboard fixes, right?
21:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut> with teamsize and stuff
21:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it was widely used that players in TEAM_BLUE wouldn't show up in the scoreboard, since ddrace(ddnet) uses TEAM_RED for normal gameplay.
21:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> If I'm in a minigame on my server, it hides other players in TEAM_BLUE, so they arent shown in the scoreboard.
21:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> In this situation, the GAMEFLAG_TEAMS is not set, but the scoreboard gets huge, cuz it probably believes the TEAM_BLUE has a high player count, so it wants to show both sides equally
21:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Could you fix that behaviour, if GAMEFLAG_TEAMS is not set? Oh, and be careful, it's a snapshot flag and can be manipulated ingame without reconnecting

21:30 < bridge> <cyberFighter> @fokkonaut
21:30 < bridge> <cyberFighter> like a few weeks old at least
21:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> mh, okay maybe something else then, idk
21:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> idk, probably has to be related to latest scoreboard work
21:49 < bridge> <robyt3> @fokkonaut Haven't tested but this should fix it
21:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Thanks a lot!
21:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Looks correct

23:26 < bridge> <Ewan> but servers are guilds...
23:49 < bridge> <teero777> it's a bit confusing but i think you can "convert" your server into a guild and then everyone has a guild badge :D
23:51 < bridge> <Ewan> in ye olden days servers were called guilds

23:53 < bridge> <Ewan> in rust should i just use a string to represent a "theoretical" file (like cpp std::filesystem::path`)?
23:53 < bridge> <Ewan> in rust should i just use a string to represent a "theoretical" file (like cpp `std::filesystem::path`)?
23:53 < bridge> <Ewan> or is there a type for that
