13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ^^ still listening but it's quite interesting
14:16 <+ChillerDragon> thanks for sharing <3
14:16 <+ChillerDragon> dfq is 28c3 btw? it a ccc channel?
14:16 <+ChillerDragon> ah ye it is
14:17 <+ChillerDragon> d
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> seems that the ddnet clinet does not recognise the difference between o and Ã¸
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/782642136796889098/2020-11-29_17_11_05-DDNet_Client.png
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> seems that the ddnet client does not recognise the difference between o and Ã¸
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> but both names get points independently
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @CÃ¸ke all names get points indepently, but similar names on the same server are tagged to differentiate them
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> its not similar
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> my name got a Ã¸ xd
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> it would be annoying if I had to kick someone every time because I can't finish with my name
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> and its not the same with similar names like Coke and coke
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> it would be better if it was "(1) CÃ¸ke" instead of "(1) Coke"
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> why?
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> his name is CÃ¸ke, right?
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> so "(1) Coke" is a bit misleading
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> no, the other person is the second to join, with the name "Coke"
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> which is why the second person got (1) Coke
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> u dont understand me, its only with Ã¸
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> oh, I misunderstood
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> Ã˜ wok
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> Ã˜ work
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> and thought it changed Ã¸ to o as well
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ddnet groups similiar looking letters together
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> upper case i (I) and lower case L (l) are grouped together for exapmle
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> it thinks that "C" and "c" dont look alike
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> Coke and coke work, CÃ˜ke and CÃ¸ke work, Coke and CÃ¸ke not xD
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea, it says 'o' is similar to 'Ã¸', but not 'Ã˜'
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> imo that reasonable
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> CÃ˜ke and COke also work
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> ???
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but yea, thats annoying when you got similar names
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> oh no not working
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ddnet doesnt go by look, it has an accesses a dictionary that tells it which look alike
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> *it accesses
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> I never noticed this 'bug' in my entire playing time
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> maybe its a new bug
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> its not really a bug
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> its a feature and tries to differentiate names
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that is supposed to help when for example a person should be kicked, but in the vote menu you cant make out which person you want to kick because the name is so similar
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> huge problem in for example tf2
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> its not possible to kick him when i get the (1)
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> i cant, and other ppl who want kick him kick me xD
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> i cant, and other ppl who want kick him, kick me xD
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> trolls will 100% abuse it :troll:
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> man it triggers me so much that clangd thinks headers under base/ are C and not C++ and gives me errors on vim
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :angrybork:
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think its always been like that
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i cant name my dummy Iouis
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cuz I and l look alike
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but o and Ã¸ not
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> its like p and q
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> db
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yea i tried Å‚ouis and louis before and it didnt work either
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> this problem should be fixed, otherwise blockers will take advantage of it and the wrong people will be kicked
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> soplo tryd to vote Coke and i was voted :monkaS:
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how will the wrong people be kicked
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mokwin> there is problem with changing custom resolution, everytime I open game I need to turn off full screen and turn it on again after opening game to make custom resolution work, like it doesnt save everytime you restart game. A lot of people using custom res and its a bit annoying
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mokwin> any ideas ? ðŸ˜¦
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> @louis we tryd it, there was Coke and (1)CÃ¸ke.. if u try to kick Coke it votes (1)CÃ¸ke
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> @louis we tried it, there was Coke and (1)CÃ¸ke.. if u try to kick Coke it votes (1)CÃ¸ke
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> soplo tried to vote Coke and i was voted :monkaS:
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @CÃ¸ke we did that intentionally because there are cyrillic characters that look exactly like latin alphabet ones
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so there could be too players whose names look identical and it's super annoying on server
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's been this way for years
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> This is known as Unicode Confusables: https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/confusables.jsp
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Your name for example and all confusables for each character: https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/confusables.jsp?a=Coke&r=None
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and trolls who call themselves similarly to prevent you from using your name could also just use your exact name
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (this website is not complete, sometimes combinations of characters together can look like one character)
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> shouldn't there be a solution to this? as I said, the wrong players get kicked if one is called Coke and one (1)CÃ¸ke
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's a bug, can you open one?
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> ok nvm we tested it again and the right person was voted
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 look this cover lmao
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/782740058675216435/EMcoETkU0AE06t1.png
