00:13 < bridge> <teero777> it works now.....
01:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes you can use the snapshot builder. What are you working on?
01:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ?xd which password what can it do?
02:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes the client unpacks that integer. Removing it would break protocol. But you could remove the variable if you want to just make sure you still pack and unpack that integer. Its value can be anything but as of right now itâ€™s zero.
02:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The variable is part of a struct which is used as offset so you would have to change that
04:38 < bridge> <Ewan> who was it with the email host recommendation? seemed like a rly good deal

11:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274> been using it for my email.
12:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i know you documented snapshots and you know i know. And i know you know that i documted them too. Why send this to me xd
12:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: I replied to your "this field is unused" message
12:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because that is also documented in the libtw2 documentation
12:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because that fact is also documented in the libtw2 documentation
12:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes i know
12:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and you know i know
12:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk im confused xd
12:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did i say something wrong?
12:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe you ment to ping teero
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or totar 
12:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah. I pinged you because it was a reply to your mesesage and you don't see replies otherwise
12:50 < bridge> <0xdeen> One problem with purelymail I had was that I noticed I couldn't receive emails from 1-2 people. This is kind of a deal breaker when you do important stuff via email. I'm hoping it doesn't happen more often, but wasn't sure if it's a misconfiguration on purelymail's side or the other side
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they were talking about how snapshots work as if there aren't 3 documentations on it 
12:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> kill me
12:50 < bridge> <0xdeen> The great part is that you can have lots of domains and emails
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah well i could have guessed xd @heinrich5991 now it just like you wanted to inform me about libtw2 xd
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> seems*
12:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ^^
12:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I see
12:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> have you asked them about it
12:53 < bridge> <0xdeen> Yes, but we didn't find a root cause
12:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ah, bummer
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i hate the fact that im still stuck with gmail and their web ui. Somehow I can not get rid of it. I tried mutt multiple times and somehow never stuck with it. About other providers im not sure either. I tried protonmail but now they deleted all my accounts so not sure how much i like them either.
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> My touchpad of the mac broke down a few days ago. So i can no longer left or right click. It still works suprisingly well without an external mouse. I can fully operate it and do all tasks i need it to do
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but my email reading became headlines only xd
13:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how about using thunderbird?
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i never liked it
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> might as well use a web ui
13:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> web UI locks you in
13:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> thunderbird does not
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont feel locked in
13:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> lock in isn't about feeling, I think?
13:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can switch from gmails web ui to protons web ui or mutt 
13:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but you can't switch to mut apparently
13:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but you can't switch to mutt apparently
13:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because of UI issues
13:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thunderbird is not sexy and not in the terminal and it still requires me to configure sign up
13:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's your lock in
13:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the sign up is trivial
13:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I am not sure what keeps me out of mutt. Maybe i don't have enough pain points in the web ui and it just works. While I am too lazy to login to mutt or learn its keybindings.
13:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then use thunderbird?
13:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it has an intuitive UI just like thet web UI
13:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (or any other graphical email client)
13:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I don't like its look and feel and the fact that i have to start a whole application just to check my mails
13:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a graphical email client would be a downgrade for me.
13:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it reduces your lock in
13:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you'll keep your mails when google bans your account
13:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I won't be able to receive new or send new 
13:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
13:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I don't use gmail as storage
13:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hi chillerdragon
13:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> foxo
13:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> chillox
13:39 < bridge> <learath2> How did you get your protonmail accounts deleted?
13:45 < bridge> <0xdeen> Some thoughts on blockers: https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/discussions/0/4407418214726864696/?tscn=1720622722
13:45 < bridge> <0xdeen> Can we bind `say "/specvoted"` and have it show up in the vote box?
13:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Maybe a small button in the vote menu, or "press F5 to watch x"
13:51 < bridge> <fokkonaut> which would execute /specvoted, preferrably only if ddnet has a SERVERCAPFLAG_SPECVOTED, so the client knows when to show that information and won't show it on servers where this command does not exist
13:51 < bridge> <fokkonaut> and wont try to execute it on F5
13:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> I honestly love the picture in picture idea. like a small window below the vote window. it is just really hard to implement :-v
14:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Not that hard, NetworkClipped has to be checked twice basically while a vote is running. Once for your own tee, once for the /specvoted tee.
14:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> That's all. Client can do the rest
14:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Client would need to know WHO is actually being voted, so it might be enough to send a NetMessageEx to tell the client about the currently being voted player
14:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> No need for specvoted hack at all then
14:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> At that point we might wanna introduce a NetMessageEx for setting a vote, so we won't send two messages.
14:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd say the problem of votes is that they're toothless. the problem is that by giving them some power, we'll have false positives, which you seemed to be quite averse to. this means votes are essentially useless on moderately full servers today
14:45 < bridge> <syrinok> I think it's a great idea to have this command bound by default, also have it in the controls menu, maybe have the client detect the key you have it bound to. Having to manually find the Tee being voted takes far too long for people to want to put the effort in, especially on a full server. Also the problem of new players not knowing you can use right shift to spectate players to begin with.
14:46 < bridge> <syrinok> I think it's a great idea to have this command bound by default, also have it in the controls menu, maybe have the client detect the key you have it bound to, and display the key you have to press to spectate them. Having to manually find the Tee being voted takes far too long for people to want to put the effort in, especially on a full server. Also the problem of new players not knowing you can use right shift to spectate players to begin with.
15:01 < bridge> <louis> make a custom client for mods that immediately specvotes every new votekick in any server
15:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it requires votes to have an effect first. or do you think that they'll have one since people are more likely to actually view the other person?
15:14 < bridge> <syrinok> Yes, I think more people actually being able to see what the person is doing would help
15:16 < bridge> <syrinok> Pressing right shift to spectate isn't known by everyone on these crowded novice servers, as well as it being somewhat difficult to find the person being voted in a giant list of people. Less effort to look at the person being voted would probably help a lot
15:18 < bridge> <syrinok> It makes sense for this to be part of the default experience anyways I think, having a button to quickly look at the voted person and have the vote menu display the key you should press to view it
15:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it'd be nice if there was an automatic picture-in-picture view of the voted person
15:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but that's a lot harder than the button
15:19 < bridge> <syrinok> It makes sense for this to be part of the default experience anyways I think, having a button to quickly look at the voted person and have the vote popup display the key you should press to view it
15:19 < bridge> <syrinok> Right
15:20 < bridge> <patiga> (to select tees in spec) maybe we change the default bind from right shift to left shit? I always do that
15:20 < bridge> <patiga> while you are spectating, you don't need the emote wheel, and right shift is quite an uncommon bind
15:21 < bridge> <syrinok> I think you could hit that on accident and get yourself killed, probably not ideal, it's also the emote wheel bind that everyone is used to, would probably have a lot of growing pains
15:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can bind it to both
15:21 < bridge> <patiga> how would you get yourself killed? o.o it would only do smth in spec
15:21 < bridge> <learath2> mh lshift is emote, we even have it in the tutorial map
15:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it only shows emote ingame
15:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and only spec in spec
15:22 < bridge> <learath2> I guess you could bind both yeah
15:22 < bridge> <patiga> nono you misunderstand
15:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I also have it boun to both
15:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I also have it bound to both
15:22 < bridge> <patiga> I don't want it to spec the voted tee, but allow you to select which tee to spec in spectate
15:22 < bridge> <syrinok> Oh, right
15:22 < bridge> <syrinok> Sorry, ya I assumed you meant spec
15:23 < bridge> <patiga> emote and tee selection don't collide and are both very handy, left shift works quite well imo
15:23 < bridge> <syrinok> Sounds fine then
15:24 < bridge> <learath2> but how do you bind both?
15:24 < bridge> <learath2> I can imagine whatever solution having very meh interactions with the controls page in settings
15:25 < bridge> <patiga> ow, might be the case
15:25 < bridge> <syrinok> I think regardless the way you spectate players isn't very intuitive, and I'm not sure how you could improve it
15:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, our settings don't really work well with double binds
15:26 < bridge> <patiga> I'm on my laptop rn, I don't have the bind
15:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `bind lshift "+emote;+spectate"`
15:26 < bridge> <patiga> probably just separated by semicolon, yea
15:27 < bridge> <patiga> the emote wheel could be combined with the tee selection perhaps? they are sorta similar popups
15:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps we could add a new binds item "spectator menu + emote wheel"?
15:28 < bridge> <learath2> I'm unsure how well stroke commands work with multiple in a row
15:29 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, this will have to be inseparable in settings, I don't see any other sane way, without parsing strings and stuff
15:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> very well. I've had this bind for probably 10 years now ðŸ˜„

15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> promising new editor
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> previously only on macos
15:37 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, nice
15:37 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, but I just got used to neovim
15:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 its made in rust
15:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/zed-industries/zed
15:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Thorsten Ball works on linux version of zed, he also wrote a book about making an interpreter :poggers2:
15:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> in go
15:40 < bridge> <louis> isnt that mac only
15:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> @louis.place it was
15:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> today they released linux version
15:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> the post literally says "zed on linux is here"
15:41 < bridge> <louis> When windows :feelsbadman:
15:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> hopefully never
15:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw zed is triple licensed
15:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> under AGPL, GPL, and APACHE-2
15:42 < bridge> <louis> oh mb i didnt scroll up that far
15:42 < bridge> <louis> when i saw the initial youtube vid it looked pretty sweet
15:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye its fast af
15:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think it will be like vscode but made in rust not js so its fast
15:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> and they aim to use the most "platform native" features i guess
15:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is why they didnt release linux yet
15:45 < bridge> <louis> maybe i should get back on linux :feelsbadman:
15:45 < bridge> <louis> only thing holding me back is fl studio and battery life lmao
15:51 < bridge> <avolicious> They use GPU for rendering ^^
15:51 < bridge> <avolicious> I am using Zed already for my daily work and it is very fast compared to any other editor
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> technically all apps use gp
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> gpu
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> they just have a custom renderer
16:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> using the platform native api
16:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> technically ( ðŸ¤“  ) all apps use gp
16:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think battery life got better
16:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know from tinkering with the kernel on gentoo that there are different cpu schedulers, some made for battery
16:15 < bridge> <teero777> Does anyone know where chatmsgs/broadcasts get put into the demo recorder?
16:15 < bridge> <teero777> i am so confused i've been searching for an hour
16:16 < bridge> <teero777> every CNetObj_* uses SnapNewItem to store itself into the recording basically but what stores the chat messages?
16:17 < bridge> <teero777> every CNetObj_* uses SnapNewItem to store itself into the snapshot but what stores the chat messages?
16:19 < bridge> <robyt3> Messages are separate from snapshots. Chat messages and broadcasts are stored as messages
16:55 < bridge> <learath2> I've been getting good battery life on my laptop, but it is very new, so maybe just the effects of new battery
17:12 < bridge> <louis> i do have a new laptop as well, it's definitely good too but just not as great as windows it seems
17:12 < bridge> <louis> might not matter though since i'm planning on bringing one of those big anker powerbanks around with me
17:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would bet a i3 desktop consumes less energy than windows desktop
17:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe u need to tweak gpu fans or smth
17:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> probs has a harder time dealing with dual gpu? since seems like some propietary stuff
17:34 < bridge> <learath2> The biggest issue I've had with laptops was linux not being able to properly get into S0ix states when sleeping, but with this new laptop, no issues with that
17:35 < bridge> <Ewan> this is it thanks
17:35 < bridge> <learath2> s2idle
17:38 < bridge> <learath2> Can youtube stop pushing this stupid update that moves comments to the right side? Every couple months they push it out, people hate it, they revert it
17:45 < bridge> <robyt3> I report it as negative feedback every time I get it
18:14 < bridge> <Iza> i dont know why so many big platforms like youtube, spotify etc have the tendency to introduce the weirdest ui changes even though it was perfect as it is
18:15 < bridge> <learath2> For this change I have a guess. The recommended next videos take much more space this way, they might be hoping it increases the chances that you would find a next video and spend more time on the platform
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> UI/UX is important, but not as important as shareholder value ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°
18:16 < bridge> <learath2> Also who was it that posted a spotify client written in rust here, I wanted to contribute to that thing then I couldn't find it again ðŸ˜„
