00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @deen or you can just use a vps as a firewall
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why does the problem not replicate to the vps used as firewall?
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> There are many kinds of successful attacks, some just need a bigger pipe, some more cpu to handle it, some a more intelligent software in front that would filter out packets that look implausible to come from actual players. I don't know how well all of that would work, how much effort would need to be spent on that.
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The best approach would be for a large udp based game to adopt us so that we can run our vps behind their protection ðŸ˜„
16:52 <+Learath2> we don't have that much traffic actually, let's beg :P

18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bumm> komm auf mein server xd
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ?
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bumm> flw mal
19:38 <@deen> laxa: can you turn off the map release thingy? (or fix it)
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @deen thats rly complicated
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> @deen I wanted to try, before that treudler hosting dies, to get a vdedicated (so same as an OVH game but a vm) that would filter packets before my own server
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> so, NAT
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> thats rly impossible to filter directly inside the current server that hosts the tw server
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> because of the CPU overloading
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> thats after my guess
22:40 <+laxadedi_> deen: wtf, I can look into that maybe later, but you can disable it with !config
22:40 <+laxadedi_> !config
22:40 <@Nimda> You have to be an operator in this channel to use !config.
22:40 <+laxadedi_> and I can't :D
