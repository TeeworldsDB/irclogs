00:14 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Yo, what is the best way to get the ID of the player that is currently being controlled given CGameClient?
00:15 <+bridge> <BillionRay> so that I can see which ID belongs to the dummy and which to the player
00:20 <+bridge> <uwu> Try 
00:20 <+bridge> <uwu> m_Snap.m_LocalClientID
00:20 <+bridge> <BillionRay> oke, naming seems odd but I will give it a shot
00:21 <+bridge> <uwu> Oh wait, there is m_aLocalIDs[NUM_DUMMIES];
00:21 <+bridge> <uwu> Pass g_Config.m_ClDummy
00:21 <+bridge> <uwu> Or smth like that
00:21 <+bridge> <uwu> And you should get id
00:22 <+bridge> <uwu> Of current controlled unit
00:36 <+bridge> <BillionRay> yep that works, thank you
00:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> +1
01:39 <+bridge> <Voxel> "ughh if you dont program in rust you dont even deserve a programming job"
01:40 <+bridge> <Voxel> actually fuck off
01:40 <+bridge> <Voxel> this is exactly the reason why i dont want to learn
01:41 <+bridge> <Voxel> because if i do and become someone like this im actually going to hurt myself
01:43 <+bridge> <Voxel> i do not like thinking about how this type if advertizing actually gets people hooked because in my opinion its very destructive
01:43 <+bridge> <Voxel> i do not like thinking about how this type if advertising actually gets people hooked because in my opinion its very destructive

02:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's what people also say about gay people or vegans
02:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I find it very stupid that people say that
02:22 <+bridge> <Voxel> yeah
02:23 <+bridge> <Voxel> pretentious rust fans when someone is genuinely happier doing anything other than rust:
02:28 <+bridge> <Ravie> @Voxel why do rustards bother u so much? just look at the language and decide if it offers something that you're interested in
02:29 <+bridge> <Voxel> it doesnt. what angers me is that rust is seen as some holy grail of coding and if you Dont Dare to use it you're trash
02:29 <+bridge> <Voxel> i dont think anyone deserves to put up with this mindset
02:31 <+bridge> <Ravie> @Voxel you can like something even if you dislike part of its fanbase (ahem)
02:32 <+bridge> <Ravie> also rust is kinda by design meant to be a "holy grail of coding" so it attracts people like that I guess
02:35 <+bridge> <Ravie> @Voxel why do respectable rust advocates bother u so much? just look at the language and decide if it offers something that you're interested in
02:38 <+bridge> <Voxel> it's very unhealthy. yeah sure it might be extremely powerful but forcing someone to learn it through peer pressure is just
02:38 <+bridge> <louis> i dont think anyone is forcing anyone to learn it
02:38 <+bridge> <louis> also their mascot is cute
02:38 <+bridge> <Voxel> no it isnt >:(
02:38 <+bridge> <Voxel> ok maybe im just salty
02:38 <+bridge> <Voxel> it *can* be
02:39 <+bridge> <Ravie> ye I made a skin of it once but it was kinda weird
02:39 <+bridge> <louis> also that image sent was just a joke about ppl who idolize rust
02:40 <+bridge> <Voxel> from the amount of rust memes sent here i literally could not tell it was irony
02:42 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/girl-explaining
03:44 <+bridge> <uwu> Remember one truth, rust is bad, all these people just want you to learn unwanted technology and take your place as REAL programmer using REAL programming languages like c++ :troll:
03:51 <+bridge> <Voxel> that doesnt help either

08:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> oh lol u made a gores map and i never noticed, because i always play in entities xd
08:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> young man, it's not a random incidence that you joined our sanctuary. It was our fate that we meet here.
08:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> You'll soon learn how warm and wise Rust is.

08:47 <+bridge> <BillionRay> yo brothers, does anyone know how to kill dummy from CGameClient? There is a SendKill function but it never actually uses the ClientID
08:47 <+bridge> <BillionRay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1104660724770414652/image.png
08:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the client doesnt need to know its id in this case
08:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the server is aware what client has what id
08:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> its about the network
08:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> there must be smth like m_aNetwork[ClientID]
08:48 <+bridge> <BillionRay> so is it possible to do something like have my dummy autokill if he spends too long in the freeze?
08:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> wait i need to look in the source
08:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> g_Config.m_ClDummy
08:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> must simply be 1 i guess
08:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if u want to force it for dummy
08:49 <+bridge> <BillionRay> so force it, send kill, and undo it?
08:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> would be one way, yes xd
08:50 <+bridge> <BillionRay> good enough for me, i will give it a shot :)
08:52 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> makes no fucking sense doing it that way, especially if europian / american ddnet servers don't utilize the filter feature for better moderation
08:52 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> with clientside filters (which is actually fuckin easy to do, even I can do it), people wouldnt need to fear for shit like spamming profanity
08:53 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Works. Thank you bro. Would have taken me a while to figure this out myself
08:53 <+bridge> <BillionRay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1104662292789997688/image.png
08:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> btw rust has a marketshare of like <10%
08:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
08:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so the mainstream wouldnt say this. But here with Ryozuki as prophet, you ofc face it every other day xd
08:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> nice xd
08:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno if i would use negation operator here tho, i dont thing ClDummy is a boolean ðŸ˜„
08:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> surprising it works actually xD
08:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well its a logical negation so doesnt matter
09:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> sometimes i think people either take memes too seriouslu or idk man
09:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> in my experience, its the other way around, lot of salty devs angry at u for using rust or saying ur project uses rust in a blog title. anyway i send these memes here cuz i find them funny, and i never expected anyone to learn rust or say the wont get a job if they dont learn it, in fact, right now rust is not the best lang to learn if a job os what u want
09:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but if u limit ur learning because x said something, that says a lot about you, i personally would learn it anyway
09:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i even learned typescript even tho i hate javascript, simply bcs its still the browser language xd
09:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the thing is that rust brings a big change that established C mammoths, usually older devs maybe, dont like, cuz their job depends on knowing this only language, atleast its a theory
09:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this is why u shouldnt limit urself to 1 lang imho
09:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont like java, golant and i know them xd
09:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont like java, golang and i know them xd
09:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> wait wtf
09:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i didnt make that right
09:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1104670509527990292/image.png

09:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> unless there's another ryozuki
09:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> i'll give u the benefit of the doubt xd
09:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ryo forgot he was in a racing clan
09:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> is there a faker?
09:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Ewan Green can u do mapinfo
09:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> ya rq
09:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> wait no /map
09:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> wtf
09:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh wait
09:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe i did do it
09:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i remember making this circular hting
09:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1104671927420854272/image.png

09:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> damn
09:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i remember this stupid part
09:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> good gores map kek

10:57 <+ChillerDragon> was the voting changed on ddnet or multeasymap in particular? i just got kick voted in a few secs on a full server thats new to me
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> !rob
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> fuck i dont have that?
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> !robster
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> !add_ping_pong rob @Robyt3
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> !add_ping_pong robster @Robyt3
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> can you send brain real quick?
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> imo this check is usless and a clock cycle waste at best and totally misleading at worst https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/cfd003d9c5c632c1cd6178150e72f80ba4d8a757/src/game/collision.cpp#L279
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> collisions GetTile() gave me a false sense of security because it has the nullptr check
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> but asan gave me a use after free
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> and i think this is because the memory is allocated and freed by the datafile but the collision pointer is never set to null
11:32 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Yeah, that's what #6565 should fix
11:32 <+bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6565
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/cfd003d9c5c632c1cd6178150e72f80ba4d8a757/src/game/collision.cpp#L66
11:32 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Layers and collision both use the map data, which is unloaded when you disconnect
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> wtf
11:33 <+bridge> <Robyt3> So you would either need to unload the map data in layers/collision by setting it to nullptr and adding these nullptr checks everywhere, or delay the unloading like this PR does
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> i would like to propose calling the collision destructor here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/cfd003d9c5c632c1cd6178150e72f80ba4d8a757/src/engine/shared/map.cpp#L45-L48
11:34 <+bridge> <Robyt3> The engine doesn't know about CLayers and CCollision
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> as of right now collision is properly nulled on first boot but as soon as a map changes the nullpointer checks all fail
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> since its non nulled pointers that point to freed memory
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> ah shiet
11:35 <+bridge> <Robyt3> It's possible, but I kept adding more refactorings to it, so the PR I opened is simpler than the alternative that I first coded: https://github.com/Robyt3/ddnet/tree/Client-Map-Disconnect-Invalidate
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> oh lol ofc ur already super aware of what i just considered a genious find xd
11:36 <+bridge> <Robyt3> But it's easier to delay the map change/disconnect until after the render call
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> wow 14h ago thats new shit
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> i hope no merge will be pain if i cherry pick ur pr now :D
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> is it production ready?
11:39 <+bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, it's ready from my side
11:40 <+ChillerDragon> cool imma yoink this so i do not have to think about fixing my crash bug
11:41 <+bridge> <Robyt3> does it crash consistently for you? I never got to reproduce the crash consistently
11:41 <+ChillerDragon> i can get it to in my sus hax bot client
11:41 <+ChillerDragon> took me months to pin point it down
11:41 <+ChillerDragon> just call GetTile() in OnRender) and then kick the client
11:41 <+ChillerDragon> 10/10 asan trigger
11:41 <+bridge> <Robyt3> I had like 8 headless clients with `dbg_stress 1` for a few hours and some of them had this crash eventually
11:42 <+ChillerDragon> ah nice u use headless :)
11:42 <+ChillerDragon> i was a bit scared that nobody ever would use the headless other than me and all are just super annoyed by the additional code complexity
11:46 <+ChillerDragon> hm i still get the crash with ur pr ._.
11:47 <+bridge> <Robyt3> maybe you are doing the thing that causes the crash manually though
11:48 <+bridge> <Robyt3> do you reload the map or disconnect manually somewhere?
11:48 <+ChillerDragon> not that i know
11:48 <+bridge> <Robyt3> like from anywhere inside the render function
11:48 <+ChillerDragon> lemme extract the crashing code out of my hax client
11:54 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet/tree/Client-Delay-Disconnect_crash
11:54 <+ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/aK
11:55 <+ChillerDragon> yea as i thought calling gettile in a clint compoennets render crashes i f the client gets kicked even with your fix
11:59 <+bridge> <Robyt3> I think you still need to check whether you are online or offline before you access Collision in a client component
12:00 <+ChillerDragon> ah tru
12:00 <+bridge> <Robyt3> The fix just prevents the collision from becoming invalid during a render call
12:00 <+ChillerDragon> i do that in my code by checkng local char i think
12:00 <+bridge> <Robyt3> But if it's invalid the entire time then you shouldn't access it either
12:01 <+bridge> <Robyt3> If we see the crash again on ddnet even with the fix then I'll also add the other fix (null-checks everywhere)
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> how do i even properly check 
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> i check for this ``m_pClient->m_Snap.m_aCharacters[m_pClient->m_aLocalIDs[DummyID]].m_Cur`` being null before calling collsion stuff
12:03 <+bridge> <Robyt3> there should be a getter for the client state, which should be online or demo-playback if you want to have a valid map
12:03 <+bridge> <Robyt3> or you use the `OnStateChange` component callback
12:05 <+bridge> <Chairn> https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/13ae07e/average_aaa_developer/
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> ah i see thanks a lot
12:05 <+bridge> <Chairn> ddnet minimum requirement: potato pc
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> yea ddnet is becoming more and more bloat tho compared to vanilla
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> but its still more light weight than tripple a
12:08 <+bridge> <gerdoe> nop
12:08 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ddnet refuses work on my old ass pc xd
12:08 <+bridge> <gerdoe> that one can die any moment tho
12:08 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ide storage is kind of.. ash
12:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> you forgot "sadly"
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> but you know what i mean right? @Robyt3 i mean sure in my dbg print example i do no checks. But it works fine initially because m_pTiles is set to 0 on boot. So might as well delete the !m_pTiles check in GetTile if it only works until the first map load
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> we are checking if a pointer is 0 that is not nulled on free
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> like wot
12:11 <+bridge> <Robyt3> If the fix from the PR doesn't work then we'll have to add this check everywhere in collision
12:11 <+bridge> <Robyt3> So it's easier if you just leave it
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> the check is broken
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> thats what i am trying to say
12:11 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Yeah, right now it's never true
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> the check does not work because m_pTiles is not set to 0 when datafile frees the underlying memory
12:12 <+bridge> <Robyt3> But at some point we may want to allow unloading the map, so we'll add that check everywhere
12:12 <+bridge> <Robyt3> collision already has these checks for all other layers (front, tele etc.) because they can all be missing from a map file
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> my probablem is not that the check is not there everywhere my problem is that the check is there at all but does not work it gives false sense of security
12:13 <+bridge> <Robyt3> but technically a map file can also be missing the game layer, so right now it would crash the game if you load map not containing a game layer
12:13 <+bridge> <Robyt3> you can try if https://github.com/Robyt3/ddnet/tree/Client-Map-Disconnect-Invalidate fixes your crash
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> i guess ill just fix my crash with the state check
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> but i feel like in general it would be nicer if m_pTiles is nulled when its freed
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> hm u null on state change https://github.com/Robyt3/ddnet/commit/10c592cf84cfdb860fae50af09575ea50d18cdcc#diff-597779b4eb51af9adfedd04b8a235afff01091a4ba741daa604cb5cbeda4e3daR855
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> omg c++ is so broken that it lets u do stuff like that in the first place
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> im slowly growing the urge to learn rust
12:33 <+bridge> <ReiTW> AAA is a battery also
12:36 <+ChillerDragon> lol
12:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I invite you to develop something completely new and bloat free as possible with me^^
12:36 <+bridge> <Chairn> how much you pay me?
12:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> With so much devs around here we could easily build smth up
12:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> U have to do it with a motivational source that does not come from money
12:37 <+bridge> <Chairn> sorry, but my stomach doesn't feed on good will ðŸ™‚
12:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I never said u must stop working
12:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Life is a trade
12:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> If u now pay more than u have to. Then maybe u'll get it back twice
12:59 <+ChillerDragon> not even money motivates me to dev i hate writing code
13:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i only want 300000000000000000000000000 FPS while using 0.00000000001 Wh electricity simulating every atom in the whole universe
13:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
13:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so i have more than enough motivation
13:01 <+ChillerDragon> based desire
13:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> money is just an illusion
13:01 <+ChillerDragon> deep
13:01 <+ChillerDragon> new gnome so bugged omaagwd
13:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> thats what i think at every KDE release too xd
13:02 <+ChillerDragon> xd
13:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> too bloated, but still best feature wise
13:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sad life
13:02 <+ChillerDragon> users love software updates dont they
13:02 <+ChillerDragon> :wq
13:02 <+ChillerDragon> ops wrong chat
13:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so u chatting with ur vi? xd
13:04 <+ChillerDragon> -.- wrong pane then mimimi
13:18 <+bridge> <Chairn> too bad physics says this is impossible
13:19 <+bridge> <Chairn> viGPT
13:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the physics we know
13:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but not mathematically
14:07 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i like rust updates the most
14:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> have u purged the rust package from ur system
14:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> what
14:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i use rustup for my projects
14:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> have u once*
14:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> have u ever*
14:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no
15:35 <+bridge> <uwu> Certified java moment?
15:35 <+bridge> <uwu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1104763328103989278/IMG_20230507_163414_088.jpg
15:35 <+bridge> <uwu> Why java sucks so much ðŸ˜­
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> ok thats kinda cool ngl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4gGJ7XXlC0
16:04 <+bridge> <Learath2> It's good, the worse optimized a piece of software is the more the new generation likes it
16:36 <+ChillerDragon> hm suddenly my game got glitchy like my gpu couldnt keep up so i switched from opengl 3.0.0 to vulkan and it got smooth again
16:36 <+ChillerDragon> !jup thanks for building stuff like that :)
16:36 < chillerbot> @Jupstar âœª
16:36 <+ChillerDragon> very pog
16:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> np, but can also happen other way around xd
16:38 <+ChillerDragon> yes thats why i used vulkan until today
16:38 <+ChillerDragon> hm something is still not right
16:38 <+ChillerDragon> maybe new gnome broke everything
16:38 <+ChillerDragon> time to switch to gentoo and use tiling wm
16:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> just use everything in fullscreen
16:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that's what real pros do
16:39 <+ChillerDragon> i do
16:40 <+ChillerDragon> but gnome is just bloat i dont really need all its features written in garbage javascript xd
16:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> good, pro
16:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xd yeah gnome sucks hard
16:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki do u have a SQL to check the shortest maps someone does not have finished yet per category?
16:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
16:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so if moderate is missing, shortest average time of maps that are missing
16:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no
17:06 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Ask chat gpt
17:40 <+bridge> <uwu> it's not like that all the time, sometimes smth happens and it lags like that, but i don't have such issues in clion or rider, so i just blame java and jvm
17:51 <+bridge> <Learath2> Zoomer try not to defend bloated software challenge, impossible difficulty ðŸ™ƒ
17:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> everything too bloated
17:52 <+bridge> <Learath2> (I only jest, please don't cancel me for not wanting my software bloated)
17:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 what makes ur OS slow, even if its in low level languages?
17:53 <+bridge> <Learath2> Laws of Physics
17:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> why does my file explorer take 1 second to start
17:53 <+bridge> <Learath2> Bad software engineering
17:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> even tho my ssd is faster than any hdd ever existed
18:10 <+bridge> <uwu> Millennials try not to confront zoomers about random stuff, impossible difficulty
18:11 <+bridge> <Learath2> Zoomers try not to have wrong opinions challenge, heroic difficulty
18:13 <+bridge> <uwu> Millennials try not to call other opinions wrong challenge, epic difficulty
18:16 <+bridge> <Chairn> internet people try not to argue on internet over stupid stuff, impossible challenge
18:20 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Yo can someone tell me how frequently / where the input from CGameClient::m_DummyInput gets sent off? I'm wondering where the best place to modify the dummies inputs is without doing it too frequently/infrequently
18:20 <+bridge> <Chairn> probably because it first computes the 1st billion decimal of pi
18:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xdd but probably yes
18:22 <+bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> DM :)
18:22 <+bridge> <Chairn> then reads the same on disk file to check computer is working correctly ðŸ™‚
18:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> modern software:
18:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - too many layers wrapping the same stuff and call it security feature
18:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - too much caching which too often does not work as intended
18:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - too often reinveted the wheel, which probably makes optimizations harder, and bloat more common
18:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - too often mixed with slow languages
18:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - too few @Learath2 in it

18:32 <+bridge> <louis> wat
18:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> oh nice, are all asserts now displayed like that?
18:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i think its fixed in next nightly, if u use nightly
18:33 <+bridge> <uwu> bro's deen :poggers2:
18:34 <+bridge> <Learath2> Exposed, nouis is deen
18:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Robyt3 is this safe to do?
18:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> e.g. the showmsgbox in backend_sdl differs quite a bit, since it first destroys the window
18:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> on my amd gpu the messagebox blocked all input, and the mouse was still captured
18:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and i could only escape with ctrl alt delete
18:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> cant we merge the impl?
18:37 <+bridge> <Learath2> It's really quite hard to do that safely and properly if SDL doesnt have a bail function
18:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> also asserts on other threads should never call this
18:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> only from main thread
18:38 <+bridge> <Learath2> Modern or old, most software seems to lack good handling for errors :/
18:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> :/
18:43 <+bridge> <Robyt3> you mean implement the messagebox ourself? I tried that first, but I didn't want to figure out how to add gtk3 to cmakelist
18:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> no
18:43 <+bridge> <Robyt3> maybe we need to add a separate function to graphics to also destroy the window
18:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in backend_sdl we already have a messagebox impl
18:43 <+bridge> <Robyt3> the message box should also work when the graphics are not initialized yet
18:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mh ok
18:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> we can also create the graphics first
18:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or simply check if a window was created
18:44 <+bridge> <Robyt3> that increase the time that a blank window is shown, not really nice
18:45 <+bridge> <Robyt3> just check if graphics are initialized and then call the special graphics method
18:45 <+bridge> <Robyt3> otherwise just the basic popup message
18:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ```c++
18:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bool CGraphicsBackend_SDL_GL::TryCreateMsgBox(bool AsError, const char *pTitle, const char *pMsg)
18:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> {
18:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª>     m_pProcessor->ErroneousCleanup();
18:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª>     SDL_DestroyWindow(m_pWindow);
18:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª>     SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox(AsError ? SDL_MESSAGEBOX_ERROR : SDL_MESSAGEBOX_WARNING, pTitle, pMsg, nullptr);
18:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª>     return true;
18:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> }
18:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ```
18:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the function is so small
18:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i guess we can live with 2 `if`here
18:46 <+bridge> <Robyt3> How to handle assert in other threads?
18:46 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Does the SDL function work or does this currently crash?
18:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> check if the assert handler thread id == the one that initialized the handler
18:46 <+bridge> <Robyt3> so only show popup for assertions on main thread?
18:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> this will not work on macos
18:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yep i guess so
18:47 <+bridge> <Robyt3> we could add a queue for the assertions I guess
18:48 <+bridge> <Robyt3> but it would be simpler to only shown the popup on the main thread
18:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> `This function should be called on the thread that created the parent window, or on the main thread if the messagebox has no parent. It will block execution of that thread until the user clicks a button or closes the messagebox.`
18:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and macos afaik, only allows creating windows on main thread
18:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> problem is, sometimes we wait on other threads
18:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so this defs increases the complexity by a lot
18:49 <+bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, all the threads adding items to the queue would have to wait until the item is consumed before calling `dbg_break`
18:49 <+bridge> <Robyt3> so probably too much complexity
18:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> most stuff is in the main thread rn anyway
18:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and the vulkan backend handles errors already
19:17 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Thread carefully guys^ :))))
19:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> gentoo is the way to a minimal bloated system
19:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> can u write the config for me xd
19:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
19:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i want to use it
19:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but too lazy
19:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no
19:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but even with 10% more perf, slow software is still slow
19:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its like arch but u just setup some flags
19:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> does it have some UI for that?
19:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thats bloat
19:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ur on the wrong path already
19:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xd
19:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> long compile times make u avoid bloated software
19:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lmao
19:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its a way of life
19:25 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Can we pass `m_pWindow` to `SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox` as the last parameter to make it a modal dialog instead of destroying the window? Or does that also block input to the dialog for you?
19:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah it was buggy and there was some open sdl issue for that

21:13 <+bridge> <bencie> median != average time
21:13 <+bridge> <Marsu> i know i've done average time before but extreme values fuck my charts up
21:14 <+bridge> <Marsu> wait my SQL might not be the correct one...
21:14 <+bridge> <Marsu> do you guys know what SQL was done for the value displayed on the website ? (if it was done with SQL in the first place)

21:28 <+bridge> <toorti> https://t.me/FloraGordon
21:52 <+bridge> <Marsu> i guess i'll just take average and limit time to 12h
21:53 <+bridge> <Marsu> highest time ever recorded is 498 days and 21h lol
21:53 <+bridge> <Marsu> not sure that's legit actually
21:56 <+bridge> <Marsu> idk what these are

22:14 <+bridge> <Skystrife> Hey itâ€™s me
22:16 <+bridge> <Skystrife> Yeah itâ€™s 2^30 milliseconds, and on maps like just every fly and puzzle partners and time shop(all of which include time penalty tiles) you can get the maximum time on without actually waiting nearly 500 days
22:21 <+bridge> <Marsu> hmmmm okay
22:21 <+bridge> <Marsu> thought Time here is in seconds
22:22 <+bridge> <Marsu> i'm not sure that these times are relevant enough for them to be in the database...
22:23 <+bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> What are you working on, if I may ask?
22:26 <+bridge> <Skystrife> Used to not be the case and you could theoretically get a 1 second time on any map if you waited long enough ðŸ™‚
22:27 <+bridge> <Skystrife> Used to not be the case and you could theoretically get a 1 second time on any map if you waited long enough ðŸ™‚ since it rolls over back to 0 again
