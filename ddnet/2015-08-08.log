05:51 < Sadale> I'm looking for the name of a race map(probably nrace). It was very old(like 5 years ago). It has multiple parts. It has blue background at the beginning. In later parts, the backgrounds changes with rainbow color(like the H value of HSV changing). and in other later parts, it has black background.

12:24 <@deen> Sadale: no idea, didn't play back then. yesterday you asked for a command line tool, I saw a link to tw-maps-gen here: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11475
12:25 <@deen> and about the [N]Race mod, you could also try posting on the ddnet forum, I have a feeling the DDNet people are more into race mods than vanilla people^^
12:27 < Sadale> interesting. Thans
