09:24 < bridge> <DefaultO> I mean it's a better design than what https://youtube.com/@ZackFreedman provided the community with. And has more functionality than just being a teleprompter. I'll definetly get one as soon as I can.
10:23 < bridge> <Matodor> but I don't see the server in the general list...

10:48 < bridge> <Matodor> > Dear clients, we are witnessing very large attacks, more than 1 Terabit. It is difficult to cope with attacks of such power even for those who charge six or even seven figures for protection. As you know, our protection is free. We do network filtering on our own, using programs that we have developed ourselves, and we pay for channels from what we earn. The cost of channels is huge, and for a small host like us, protection against such attacks i
10:48 < bridge> <Matodor> > Thanks for understanding.
13:04 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 @Learath2 is this conceptually going in the right direction? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5949
13:07 <+ChillerDragon> yo @Patiga any chance you are motivated to add 0.7 map format support to ddnet? :) 
13:24 < bridge> <Robyt3> I already started this in #5737, but I haven gotten around to finishing it (bezier support is missing)
13:24 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5737
13:35 < bridge> <Matodor> pls allow 0.7 to die 🥺
13:36 <+ChillerDragon> ah amazing thanks @Robyt3
13:44 < bridge> <NeurOnuS> Hello!
13:44 < bridge> <NeurOnuS> Why when i build DDNet Client on linux its only working for me ?
13:44 < bridge> <NeurOnuS> Others ppl couldn't use it and they got error , is there any static command for building client in linux?
13:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If the glibc dep is too high u cannot do it
13:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Similar for other deps, tho they can be work around by using bundled libs
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why wouldn't the other person simply compile it
13:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: yes, going into the right direction
13:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe you could also move the net message translation into a new file?
13:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `SendInfo7` is superfluous, just do it in the net message translation, I'd say
13:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Thought so to but wanted to stay consistent with how it’s done Server side
13:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
13:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't like the server version, it pollutes the file. let's ask @Learath2 on his opinion maybe
13:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea sounds nice
13:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
13:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and the src/game/version.h constants can probably also go directly into the translation, don't need the constants, I think
13:58 < bridge> <Learath2> I don't like the server version either
13:59 < bridge> <Learath2> Problem I had with info was that it had to work with caching properly. So it wasnt very easy to achieve
13:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah. that problem doesn't exist on the client side, so we should be good there
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do u really plan to merge this?
14:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it should be fine if it's clearly separated
14:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so yes, I thought that this would be nice to have in a finished form
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It adds more dependencies. We should go away from old dependencies
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Have u never thought about that your decisions are bad for the projects future?
14:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm not sure what you mean by dependencies here, do you mean more code?
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If we support 0.7 ppl will use this
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If we don't do it. They don't
14:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sentences with "never" are usually false. yes, I do try to reflect on decisions and want to see whether they're good or bad
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I hope u are aware that most decisions about the project were BCS of u
14:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, people will probably use it. you'd probably be annoyed by bug reports etc. coming from 0.7? I see, I understand, I think
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But u aren't the only person that likes ddnet
14:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im against adding 0.7 stuff
14:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if we vote on this
14:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you probably mean 0.7 compatibility? or also stuff like 0.7 skin support?
14:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 0.7 compat
14:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we could add our own skin protocol
14:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i would remove the sixup thing too
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We generally have 20 versions of this game
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What is our goal with this
14:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a mess
14:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> tw is dead
14:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i am for ddnet 2.0 with a protocol removing hacks
14:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hacky code i mean
14:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and ofc, as future proof as possible
14:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with consideration for mods
14:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you consider cleanly isolated compat code bad?
14:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> unlike the long standing position of tw devs against mods
14:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it can exist in a fork
14:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no need to be here
14:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it adds noise
14:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> even if it's cleanly isolated?
14:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to me yes
14:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. not the stuff we have right now where game logic is intertwined with checking whether the client is at least  version 15.3.3
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then make it a proxy
14:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 0.7 in itself is a useless thing to do
14:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if chiller wants to put effort into it and have his fork sure he does he
14:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but why the ddnet project needs that?
14:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what we need a rework
14:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is*
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> This
14:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because we generally welcome contributions
14:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> rewrites are hard
14:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but this is not something that gives a tangible benefit in my opinion
14:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it'd probably give me the benefit that I could play vanilla
14:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rewrites are hard ok, but we dont need 0.7 compatiblity
14:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which I enjoyed
14:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u can play vanilla
14:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> use the 0.7 client
14:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or ddnet and play 0.6
14:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes; that's the barrier to entry
14:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the truth is vanilla is dead
14:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and its not cuz ddnet
14:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can't just decide to join a round of vanilla right now, there are no servers with players
14:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I did not say anything like that
14:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I agree that 0.7 is mostly dead
14:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but it seems to be the only place where I can play a round of vanilla
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> As if 0.7 vanilla is so much greater experience xddd
14:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 0.6 has vanilla too
14:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but no players
14:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I need other players for vanilla
14:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> like 0.7
14:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> at least months back, I could play a round of vanilla in 0.7
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well then go to#general and ask
14:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> without asking friends
14:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if u want players for vanilla instead of addinng code bloat, u should make tournaments or stuff
14:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why does ddnet need to take care of vanilla stuff?
14:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it makes no sense
14:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ddnet is a ddnet client
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ddnet doesn't have to, obviously
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's ChillerDragon who wants to invest time in it
14:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah thats fine, in his fork
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I probably wouldn't implemnet it, I have other interests
14:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why is it important that it's a fork, here?
14:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz its not on the ddnet repo, where ddnet  code is
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It defs makes a rewrite harder
14:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its how free software works
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> BCS it relies on our current code
14:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if his fork is better
14:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it will gain more users
14:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
14:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we have steam, repos, etc.
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it needs to be more than just better
14:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not rly
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the website
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
14:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If we remove lot of stuff. Rewriting gets more realistic
14:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think you're being unrealistic
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we saw that in the past with ffmpeg e.g.
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ffmpeg had to be REALLY bad for a while
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> before distros added the fork
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also ddnet/vanilla
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> only because vanilla was dead for soo long, people started including ddnet in the repos
14:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> vanilla died for a reason
14:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ddnet is more entertaining
14:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm saying ddnet had to be more than just better
14:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> teeworlds had everything u say
14:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> website
14:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> steam
14:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> reach
14:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
14:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it was in all linux repos
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So if his fork gets attention we can still add it
14:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and ddnet yet is here
14:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and ddnet didn't have to be just better
14:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it had to be a lot better
14:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which it was
14:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but it's not just "being better". it's being overwhelmingly better
14:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ddnet didnt start with a lot better
14:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yet it quickly gained players
14:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its simply that the gamemode is more interesting and unique
14:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> pvp gets stale fast
14:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and noobs have  a harder time
14:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> winners write history books I guess
14:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz they are matched against 10y old pros
14:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats a problem with many games
14:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but coop games dont have that problem
14:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> need to do stuff irl
14:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> anyway, if we vote, which i doubt will be the case given previous iterations, im still against it
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Whatever makes 0.7 vanilla mod more attractive we can still add to the client
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But ddnet has such a big player base, yet nobody cares
14:21 < bridge> <akame> @Shiriusu
14:58 <+ChillerDragon> if 0.6 code is removed the rewrite shouldnt be harder
14:58 <+ChillerDragon> and the thing that makes vanilla 0.7 more attractive is that it is the only version you can play with the official client
14:59 <+ChillerDragon> > unlike the long standing position of tw devs against mods
15:00 <+ChillerDragon> as of right now vanilla is more mod friendly than ddnet
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you dont understand heinrich
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he'd never drop 0.6 support
15:00 <+ChillerDragon> we dropped 0.5 didnt we?
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else this would be a completly different situation
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess that was still vanilla tw's archivement
15:00 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 jopsters assumtion right that 0.6 will not be dropped?
15:01 <+ChillerDragon> is*
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if we'd drop 0.6, we could also make a complete rewrite xD
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> isnt that obvious
15:01 <+ChillerDragon> yea sure but i personally have no problem with the protocol if you do you can do a rewrite
15:01 <+ChillerDragon> i only have a problem with missing vanilla compability
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but just for the record, u are aware that 0.7 is dead
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> vanilla
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and even if oy gets active tw has no real future
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs egomant
15:25 <+ChillerDragon> 0.7 vanilla seems as alive to me as i know it from 0.6
15:26 <+ChillerDragon> someone to play with on ctf5 most of the time
15:26 <+ChillerDragon> not sure about pro games since i quit vanilla they might be dead
15:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> jupstar* btw
15:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think we'll ever base the ddnet protocol on top of the tw 0.7 network protocol
15:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there seems to be no point in it
15:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> dropping 0.6 at some point is probably okay, there are probably no players there anymore

15:52 < bridge> <Kaffeine> > ChillerDragon: as of right now vanilla is more mod friendly than ddnet
15:52 < bridge> <Kaffeine> How so? Didn't the 0.7 protocol broke all mods, moved the vanilla game mode code to the base classes, disable features wanted for mods e.g. Sv_GlobalSound (and oh `oy` enabled `Sv_SkinChange` in 0.7.3.
15:52 < bridge> <Kaffeine> 
15:52 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Port a mod to 0.7 means the loose of all players because there is no smooth transition. Otherwise the only option is DDNet codebase.
15:54 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Forgot to mention: reasonable maintainers. Teeworlds (0.7 and as the upstream) is dead also due to that point being missed.
15:54 < bridge> <Matodor> for vanilla exist 0.6<->0.7 server by TsFreddie, its enough 
15:54 < bridge> <Matodor> pls allow 07 to die
15:54 < bridge> <Matodor> give us mod api for 0.6 😔
16:05 < bridge> <Kaffeine> > give us mod api for 0.6
16:05 < bridge> <Kaffeine> This! But it means more maintenance load for DDNet.
16:05 < bridge> <Kaffeine> 
16:05 < bridge> <Kaffeine> I'd love to see a shared codebase with DDNet being one of the game modes implemented ontop. Yet it is hard to expect because for DDNet it means a lot of dev resources wasted for too small effect. 'Better abstractions and clear architecture' is a silly reason for such a big effort.
16:05 < bridge> <Kaffeine> 
16:05 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Deen mentioned (https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1048251667432353843) ddnet-skeleton https://github.com/teeframe/ddnet-skeleton but it starts with disable of ASan, UBSan, and Valgrind's Memcheck tests 👀 . Looking at the commits, a huge drop in the quality I expect. `:yoda:`
16:08 <+ChillerDragon> @Kaffeine > How so?
16:08 <+ChillerDragon> the way i said it
16:08 <+ChillerDragon> im not saying the 0.7 protocol is more mod friendly than 0.6

16:08 <+ChillerDragon> im saying the vanilla code base has a gamecontroller server side and ddnet code base blocks the gamecontroller with the ddrace controller
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> vanilla even added stuff for race in its code base
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> ddnet made no efforts to my knowledge to be a moddable codebase
16:26 < bridge> <Kaffeine> > made no effort to be a moddable codebase
16:26 < bridge> <Kaffeine> The benefit for that is super low. However DDNet accepts such PRs and the maintainers spend their time reviewing such changes. E.g.: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3502/files#diff-cd203dd9ecb0f067300e80e7357a5fb6e3b52982a9bde783f1cdbd53fe8151bd
16:26 < bridge> <Kaffeine> 
16:26 < bridge> <Kaffeine> This seems to be much better than how the `teeworlds` ~~upstream~~ treat the mods.
16:26 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Do I really have to say you that DDNet has explicit support for other mods?
16:26 < bridge> <Kaffeine> E.g. code: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L1005
16:26 < bridge> <Kaffeine> E.g. resources: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/data/editor/entities_clear
16:30 < bridge> <Kaffeine> The protocol extension with UUIDs is super neat: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/615
16:30 < bridge> <Kaffeine> It is extremely helpful for mods. I base Infclass client on that and it won't be possible on 0.7.
16:46 < bridge> <Learath2> fwiw I was only for 0.7 compatibility because it seemed teeworlds was again alive for a while there
16:48 < bridge> <Learath2> I did a couple iterations on this but honestly everytime I start isolating gameplay related code I just get this unbelievable urge to just rewrite everything
16:53 < bridge> <Robyt3> @heinrich5991 What do you think about my suggestion to use `sizeof(int32_t)` in #6328? Would that make it acceptable to you? Or should I just drop that commit?
16:53 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6328
16:54 < bridge> <Kaffeine> If you'd ever try to do it again, please mention or PM me, I'll find time to help. Or maybe I'll also try to do some steps in this direction eventually but I've no idea when it happen.
16:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Robyt3 is singlehandledly carrying ddnet code rn
16:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
16:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i want to do stuff but the stuff i always find to do has a too much big of a scope
16:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i need to have the skill to find small refactors like robyt
16:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wanted to add a secure channel between server and client using pubkey, i got the exchange, but then i went deep into the protocol layer to add encryption as if it was invisible to the higher level code
16:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i just stopped
16:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz too much work
16:57 < bridge> <Learath2> I remember two massive issues, 1 is `IGameController` it's misnamed, it's not an Interface :D, 2nd was `CGameController`s and `IGameController` leaking into `CGameContext`
16:59 < bridge> <Kaffeine> I'm not the one to review PRs in this project but I still look at them time to time.
16:59 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Personally I find `sizeof(int32_t)` to be the most readable option 👍 . On one hand you removed the hardcode and the new code indeed makes it clear that there are ints instead of four chars or two shorts. On the other hand Heinrich5991 point in possible variations of the `int` size makes sense and (with int32_t) you're addressing it in the most reasonable way.
17:04 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Yeah, it is super important to stop at the right scope (which might be big enough because we have big issues and yet it should be doable and not overwhelming).
17:06 < bridge> <Kaffeine> The name itself is not a big technical issue or significant tech debt.
17:06 < bridge> <Kaffeine> I see the two issues in:
17:07 < bridge> <Kaffeine> 1. Network/protocol-specific stuff spread through the codebase (I'd rather have another layer for that)
17:07 < bridge> <Kaffeine> 2.

17:08 < bridge> <Kaffeine> 2. Game mode stuff spread through the codebase (not encapsulated into ModGameController; and hey, it does not seem to be doable reasonably). In another mod I've also subclassed CPlayer and CCharacter, and still had to keep some mod-specific code in CGameContext.

18:18 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :pepeH:
18:20 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> libtw2 moment
18:21 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> also rust server is pretty good xd
18:21 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> was able to run mazes on it
18:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i hope thats true
18:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> learath is too depressed, but would be cool xd
18:24 < bridge> <Learath2> aye, I barely have motivation to wake up

18:29 <+ChillerDragon> oof lerato sad
18:29 <+ChillerDragon> ._.
19:09 < bridge> <судный день.> we need ddnet on asm
19:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> compile ddnet, then u have ddnet on asm
19:29 <+ChillerDragon> asmr ddnet
19:30 < bridge> <DefaultO> maybe they mean roller coaster tycoon asm level
