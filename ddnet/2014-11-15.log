00:00 < laxa> well, do any german know it there ?
00:01 <@heinrich5991> laxa: I do
00:01 < eeeee> meanings:
00:01 < eeeee> [1] intransitive, with before or at: be indecisive, hesitant
00:01 < eeeee> Cognate words:
00:01 < eeeee> [1] wait, flicker, wait, hesitate
00:01 <@heinrich5991> hesitate
00:01 < laxa> wut
00:01 < laxa> !de-en zaudern
00:01 < Nimda> Translation: hesitate
00:01 < laxa> I don't mean that
00:01 < laxa> !en-de procrastinate
00:01 < Nimda> Translation: zögern
00:01 < laxa> WTFFFF
00:01 < laxa> !fr-de procrastiner
00:01 < Nimda> Translation: zaudern
00:01 < laxa> !fr-en procrastiner
00:01 < Nimda> Translation: procrastinating
00:02 < laxa> !en-de procrastinating
00:02 < Nimda> Translation: zaudern
00:02 < laxa> ...
00:02 <@heinrich5991> zaudern doesn't mean procastinate
00:02 < laxa> how to say that in german then ? :D
00:02 <@heinrich5991> it means that you're not sure whether a decision is the right one or so
00:03 <@heinrich5991> I think there's no german equivalent
00:03 < laxa> WUT ?!
00:03 <@heinrich5991> you can "aufschieben"
00:03 <@heinrich5991> but it needs an object, unlike procrastinate
00:03 <@heinrich5991> it means that you don't do something until later
00:04 < laxa> hum

00:17 < laxa> deen: there is a little "bug" with map sound
00:17 <@deen> ?
00:17 < laxa> if your sound is low
00:17 < laxa> but not 0
00:17 <@deen> why can't you just say "prokrastinieren"?
00:17 < laxa> sometimes you can't hear sounds
00:18 <@deen> laxa: how to test it?
00:18 < laxa> hum
00:18 < laxa> follow me
00:18 < laxa> wait
00:18 < laxa> I need test server password
00:19 < laxa> deen: ok follow me, I am ready
00:19 < laxa> EUR test #1
01:33 < nuborn> hi
01:35 <@deen> hi nuborn 
01:43 < nuborn> deen: when the code is fixed, shall I just send a new pull request?
01:43 < nuborn> and including the server code
01:43 <@deen> yes
01:43 < nuborn> ok, just checking :P
01:43 < nuborn> Ill look at it later

18:15 <@deen> hi
18:15 <@deen> EastByte: I've seen that before, but it looks laggy, right?
18:15 <@deen> which is why i didn't want to add it
18:15 <@deen> can't imagine how terrible it is with ping 200
18:16 <@EastByte> yea right
18:16 <@deen> EastByte: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=666&p=5829#p5829
18:16 <@deen> did you hear that teevision is down?
18:16 <@deen> maybe we can hosta simple script so people can run their own testservers, similar to DoNe's trashmap
18:17 <@EastByte> haha
18:17 <@deen> or teach people how to forward ports in their router
18:17 <@EastByte> looks everyone wants to be a tw hoster again
18:18 <@deen> i don't want to
18:18 <@EastByte> ...
18:18 <@deen> I'm just wondering if we should do it
18:18 <@deen> because otherwise people may have problems testing their maps
18:18 <@EastByte> hmm not sure why
18:18 <@deen> afk

20:10 < Maple> Hello, dev!
20:24 < Welf> Maple i heard you had a discussion about accepting maps?
20:25 < Maple> well it was more broken, leute and some people arguing about stuff
20:28 < Welf> ahh hi_leute told me that you also said sth about that, so you just trolled ? (or maybe i misunderstood him)
20:29 < Maple> im not a troll
20:30 < Maple> but i agree map admission criterias are biaised
20:32 < Welf> i don`t think so, nobody looks at where is the mapper from ^^
