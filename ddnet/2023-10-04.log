01:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought chillerbot-zx was the illegal one, why is it on ger10
08:15 < bridge> <AssassinTee> kinda, check out my new ddnet testmap, Mycelium
08:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It is the illegal one. So psst before the admins notice him .\_.
10:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> do we have websocket support in ddnet
10:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe i can connect the client to the event feed
10:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> pog
10:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat how is gentoo going
10:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
10:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> @fokkonaut wasnt it removed
10:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> true
10:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
10:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> but adding a external websocket connection shouldnt be hard
10:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont mean a server one
10:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ye
10:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> klient
10:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> <https://ddstats.org/events> :eyes_anger:
10:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> most events are from chinese
10:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1159041826771177482/image.png?ex=651e7151&is=651d1fd1&hm=12dd3ba5f2860b497b845519dbcdb320f7a4761f4284fb4b74c2a2976236be3c&
10:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> well most players are from chinese
10:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> china*
10:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> u should speak english correctly ur american
10:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:

10:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> broken
10:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 128
10:20 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/ddnet-web-demo-viewer
10:20 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Now u can get data about demos and maps in js. For what? Why? Idk but you can :p
10:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> 128?
10:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @ryozuki max clients in the browser is at 128, not 64
10:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
10:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> the master itself can take infinite, i believe, but the client can take up to 128
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> @fokkonaut its not broken though
10:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> probs
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> that just specifies the initial capacity
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> hashset can grow
10:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ah
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> its so it doesnt reallocate
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> when adding
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> default initial is 4 or 8 iirc
10:21 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought that ddnet could only show 64 players?
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think 64 at a time
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u can hack it
10:21 < bridge> <Ewan> and servers are usually 64 with the exception of yours
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> fokkonaut knows more since  he made it xd
10:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> its about the browser
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> oh i see
10:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> u can show all clients in the server browser
10:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> @fokkonaut but ye this is like allocating a std::map or equivalent with 64 slots but it can grow to whathver
10:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4560/commits/8300753fa41fb90e5042865cf8b2e0fb17a3d292
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> why use a hash table for a fixed size arr
10:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
10:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> pub fn with_capacity(capacity: usize) -> HashSet<T, RandomState>
10:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
10:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> Creates an empty HashSet with at least the specified capacity.
10:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
10:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> The hash set will be able to hold at least capacity elements without reallocating. This method is allowed to allocate for more elements than capacity. If capacity is 0, the hash set will not allocate.
10:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
10:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thats nice
10:23 < bridge> <Ewan> Oh at least
10:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html#method.with_capacity
10:23 < bridge> <Ewan> mis read
10:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc vec grows at a factor of 1.5
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah its 2
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> so if the initial alloc is 4, to get to 64 it would do 4,8,16,32,64
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> 5 allocations
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> vs 1 if u use with capacity
10:25 < bridge> <ultrakeker> Soon we will get JS client :justatest:
10:25 < bridge> <ultrakeker> Soon we will get full JS client :justatest:
10:25 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Hell nah
10:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
10:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet ecosystem growing
10:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> lots of new libs
10:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
10:26 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> agpl 3 btw :gigachad:
10:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://teewebs.net
10:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> best
10:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> teeobserver, ddstats, ddnet-map-diff, ddnet-map-gen are agpl3 too
10:27 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Its all ur stuff, isnt it?
10:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> teerender too
10:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> i gotta finish it
10:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
10:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @ryozuki u made map diff?
10:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> chiller has some kind of map diff tool too, but for github pipeline
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> @fokkonaut i ported ravie one to rust and added features
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a editor map diff
10:28 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> I have only DDnet-Team-Searcher and web-demo-whateverthehell :feelsbadman:
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> it modifies the map
10:28 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> And both in js :pepeW:

10:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> and windows
10:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> u
10:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> keep doing more
10:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just do whathever idea i have
10:32 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> My ideas take forever
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also have a ddnet config parser
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/teeconfig
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Hash)]
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> pub struct ConfigEntry {
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki>     /// The description of this config entry.
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki>     pub description: String,
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki>     /// The type of the entry.
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki>     pub entry_type: EntryType,
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki>     /// The flags of the entry.
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki>     pub flags: CFGFlags,

10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki>     pub symbol: String,
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> it parses the header c file
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u get a vec with all the config entries with this struct
10:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need to parse the cfg file next
10:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is done using a LR(1) parser   https://github.com/edg-l/teeconfig/blob/master/src/grammar_cpp.lalrpop

11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> instead of a m1
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> nerd
11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> all ppl who chat here are nerds

11:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i really like steve
11:14 < bridge> <Ewan> his uncontested enthusiasm inspires me
11:15 < bridge> <Ewan> tho it’s rly just the cocaine
11:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> today i think i get the hardware for my home server
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i had a ryzen 3200g lying around so i built it around that
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> gentoo 2 inc
11:33 < bridge> <sergeyshukhyan> i not have pc
11:35 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I know that the package installs curl, so yes
11:35 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I thought the same a longer time ago, but with twitch support
11:36 < bridge> <AssassinTee> imagine top ddnet streams coming up in a live feed, or official streams 🙈
11:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> curl has nothing to do with websockets
11:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> curl is used to query master server and ur name info
11:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> http stuff
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc for websockets we used https://libwebsockets.org/
12:53 < bridge> <AssassinTee> > curl has nothing to do with websockets
12:53 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Calling an api with curl in order to connect the client with the feed would be a valid solution as well.
12:58 < bridge> <AssassinTee> also I found this, which is also new for me: https://everything.curl.dev/libcurl/ws
12:59 < bridge> <AssassinTee> also I found this, which is also new for me (can't tell if related): https://everything.curl.dev/libcurl/ws
13:12 < bridge> <deen> Pretty powerful for a home server
13:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
13:12 < bridge> <deen> I think mine is idle nearly always, except for backups + official ddnet builds + teehistorian archives
13:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> but one of the uses ill give it will be to use it with distcc
13:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> to compile gentoo packages
13:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> @deen do u use some kind of software to make a NAS?
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> or u just ssh
13:13 < bridge> <deen> sshfs
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill check that out
13:14 < bridge> <deen> I'm not a Windows user though, probably doesn't work on Windows
13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah im a gentoo user
13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> ☕
13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> what other stuff u host in ur home server?
13:14 < bridge> <deen> And samba for everyone else in the house
13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> to have some ideas
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> good thing is i pay a fixed monthly price for water/electricy so i dont care about power usage
13:16 < bridge> <deen> Mostly it's a NAS, I also use fetchmail on the server, and get the emails to my local systems using unison. Command line programs that should always run, like newsboat, irssi
13:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> ohh
13:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> true i can put my irc bouncer there
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also want to do some DIY with my 100 liter aquarium
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> like a parameter logger and dashboard
13:19 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> force your fish to use linux
13:19 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> or smth
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill probs use a microcontroller board to get the params and send them over network to sv
13:24 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I recommend an rp2040 based one.
13:24 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/rp2040.html
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> does it has rust tooling/libs
13:25 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I think so
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have some stm stuff
13:25 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> doing a quick search returns this https://github.com/rp-rs/rp-hal
13:26 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ah ok ;)

13:31 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ooooh i know what type of map robyt3 plays now
13:32 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> you DO like blocking, dont you, robyt3?
13:32 < bridge> <robyt3> A bit weird how we use the EU "country" for all our European servers but KoG uses individual countries like Germany
13:32 < bridge> <robyt3> Server favorites and friends in my screenshots are always random :kek:
13:33 < bridge> <robyt3> The completed maps are correct though
13:33 < bridge> <robyt3> map*
13:33 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ohh
13:33 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> makes sense
13:35 < bridge> <robyt3> I keep adding random friends for testing. Though when I launch an old client, I lose some of them again, because the maximum number of friends was lower
14:19 < bridge> <cyberFighter> is that impact font
14:19 < bridge> <robyt3> yes, lol, was the default in paint for some reason
14:19 < bridge> <robyt3> yes, lol, was the default in GIMP for some reason
14:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you could move the set out some scopes so that you don't reallocate in each loop
14:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> bitcoin miners?
14:59 < bridge> <learath2> I'm never touching prediction again :ahendmymiserableexistence:
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i tried but the loop complained cuz the references
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can look into it more but i wanted to get smth working fast
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> could be worth lol

15:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> @chairn opinions on this?
15:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> non volatile ram
15:47 < bridge> <robyt3> In theory, yes, but I don't think we discussed the specific criteria adding communities yet
15:47 < bridge> <robyt3> The whole discussion is here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5654
15:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
15:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> @robyt3 btw if u ever need a review to get a pr merged feel free to ask
15:51 < bridge> <sedonya> New avatar :brownbear:
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> who
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7258
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw im in favour of merging this
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 are u against?
15:52 < bridge> <learath2> curious, it'd have to be something completely different, 100x lower dynamic power consumption than dram usually would imply one tenth the frequency or somehow one one hundreth the capacitance
15:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> AIUI, we just merged a PR that fixed a bug with interlaced PNGs?
15:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or there's one in the queue?
15:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> what does AIUI mean
15:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> as I understand it
15:52 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i saw this a year ago
15:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7283
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> iwas about to merge it
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> but then i read it was useful only with that pr
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Note that the client will still show a warning popup when loading images with an indexed color palette, so this is only effectively usable together with #7258.
15:53 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7258
15:53 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> tried ninnou but then again its as as hell
15:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it should be useful without the PR as well
15:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no idea why robyte said that
15:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @robyt3?
15:54 < bridge> <robyt3> I guess it's still an improvement to fix the loading of the images itself, but we wouldn't add our own images if they still cause the warning every time
15:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7283 good to merge because it fixes a bug, I'd say
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> well ill add it to queue
15:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6990
15:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> lgtm
15:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think I'd like to wait with https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7258, people are still actively using clients that don't support these PNGs
15:58 < bridge> <learath2> I think I'd like 7258 merged, one more mistake like this and they will just have our heads
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> we shouldnt hold back because 20 people use ancient clients
15:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you talk to these people and understand why they use these clients, we can figure something out
15:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we probably also "hold back" because 20 people use some feature in other places
15:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. adding upnp support to the servers
15:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or re-adding freeze stars
15:59 < bridge> <learath2> There will be still a couple people that just prefer to stay on the old client, even if we convert most of them you won't agree to merging 7258 because of the holdouts
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> usually these ppl hold back not because they use a feature but because smth changed
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> even konsti uses latest client
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> he told me xd
16:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I find statistics liek "only 1% of our concurrent player base use the feature" to be misleading
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think ppl using old clients understand what it means
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> and the drawbacks is that at some point that old version wont work with modern server versions
16:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but we're cutting an online service which means we stop supporting the skin db for these skins in these old clients
16:01 < bridge> <learath2> I think you should provide a patch to make the warning far less punishing if you don't want 7258. We don't get to kill peoples runs for our mistake
16:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess I'll try to make a patch for that
16:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can see this point
16:02 < bridge> <learath2> (that is at the very least, I think 7258 + a skindb policy just to never include any interlaced or indexed skin is the better solution)
16:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you believe we can do a skindb policy without hte warnings, then the warnings shouldn't be a problem
16:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't believe in that, that's why I added the warning
16:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we can *uphold the skindb policy
16:04 < bridge> <learath2> I'm starting to wonder why you ever added the disable switch to the warning if you'd never be willing to disable it anyway
16:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it's not the time yet
16:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I added it because otherwise the warning would be a forward compatibility hazard
16:05 < bridge> <learath2> What is the bar if not 1%? 0.1%? 20 players? 10 players?
16:06 < bridge> <learath2> Why? If we are never allowed to break backwards compatibility, in this case there will never be a forward compatibility issue anyway
16:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> @deen any opinion
16:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if we didn't add the option, we'd be in the same situation as before
16:07 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, as long as the warning is toned down, I'm okay with keeping it if you feel it's that important. My concern is mostly with punishing the most players, the rest is just idle curiosity as to what you are thinking
16:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> at least now we're already in a much better position than before, because we added the remote switch
16:08 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, as long as the warning is toned down, I'm okay with keeping it if you feel it's that important. My concern is mostly with punishing most players, the rest is just idle curiosity as to what you are thinking
16:10 < bridge> <learath2> Well the switch might as well not exist if we are not allowed to touch it. The mere existence of it only gives us an option, if we aren't allowed to take the option it's neutral
16:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > the rest is just idle curiosity as to what you are thinking
16:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think stopping software that once worked from working is bad, especially if people are still using it
16:11 < bridge> <learath2> I agree that stopping it is bad. One skin not properly loading in 3 years of hosting the db, almost 5 years since we released the said old version does not constitute stopping it IMO
16:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I agree that this is kinda minor, it's just skins
16:12 < bridge> <learath2> If it was a crash or graphical issues I'd be 100% onboard
16:12 < bridge> <learath2> It falls back gracefully to the default skin even
16:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
16:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> one skin is not bad, I agree
16:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd guess that it's just one skin because we had the policy in place, perhaps even due to the warning
16:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess my fear is that by removing the warning, we're going to get to a point where the skindb is not usable for old clients
16:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> still used old clients
16:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so just removing the warning in the current state isn't bad
16:15 < bridge> <learath2> Is there even a will to include interlaced or indexed skins in the db?
16:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I saw such a will from people, almost just to exclude old clients ^^
16:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it'd also give some space savings
16:16 < bridge> <learath2> Oh that is definitely there, @ryozuki and @jupeyy_keks would interlace all of them just to make people migrate 😄
16:18 < bridge> <learath2> This is so interesting btw, it's like a space-age FLOTOX 😄
16:19 < bridge> <learath2> It uses gallium arsenide semiconductors too, bizarre
16:19 < bridge> <deen> I don't care much, probably because I think seeing a default skin is not that ad. Like Learath2 said let's set a reasonable user base where we accept a few skins breaking, maybe 1%.

16:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oof, encoding broken utf-16 into another standard 😦
16:25 < bridge> <learath2> How loose the web technologies are with standards is actually quite annoying. Browsers are so extremely liberal with what they accept that it's sometimes hard to predict behaviour
16:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> causing security issues in the process
16:25 < bridge> <learath2> Potentially ill-formed UTF-16 should just look broken so the developer fixes it, not patched up and displayed
16:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the largest languages all use this potentially ill-formed utf-16, unfortunately 😦
16:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but maybe this gives you better string interaction for building wasm APIs 🙂 @ryozuki
16:42 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ironically the biggest ddnet update will be adding backwards compat
16:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
16:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i think js Date also uses iso86xx with quirks

17:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> is there support for gamemodes on the ddnet codebase? or is the DDRace gamemode hardcoded? I'm trying to make a new gamemode and looking at other mods (which aren't based on ddnet codebase) seem to do it differently than DDRace.
17:20 < bridge> <robyt3> Many things are hard-coded in our code. There's another project that tries to make the code more modable: https://github.com/teemods/ddnet-skeleton
17:22 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Ok, thanks ^^
17:26 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh man you know what would be a cool af mod support feature? the ability to have popups that have buttons and prompts that can send what button you press or what script you type in to the server
17:51 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Dead/not maintained codebase which starts from disabling tests. Also it is hard to agree what is the base game (and should be kept) and what is ddnet specific stuff (and should be cut).
17:51 < bridge> <kaffeine0> It could be a thing if we'd have more people (mod devs) working on the shared codebase. I tried to convince a few mod devs but they see it as waste of time/resources.

18:05 < bridge> <kaffeine0> IIUC this is the goal of https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7042 (which uses https://nodes.teeworlds.dev/media as an example)
18:05 < bridge> <kaffeine0> However, the proposed "strategy" as "implement an interface in C++ and subsequently add Lua bindings for it" is questionable, and there are other ways to do that.
18:44 < bridge> <learath2> @nuborn if you have some time, could you check out reckoning in tutorial? It's broken because m_Jumps is not correct. I think we are forced to take that though now that I see we are kinda stuck with at most what vanilla can reckon
18:44 < bridge> <nuborn> yes, I could take a look later
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u know if u can make the gentoo install boot and setup ssh? without any display/keyboard
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill have to connect it to a display and keyboard right? smh
18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> quite pretty and smol i would say

19:06 < bridge> <learath2> it's doable if you have dhcp and using an ethernet cable
19:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 u mean the router assigning the computer a local ip?
19:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> and yes i got ethernet
19:11 < bridge> <learath2> yes, in that case the installation cd can bring up the network on it's own
19:11 < bridge> <learath2> You can just symlink sshd into `/etc/runlevels/boot` in the install usb and it should bring up sshd
19:18 < bridge> <learath2> (though doing it blindly can be a fun exercise, it can also be extremely frustrating as you have no way to monitor anything 😄 )

20:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
20:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> one day i was sick of slow usbs
20:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> so i bought the fastest usb i found
20:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> also its 128gb
20:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> sandisk extreme pro
20:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> how to do this btw
20:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess i need to mount the usb
20:04 < bridge> <learath2> yep
20:05 < bridge> <learath2> OH also remove pwgen from whatever runlevel it's in
20:05 < bridge> <learath2> and set a root password instead
20:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> how was it to mount with write perms
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> `mount -o rw` ?

20:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> sudo mount -t hfsplus -o rw,remount -force /dev/sdb3
20:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> i found this command
20:11 < bridge> <learath2> tough luck, you'll have to just connect a monitor and keyboard 😄
20:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> f
20:12 < bridge> <learath2> Why hfsplus though, I don't really believe that
20:12 < bridge> <learath2> I think it's a bizarre result of this hybrid iso disk image thing
20:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
20:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> sad noises
20:14 < bridge> <learath2> I'm curious, could you run `cfdisk` on the iso?
20:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> holy
20:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats cfdisk

20:15 < bridge> <learath2> it's fdisk but better
20:15 < bridge> <learath2> why HFS+? that's so bizarre
20:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
20:16 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, maybe for mac compatibility?

20:44 < bridge> <learath2> What are you doing btw? New computer?
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> home server
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> with gentoo
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill help it with distcc
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> altho it has a 3200g ryzen
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> 8 cores
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> everything needs to be gentoo
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> i cant dare touch another distro in this home
20:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
20:45 < bridge> <learath2> Try a BSD sometime, it's quite interesting too
20:46 < bridge> <learath2> Portage is inspired by ports iirc
20:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> should i use no multilib
20:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> for a server
20:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc i only use multilib on desktop cuz steam
20:49 < bridge> <learath2> Mh, why make it annoying for yourself? Portage won't pull in anything 32bit anyway unless you want it
20:52 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> what does ryoz need a server for
20:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye i went normal
20:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> its always fun and its handy to have a computer running 24/7
20:53 < bridge> <learath2> Having a homeserver is quite fun
20:53 < bridge> <learath2> I used to have one hosting all my anime that I totally acquired through legitimate means
20:53 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i mean sure but like
20:53 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> what plans would you have
20:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> NAS, irc bouncer
20:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> torrent seeder (?)
20:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> more to come
20:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> it can also help my main pc compule
20:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> compile
20:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> via distcc
20:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> im lookijg forward to halved firefox times
20:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> or almosy
20:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> almost*
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> why sweat emoji?
20:55 < bridge> <Ewan> someone doesn’t understand torrenting :justatest:
20:55 < bridge> <learath2> you can also have your server compile firefox for your main machine
20:55 < bridge> <learath2> just in the background
20:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> omg
20:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats genius
20:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> or everything for a fact
20:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> xsd
20:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
20:55 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> too used to "getting games free"
20:59 < bridge> <learath2> You can have your server just compile everything make it into a binpkg and use your server as a binpkg host on your local machine 😄
20:59 < bridge> <learath2> That's how I was using gentoo on my laptop back in the day
21:51 < bridge> <gerdoe> afair torrent speeds are always higher than average fileshare service's
22:08 < bridge> <learath2> Especially if you have an above average connection
22:09 < bridge> <Ewan> wonder if i can run distcc on winders
22:11 < bridge> <Ewan> you probably wouldn't want to do this on your home internet, there are seedbox-for-rent VPS services that are just underpowered with a lot of storage and a lot of bandwidth
22:11 < bridge> <Ewan> the bandwidth is what makes it worth it
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> they can get up to like 50Gbps
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> but are usually around 10-20
22:13 < bridge> <Ewan> like if i hosted a seedbox at my house, my ISP's disgustingly asymmetrical grid would make it so not worth it
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> less than 5 MBps
22:22 < bridge> <chairn> it looks too beautiful to be true. Feels more like a scam to get more money from investors.

22:22 < bridge> <chairn> Good luck to sell that to anyone

22:27 < bridge> <chairn> > ultralow logic state switching energies of 10−17 J are predicted for 20 nm feature size ULTRARAM memories
22:27 < bridge> <chairn> Predicted, they admit they don't have the tech ready yet, which confirms my first point. They need money from investors
22:30 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, it seems AMD uses something atleast named the same in some devices https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/am007-versal-memory/UltraRAM-Introduction
22:32 < bridge> <chairn> looks completely unrelated. Your link seems to refer to FPGA only. It doesn't even mention it's non volatile
22:33 < bridge> <chairn> Their concept is closer to Intel Optane memories
22:34 < bridge> <learath2> I was following a link from wikipedia, so I guess whoever the editor is just googled ultraram and added a source 😄

22:34 < bridge> <chairn> Ultraram SRAM block array, not even DRAM
22:36 < bridge> <chairn> Another half scam company https://www.weebit-nano.com/
22:36 < bridge> <chairn> It does work, but only for niche market with specific usage, not for everyday desktop
22:36 < bridge> <learath2> Q: Won't this be the case until someone does achieve it? I don't quite see this as an argument for much of anything
22:37 < bridge> <learath2> Unless you believe there is some fundamental physics reason that makes it actually impossible
22:37 < bridge> <chairn> If it was true, everyone here would hear about it
22:37 < bridge> <chairn> not really, but the techs used have troubles to get good performance, endurance and density
22:37 < bridge> <chairn> in general, you only get 2 out of 3
22:38 < bridge> <chairn> SRAM and DRAM have good perf and endurance, but quite low density, and also quite high power consumption
22:38 < bridge> <chairn> Flash has bad performance but very high density. High power consumption in writing, low in reading. Endurance is quite limited
22:39 < bridge> <chairn> New non volatile memories often have good performance, high density, low/medium power consumption, but low endurance as well
23:09 < bridge> <marmare_314> @robyt3 do you have any idea how to refactor the layer list dragging code? I tried multiple times but it just doesnt work. Ideally it would be reusable for stuff like the server settings editor (or envelopes :justatest:). So the part you drag isnt always the same (ie in the layer list its the group button, for settings it would be a `⠿` label), which doesn't make it easier.
23:21 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't have any immediate ideas, but I also think it would be useful to refactor the dragging UI code. For example the usage of `DoDraggableButtonLogic` feels a bit inconvenient with the two bool pointer arguments. Dragging/moving support could be added to listboxes in general and enabled when desired if possible. I think making the entire list item draggable would be easier for server settings. I supposed you could also add delete buttons to each 
23:26 < bridge> <marmare_314> Allowing the whole line do be draggable seems good too. Adding support it to listbox would be even better. One of the biggest problems I faced was the hot/active system. It doesnt really allow you to have subelements. So say I wanted to add a movable container. Then it would be hot if the mouse is hovering it. But that completely breaks all buttons that are potentially in the container.
