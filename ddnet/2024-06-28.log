08:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> morning
08:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> gm,
08:57 <+bridge> <Bota> /gm 1
12:01 <+bridge> <learath2> I have commited a grave offense. I emerged firefox-bin
13:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
13:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2  Fri Jun 28 12:26:53 2024 >>> www-client/firefox-127.0.2
13:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki>        merge time: 8 minutes and 44 seconds.
13:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cant u compile firefox in 8 mins like me?
13:15 <+bridge> <learath2> I'm outside, can't afford to waste battery on that
13:15 <+bridge> <learath2> What CPU did you have @ryozuki
13:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1256206436409806957/image.png?ex=667fece9&is=667e9b69&hm=85a44a8e11ad1e728f3d161885fa64903c8b01bf0e0315470bac0406aa3f0b7d&
13:19 <+bridge> <learath2> I have 2/3rd the cores and my boost clock is 10% less than yours, so a very very very rough estimate would put my compilation time at 15-ish minutes
13:19 <+bridge> <learath2> Probably more like 20 as I doubt this tiny laptop can keep at 100% the boost clock for very long
13:25 <+bridge> <piegunvgunpie> how to solve itüò≠

14:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cant wait to play factorio 2.0
14:55 <+bridge> <zhn> :justatest:
15:00 <+bridge> <learath2> Omg, above ground level
15:00 <+bridge> <learath2> Blasphemy
15:02 <+bridge> <Bota> CHOOOO CHOOOO üöÇ
15:30 <+bridge> <1234503178> **suggestions for improving the editor from the most useless to the most useful:**
15:30 <+bridge> <1234503178> 
15:30 <+bridge> <1234503178> > *1. the ability to customize the appearance of the editor (buttons, button color, etc.
15:31 <+bridge> <1234503178> > 2. ability to move buttons and layers to convenient places
15:31 <+bridge> <1234503178> > 3. advanced animation: adding a side button, will be added for "PARA" x y / also the ability to move tiles, but without properties (for example hook/unhook)
15:31 <+bridge> <1234503178> > 4. improved clipping: ability to work with para and animations
15:31 <+bridge> <1234503178> > 5. hints when using server settings (for example tune ...)
15:31 <+bridge> <1234503178> > 6. hotkey for quickly deleting a texture or group (shift + mouse2)*
15:31 <+bridge> <1234503178> 
15:31 <+bridge> <1234503178> **bug:**
15:31 <+bridge> <1234503178> 
15:31 <+bridge> <1234503178> > *1. ‚ÄúProof‚Äù can be seen even in the texture (if you hold down space)
15:31 <+bridge> <1234503178> > 2. why red and blue | spawn and flag are present on DDNet Entites*
15:31 <+bridge> <1234503178> 
15:31 <+bridge> <1234503178> 
15:31 <+bridge> <1234503178> 
15:31 <+bridge> <1234503178> I‚Äôll say right away: yes, most of these things are useless, but remember the ‚ÄúRemove unused envelopes‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlace Border‚Äù buttons, they are literally useless at all levels of mapping
15:31 <+bridge> <1234503178> 
15:31 <+bridge> <1234503178> and 1 more: remember the ‚Äústopper‚Äù, I‚Äôll be honest: for me, this is the worst thing that was invented in this game, because not only does it hardly stop, but you can also get stuck in it, it‚Äôs difficult to use it so that there were no errors in it (for example, you can stand edge in a vertical wall) (image 1)

22:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> found on twitter
23:17 <+bridge> <tintint8> i was trying to figure out the script to apply color to user i couldn't figure it out. help pls xD
23:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> elaborate
23:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> pls üòÉ
23:22 <+bridge> <tintint8> i was trying to create a script to make person rainbow. so it's gonna change colors smoothly. i'm cycling through colors but i need to know how to apply them to user üòÑ
23:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> a script
23:23 <+bridge> <tintint8> like rainbow colors not actually real rainbow
23:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> like on your server or cjient?
23:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> like on your server or client?
23:23 <+bridge> <tintint8> probably on server
23:23 <+bridge> <tintint8> i'm not the one who is gonna run it
23:24 <+bridge> <tintint8> just trying to do a favor to a friend
23:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> dont think it can be scripted in that case
23:26 <+bridge> <tintint8> i might need little help it's my first time trying this idk how things actually work. we did augmented reality stuff for furniture companies and some web stuff for real estate companies but nothing too serious
23:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> you'd have to implement it in the server
23:27 <+bridge> <tintint8> like can't someone with enough authority can't run this script so it can make people rainbow ?
23:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> or add a mechanism to change tee colors via. server console
23:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> you could have the functionality but kot as a script
23:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> unless u do this, then u can use ur new cmd via. fifo file/named pipe w/ sv_input_fifo
23:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> or just implement the whole fuature on the server (that's what i'd do)
23:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> or just implement the whole feature on the server (that's what i'd do)
23:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> i'd break this up into steps ig üòÉ 
23:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> - how to manipulate a player's color(s)?
23:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> - how to do something on a set interval?
23:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> - how to toggle this for specific players?
23:32 <+bridge> <tintint8> YE I LOVE THIS DEV COMMUNITY
23:32 <+bridge> <tintint8> TY MAN
23:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> you could have the functionality but not as a script
23:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> btw kog has this feature already
23:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> works via rcon afaik
23:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> maybe if u ask avo nicely he'd paste it for u
