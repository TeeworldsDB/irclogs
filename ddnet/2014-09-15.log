17:25 < xRoThx> Yo
17:26 < EastBite> just noticed the player with hookbot in the lounge
17:26 < EastBite> hi xRoThx 
17:27 < EastBite> I wonder whether Meskalin is a coder
17:41 <@deen> yes he is
17:42 <@deen> he's working on zClient with toast
17:42 <@deen> modified ddnet client with bots
17:42 <@deen> hi xRoThx 
17:43 < bor> hi deen
17:44 <@deen> hi bor
17:45 < bor> do you have a link to latest ddnet client ? something like ddnet.tw/downloads/latest.zip
17:46 <@deen> hm, no
17:46 <@deen> I guess I could create something like that, but it would be Windows only
17:46 <@deen> why don't you just link to http://ddnet.tw/downloads or even http://ddnet.tw/ ?
17:47 < bor> not all players here (mostly on elementary school) are good with english , they would need extra description to find the link on page
17:49 <@deen> ah, ok
17:49 <@deen> let me think of someting
17:50 < bor> if you are using apache you can use a rewrite rule in .htaccess file 
18:08 <@deen> bor: http://ddnet.tw/downloads
18:08 <@deen> better now?

18:22 < EastBite> which provider do you use?
18:24 < laxa> deen: wtf, the tournament video has been greenlighted almost instantly.
18:24 <@deen> what's "greenlighted"?
18:24 < laxa> our videos from hall of fame are still waiting

18:25 < laxa> all hall of fame video are blocked at 301

18:28 < KinG__> hi all
18:28 < KinG__> hi deen 
18:28 < EastBite> hello
18:28 <@deen> hi KinG__ 
18:29 < KinG__> deen:  the block server is down can u run it plz?
18:29 <@deen> KinG__: it's up and i see 2 players on it
18:29 < KinG__> the other block :D
18:29 <@deen> one of them is you
18:30 < KinG__> other is my dummy 
18:30 <@deen> ^^
18:30 < KinG__> i mean the other server
18:31 <@deen> weird, it was running but not registering at master server
18:32 <@deen> next time that happens you can just connect to it and shutdown, then it will automatically restart
18:32 < xRoThx> Other mods are allowed aswell: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=112107#p112107
18:33 < KinG__> how deen ?
18:33 <@deen> KinG__: log into rcon and write shutdown
18:33 < KinG__> ok
18:57 < laxa> deen: are the favorites requested from the masterserver ?
18:57 < EastBite> nope
18:57 < laxa> so, if a server is sv_register 0 and is in my favorite, I'll still see it right ?
18:58 < EastBite> ya
18:58 < laxa> ok thanks for info :)

18:58 < laxa> any idea where this rating come from ?
18:59 < laxa> It's bugging me :p, I wanna know where it comes from.
18:59 < EastBite> up and down votes I guess
18:59 < laxa> yeah I guess that too
18:59 < laxa> but which formula do they use ?!
18:59 < laxa> this value is coming from youtube's API
18:59 < EastBite> 5= 100% 0 = 0% ?
18:59 < laxa> so 
19:00 < EastBite> youtube also had stars once
19:00 < EastBite> maybe the api is so old :D
19:01 < laxa> don't think so
19:03 < laxa> ok 
19:03 < laxa> !fr-en pouce
19:03 < Nimda> Translation: inch
19:04 < laxa> (GREEN_INCH/TOTAL_INCH*100)/20
19:04 < laxa> but I wanna be sure of that :p
19:04 < EastBite> I'm finally skilled enough to move my mouse properly while rocketfly
19:04 < EastBite> wut
19:05 <@deen> xRoThx: i think everyone here runs their own server, so they're properly not interested =/
19:07 < laxa> Fuck yeah
19:07 < laxa> https://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol_ratings
19:07 < laxa> I found out
19:08 < laxa> I am happy xD
19:08 <@deen> nice googling skills, laxa
19:08 < laxa> So, Nimda is using youtube API v2.0, the rating is depecrated there
19:08 < EastBite> :D
19:08 < laxa> deen: thanks xD
19:08 < laxa> You won't believe me, but today I discovered the "search tools" on google xD

19:11 <@deen> nope
19:11 < EastBite> I do
19:11 <@deen> but i used dvorak a long time ago
19:11 < laxa> deen: you are the real coder guy :p
19:11 < laxa> french layout is really bad to code
19:11 <@deen> german too, but with nimrod it's ok :P
19:11 < EastBite> ^
19:12 < laxa> you need to do altgr + "-" for ]
19:12 <@deen> same
19:12 <@deen> [] and {} are over altgr
19:12 < laxa> I always code with us layout
19:12 <@deen> <> are at terrible position
19:12 < laxa> yup, same for french
19:12 < laxa> just right from shift ?
19:12 <@deen> yes
19:12 < laxa> same for french :)
19:12 <@deen> but i don't care much, i can type way faster than i can think anyway^^
19:12 < EastBite> I'm thinking abuot switching back to qwertz
19:13 < laxa> deen: why don't you use dvorak anymore ?
19:13 < laxa> EastBite: I wouldn't, US keyboard rule !
19:13 <@deen> tired of changing settings in every program and i unlearned qwertz
19:13 < EastBite> but I need öäüßüäß
19:13 < laxa> that's one of the good thing of windows
19:13 < laxa> you can have a different layout of keyboard for every application
19:14 < Savander> http://sterlingadaptives.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/matias_half_qwerty_508_keyboard.jpg
19:14 < laxa> without configurating anything

19:14 < EastBite> ye
19:14 < laxa> Savander: that's your keyboard ?
19:14 < Savander> no
19:14 < Savander> xD
19:14 <@deen> laxa: wouldn't help me. i want to type normally in the program, with dvorak, but change the shortcuts so they're where I'm used to
19:15 <@deen> oh, my keyboard looks funny
19:15 < laxa> I don't get it :p
19:15 <@deen> i should make a screenshot
19:15 < laxa> look how windows is funny
19:15 < laxa> I configured russian layout too !
19:15 <@deen> that looks like an english keyboard
19:15 < laxa> Руддщ умукнщту .

19:22 < Savander> LOL
19:22 < Savander> ???
19:22 <@deen> i didn't want to switch the keys for dvorak, so i just removed the letters
19:22 < EastBite> I like the idea
19:24 < Savander> you're crazy
19:24 < Savander> xd
19:24 < laxa> you can't do that anymore on modern keyboards :)
19:24 <@deen> why not?
19:24 < laxa> cause good keyboard use caps that are burnt with laser
19:24 < laxa> it's not printed
19:24 <@deen> good ones did that 6 years ago too
19:24 <@deen> i just have a cheap one :P

20:52 < laxa> I love you
20:53 < laxa> well now

21:11 < laxa> I one time posted my school account password on IRC, cause of the 2 screens uses :(
21:12 <@deen> i wanted to post it here
21:12 <@deen> but posted it in the Nimrod Programming Language channel^^
21:13 <@deen> maybe EastBite posted his password before too, and then covered it up

21:59 < EastBite> add whitelists for important players :D
21:59 <@deen> when i see 12 finishes in 2 minutes
21:59 < EastBite> or only top5 ranks
21:59 <@deen> yeah, some filter like that
21:59 < laxa> deen: I don't think it's a good idea
21:59 < EastBite> and also last rank for me <3
21:59 < laxa> some filter would be good :p
21:59 < laxa> you know PHP deen ?

22:02 < EastBite> do you know to work with json?
22:02 < laxa> I did some hacking / programming challenges
22:02 < laxa> not really

22:02 < laxa> but I do that at work with C# :p
22:02 < EastBite> I have a nice ajax backend for tw stuff
22:03 < laxa> it's webservice or API ?
22:03 < EastBite> it's my webservice which provides an API
22:03 < EastBite> it has nothing yet but requesting players
22:04 < laxa> write documentation for it
22:04 < laxa> I'll make a plugin later for it :p
22:04 < EastBite> but it holds a serverlist refreshed every minut
22:04 < EastBite> e
22:04 < EastBite> and I wanted to add some ddnet stuff
22:10 < laxa> Savander: you there ?
22:10 < Savander> yes
22:10 < Savander> what's up?
22:10 < laxa> could you send me the TwRequest I sent you ?
22:11 < laxa> I want it to work with 64 players
22:11 < laxa> and you fixed it right ?
22:11 < Savander> ye
22:11 < Savander> it works
22:11 < Savander> with 64 players
22:11 < Savander> sec
22:11 < Savander> it was simple
22:12 < Savander> http://pastebin.com/UeFVvzat
22:12 < Savander> here you go
22:13 < Savander> if you want 64p 
22:13 < Savander> in array
22:13 < Savander> e.q.
22:13 < Savander> 				array("62.113.205.186", 8500, TwRequest::VERSION_06_64),
22:15 < laxa> hum
22:15 < laxa> sorry to disturb you
22:15 < laxa> but could you put it on your http server with txt extension ? xD
22:16 < Savander> what?
22:16 < Savander> ah
22:16 < Savander> ok
22:16 < Savander> sorry
22:16 <@deen> woah, Wolfram Alpha doesn't give out step-by-step solutions for free anymore?!
22:16 <@deen> How do students solve their math homework now?
22:16 < EastBite> laxa: https://eastbit.net/priv/blubb.txt
22:17 < Savander> http://ddforce.net/TwRequest.txt
22:17 < EastBite> I was faster :D
22:17 < laxa> xD
22:17 < Savander> hehe
22:17 < Savander> ^^
22:17 < EastBite> deen: good question
22:18 < laxa> wow, you changed a lot of code Savander right ?
22:18 < Savander> not that much
22:18 < EastBite> 64pl is not that easy
22:18 < Savander> i add some case:
22:18 < Savander> :P
22:18 < Savander> i added*
22:18 < EastBite> there is an offset and multiple responses
22:20 < laxa> deen: I'll host any maps that are not too bad and that you rejected. Should I write that on forum or not ? :D
22:21 <@deen> we reject non-bad maps?
22:21 < laxa> I just hosted Tatunka
22:21 < EastBite> "ddracepro hosting trash maps only" :D
22:21 <@deen> if we do that, better argue for the map being released
22:21 < laxa> map from maggi323
22:21 <@deen> yeah, write the title as EastBite said!
22:22 < Savander> http://ddforce.net/
22:22 < Savander> look in status
22:22 < Savander> i test one server
22:22 <@deen> DDNet Chile!
22:22 < Savander> xD
22:22 < EastBite> :D
22:22 < Savander> but
22:22 < Savander> it works
22:22 < Savander> :P
22:22 <@deen> that's only the first request
22:22 <@deen> you need to send 2 more
22:22 < laxa> if you wanna cheat players
22:22 < Savander> why?
22:22 <@deen> for more than 24 players
22:22 < laxa> just do that Savander
22:23 < laxa> sv_name "Best server ever [63/64]"
22:23 <@deen> the players are split up, i think you need 3 requests
22:23 < EastBite> deen: I don't think so
22:23 < EastBite> one request, multiple responses
22:23 < Savander> ah yes
22:23 < Savander> i see
22:23 <@deen> EastBite: true!
22:23 < Savander> i don't see
22:23 < Savander> all players name
22:23 <@deen> i meant, handle the other 2, my bad
22:23 < EastBite> also threre is an offset integer
22:24 < EastBite> binary integer + compressed ...
22:24 < Savander> btw
22:24 < EastBite> in a string protocol
22:24 < Savander> how it works? how to make 3 requst
22:24 < Savander> with offest?
22:24 < Savander> don't know how it works :(
22:24 < EastBite> just send the request like you did
22:24 <@deen> only 1 request, but handle 3 packets
22:24 < EastBite> and wait for all responses
22:25 <@deen> but Chile is bad for testing, since i always have packet loss to chile
22:25 <@deen> specially on udp, but not on icmp
22:25 < Savander> first server on list
22:25 < Savander> :D
22:25 <@deen> they cheat their packets
22:25 < EastBite> deen: lol
22:28 < laxa> deen: how to make switches work individually on solo maps ?
22:28 < laxa> for ddnet server
22:29 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/types/solo/flexreset.cfg
22:30 <@deen> sv_team 3
22:35 <@deen> good that i have all the stuff online
22:37 < Savander> wow don't know
22:37 < Savander> how to fix it
22:37 < EastBite> it's not easy :/
22:37 < Savander> TwRequest is not mine
22:37 < Savander> xd
22:37 < Savander> it's from lxa
22:37 < Savander> laxa
22:38 < laxa> It's not mine either
22:38 < Savander> but i have it from you
22:38 < Savander> nvm.. but works a little bit
22:38 < Savander> 64/64
22:38 < Savander> and to 24 players name
22:38 < Savander> hehe.
22:39 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/teeworlds.py#L379
22:39 <@deen> I guess you need to have a timeout and just wait for the 3 packets to come in
22:39 < EastBite> http://ebeur.eastbit.net:8888/server/185.37.147.11/8303/
22:39 <@deen> but haven't looked at the PHP lib
22:39 < EastBite> now supports serer requests :D
22:39 <@deen> nice
22:39 < EastBite> even has reverse lookup
22:41 < Savander> http://php.net/manual/en/function.socket-set-timeout.php
22:43 < EastBite> set_timeout should be useless in this case
22:43 < Savander> meh ;D
22:44 < Savander> not good
22:44 < EastBite> non blocking sockets
22:44 < Savander> 		/* unblock, so that the requests can be parallel */ 		stream_set_blocking($socket, 0);
22:45 < EastBite> I should do some regex and leech all the country names from the source
22:48 < Savander> i have no idea
22:48 < Savander> xDD
22:49 < Savander> http://php.net/manual/en/function.fseek.php
22:49 < Savander> what you think?xD
22:50 < Savander> :( :c
22:50 < EastBite> hem
