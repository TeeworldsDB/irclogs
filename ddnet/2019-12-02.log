00:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Christmas sucks
00:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u suck
03:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> is there anything (settings etc) that could cause normal ddnet client to set its mouse position to nan
08:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @onby screen resolution of 0 being reported by OS maybe
08:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> would they be able to play like that?
08:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> no, but OS might misreport it for a moment while changing resolutions
08:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> or minimizing
08:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> interesting
08:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> in game their aim just stays up and to the left the whole time
08:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> could probably check if mouse position is outside of bounds and reset it
08:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> client side or server side
08:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> client
08:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> would be cool if it printed a dbg msg if it ever had to reset it
08:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> bcs ive only seen the nan mouse pos a couple times and one of them was a broken bot
08:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> and wondered if the other time i saw it was also someone trying to bot
08:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ah, I thought you had regular players reporting that
08:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, some misbehaving bot is much more likely
09:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> maybe the server could check for that too
09:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> if someone has nan mouse pos assume theyre doing something shady (?)
09:15 <@deen> I guess
