00:19 < bridge_> <thrava> NOOOOOO
00:19 < bridge_> <thrava> The vote description length limitation seems to be existed in network layer
00:20 < bridge_> <Teero> wth
00:20 < bridge_> <thrava> This literally ruined my plan
00:21 < bridge_> <Teero> what were you planning? abusing votes and invisible characters to make serverside ui on the right side of the screen?
00:21 < bridge_> <Teero> i literally cant think of anything else this would be useful for lmao xd
00:22 < bridge_> <thrava> totally normal use
00:22 < bridge_> <thrava> totally normal usage
00:23 < bridge_> <thrava> I just want to let the voting of my server more more stylized
00:23 < bridge_> <thrava> I just want to let the voting of my server be more stylized
00:23 < bridge_> <thrava> can't it be sent segmentedly?
00:24 < bridge_> <thrava> can't it be sent segmently?
00:24 < bridge_> <thrava> can't it be sent in segments?
00:26 < bridge_> <thrava> I mean no matter the resolution of the game window, the description text always just takes up half of the screen
00:26 < bridge_> <thrava> even less
00:27 < bridge_> <thrava> This really upsets me very much
00:29 < bridge_> <thrava> I earlier thought the length could be adjustable because it was declared in the voting.h, not in somewhere else like protocol.h or network.h
00:30 < bridge_> <thrava> So I just spend many time to design the voting layout but end up knowing I'm just wasting time
00:30 < bridge_> <thrava> This is really upsets me very much
00:31 < bridge_> <thrava> Ruined, literally
00:31 < bridge_> <thrava> sad
00:35 < bridge_> <thrava> And there is less than 3 days, and I need to host a server
00:36 < bridge_> <melon> send the vote description as a broadcast
00:36 < bridge_> <melon> thats how we on blockworlds do it, works fine
00:37 < bridge_> <melon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1421626720674512987/image.png?ex=68d9b88e&is=68d8670e&hm=b25cc3a9ab4431af4ee946192db742c6cb8ff7eb04fc80785fc2059e1483d377&
00:37 < bridge_> <melon> sadly no colored broadcasts :/
00:39 < bridge_> <thrava> I need a million year to finish downloading the map and enter the server
00:40 < bridge_> <thrava> I hate this world ((
00:40 < bridge_> <melon> :c
00:40 < bridge_> <Teero> hi  em,oln
00:40 < bridge_> <melon> hi Tr,eeo
00:41 < bridge_> <Teero> tereo
00:41 < bridge_> <thrava> Like what
00:42 < bridge_> <thrava> I mean how does it behavior (displayed)
00:42 < bridge_> <thrava> Does it really a broadcast?
00:44 < bridge_> <melon> ye, and thanks to broadcast_pl you can target individual players
00:44 < bridge_> <melon> ye, and thanks to broadcast_pl you can target individual players with ease
00:46 < bridge_> <thrava> ok..............................................................................................................................
00:46 < bridge_> <thrava> I guess I must face the fact that I just can't put more than 64 char in the vote description
00:46 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> maybe try to do some kind of scrolling text
00:47 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> so if its bigger than the limit send a different vote that scrolls to the next letter
00:47 < bridge_> <melon> scrolling text in a vote menu sounds cool
00:47 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> and loop through everything
00:47 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> some servers do that with nicknames
00:47 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> like when they use custom nameplates before nicks etc
00:47 < bridge_> <melon> won't that flicker and look weird? :o
00:47 < bridge_> <melon> i'm tempted to try
00:48 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> you cant update the vote window right away?
00:48 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> i dont really know its just an idea i thought might work
00:48 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> i know i saw people manipulating the voters/vote ratio count while vote was running
00:48 < bridge_> <melon> i never attempted it so it was an assumption, maybe you can
00:48 < bridge_> <thrava> I have pretty much no energy to describe what I'm doing, I just feels bad
00:48 < bridge_> <thrava> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1421629699674865844/image.png?ex=68d9bb55&is=68d869d5&hm=befac7bb4c6790e4f0cb57e7db0b19050186ce1f87debb1d212f6bd436d80611&
00:49 < bridge_> <thrava> The motd works perfectly because the space is enought
00:49 < bridge_> <melon> interesting way of doing it
00:49 < bridge_> <melon> i think we attempted something for our vote menu
00:50 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> i saw people use motd and detect the cursor positions to make menus that let you just click individual options
00:50 < bridge_> <melon> i think we attempted something similar for our vote menu
00:50 < bridge_> <thrava> Have you seen the tree command in windows?
00:50 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> really cool stuff
00:50 < bridge_> <melon> oh yeah the mmotee server for example
00:50 < bridge_> <melon> really sick indeed
00:52 < bridge_> <thrava> Well, it will be fine at the end, I can just divide on more voteFormatSub1 to shrink the length
00:52 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> is there a place i can dm you with the question i have xd
00:52 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> matrix
00:52 < bridge_> <thrava> I guess I was dragged down by my own emotions
00:52 < bridge_> <12944qwerty> matrix?
00:53 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> when src2?????
00:53 < bridge_> <melon> ^^
00:53 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> download element client
00:53 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> join #ddnet-developer:matrix.org
00:53 < bridge_> <melon> (yes, matrix)
00:53 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> and try to find chiller or whatever
00:53 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> he replies (sometimes)
00:54 < bridge_> <melon> or write him a passive aggresive e-mail
00:54 < bridge_> <melon> worked for me, got a response within a minute
00:54 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> xddd
00:54 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> where do i find his mail
00:54 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> i want to send him love letters

01:00 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I still have legendary legacy profile pic on Gmail where I spelled chiller with 3 L accidentally. I did not even notice for like half a decade
01:02 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I fixed it with paint on my gh profile
01:19 < Thrava> So how does this quakenet works like if I send a message
01:19 < Thrava> cool
01:20 < bridge_> <thrava> So does the message on Discord also visible on another side
01:21 < Thrava> really an interesting stuff to me
01:25 < bridge_> <thrava> tired, sleep
01:25 < bridge_> <thrava> goodnight guys
01:30 < bridge_> <thrava> anyway, I will still open my server from 10/1 to 10/7, originally it should be opened at 10/1, but there are some problem like I discussed just now
01:32 < bridge_> <thrava> i'd rather to delay the date than just open an unconfigured vanilla server, that will make the whole efforts making in these days meaningless
03:40 < Myai> hey
04:03 < bridge_> <tsfreddie> bro discovered irc bridge
04:03 < bridge_> <thrava> bruh
07:54 < chillerbot> DO NOT FORGET @ChillerDragon TO: add snaps to twnet_parser

10:03 < ChillerDragon> tmux to the rescue :poggers:
10:03 < ChillerDragon> omg tmux is so op
10:26 < bridge_> <Assa> fucking telecom router crashed home Network again
10:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> we have router freiheit
10:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> just buy a non shitty one
10:28 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Ono Debian 13 update fried my laptop
10:29 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> rip
10:29 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Can’t even boot old kernels
10:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Go into recovery
10:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Might just be mesa drivers
10:31 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I have no internet in recovery
10:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sudo dhclient
10:31 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I see nothing interesting in logs either
10:31 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Idk which logs
10:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or sudo dhcpcd
10:32 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Im running home right now to search internet cables
10:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Oke
10:34 < bridge_> <Assa> it was part of my contract, I am actually considering.
10:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> They usually give you money if you dont buy their router xD
10:35 < bridge_> <Assa> I have an LTE hybrid router, I don't know how easy I can replace it
10:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> wtf ok
10:47 < bridge_> <Assa> Thats the downside on the german country side, you are either a telecom customer or you only have 16 K, and they couldnt even give me 100K without LTE
10:47 < bridge_> <Assa> tja
10:53 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** it would for the life of it not find the fakin eth0 device
10:53 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but then randomly connected to my home wifi during recovery mode xd
10:54 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** debian breaks more than arch, change my mind
11:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I had to use LTE too lately, sucks hard for playing teeworlds :lol:
11:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I'd take the 16k additionally
11:19 < bridge_> <Assa> nono the telecom gives me 80K, other providers only give me 16
11:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Classic monopoly
13:24 < bridge_> <01000111g> i currently habe no internet in my new flat cuz there is glass fibre in the street, but house owners havent decided if the house should be connected to it (it costs like 1k once, but most telecom conpanies do it for free). The absolute state of this country 🤯 I can get 250 mbit DSL or 1 Gbit cable, but i don't trust their stability regarding packet loss/ being a shared medium.... so I just wait for their answer first painfully

13:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah don't buy cable
13:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's a trap
13:25 < bridge_> <01000111g> Yeah, the 250 mbit DSL would be my next choice after glass fibre... with cable my ddnet days are probably over
13:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @robyt3 is it just me or do get prs messy quite quickly? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10967#issuecomment-3342966918 i feel like they need some todo system where you can mark stuff as done and see what is open
13:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** as soon as there is like 10 comments and 3 open todos it becomes chaos
13:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 the problem with capital letters in skin names still persists btw:
13:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1421821338640715869/image.png?ex=68da6dcf&is=68d91c4f&hm=a7ee06a75d4f01ebdf01d0ed473fd6cc13285f1975b8802dd786eeb313380418&
13:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It's even worse than before
13:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Before I could simply reload and it worked I think
13:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If it helps: someone on the server has the name with lowercase
13:34 < bridge_> <robyt3> I don't know how to solve this without reverting to loading skins multiple times for different capitalization. There doesn't seem to be a way to determine the canonical name of a skin. I guess this is more of an issue on case sensitive file systems, because others will just load the skin with any name.
13:36 < bridge_> <robyt3> I guess we'd have to try to load skins with every newly encountered capitalization even if a skin already failed to load with another
13:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno loading it twice sounds less bad than not loading it at all
13:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But yeah to have it consistent, windows has to be case senstive too
13:37 < bridge_> <melon> can't we just force Souly to lowercase all existing skins on the db :justatest:
13:37 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> @soulyvevo
13:38 < bridge_> <melon> tho that doesnt prevent user error writing glow_Contrastfox and wondering why the skin was deleted..
13:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> In any case, the current behavior is a massive bug imo
13:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it allows users from the server to control behavior of my client
13:38 < bridge_> <Assa> my home owner just said no, we don't get fibre.
13:39 < bridge_> <melon> i wonder if we could somehow cache a lookup to attempt to first load exact match, and if that fails try a case-insensitive search
13:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> Even if you could open a file with name case insensitively, the same problem would also be when downloading. The server returns 404 with wrong capitalization.
13:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Mh we could keep a HashSet or similar of skins names tried to be loaded case sensitive.
13:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> And generally look if the skin is loaded lower case.
13:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It don't see why it should be impossible to not trigger the file read twice while having consistent behavior
13:50 < bridge_> <Assa> sounds to me like we are missing a server option for ?insensitive
13:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But for consistency we should disable case-insenstivity on windows. Too bad that is still hard even in other programming languages
13:51 < bridge_> <Assa> yes, I already see that there might be collisions
13:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> apparently you can make a directory be case sensitive in windows 10+
13:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but it does not affect subdirectories
13:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> So every folder every created by us needs this xd

15:53 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but i am often in airplain mode or dont have my phone with me
15:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i'll ping you in 20-30mins ig
15:53 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i have friends that ringed my door bell or invited me to github repos already to reach me xd
15:54 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** its more a "don't call us, we call you" kinda policy i have to keep a bit of mental health
15:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ok, lemme quickly book my private jet to muinch
15:54 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but i check #developer a lot you should be able to reach me here
15:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> alright
15:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> does chiller ping you, or only the whole name
15:55 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** needs whole name
15:56 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.a4b90029-718e-4e84-a446-75640a30d890.png
15:56 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** hrhrhrhr
15:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> :frozen:
15:59 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** !remind 25 check irc because josspit needs it
15:59 < chillerbot> Helo ChillerDragon I will remind you at Sun Sep 28 2025 16:24:09 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.
15:59 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** 🧠 
15:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> :deen_star:
15:59 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** this is literally of no use
16:00 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** omg
16:00 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** there is really a bug
16:00 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** in my int unpacker
16:00 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and i did not notice for years?????????????
16:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> shit
16:00 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** oh wait no there isnt?
16:01 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ok thats even weirder
16:01 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** fuck
16:02 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i hope its not a huffman decompress error
16:02 < bridge_> <melon> yes, for blockworlds
16:02 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon why tho
16:02 < bridge_> <slavviikk> Есть русские?
16:02 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** da
16:02 < bridge_> <melon> similar to fng, you dont want dead people to be able to fight back
16:03 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** u want the fight back to be random instead?
16:03 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i think the heinrich fix did more damage in ddrace than it did in block
16:03 < bridge_> <melon> i basically want if(isHit && isFrozen) { return; };
16:03 < bridge_> <slavviikk> Anyone who wants to go through maps with levels 1-5 needs to raise points
16:04 < bridge_> <melon> best place to ask is in #general, this channel is development exclusive ^^
16:04 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @slavviikk ??? wich levels?
16:04 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon is blockworlds even using ddnet?
16:04 < bridge_> <melon> on it right now
16:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** u plan to keep merging into it?
16:05 < bridge_> <melon> we're on 18.8, and i plan on just cherry picking some things
16:05 < bridge_> <melon> like broadcast_pl
16:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ah so hard fork?
16:05 < bridge_> <melon> ye
16:05 < bridge_> <slavviikk> Oh
16:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** then just add the return duh xd
16:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but i still think it soks
16:05 < bridge_> <melon> i follow your mod_related changes thing for that xd
16:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** gimme heinrich hammer block gaming
16:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i wanna fight back
16:05 < bridge_> <melon> :kekw:
16:06 < bridge_> <melon> just l2p
16:06 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** its skill issue if you cant hammer frozen tees without them killing you
16:06 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** the amount of trolling we already did with that on foggonaut server is historic
16:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon will you also fix the gun bug?
16:07 < bridge_> <melon> define gun bug
16:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** the one where it shows you have 1 ammo
16:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** makes bw unplayable
16:07 < bridge_> <melon> we show ddnet HUD
16:07 < bridge_> <melon> no ammo
16:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** no
16:08 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i have 1 ammo
16:08 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.db415e13-14d0-4de7-be70-77294810500a.png
16:08 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** Eye of GNOME
16:08 < bridge_> <melon> you're on old source
16:08 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** thats why i ask
16:08 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** if u fix it
16:08 < bridge_> <melon> we're working on it okay :(
16:08 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** veri nice
16:08 < bridge_> <melon> well yes, the moment new source drops
16:09 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** cant wait to have bw reach basic ddrace support hrhrh
16:09 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** with zooming and shits
16:09 < bridge_> <melon> xdddd
16:09 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and no more bullets flying through walls
16:09 < bridge_> <melon> oh nice reminder
16:09 < bridge_> <melon> 
16:09 < bridge_> <melon> !add_todo dont render tee's outside of default zoom
16:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 so favorite skins are normalized too ig?
16:09 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon why tho
16:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> That would explain why some favorite skins are randomly gone
16:10 < bridge_> <melon> all my homies hate campers
16:10 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon thats just adding the bug back
16:10 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** that zoom doesnt work
16:10 < bridge_> <melon> not a bug, feature
16:10 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** its a ddrace based mode you can assume the majority has clients that can zoom
16:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I think we should revert the normalized stuff
16:10 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** zooming is a skill
16:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> loading a skin twice sounds like not a real issue
16:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what problem does it solve other than that?
16:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon
16:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> The time is over

16:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
16:21 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** u fakin troller
16:21 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i said C
16:21 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** noway u just did that xd
16:21 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** vibe coded?
16:24 < chillerbot> Elo @ChillerDragon I just wanted to remind you that: check irc because josspit needs it
16:24 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yeye chilerbot look at what he did
16:25 < chillerbot_> Holy fuck
16:25 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** fr
16:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i didnt code a single line
16:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> oh wait
16:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i added target to gitignore
16:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I coded exactly 1 line
16:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
16:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** u pro vibe coder now?
16:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yesterday i let it give me an analog clock
16:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> wanna see?
16:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** sure
16:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but does it work? xd
16:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1227766426761429123/1421601272934699118/xDDD.mp4?ex=68d9a0db&is=68d84f5b&hm=48cc4b3960817ad7740e52ade879b240faee57033d0f6ffa1cf2b53c45890460&
16:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** are you telling me this is 100% ai generated?
16:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> totally works
16:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1227766426761429123/1421602155055288430/xDDD2.mp4?ex=68d9a1ad&is=68d8502d&hm=027e9478a6f6832e4c931110c45c0521cf53bebc45717debd368312723797612&
16:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** what does the clock do
16:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> zero bugs
16:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** where is it
16:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> zero logic errors
16:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's just a system clock
16:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** in the ddnet-rs client hud?
16:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But I dunno why the fuck it failed to set the red one as second pointer
16:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> instead of freaking hour xD
16:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, tater or smone was like, we need analog clock
16:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ye but where is the clock
16:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so C++?
16:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's deleted again
16:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ah no ddnet-rs
16:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah rust
16:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but not in the map or something right?
16:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i mean the clock itself looks kinda solid
16:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yes
16:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but man wtf did AI think about the logic xD
16:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> not in the map
16:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's egui code
16:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ok and the irc thing? like u did not do anything?
16:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
16:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well
16:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** do you have local agents that edit files?
16:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i wrote the prompt
16:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
16:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> codex
16:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** do you think it works?
16:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you need gpt premium tho
16:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno
16:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** leak prompt
16:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you have like a non-production server? XD
16:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** no
16:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i test in prod
16:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ```
16:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> rewrite this whole project into rust..
16:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> make sure to carefully check the logic is ported correctly and compiles without errors or warnings.
16:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ```
16:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** if prod is down we can no longer chat but duh
16:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** wow open source prompt
16:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it used cargo check for warnings tho, instead of clippy
16:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** do you think closed and open prompts will become a thing?
16:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, arent both a thing already?
16:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** idk
16:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** im not deep in ai
16:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** like not at all actually
16:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i can tell ya, there are 1000000 agents like this
16:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> new startup ever day
16:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> new startup every day
16:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** epic times
16:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** this is why we need a plugin api in ddnet
16:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so every 12yo dude with an idea can just vibe a plugin
16:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well i'd say the code quality is not good enough yet
16:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Like it's not bad.. you can defs use it for prototyping.. but so many stupid things
16:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** that doesnt matter if we hide bad code in plugins
16:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ok
16:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i'd say test on production or not?
16:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> can you at least make backup of your database? XD
16:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
16:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yes i need a sec tho
16:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i have been watching prime a bit https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen
16:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** he and his squad are embracing vibe coding a game since a few days
16:35 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** its funny
16:35 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** 24/7 lua gamedev
16:35 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i also was amazed how they managed to have a structured code base with tests and all and make the ai understand how to write clean code
16:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> my bro vibe coded a game (i dunno the name but it's where you have to guess from what time music is and then put a card before existing date or after)
16:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it was in flutter
16:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and damn that thing is actually pretty nice
16:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> he also made sure to not code a single line for fun
16:36 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yea i was aware AI is cool for small things you can oneshot generate in a single file even for ppl that dont know how to code
16:36 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but i always thought it breaks in bigger projects or when there is a dev with xp behind it with a vision
16:36 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but it actually seems to work
16:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it defs breaks.. bcs it cannot _really_ test your code
16:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> actually if you do test driven coding it's good again
16:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** they have a bunch of tests
16:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs then it can test xd
16:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** it solves merge conflicts for them and runs test and adds type hints and lints and all the shits
16:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** they ofc need to test a lot
16:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
16:37 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but one thing i also noticed is that it freed up a lot of time for actually thinking about the game
16:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** they discussed a lot how the game should look and feel and work from a high level
16:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> we'll see how useful will get in future
16:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** which is what game dev should be really about
16:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> rn it'd say it's defs too bad to deliver something of higher quality
16:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and the technical details under the hood would just be generated
16:38 < bridge_> <robyt3> yeah. I'll think about it again, if I can't come up with a better solution I'll revert the normalization
16:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Alright :deen_star:
16:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ok lemme close some shits then we test in prod
16:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> nice 😬
16:39 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** omg i had too much coffee already
16:39 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and the fakin nice lady from the coffee place randomly gifted me another one
16:40 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i might die 
16:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ how am i supposed to maintain that code tho xd
16:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** it was also cool to have the shared typehints for front and backend for the protocol
16:41 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i somehow doubt it will actually work 
16:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> prompts
16:43 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ..
16:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> as if your problem isnt a solved problem
16:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u contact some http server and request to another
16:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
16:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** fr
16:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** `[!]        try running 'npm run db migrate' (or the Rust CLI equivalent)`
16:44 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** bru
16:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lel
16:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ah sick it has better error msgs than you
16:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> gj AI
16:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** sadge 
16:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** doesnt work
16:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> rip
16:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** no errors but im just stuck in login screen
16:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> wait i'll insult it that it failed
16:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
16:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** looks promisin tho
16:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.44fa37f3-9700-4224-a437-b403abe89384.png
16:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u stuck in login screen ofc you are
16:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs u created new db
16:48 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so?
16:48 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i regged new user
16:48 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** on register it does notin
16:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> oke
16:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah dunno ssl error rip
16:49 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yea the irc also looks bad xd
16:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> packet length too long lmao
16:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> wtf is this error
16:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sounds like a real err
16:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** it didnt even insert to sqlite3 db :/ 
16:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** also why does ctrl+c not quit it omggahw
16:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ok delete this trash
16:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** AI VIRUS
16:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
16:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ez
16:50 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** skynet got me
16:51 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but its pretty close
16:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i honestly thought the project is trivial enough for the AI to not fuck it up
16:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's only like 3k LOC
16:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> there you see it
16:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it still too bad for dis world
16:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> on a testing env it could start the service itself and read the errors
16:53 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** well there arent even errors
16:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you think it's a user err?
16:54 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** writing good tests for a frontend actually working is hard
16:54 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i press enter and nothng happens in login or singup page
16:54 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** that doesnt happen in js version
16:55 < ws-client> **<chiller>** a
16:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> whatever was a fun try
16:55 < ws-client> **<chiller>** oh wtf this is linked to actual irc? xd
16:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> watcha mean
16:56 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.15367a9c-bb4e-49d4-acfe-17d6b52b96e5.png
16:56 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i tested the js version on local hist
16:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ah it uses some irc crate
16:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lol
16:58 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @12944qwerty oke i actully made a bit of progress with snaps 🚀
16:59 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but lots of distractions today i will rq coding now
17:34 < bridge_> <learath2> You just need to hire 4 people and make them all use ai
17:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> You just need to hire 4 AI and make them use the other AIs

18:50 < bridge_> <kebscs> i dont get it how TEAM_RED is good here
18:51 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> TEAM_SPECTATORS is -1 TEAM_RED is 1
18:51 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> you changed it from 1 (red) to 0 (blue) and roby proposes not doing that but instead changing them to the constants they represent
18:53 < bridge_> <kebscs> no, team_red is 0
18:54 < bridge_> <kebscs> ```
18:54 < bridge_> <kebscs> enum

18:59 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @robyt3 is it possible live demos dont have the markers in them?
19:00 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yeah, they can't because markers are only written when the demo is closed
19:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> oh
19:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> @kebscs roby is then just suggesting use the contants
19:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> why did u change it from 1 to 0?
19:01 < ChillerDragon> hm sad i see
19:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> it might fuck up ddnet-insta
19:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> set_team does nothing in ddrace i think
19:02 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> same with any non team gamemode
19:02 < bridge_> <kebscs> explained in the comment
19:02 < bridge_> <kebscs> -1 = spectator 0 = game
19:02 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> oh new comments
19:02 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> oh comments i just didnt read
19:02 < bridge_> <kebscs> ddnet-insta can edit the function in a fork
19:02 < bridge_> <kebscs> for ddnet only 0 and 1 makes sense
19:02 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> > I don't know if TEAM_RED makes sense here, if that is for ddrace that doesn't use vanilla teams.
19:02 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> > The function only takes -1 for spectators and 0 for game, doesn't differentiate between teams
19:02 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> theres no point in... breaking it htough
19:02 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> 🥺
19:03 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> getting from ddrace to ddrace with teams is pretty easy
19:03 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i think (@chillerdragon)
19:05 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> the server code has remained pretty stuck in time due to not wanting to change physics
19:07 < bridge_> <kebscs> i guess i could change GetTeamName logic to follow ClampTeam
19:07 < bridge_> <kebscs> less than 0 = sectator, else game
19:07 < bridge_> <kebscs> this wont break mods then
19:08 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> clamp team leaves room for extra teams
19:08 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> it would be epic if we could add team green
19:08 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> (mods could add team green)
19:08 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> no one plays vanilla anyway though
19:08 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> but imagine
19:09 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ~~clamp team leaves room for extra teams~~
19:09 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> why does this return 0
19:09 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> it was written by oy
19:10 < bridge_> <kebscs> clampteam?
19:10 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah
19:10 < bridge_> <kebscs> bcs its for ddrace and ddrace doesnt have teams
19:10 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> oy  contributed to ddnet?
19:10 < bridge_> <kebscs> idk but this only differentiates between spectator and game
19:10 < bridge_> <kebscs> for ddrace teams there are diff functionmsm
19:10 < bridge_> <kebscs> for ddrace teams there are diff functions
19:12 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/a72848e78032014adb1bf053c4556bf1072b0c2d
19:12 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> this is before ddrace
19:12 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
19:12 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> if(IsTeamplay())
19:12 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)>     return Team&1;
19:12 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
19:12 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ah this was removed
19:13 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> but yes do use clampteam then because it can be overriden
19:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> who touched hookline

19:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> why is this always broken xD
19:55 < bridge_> <Teero> cuz we have bad physics
19:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no
19:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> someone broke it
19:56 < bridge_> <Teero> so slow that doing them for visualization is ass
19:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it was broken once with the zoom change
19:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> now it's broken again
19:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @essigautomat
19:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you?
19:56 < bridge_> <pioooooo> :kek:
20:06 < bridge_> <manikoo> :justatest:
20:07 < bridge_> <kebscs> is that a hook tele?
20:07 < bridge_> <kebscs> exact same setup works for me
20:07 < bridge_> <kebscs> but without teles
20:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> No, normal tele
20:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> see screenshot 2
20:09 < bridge_> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1421921708209737758/image.png?ex=68dacb49&is=68d979c9&hm=4999c3a18108153a1de310189db7a3f2cc1cb60c40638b7c980dc0eebeead2b5&
20:09 < bridge_> <kebscs> works fine on nightly
20:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> you dont have same cursor position
20:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> try without the cheat
20:10 < bridge_> <pioooooo> your setup is different
20:10 < bridge_> <pioooooo> it's not 45 in the previous screenshot
20:10 < bridge_> <kebscs> ah alr
20:11 < bridge_> <kebscs> yea youre right
20:12 < bridge_> <kebscs> doesnt seem like zoom problem either
20:15 < bridge_> <kebscs> got a fix
20:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> n1
20:22 < bridge_> <kebscs> or maybe not, it fixes that edge but still not 100% accurate
21:00 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> @stepfunn
21:12 < bridge_> <kebscs> @jupeyy_keks do you have other setups to test the line?
21:12 < bridge_> <kebscs> that one works fine now
21:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> mh dunno, all kinds of edges where you dont stand next to the edge i guess.
21:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but nice thanks
21:14 < bridge_> <melon> has anyone tried [cosmic](https://system76.com/cosmic?srsltid=AfmBOoqzEPx9UzaWRrfXzd5Np-mWAONYkKQUnv8ItMsYLZrTuOKBGt6v) yet?
21:15 < bridge_> <melon> has anyone tried [cosmic](https://system76.com/cosmic?srsltid=AfmBOoqzEPx9UzaWRrfXzd5Np-mWAONYkKQUnv8ItMsYLZrTuOKBGt6v) yet?, i did a few months ago but it was pretty brittle, now that i'm on gentoo i want to give it a try again

21:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Sometimes the smallest bugs take the longest to debug
21:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i swear wayland causes me some fps drops sometimes
21:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** stutter game
21:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and new lowlight is that i can not drag some windows anymore
21:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> One of the effects I dislike in ddnet:
21:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the more fps you have the more consistent the gaps are
21:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1421946256913338400/image.png?ex=68dae226&is=68d990a6&hm=57d49004bf9525f99784d416ca871f00021850607746b85767595f004ee27c81&

21:46 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i wonder if gnome dropping X11 will increase wayland bugfix speed
21:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that is because they are only allowed to spawn after 50ms passed or smth
21:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** lel
21:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so less fps miss more opportunities
21:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** never noticed
21:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i guess i never played with high fps xd
21:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I honestly only noticed when i first implemented it in ddnet-rs
21:47 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** developa
21:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I'd like to somehow fix it, but not really ez
21:48 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yay new bugs for a cosmetic nobody notices except the one person who preferred the old way
21:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> today i saw it bcs i was debugging in /10 times speed again
21:48 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** sounds like a good idea
21:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then it's like super visisble
21:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then it's like super visible
21:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xdd
21:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> normally teero spots such things
21:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> guess he is getting old too
21:49 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** fr
21:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lost his hawk eyes
21:49 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** he must be 14 by now
21:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ikr
21:49 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** thats when you start to abbau
21:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
21:49 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** whats "abbau" in english?
21:49 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** decompose?
21:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> decline
21:49 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** right

22:01 < bridge_> <Teero> i have noticed this but i never cared, many of the effects are fps bound
22:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) i had "Sudden Death" displayed in ddnet-insta ddrace when i joined until death cant reproduce anymore not even w reconnect and the server is running since 98 days
22:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** do u think i should open an issue? xd
22:35 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> err
