00:05 <+bridge> <reitw> if you use cf there was an incident today
00:05 <+bridge> <reitw> some hours ago tho
00:05 <+bridge> <reitw> and since many services such as discord, maybe ddnet for https masters (idk), etc..
00:06 <+bridge> <reitw> they are behind cf, you could have been impacted aswell
00:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> perhaps. it was also happening yesterday
00:06 <+bridge> <reitw> idk about yesterday tho
00:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> and actually my DNS was working cuz i could go to e.g.  google.com and it would work
00:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> but not a lot of other sites
00:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> at least i am using opendns currently just cuz it has best latency to my home
00:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> (as opposed to cloudflare)
00:08 <+bridge> <reitw> there was just high latency
01:07 <+bridge> <zhn> wow perfect tech support
01:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea
01:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> rare
01:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> especially with ISP
01:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> when i think of bad tech support i think of xfinity
01:08 <+bridge> <zhn> i called TS once just to get my "restart your router" lovely boy
01:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah
01:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think they are trained to give u a shitty answer rather than say they don't know or get someone who does know
01:08 <+bridge> <zhn> oh don't think so
01:09 <+bridge> <zhn> same happened to tech retail for no reason
01:09 <+bridge> <zhn> you can't get any help from irl "consultants" as you could back in the days
01:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah
01:10 <+bridge> <zhn> ga
01:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> ga
01:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> well technically good evening now
01:14 <+bridge> <zhn> hm ye
01:14 <+bridge> <zhn> ge

06:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> morning friday rust
07:23 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Creating this screenshot was around 20 hours of work across 3 weeks :D
07:23 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1718947151.png
07:23 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Totally worth it
07:25 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> It is a proxy written in go which unpacks chat messages and changes the message to "capitalism." then packs it again and forwards it to the client.
07:25 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Its sets the correct chunk header sizes and reapplies huffman compression 
07:26 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Obviously only 0.7 is supported for now
08:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> hi chiller
08:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> Xhiller
08:37 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> elo
08:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> gores‚Ä¶
08:39 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont play
09:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller: legend xd
09:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> When the world needed him most, he was there to save us with epyc tools
12:26 <+bridge> <teero777> Translator proxy coming soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
12:26 <+bridge> <teero777> cool :D
13:17 <+bridge> <remakepower> seemed you were test on DDNet CHN
13:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yep
13:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> CHINA capitalism
13:18 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Here is the code if anyone needs some capitalism https://github.com/teeworlds-go/proxy
13:18 <+bridge> <remakepower> HMMmmmmmmm
13:19 <+bridge> <remakepower> Sooooooo
13:19 <+bridge> <melo∆û> so what - speak
13:19 <+bridge> <melo∆û> quick!
13:19 <+bridge> <melo∆û> im waitiiing
13:19 <+bridge> <melo∆û> !!!1111efl11
13:20 <+bridge> <remakepower> I can't find when i need to use this proxy
13:20 <+bridge> <remakepower> But that's
13:20 <+bridge> <remakepower> Truly give me a new way
13:20 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> To be fair the sample of replacing all chat messages with capitalism might not be the most useful for the gernal public
13:20 <+bridge> <remakepower> We can use proxy to translate 0.7 message to 0.6
13:20 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> But the technology has endless possibilities
13:21 <+bridge> <remakepower> Then we can move the message from the code
13:21 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes for example translation that does not depend on modifying the client
13:21 <+bridge> <melo∆û> hook it up to a translation API
13:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or it can be used as idle proxy on a vps
13:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> infinite timeout protection on any server even vanilla
13:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> allow client and pc reboots without loosing the current tee in game
13:22 <+bridge> <remakepower> But
13:23 <+bridge> <remakepower> I found the problem of use it to translation
13:23 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or 0.7 and 0.6 bridge
13:24 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> That could be hosted online for any server. Suddenly any server can be slapped behind a translation bridge and can accept any client.
13:24 <+bridge> <remakepower> The differences between 0.7 msssage and 0.6 message are so many
13:24 <+bridge> <remakepower> And also
13:24 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Or your local client could connect to any server
13:24 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @remakepower yep it is a lot of work but i have done it before
13:24 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i will probably not do it again im just saying a lot of fun stuff is possible with this poc
13:25 <+bridge> <remakepower> Ah

14:45 <+bridge> <learath2> This is an issue title I'd never expect
15:30 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> can you make a server for specifically bot clients?
15:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how about using LAN server
15:33 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> i want to make a fighting bot that beats other playsers
15:34 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> can you implement a function that downloads the speedrun of the top time and you can replay it on client?
15:38 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> it seems easy to do
15:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not super easy, but could be done.
15:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It also was discussed a few times already. One big contra argument was that it makes skipping parts less attractive.. e.g. for ppl that arent the best speedrunners
15:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> esp. if the skip isnt easy to find
15:44 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> i see
16:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/dd/
16:21 <+bridge> <ftayu> Help me appeal the ban
17:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 you currently plan no virtual joystick?
17:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If you hold a tablet with 2 hands, it would be hard to aim on the screen directly while also holding the tablet.. I think there is no real way around it
17:49 <+bridge> <robyt3> hmm, seems like we need at least an option for a virtual joystick to aim/hook
17:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> forgottencat also said that your fingers always block sight, which is too annoying
17:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so maybe it should even be default üòÑ
17:51 <+bridge> <robyt3> I don't want to make it too configurable though, at least not immediately. With enough effort it could be made so you can reconfigure the ingame controls by using the ingame controls
17:52 <+bridge> <robyt3> I don't know, feels pretty unintuitive to use a virtual joystick when you could use the touch screen like you would in any other game
17:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> > at least not immediately
17:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah i thought so. but in the end, especially for buttons it would maybe be nice to customly place buttons on the screen
17:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah dunno, i've not really seen an aim game in 2d on mobile yet
17:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> most platformers are more like mario, walk & jump
17:56 <+bridge> <robyt3> btw this adds zero lines of code specific to Android, touch input on other OS are theoretically also supported with this :justatest:
17:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i plan to use it with mouse
17:57 <+bridge> <robyt3> Should also work. I tried with BT keyboard, which worked, but I haven't tried a mouse on Android yet
17:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can use scrcpy
17:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice tool
17:58 <+bridge> <robyt3> Touch controls can also be disabled with a config variable on Android (or enabled on the other platforms)
17:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep sounds good for testing purposes üòÑ
17:59 <+bridge> <robyt3> > btw this adds zero lines of code specific to Android
17:59 <+bridge> <robyt3> (guess I lied, it's adding one line for that Android-macro)
18:00 <+bridge> <robyt3> If only it was possible to test touch events on Windows directly, but Microsoft basically dropped most support for touch input. The emulator is only included in an old version of VS that I don't want to install
18:01 <+bridge> <robyt3> The closest I got was using TeamViewer to emulate touch inputs, which either is broken in Windows or SDL :pepeW:
18:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you own a tablet with windows? üòÑ
18:01 <+bridge> <robyt3> no üòÑ
18:03 <+bridge> <robyt3> I also tried an old graphics tablet, but somehow Wacom broke the perfectly good drivers so now it's just a nice paperweight
18:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there even was a time where monitors had touch input
18:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but apparently it didnt really age well
18:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my brother still has one XD
