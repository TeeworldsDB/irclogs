00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> naively I would think so
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen can you show a `ulimit -a | grep open`?
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I wonder why so many files are stuck open :p
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ‚ùØ ulimit
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unlimited
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I bet I forgot an io_close
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why use grep
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ulimit -n
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does the same right
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't remember the flag
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it tells u it
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u do ulimit -a
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd

00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I now know this, I hadn't checked
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 1024
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I think the last commit should fix it
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though github is being a little bit of a goof right now
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ‚ùØ cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 9223372036854775807
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats this
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I pushed a commit on the branch and it didn't get added to the PR
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, works now
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I think that one is the absolute maximum
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like the filesystem just can't do any more üòÑ
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its a lot
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 what does fix do btw? just overwrite files?
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or move modified files to config_directory too?
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For now it will get the missing files and overwrite the others
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I couldn't figure out how to get to the `config_directory`
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just need to implement `CStorage::Store` and it'll move the modified and extra files to the config dir
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder why the kernel uses a signed integer for indexing the file handles
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Some argue that with unsigned ints there's a high risk of underflow, not sure if that's the reason in the kernel
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, signed integers overflow too, even worse they overflow in an undefined way in C and C++
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, but not so commonly. For example going through the array from the back and your condition is i >= 0 is an easy mistake with unsigned ints
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, yeah, I've seen that many times
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> array index in C/C++ is also signed int
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though curiously `std::vector<T>::size()` returns `size_type` which is unsigned.
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Great, somehow I can't comment on Github anymore üòÑ
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, adblocker is blocking the +
00:35 <+Learath2> :D
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Linuxbroke, sendhelp
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyone who values their lives should enable sysrq on their kernel
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Can you give me any hints? I'm trying to understand how chat messages working, so I can try to add roundrect background for each message for example
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Can you give me any hints? I'm trying to understand how chat messages are working, so I can try to add roundrect background for each message for example
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `src/game/client/components/chat.cpp` is where the chat messages are rendered
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are looking for the `OnRender` function
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I see the m_aLines[MAX_LINES] array, which is, I assume, getting some new messages somewhere (maybe I saw that part of code already, did not pay attention)
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> then creates text containers in `OnPrepareLines` and `OnRender`
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `OnMessage` is where the new messages are added to that array
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and seems like calling `TextRender()->RenderTextContainer()`
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and now I stop understanding what's going on
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In `OnRender` those prepared text containers are rendered
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You want to render your rect before that
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> yeah, nice hint
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> but anyway I'm trying to understand how text is exactly rendered, as far as I can go
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well good luck, 12 years working on this codebase and I still don't have all of text rendering down
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> also, seems like my visual studio's `find all references` function is not working properly for ddnet
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> sad
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `CTextRender::TextEx` is the function that renders the actual text
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> that's really bad, 'cause I used to use it a lot
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> for example, I want to know, if `chat.cpp` is the only one who uses `CTextRender::RenderTextContainer`
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well VSCode with the cmake tools has great "find all references". IDE 0 - Text Editor 1
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è it's not, nameplates are also rendered in TextContainers
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> idk what's wrong with my VS now, working perfectly in other projects
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> killmessages use them too, that's it iirc
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Oh, it was weird button over there
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The idea with a text container is that we use immediate mode ui, which means every shape is rendered every frame but text can get a little costly to render, so we render them once inside the container, then in future we just render the entire container
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/764261424943857664/unknown.png
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> works fine now
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> > The idea with a text container is that we use immediate mode ui, which means every shape is rendered every frame but text can get a little costly to render, so we render them once inside the container, then in future we just render the entire container
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @Learath2 that's the best practice for that
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and I got it already
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> But still can't understand what's going on in `RenderTextContainer`
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> An even more performant/gpu friendly way would be doing all of the ui in retained mode, but that's a massive rework that brings many issues with it that no one really wants to undertake
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well which part don't you get?
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Not sure why you're so worried about optimization in ddnet client
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> It's running pretty fast now
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not, I'm perfectly fine with the UI as is, @Jupstar ‚ú™ doesn't like immediate mode though
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> ```cpp

01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Try not to paste multiple lines here, it's linked to irc so you are kinda spamming there
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> ok, sorry
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, that looks to be a part of the selection and cursor support
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Pretty sure that I will drop the idea of trying to make something in ddnet code, but ideally I don't like the idea of storing lines instead of messages
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What do you mean? We do store the entire message in one "line"
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Even when it splits in 2?
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Line wrapping is applied later by the text renderer
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Ok, nice
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We give it the entire line, we give it the width of the box, it chops the text up
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fwiw the selection stuff doesn't look used yet, I wonder what it can do üôÇ
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Any other questions? I'll just head off to sleep
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Nothing. I remember seeing some useless code few years ago, when I tried to open ddnet code again
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Wondering if it was fixed now xD
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We try our best to clean up unused stuff, but it's like 1.5 decades of work, it's hard to clean the entire thing up and not miss something
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Do you know where is it wrapping lines of chat text?
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> nvm, found it

01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is it just to lessen TBAA effects?

02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> am I that bad in math or is it nonsense?
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> oh, ok, it's rounding
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 std::launder is indeed to stop TBAA from going overboard
02:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> ok, I have a question, 30 mins not found any answer for that
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> why does new line of chat message start with less offset
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> why does new line of chat message start with less x_offset
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which line?
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> second xD
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean in the code

02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (The first part where you might think it's getting rendered it L869 but if you don't set `TEXTFLAG_RENDER` on a cursor, it won't really render, it will just advance the cursor)
02:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> it's really dirty hacks going there

11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD | alloca„ÉÑ> It's useful if you want to separate allocation from initialization (placement new) on objects with const data (avoiding ill-formedness). So it's a low level feature (which should have been a languange feature instead of an STL feature)
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™ theorically its implementation-defined not ub :monkalaugh:
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is ub for me

11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen can you quickly look into find_binary, maybe i just dont understand it, but doesnt look like binary search xd
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or what is the sense of find_binary xd
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> binary data?
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ryozuki mhh yeah, looks like alot of false positives probably
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ never looked at that code, looks like it calls partition_linear by mistake and should be partition_binary
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but weird

11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it comes from here
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its just alot of polymorphism casts
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that it detects
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno if it has some option for old cast
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ubsan doesn't have false positives btw, everything it finds is an actual problem
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> &m_CmdBuffer.DataPtr returns a unsigned char

12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> looks wrong imo
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it clearly creates a cmenumap
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> even used `override` to not fall into the signature trap
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or is the vtable not available in constructors
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=81705
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are you sure?
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we use the clang version, not gcc. and also "no false positives assuming no bugs in ubsan"
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i still dont see a bug in that code
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i think the undefined behaviour is virtual functions
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> makes sense and good to know
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> about memory alignment
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in x86 it probs doiesnt matter too much
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but we could fix all xd
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> exactly, we should still fix them for other cpu archs
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but thats alot of work actually
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the whole command buffer just doesnt care about alignment
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what would you need to do to fix this?
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> align memory
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> alignof(ptr_type)
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is 8 on 64bit
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so always add paddings
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> to all commands
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well if we go even further
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> fix all floating point alignments
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> they make more trouble under arm
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `alignas(alignof(unsigned)) unsigned m_Cmd;` ?
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never used this
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gotta research
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not unsigned, that wont matter alot
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its the pointer itself
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we have alot of floating point errors @deen üòÑ
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i fixed alot somewhere
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah sad, i probs didnt save most fixes, but atleast one:
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/commit/adb5aabe725cc9f4fdce38f444b5f27d7235c2b3
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly most of these things are also in gamecore.cpp or .h
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i didnt want to touch them i think
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> this case i saved bcs the result is sent to the GPU
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but opengl has nan and inf, so not UB directly
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> find_binary is really find_binary
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it confused me for a while too
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> why
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> wait
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u mean find binary data?
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont really get how its binary search, i also switched it and still works xd
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah, you were talking about partition_binary and partition_linear
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its used in find_binary
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> partition_linear
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i changed it in
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3053
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and still works
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh find_binary was using partition_linear? üòÑ
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah üòÑ
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> troll function for sure
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @redix fixed it on vanilla a year ago, why wouldn't he share? traitor
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xDDD
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Only noticed that while fixing the snapshots ^^
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> welcome in the club
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Was a bit confused when I noticed that :D
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> welcome in the club
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen about the skin fix, we have todo it differently
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> else skins like blacktee are broken
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> too bad, can you change it?
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> inside ur pr?
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The downcast thing is because entities remove and insert themselves from the gameworld, which is just odd
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that wouldnt be ub would it?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it has to be constructed wrongly somehow
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Currently when RemoveEntity is called from `~CEntity` which happens after `~CCharacter`. At which point it is just a `CEntity` which is UB to cast to a `CCharacter` and call a method on
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah alight
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah alright
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> k, good morning. I'll continue asking stupid questions here if you don't mind
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> about text?
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> chat
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I managed to align some chat messages text yesterday and even draw roundrect background for each message, but it's too dirty
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> The first question is more about cpp I guess, 'cause seems like I suck in it.
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u doing it for ddnet make sure to use buffered rects xd
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <üñ§Smetanolubüíé> –∂–µ–Ω—è —É–≥–æ–º–æ–Ω–∏—Å—å
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <üñ§Smetanolubüíé> —à–æ —Ç—ã –ø–∏—à–µ—à—å
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I made a function for drawing chat message background in CTextRender class, which is stupud idea. I probably need a reference to CRenderTools here, but I didn't find the way to get it
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can request it form kernel probably, but do it rather in chat.cpp
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ i guess, or in your own, both are fine
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok then i'll do it xd
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (i just pushed again)
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> too late i guess xD
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that was my fear xD
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, sorry üòÑ
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> no way again in editor game crashed
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @texnonik did you do anything specific?
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also what version
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we had quite alot changes in the rc
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> newest
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 15.0.5, right?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> yes
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> i was copying a lot ideas from old map , saved as new  map , go load other map put the all copied ideas in other map and while i was deleting parts that i didn't need it freezed and then quit as always happened in old version ...
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> i tryed repeat it but it didn't crashed
16:37 <+ChillerDragonTL> what about generating automated crash reports in rlsd clients?
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> dbg symbols are quite huge
16:37 <+ChillerDragonTL> I guess even a non debug crash report can be more useful than none idk how exactly that should work without affecting performance
16:37 <+ChillerDragonTL> maybe not even slap a debugger on it
16:38 <+ChillerDragonTL> just track a few function calls and on crash store a backtrace
16:38 <+ChillerDragonTL> or are crashes too rare? I cant tell.
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well the best would be cutting the debug symbols after building so we can keep a client with symbols
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and then just stack trace with memory addresses
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, works fine with splitdwarf
16:39 <+ChillerDragonTL> but does that then require running it inside a debugger?
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think it just sets a hardware expection or smth
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the os knows that the client crashes too without any debugger üòÑ
16:40 <+ChillerDragonTL> i run most of my software w symbols and in debug mode and it works fine but i do not think we should ship something like thatr
16:40 <+ChillerDragonTL> but can the os generate a backtrace?
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont have too much details on that tbh, but i know that many games do this, and i doubt they trade performance for it
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its like with exceptions
16:42 <+ChillerDragonTL> might aswell optionally sent them back to ddnet automatically 
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it already be a huge win if its saved in some error log
16:43 <+ChillerDragonTL> yes
16:43 <+ChillerDragonTL> but i dont know if crashes are even a problem i cant remeber the last crash i had w ddnet
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well it always depends
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you just joining the server and play its most likely that u wont get any crash, bcs thats what the devs found most easily
16:44 <+ChillerDragonTL> on what
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but editor and stuff is harder for sure
16:44 <+ChillerDragonTL> i use the editor tho
16:44 <+ChillerDragonTL> and demos
16:44 <+ChillerDragonTL> and the console
16:45 <+ChillerDragonTL> and the remote console
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok xD, well we had crashes tho
16:45 <+ChillerDragonTL> so im just lucky for 5 yrs straight?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
16:46 <+ChillerDragonTL> lol nice
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> "is:issue is:open crash "
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ;D
16:46 <+ChillerDragonTL> i actually lost more progress on windows crashing than ddnet crashing
16:47 <+ChillerDragonTL> yikes 12 open 66 closed
16:47 <+ChillerDragonTL> the current reported one might be #1452
16:48 <+ChillerDragonTL> ddnet bot u here?
16:48 <+ChillerDragonTL> wait is it a discord exclusive feature
16:48 <+ChillerDragonTL> omg
16:48 <+ChillerDragonTL> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1452
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's really hard for us to generate any meaningful backtrace in our application after it crashed
16:56 <+ChillerDragonTL> hm why?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd guess the OSs have support for that
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> linux has coredumps, windows probably also has something like that
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the OS killed your application for a reason, at that point even if you catch the signal, there is no guarantee that anything makes sense
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You could have completely overwritten the stack e.g.
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, but that's how we usually debug ^^
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the debugger also just looks at the stack (that might have been overwritten already)
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well we get to run it a couple times, we get to try different tools, it's acceptable when the crash is happening on my machine
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On iOS and Android there are many solutions that monitor the call stack by sampling it, it does cost a bit, but you get real nice crash reports
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, interesting
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> got a name/link?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Is the server send plain text as system messages and not events?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> When will it start send events?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> When will it start sending events?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, I can't seem to remember where I saw it, must have been a talk on debugging but the guy had access to the call stack at 150hz for the last 5 seconds
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "many solutions" might have been exaggerating a bit, I'm not really sure how common it is actually
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I have an idea, how about stealing crashpad from chromium?
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that might work
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should be opt in though, might contain personal data
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We just capture it and ask the user if he wants to send it?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's opt-in in my view
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or maybe we capture it and just save it in a dir, so they can provide it with their report?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the first one would result in more people reporting though
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that would also work
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh, if you sign your application with a fancy expensive certificate, you can gain access to the error reports sent to microsoft
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Or you can use Crashpad
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> though it will require using google toolchain which is a bit too complex
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> where can I find code that renders this top right list ?
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/764514472911306752/unknown.png

17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/764515173821579314/SPOILER_message.txt
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> killmessages
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> what `Graphics()->MapScreen()` does?
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> translate map coordinates into screen coordinates
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (or the other way around, not sure)
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> what's the reason for ddnet work a lot worse with significant fps drop and freezes on connecting to server when playing right from the compiled version from source code? Is that something about preprocessors?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I guess something heavy is not compiled for the public version?
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> debug version?
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or what do u mean
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> yes
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs in debug versions, there are no optimizations and sometimes the compiler's libs have additional things that helps for debugging but slow the execution down
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I just worried if that's my code causes long freeze before joining the server
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well switch to releasewithdebuginfo/release and you'll know
19:31 <+ChillerDragon> @Soreu I finished replacing all textures with SVGs on https://zillywoods.github.io/ZillyWoods-web/ it scales so well on my 4k screen <3 The grass looks a little bit different maybe ill change it. Could you send a screen how it looks like on ur broken end now? :/
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I'd like to remind you that it is broken for me because of the code I wrote üòÖ
19:32 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon 144hz > 4k screen
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Soreu fix
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> will do
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> did u upload to ur database?
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ...someday :justatest:
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i want to have svg :D:D
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> He's replacing single tiles from grass_main
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> atleast smth üòÑ
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> because I did cut the mapres in pieces to use only the needed ones
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> keep it up chillerdragon, looks really good üòÑ
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://www.github.com/TeeworldsDB/images/tree/master/realistic%2Ftransparent
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah the single tiles, but i'll wait for the full mapres xd
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> there they are somehow
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I don't even understand how he pulled part of different repo into the website
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but I barely understand GitHub anyway xd
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> submodule magic i am a git wizard 
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> yes Jupstar ofc everythin in the repo and doodads are almost finished but keep in mind i wont produce tilesets from last decade but 0.7 standards :D
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: nah 60hz the screen is older than time it self and actually affordable xd
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait u did a compare 
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> ok fair guess it depends i have more hz but less pixels on my laptop and i prefer my 60hz big 4k screen 
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon what u mean with tilesets from last decade?
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> can 0.7 client set single tiles or what xd
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> teeworlds uses a new incompatible mapres format
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> to the one that ddnet uses
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf, how that
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> im all for backwards compability but sometimes u have to move forwards :)
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> how did u not know?
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but pls explain
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> since when?
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> 0.7 rls
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i used 0.7 tilesets
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> they work fine
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> well "work"
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> if u embedd them
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i honestly dunno what u mean
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> sec
19:52 <+ChillerDragon> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/master/datasrc/mapres/grass_main.png https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddnet/ddnet/master/data/mapres/grass_main.png
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its a normal png
19:52 <+ChillerDragon> if u place shadow in ddnet client and open it in vanilla client its gone
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> do u know what i mean?
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well that not a real problem, if we have svg with shadows, ddnet has shadows again
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> thats the thing
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its just missing in the png üòÑ
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> i wont make shadows :p
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or opposite
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> i will make 0.7 tiles
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but we dont need to name it grass_main
19:54 <+ChillerDragon> well ok fine
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we could call it grass_4k
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ;D
19:54 <+ChillerDragon> yes then sure no problemo
19:54 <+ChillerDragon> i thought more like replacing the standard tiles
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well we can build uppon your tileset üòÑ
19:55 <+ChillerDragon> ill pay a lawayer to craft me a 0.7+ license
19:55 <+ChillerDragon> xd
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> BSD license.. yes ;D

20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ohh
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> discord xd
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> why was the in-game chat emotes removed
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thought ingame
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs they are distracting and annoying xd
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it was funny
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we have tee emotes
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tee emotes best
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i miss ü§ñ in chat :(
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> they were so annoying
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> üá≥üá¥   üá∫
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aoe> suggestion: add more emotes like the once from twitch.tv to the discord group? like widepeepoHappy, Pogu , monkaW etc etc...? - https://betterttv.com/emotes/top
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> no they werent
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why werent they just made opt-in
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> after all the code was added to support them
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> just as easy to add a setting
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> because then u see the emote names instead of the emote :kek:
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ye so
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thats even more spam
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> even more annoying
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> ye the solution is to just add back emotes
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :antijao:  `:antijao:`
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> which is more annoying
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> the solution is to remove them
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but people can still use the version with emotes
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but they wont have new features
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and still can type `üòÑ` into the chat with any vr
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idc
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> F4 emotes in chat sux
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i still use ddnet 10
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why would they use it
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> to see emotes
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no one else sees emotes anyways
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so ur like talking with urself
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> same as using a custom skin that none else has
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> some ppl do it
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> KENZO LIE
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> (tbh i agree its totally useless feature lol)
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but using a custom u see all the time urself
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> custom tee*
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ye and u can see ur own emotes
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but no one talks with himself
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no one that‚Äôs mentally stable
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> im never used emoji version but im writing emote names ingame anyway
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> xd
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its like when people who dont have nitro say `:kek:` on discord
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :kek:
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> they cant see the emote but who cares xd
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> :feelsbadman:

20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> yes

20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> üá≥üá¥üá∫
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> norway u
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> example: 
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> `*** 'Konsti' called vote to kick 'jao' (lol)`
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> `*** 'jao' has left the game (You have been banned for 5 minutes (Banned by vote))`
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> `Konsti: :danAmazing:`
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> `nameless tee: :danAmazing:`
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Aor sax something if big troll
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> say*
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> whos aor
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> xddd
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Fucked up
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> :danAmazing:
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> to minimize spam on ddnet just add chat filter on server side
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its about emotes
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> F4
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> client side obivously
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> They would ban me from saying n word
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> people who dont want to see spam can choose to filter it out
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the default should b to allow all
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> same could apply for 18+ language i guess
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> nword= noby ofc
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> im about emoji spamming
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> noone really *spams* emojis
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> just says them someitmes xd
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> trolls can
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ppl spam emojis to me
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> trolls cna spam non emojis
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> trolls can
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> everyone has a different defn of 'spam'
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> trying to filter it serverside is
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think its literally impossible beyond simple ratelimiting
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh also ddnet should be less restrictive on the automute ratelimit
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> they should just let people setup their own chat filter in client
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and +1
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i always get automuted just cus i type fast
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> press return less often helps but
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> stop typing short messages
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> lmfao
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i cant not type short messages
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> typing long messages is boring
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i have the same problem because i type rly fast
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> even when i type long messages
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> ```@louis :nouis:```
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> or when i correct messages that i mistype
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it sometimes automutes me and i have to a: buse
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and unmute myself
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> a: buse
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i swear im not spamming tho
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if u send a short sentence every couple seconds like im doing rn
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it can mute u
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> just do like on noby server, u cant spam the same messages
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i would make a PR for ratelimit
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if they wanted it
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/764562845680795678/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_1.59.41_PM.png
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i use this instead of auto mute and i know u can just spam and change the last character but it still helps alot xd
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> itts just set to only let u say the same thing 3x/min
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but the limit and time could be anything
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> then you can add emotes :feelsamazingman:
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i mean
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> a 64/64 ddnet ddrace server might have higher standards of chat moderation than my smaller fng server .. xd
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ig spam protect should be or serverside only or clientside only
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and last one would be better
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think the only serverside spam protection should be simple rate limit
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> do you know clientside
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> eh, @Jupstar ‚ú™ can you help with that?
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> or you are grender boy
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> or you are render boy
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> maybe ryo knows
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Õç
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tldr?
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> add back emotes
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> client side spamprotection is useless
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> when the client is open source xd
21:23 <+ChillerDragon> chat spam is rare a problem tho
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> client side spam protection = add_foe
21:24 <+ChillerDragon> or do it like the browser console and show the amount of occurences using a number
21:25 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1602357875.png
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @Jupstar ‚ú™ why> its just :-: filter
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @Jupstar ‚ú™ why? its just :-: filter
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so u want a chat filter, mh, that might be unwated by some servers
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or do u want chat filter like removing bad words
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> > unwated by some servers
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> uhm why?
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mods*
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well its a forced limit
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so do u want a rate limit, or a chat filter?
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> im not sure rn
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> uh oh
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> maybe add new flag/netobj that will be sended to new ddnet users with rate limit count
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> or dk
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> add to exist
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> add to existing
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well u can always create an issue or pr, maybe someone will help you
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> hm, okey
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> okey
