11:55 <+luca> Gotta question... if I create a new Map in TW Editor, how to adjust the size of the white mapping box?
12:15 <+fstd> press A+B+Start+Select
12:31 <@deen> luca: the white box you see when "proof" is enabled?
12:32 <@deen> that's how far players will be able to see
12:32 <@deen> mouse wheel to scroll in or out
12:33 <+luca> No, I mean the one where you cant map outside
12:37 <@deen> ah
12:37 <@deen> right click on game layer, change width and height
12:38 <@deen> but keep it as small as possible. the map is stored in RAM uncompressed, so huge maps are a problem
12:49 <+luca> but i wanna do a huge map :D
12:49 <+luca> thanks deen
12:51 <@deen> 700x700 is already a huge map btw, see for example Neverwhere on DDNet Moderate
13:12 <+Marmare> Is there any documentation on the networking of teeworlds ?
13:24 <@deen> Marmare: hi. a bit in the source code
13:25 <@deen> for example engine/shared/network.h
