08:52 <+ChillerDragon> I am thinking about adding this alias to my debian machine ``alias yay='sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y'`` but im not sure 
08:52 <+ChillerDragon> or is it illegal to fake other packagemanagers? xd
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u are ilegal
09:02 <+ChillerDragon> oof
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://twitter.com/VennStone/status/1351637848424931331
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, I guess our staff page could be improved a bit. We actually have no contact information at all ðŸ˜„
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> lol wtf is it?
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i am here since too long but hm
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> @deen on the staff page there is a Getting In Touch section that is straight forward
10:51 <+ChillerDragon> or ask the first person in game and ull have your answer too
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ask the first person ingame, haha
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> aka 24/7 live customer support
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for customers by customers ðŸ˜„
10:55 <+ChillerDragon> yes thats what communitys and oss is all about
10:55 <+ChillerDragon> :D
10:55 <+ChillerDragon> you have to be really disconencted with the game to not know everybody here
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> most players have no idea who mods or admins are
10:56 <+ChillerDragon> assuming based on his "LinuxGameCast" name he probably is a somewhat external person maybe trying to do some linux related and not tw related things with ddnet
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> well sure there are a lot of people who do not know basic things but on every server you should find a player that plays 10+ yrs and can tell u a lot
11:01 <+ChillerDragon> btw @deen did you contact him or respond on twitter?
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't have Twitter. I contacted them, yes
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> ima insult him with a tweet
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> ah fuck i think my twitter acc is somewhat blocked
11:05 <@deen> Is it you, Donald?
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> lol
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> how did u even find the tweet?
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> omg my alt account is also not able to respond
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> auwhiduhawduhawuid
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Searched for DDraceNetwork
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> ok finally but it hides my response behind insult protection omg twitter is so fucked
11:28 <+ChillerDragon> on twitter?
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> did you also search on schÃ¼ler vz ?
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> what made you think today is a good day to search on twitter xd
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> omg i aged 5 years in the last 5 minutes working w twitter 
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> classic to get my twitter back they want a phone number twitter is as bad as discord 
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So what were they interested in? :)
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no response, no idea
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea tell us
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> curious
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ‘€
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYFs-KtH24I&t=773s
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they talked already bout ddnet
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hope they make a new vid
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> deen is maintainer of ddnet on github, there is his email, but ig it is a hard way to get contact xd
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> github doesnt say who is the main maintainer
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can just guess
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i wouldnt expect press ppl to know how to use github
14:35 <+ChillerDragon> github is easier than twitter
14:35 <+ChillerDragon> thanks for sharing their yt video
14:36 <+ChillerDragon> so informative so if one asks me what i play all day i will respond now "something like worms"
14:39 <+fstd> you should play some nethack
14:40 <+fstd> it's kinda something like worms too!
14:40 <+fstd> telnet nethack.alt.org
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol
14:56 <+ChillerDragon> i dont have telnet :/
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ssh also works
14:56 <+ChillerDragon> nice
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Works a little better even iirc
14:56 <+ChillerDragon> what user?
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nethack@alt.org
14:57 <+ChillerDragon> looks so complicated xd
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ?
14:57 <+ChillerDragon> im more the simple guy
14:57 <+ChillerDragon>  ssh sshtron.zachlatta.com
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ssh nethack@alt.org is more complicated than what you sent?
14:58 <+ChillerDragon> yes
14:58 <+ChillerDragon> im confused in althack
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are as weird as you are simple :P
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean the game itself is rather complicated but the ssh command is just a normal ssh command :P
14:59 <+ChillerDragon> i talk about the game obv
15:00 <+ChillerDragon> lol is it text adevnture so much to read
15:01 <+ChillerDragon> i cant escape it xd
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, it's an acquired taste to say the least.
15:35 <+fstd> it's not a text adventure
15:35 <+fstd> the genre was revolutionary for having something kinda like graphics
15:35 <+fstd> so instead of describing the environment to you, the game can show you
15:35 <+fstd> ChillerDragon: ^
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> im not convinced
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> maybe not my genre
16:59 <+fstd> your loss
17:02 <+fstd> it would probably be too hard anyway
17:03 <+fstd> that combined with permadeath can be quite frustrating
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> woah
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://crypto-anonymous-2021.medium.com/the-bit-short-inside-cryptos-doomsday-machine-f8dcf78a64d3
19:41 <+ChillerDragon> tl;dr
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> ok skimmed it a bit something about fake money tether scamming whole btc market
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> i slowley fear btc wont reach 500k any time soon
20:01 <+fstd> if it ever reaches 500k i'll be mad i spent tens of thousands of euros on my domain
20:07 <+ChillerDragon> u pay ur domain in btc?
20:09 <+fstd> yes
20:10 <+fstd> more like in miniscule fractions of BTC at the current rates though
20:11 <+fstd> which is helpful since i have "only" about $10k worth of BTC left.. which is ridiculous in its own right, but i digress
20:16 <+ChillerDragon> :D
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> well u spent btc at a lower price don't get crazy and think its lost money
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> also nice which domain provider supports btc payments?
20:18 <+fstd> yes, true
20:18 <+fstd> namecheap.com
20:19 <+fstd> turns out they also don't verify your identity
20:19 <+fstd> or at least they didn't use to when i signed up
20:19 <+ChillerDragon> is that legal for domains? o.O
20:20 <+fstd> and it further turns out that having a fake name in your WHOIS record due to having a namecheap domain is in turn enough to fool hetzner into trusting your name is real
20:20 <+fstd> at least after you complain a little
20:20 <+ChillerDragon> haha wtf
20:20 <+fstd> idk, who gives a shit
20:20 <+fstd> i mean who can do what exactly about it?
