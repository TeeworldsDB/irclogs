00:20 < bridge_> <teero777> hmm okay seems like that guy is hallucinating.
00:23 < bridge_> <totar> I don't think his claim is that outlandish he said it weird
00:23 < bridge_> <totar> old demos could contain references to teewars
00:24 < bridge_> <totar> but it's not a bug

01:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> what is fake
02:05 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> lmao
02:05 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> (@teero777)
02:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> ? C++? Install the c++ extension and a compiler and then do ctrl+shift+p and search for build
02:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> (@solayer)
02:13 < bridge_> <solayer> chillerdragon: thanks man
02:16 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Vague question which Codebase do you want to build?
02:16 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> (@solayer)
02:29 < bridge_> <solayer> chillerdragon: idk
09:45 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> him answering "no" to that feels weird
09:45 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> him/her/it answering "no" to that feels weird
09:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> chuckled at "it"

13:52 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> .
14:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> how about u try to google it, did u execute the query on the correct database/connection?
14:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what kind of help do you expect with so few information?
14:06 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> Is it even possible to execute a query to create a table in another database while being connected to ddnet's database?
14:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i guess depends on your permission level
14:10 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> I granted all the permissions of mysql to the user I use in the server config
14:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> maybe select the database first: Use mydb or smth
14:11 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> When I add USE mydb; to my query I get sql syntax error
14:12 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> When someone finishes the map I get this:
14:12 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> ```
14:12 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> sql: failed connecting to db: error executing query: 'unknown database mydb'
14:12 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> sql: save score done on write backup database, Success=0
14:12 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> mysql: connection established
14:12 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> sql: save score done on write database
14:12 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> sql: failed connecting to db: error executing query: 'unknown database mydb'
14:12 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> ```
14:12 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> and the second time someone finishes the map the server crashes
14:12 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> ```tried connecting while the connection is in use```
14:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and if u manually execute the queries it works?
14:21 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> The query I entered in the code works and the table gets created but I get this error anyways (when someone finishes)
14:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well dunno, maybe it tries the same SQL on a different driver (not mysql) e.g. in the backup db
14:35 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> I tried executing "USE ddnet;" in another call to PrepareAndExecuteStatement() after running my query to make sure it selects the ddnet database and I got this:
14:35 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> ```
14:35 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> sql: failed connecting to db: (prepare:stmt:1295): This command is not supported in the prepared statement protocol yet
14:35 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> ```
14:38 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> use database.table as statement instead of USE
14:44 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> I use that in the query I use to create the table in the other db

15:14 < bridge_> <QuiX> Hey! how do you rotate quads in the new client version? also im wondering why this got changed (like copying quads too with ctrl+c/v), was it doing some conflict with other things or? because was way better how it was before imo.
15:14 < bridge_> <AssassinTee> you select the quad and press r
15:15 < bridge_> <AssassinTee> you can also rotate multiple quads at once with this
15:16 < bridge_> <AssassinTee> I think it's not better (or worse), but needs some time to get used to
15:17 < bridge_> <QuiX> ooh okey i see, and yeah i guess its bcs got used to the old way xD cool thank you!

19:31 < bridge_> <teero777> dont try joining a server with this map multiple times... i bricked one of my gpus yesterday... 🥲
19:38 < bridge_> <teero777> im having an issue with huge maps like this one. you can load and edit them fine in the editor but playing them freezes and it feels like a memory leak to me since a 12000x 12000 map should not take over 32 gigs of ram.
19:38 < bridge_> <teero777> Edit: dont use this map.

21:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> cpu + motherboard recommendations?
22:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> i haven't really kept up with new parts
22:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> idk what's good
22:00 < bridge_> <murpi> Budget?
22:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> $500, maybe $600
22:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> buy cheap mb, good cpu
22:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> i don't want to spend all that though, there used to be some nice ryzen deals where you could get the motehr board & ryzen 5 apu for a good price. idk if there's anything like that for a ryzen 7/i7? not trying to mess with i5/ryzen 5 anymore
22:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> maybe
22:01 < bridge_> <murpi> amd ryzen 7 78003dx and any B650 board
22:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u need a igpu?
22:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> nope
22:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> i have gpu
22:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> how's it compare to the 7900X3D
22:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> i might be able to get away with it 😃
22:03 < bridge_> <murpi> worse, because 7900x3d comes with 2 ccd chip
22:03 < bridge_> <murpi> worse, because 7900x3d comes with 2 ccd chips
22:04 < bridge_> <murpi> the latency added by the second ccd was worse for performance than just restraining all traffic to one ccd
22:05 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Hi, is it normal I can't copy quads by selecting them all ?
22:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well it has more cores tho
22:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it doesnt need to use the cores
22:06 < bridge_> <murpi> yes, but you'd have to park them manually if you don't need them
22:06 < bridge_> <murpi> it's hella annoying
22:06 < bridge_> <marmare_314> very cool! now Im thinking if I should add this method to my PR for images with more than 3 * 255 colors
22:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i guess the OS is doing that
22:06 < bridge_> <murpi> it's not xd
22:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> also the 7900 clocks higher
22:06 < bridge_> <murpi> well in windows at least
22:07 < bridge_> <marmare_314> try ctrl + c / ctrl + v
22:07 < bridge_> <murpi> well on windows at least
22:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> realistically i'd first look for single thread perf
22:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> most real time applications will probably not use many cores
22:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and for non real time apps the latency might not matter too much
22:08 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Oh! I'm conflicted now, I like it because it's great but I hate it because it changes my habits
22:11 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Actually it's kind of annoying if you are using many quads
22:11 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Now it selects every single point and it can get messy if you have different quads stacks or crossing one another
22:13 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Before, you had to select 1 quad (its points) then select all the other quads (thanks to the center point)
22:13 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> And you couldn't be wrong
22:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> the core count is tempting
22:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 5600x is the best for price/perf
22:14 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Now it selects every single point and it can get messy if you have different quads stacked or crossing one another
22:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> seems like a good deal but not much better than my current one
22:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> money is everything
22:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> whats ur current
22:15 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Im not quite sure what you mean, you can still select just the center point to copy it
22:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if its 500 for mobo + cpu
22:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> i just remembered my slow ass ram is probably not going to be appreciated
22:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> shoot
22:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dude
22:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> tell ur current specs
22:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why u ask recs blind
22:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
22:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im annoyed
22:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh i thought u were asking how much money i had LOL
22:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> i was ???
22:17 < bridge_> <Voxel> you have a penny
22:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> i have an i5 9400f
22:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> and 16GB of 1666MHz
22:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lol
22:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> dookie ass ram
22:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and u said not much better
22:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 5600x rips ur cpu
22:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea maybe
22:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also that ram speed is trash
22:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeap
22:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the 5600x allows 3200mhz ram
22:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> i have 5500U in my laptop and it matches my desktop in cpu benchmark
22:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if u can then get 5800x
22:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its the one i have
22:19 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> @marmare_314 I mean if I want to edit 20 quads crossing 40 other quads. I would move their center (20 up and 40 down).
22:19 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Let's say I want to change my 20 quads' color. I'd create a new quad, pick its 4 corners, select the 20 quads and edit 1 corner to change them all at once.
22:19 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Now, it's not possible anymore. If I want to change my 20 quads and their points are mixed with other quads' points, it will also edit other quads too
22:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @mpft i have this mobo https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/B550-A-PRO
22:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its pretty good imho
22:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 2 M2 slots
22:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> is godsent
22:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and pcie 4
22:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh that's nice
22:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> + a 3080
22:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol
22:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i run baldurs gate at max capped at 144fps
22:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> i dont rly play games
22:21 < bridge_> <Voxel> i run ddnet
22:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> i want fast compile
22:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> then get 5800x
22:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i compile ddnet in 20-22s on release
22:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> plus i use gentoo
22:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its important to have a M2 too
22:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and ram
22:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> i have m.2
22:21 < bridge_> <Voxel> same but i also use windows
22:21 < bridge_> <Voxel> :gigachad:
22:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> thats not true
22:22 < bridge_> <Voxel> you dont know that
22:22 < bridge_> <marmare_314> I wasnt sure wether selecting the midpoint should also select all corner points. I decided against it because it looked cleaner this way. But that would make this easier right?
22:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i know u dont have a good cpu as me, and it compiles slower on windows
22:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> windows likes to firewall scan live
22:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its funnny
22:22 < bridge_> <Voxel> ill give specs when i get home
22:22 < bridge_> <Voxel> if i remember
22:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> he is using the forbidden compiler
22:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and u cant match the gentoo speed
22:22 < bridge_> <Voxel> or care
22:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> voxel what ide do u use
22:23 < bridge_> <Voxel> gentoo sucks tho
22:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> windows sucks
22:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/windows-users-when-theyre-forced-to-randomly-update-windows-users-windows-linux-linux-is-bad-gif-21815262
22:23 < bridge_> <louis> i recently went to windows 11
22:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> can u even make a tmpfs on windows
22:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> W
22:23 < bridge_> <Voxel> https://tenor.com/view/linux-kali-linux-arch-linux-arch-girl-gif-24642405
22:23 < bridge_> <louis> its not bad as people say
22:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> voxel what ide do u use
22:23 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> I would revert this change, it was good at it was, now it's more noob friendly but anti advanced designing
22:24 < bridge_> <Voxel> visual studio for compile and build
22:24 < bridge_> <Voxel> vscode for actual coding
22:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @mpft is compile especially important to you?
22:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> are you talking about 20 seconds from when you press the green button to when it starts
22:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> if so
22:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> moot
22:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> that's not a full recompile, that's only recompiling the needed .obj & linking
22:24 < bridge_> <Voxel> ill run proper tests when i get home
22:24 < bridge_> <Voxel> i just like fighting linux egos
22:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea
22:25 < bridge_> <louis> why can't it be keep the select as normal but ctrl+c to copy
22:25 < bridge_> <louis> instead of instantly copying
22:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i got my 3950x 16 core for like 250€ on ebay.. it's faster in compiling than any other deal u get here xd
22:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> no way
22:25 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> instant copy paste was great, the way the selection worked for points was great
22:25 < bridge_> <louis> im pretty sure ddnet is gonna compile faster on linux with equal specs
22:25 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> I would have never changed it
22:25 < bridge_> <louis> i don't understand the new behavior maybe
22:25 < bridge_> <Voxel> yeah because ddnet is a linux game
22:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> what
22:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> are you talkin about
22:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> on ebay u can check how expensive the last sold items were
22:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1140743242099478658/image.png
22:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> currently the price is pretty cheap xd
22:26 < bridge_> <marmare_314> if so it might be the only linux game out there
22:26 < bridge_> <Voxel> there are a ton
22:26 < bridge_> <Voxel> i just forgot most of them
22:27 < bridge_> <Voxel> i remember ubuntu store holding a TON
22:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> any cross platform program will compile faster on any sort of linux  than the alternatives, 9 times out of 10
22:27 < bridge_> <Voxel> one of which was a game where you draw shapes and get the ball to the finish line
22:27 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Why would that be worse though? It would allow you to edit all the quads without even moving them. I would say that is an improvement.
22:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its a fact u will lose
22:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and btw with 20 secs i mean a clean compile
22:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ill just run the test again, but using the linux prowess to tune just that compiling
22:29 < bridge_> <Voxel> not like i give a shit
22:29 < bridge_> <Voxel> you trying to convince me will be the funniest thing ever
22:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> to lower it even more
22:30 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Do you often use the editor (and make designs)?
22:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also the 20 sec is with mysql, vulkan, and etc enabled
22:30 < bridge_> <Voxel> snrrr mimimimimi
22:30 < bridge_> <Ewan> -Ofast
22:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @_voxeldoesart let's be honest, you were convinced when you started windows after your first linux use 😏
22:30 < bridge_> <Ewan> ddnet fast optimizations when
22:30 < bridge_> <louis> if i understand, this should already be possible if you just shift+mouse drag to select all?
22:30 < bridge_> <Ewan> i have 3 recs so far and they all seem like good options
22:30 < bridge_> <Voxel> my ubuntu laptop sucked ASSS!!!
22:30 < bridge_> <Ewan> hmm
22:30 < bridge_> <Voxel> steam CRASHED THE SYSTEM
22:30 < bridge_> <Ewan> what does that mean
22:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xDDD ubuntu is trash, bcs it comes with gnome
22:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> it hijacked the main frame
22:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> gnome is good
22:31 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> You do not need to move the quads to edit them?
22:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that is like the worst of all worlds in one product
22:31 < bridge_> <Voxel> #(
22:31 < bridge_> <Voxel> anyways back to work
22:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> gnome's badness already starts with it's name
22:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> almost as bad of a name as Windows
22:33 < bridge_> <marmare_314> If I understand correctly what @pipou_tw is saying is that if there are overlapping quads and you want to change the color on some of this is currently a bit inconvenient. Because you have to select all corners manually.
22:33 < bridge_> <Voxel> gentoo sounds like a fucking goofy alien name
22:33 < bridge_> <Voxel> arch sounds edgy
22:33 < bridge_> <louis> erm gentoo is a penguin species 🤓
22:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> @murpi do you really mean *any* b650 board
22:33 < bridge_> <marmare_314> I thought that was what you did before this change, move some up, move some down edit and move back
22:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> gentoo is for tryhards
22:33 < bridge_> <Voxel> ermm `thog dont caare`
22:34 < bridge_> <louis> was the appdata/Teeworlds directory changed
22:34 < bridge_> <louis> i cant find it
22:34 < bridge_> <louis> i only see DDNet folder now
22:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> afaik it's DDNet on installs where Teeworlds wasn't present
22:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> afaik it's DDNet on systems where Teeworlds wasn't present
22:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> also gentoo is a distribution
22:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Windows is a desktop environment
22:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u need to compare it to good stuff like K desktop environment
22:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or chillerdragon's favorite: openbox
22:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
22:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> really depends
22:35 < bridge_> <louis> can i still pop settings_ddnet.cfg in that folder
22:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> they're the same louis
22:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's just that, if you had Teeworlds, ddnet would keep it that way
22:36 < bridge_> <louis> my settings_ddnet isn't getting automatically updated though
22:36 < bridge_> <louis> in that folder
22:36 < bridge_> <Ewan> jup which mobo do u have? rly which chipset
22:36 < bridge_> <Ewan> and does it matter for that cpu
22:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> also gentoo is a distribution
22:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Windows is a desktop environment
22:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u need to compare it to good stuff like K desktop environment
22:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or chillerdragon's favorite: openbox (even tho that's more of a WM)
22:37 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> If you had too many quads, you'd only need to create an extra quad to edit them all (which is super easy and practical) and if you only had 1, you'd have to move it away and place it back. Right now, if multiple points are overlapping, it's still the same problem, you have to move the quad away and place it back so it's not solving anything.
22:37 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Moving a quad isn't really a problem anyway, if you use the grid you can place it back very easily
22:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> do you mean me with jup? xd
22:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> i don't see another jup here
22:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> 😃
22:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well i use jup as yes xdd
22:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> m
22:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i have overkill mb, but tbh it's not worth it
22:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> u have high end  chipset?
22:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://www.gigabyte.com/de/Motherboard/X570-AORUS-ELITE-rev-10#kf
22:38 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Also the instant copy paste was awesome
22:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> b chipsets are good enough really
22:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i once planned to buy water cooling
22:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but guess i'm too lazy to install the water stuff
22:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> ah
22:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and u have to refill it every year
22:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> i would only go as far as getting an aio
22:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> modern AIO also cought up
22:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> stock cooler good for now tbh
22:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> air is generally good enough anyway
22:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the more expensive ones are close to water too
22:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> water cooling is nice still to have a better control where the heat goes, but i generally don't see my hardware go above like 70°C anyway
22:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki u on 1080p?
22:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i only get 100 fps on average in BG3 at max on 2k screen, and refering to mangohud it's a CPU bottleneck. just surprised you get 144fps lol
22:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1140747925824213112/image.png
22:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 50% more perf would be too much xd
22:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah 1080 same fps.. and almost same GPU load lol
22:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> hmm
22:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> i heard some games are like that
22:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> they were too gpu-heavy the past few years so i guess they are trying to balance it more
22:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> but it just ends up being pretty crappy performance all around
22:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i generally have the feeling BG3 isnt the most optimized game xD
22:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> why does it need 3-4 cores at 100% lmao
22:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but its best game, i have 36h in 3 days now xDD
22:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> wow
22:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> u rly spend 50% of your time Gaming
22:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> incredible
22:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> more than 50% xd
22:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> maybe of your waking hours
22:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> 50% total
22:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> i can't judge though
22:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> i get into the games too
22:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye
22:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> do u have 4k ryo
22:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it still has almost 700k players... impressive for RPG game xd
22:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> is it mmo
22:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> or singleplayer
22:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no, i have 2 1080 144hz
22:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's single or coop
22:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> awesome
22:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> up to 4 players
22:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> 4k is awesome
22:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> it changed my outlook
22:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> and my impression of which DEs were good or not lol
22:50 < bridge_> <marmare_314> I think now I understand how you did it before. Do you also often use this to select only 3 or less corners on multiple quads?
22:50 < bridge_> <Ewan> i used to be the biggest xfce fan but after high dpi, gnome was the only one that behaved reasonably
22:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks do u use dlss
22:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> troll
22:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh
22:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i use dlss
22:50 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol
22:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> FSR
22:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but anyway.. my GPU is at 70%
22:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's basically idle
22:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> not even spinning
22:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> for this trash game
22:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
22:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i use dlss so my gpu has less load, but mainly cuz its summer and i want as less heat as possible
22:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but i think the game is cpu based
22:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u sure your gpu is using lots of energy at <70% ?
22:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> gpus are generally quite efficient, but the last 20% kills everything
22:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk
22:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its prob my cpu
22:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> as always
22:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
22:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well my gpu still uses quite lot of energy tho xd (~150W)
22:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but considering 150w are added for the last 30% perf
22:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that's still ok xd
22:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sad that the CPUs don't have a watt meter built in
22:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> damn jup $250 seems like a steal for your cpu
22:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> im finding early bids for just under that
22:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well i dunno, check for ended ones
22:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> they tell how espensive it is
22:56 < bridge_> <patiga> I run my gpu on 150W because otherwise my power supply dies xd
22:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh dude i found the deal
22:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1140750729150201919/image.png
22:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xD
22:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u have your 6900xt now too?
22:56 < bridge_> <patiga> yea ^^
22:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well scammers are always around xD
22:56 < bridge_> <patiga> I'm still not sure why though, according to my calculations it should have room for at least 250W
22:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> always buy with paypal or smth that secures you xD
22:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the PSU tells how muhc power the PCIe slots have
22:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the pcie cables
22:57 < bridge_> <patiga> would be fun, though Ravie is probably right in that it is usually better to reduce the amount of colors
22:58 < bridge_> <pipou_tw> Yes
22:59 < bridge_> <patiga> whats psu?
23:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> power supply
23:00 < ChillerDragon> @matodor is it like a bugged ad campain from your company? or is it mailicious phising emails some external party placed there? if the latter is the case then postfix is only curing symptoms your gotta figure out how someone got into your system.
23:00 < bridge_> <patiga> yea I'm quite sure they can provide enough
23:00 < bridge_> <patiga> but my system dies as soon as my gpu tries to draw more power :d
23:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> don't worry i'm not buying the $900 cpu
23:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> also that is sorta misleading. scammers will have u do paypal friends & family
23:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> just pay thru ebay
23:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> safe\
23:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> unlucky, sadly i have very bad experience with bad PSUs. so i cant recommend anything cheap here xd
23:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah cheap PSUs are a fire hazard
23:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i had 2 literally explode xD
23:01 < bridge_> <patiga> yeye, like you said though, the last watts are the least important, nearly all games bottleneck on my cpu afaik
23:02 < bridge_> <patiga> I think I can go up to ~200W safely, but I just don't wanna risk it ^^
23:02 < ChillerDragon> @solayer what kind of python bot do you need? A chat bot? This one just downloads maps but should be easily extendible to do other things too https://gitlab.com/teeworlds-network/twnet_parser/-/blob/master/examples/07/download_map/download_map.py?ref_type=heads
23:03 < ChillerDragon> https://gitlab.com/teeworlds-network/twnet_parser/-/blob/871f6bb4066f0940a591fa92146e59ff68448f8a/examples/07/download_map/download_map.py
23:03 < bridge_> <patiga> corectrl is a cool program btw for managing the cpu/gpu performance/limits, needs a little setup but works great
23:03 < ChillerDragon> permalink before heinrich wakes
23:03 < bridge_> <patiga> wait, I just skipped past this
23:03 < bridge_> <patiga> what
23:04 < bridge_> <patiga> how
23:04 < bridge_> <patiga> what did you do? xd
23:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i basically just used the computer
23:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i even had a bad be quit PSU once.. it sprayed sparks
23:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i even still have a video of it, bcs they support didnt believe me first xD
23:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1140753076765073568/VID_20190620_074349.mp4
23:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, but PSUs are what i'm unlucky with hardware wise
23:06 < bridge_> <patiga> where did you buy it from?
23:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and samsung monitors xD
23:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> from amazon or mindfactory
23:06 < bridge_> <patiga> that looks hella dangerous
23:06 < bridge_> <patiga> so first-hand? o.o damn
23:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yep. i got a new one, and it runs good since then
23:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that was 4 years ago
23:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well this stuff can happen
