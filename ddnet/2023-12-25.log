00:28 < bridge> <cyberfighter> -nah i was tempted to leave for a month now
00:43 < bridge> <louis> seemed like this discord server was not good for his mental health anyways
01:20 < bridge> <baby frog> hello
01:21 < bridge> <baby frog> can someone explain to me why why m_Fire is always incremented or decremented (+= / -=), instead of set directly?
01:21 < bridge> <baby frog> like why isn't it just a bool
01:22 < bridge> <baby frog> is firing or is not firing
01:39 < bridge> <-StormAx> alr does someone remember i asked about katana in 16.2.2?
01:39 < bridge> <-StormAx> i still cant find where is that was changed
01:45 < bridge> <furo321> Katana?
01:46 < bridge> <-StormAx> in old ver (before 16.2.2 ) the frozen tee was actually ninja with katana
02:14 < bridge> <furo321> Here, I guess <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5420/commits/51133dee2ee5c7b10ad77df80032a6b13ca426ad>. But if you wanted to get the original behaviour back, you would have to send an old client version like `16019` (which I don't recommend doing) and also removing this line in `src/game/client/components/players.cpp`
02:14 < bridge> <furo321> ```cpp
02:14 < bridge> <furo321> if(m_pClient->m_aClients[i].m_FreezeEnd != 0)
02:14 < bridge> <furo321>     aRenderInfo[i].m_TeeRenderFlags |= TEE_EFFECT_FROZEN | TEE_NO_WEAPON;
02:14 < bridge> <furo321> ```
06:44 < bridge> <baby frog> is it possible to log something to some console in the code?
06:44 < bridge> <baby frog> if so, how
06:44 < bridge> <baby frog> like say i just want to see the value of some variable, play the game, stuff happens and that triggers a console log
06:44 < bridge> <baby frog> then i can see if afterwards or even in-game or smth
06:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> You can do it with magic of coding ü™Ñ‚ú®
06:59 < bridge> <baby frog> yes but how :c
06:59 < bridge> <baby frog> i have it compiled and everything
06:59 < bridge> <baby frog> and can run
06:59 < bridge> <baby frog> just dont know where to start
06:59 < bridge> <baby frog> just dont know where to go
07:17 < bridge> <Ewan> you can run it with a debugger and set a breakpoint at the line of code you want to observe
07:17 < bridge> <Ewan> or you can log it with CConsole::Print
07:21 < bridge> <baby frog> how would i run it with debugger?
07:21 < bridge> <Ewan> what‚Äôs your setup
07:21 < bridge> <baby frog> right now i just build and go to ddnet/build/pack_DDNet-17.4.2-win64_zip and run ddnet.exe in there
07:22 < bridge> <Ewan> ok but what‚Äôs your setup tho
07:22 < bridge> <baby frog> visual studio 2022?
07:22 < bridge> <baby frog> what do you mean
07:22 < bridge> <baby frog> windows
07:25 < bridge> <baby frog> 10
07:33 < bridge> <Ewan> press the long button
07:33 < bridge> <Ewan> with the green arrow
07:34 < bridge> <baby frog> oh
07:34 < bridge> <baby frog> i did that before and it didnt work
07:34 < bridge> <baby frog> but now it does
07:34 < bridge> <baby frog> thanks
07:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
07:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> company's having christmas party
07:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> its quite boring
07:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
07:50 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
08:11 < bridge> <baby frog> question
08:11 < bridge> <baby frog> what if i joined a server with my build
08:11 < bridge> <baby frog> i dont want to try it in case i get banned ^^
08:11 < bridge> <baby frog> would it work? or would i not be able to connect... or would no one know
08:54 < bridge> <Ewan> it would work
09:08 < bridge> <baby frog> so i could make some hacks basically
09:08 < bridge> <baby frog> is there some anticheat? how would i get caught
09:12 < bridge> <learath2> There is server sided anticheat. Don't mess with it, it'll ban you
09:15 < bridge> <baby frog> ok. so i shouldnt join with a custom client then, regardless of whether theres hacks or not
09:15 < bridge> <Ewan> just don‚Äôt cheat tbh
09:15 < bridge> <Ewan> join with whatever client you want that isn‚Äôt a cheat client
09:15 < bridge> <baby frog> so how does the anticheat decide whether something is a cheat or not
09:17 < bridge> <Ewan> irrational player movement patterns and stuff, you should not have to care about it though since hopefully you won‚Äôt even come close to triggering it
09:17 < bridge> <Ewan> don‚Äôt automate or tamper with inputs in anyway that you can‚Äôt already do in ddnet
09:18 < bridge> <Ewan> that would be a cheat
09:19 < bridge> <baby frog> >tamper with inputs
09:19 < bridge> <baby frog> ah ok
09:19 < bridge> <baby frog> > tamper with inputs
09:19 < bridge> <baby frog> ah ok
09:54 < bridge> <louis> theres also some checksum thing i believe
09:55 < bridge> <louis> although idk how it works
10:42 < bridge> <baby frog> hm ok
10:43 < bridge> <baby frog> i have another question üôÇ does the client store the last g_Config.m_ClDummyJump or g_Config.m_ClDummyHook or g_Config.m_ClDummyFire?
10:43 < bridge> <baby frog> as in, if last tick it was set to 1, but now it is set to 0 kind of thing
10:44 < bridge> <baby frog> is there any way to access the value it was set to the last tick
10:52 < bridge> <louis> probably not but im sure it wouldnt be hard to implement
10:54 < bridge> <learath2> No, past values aren't stored
11:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Hehe the weekly new bot client dev joined the conversation
11:33 < bridge> <learath2> :pepeW:

14:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don‚Äôt get the meme
14:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ryo explain
15:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @SpeedTime
15:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Did the ping work?
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> they leaked today
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> gta 5 source
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> code
15:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> They also leaked gta6 trailer right
15:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Leak company
15:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Who leaked the code? I assume it wasn‚Äôt official. And is it easy to actually self compile and setup now?
15:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs huge isn‚Äôt it
16:49 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> are you guys using TakeDamage() to fly with jetpack ?
16:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> in tune zones
16:55 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1188872569684774912/Screenshot_35.png?ex=659c1adc&is=6589a5dc&hm=8f7d2b89d115f07dbdb605fcd3e8193a52437d09c47f6723cb347bdd489e7323&
16:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and if the player was not in the tone zone , Tune() function will take care of jetpack handling ? am i right ?
17:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> in tune zones ?
17:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i think I'm wrong
17:21 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i found my new favorite function :brownbear:   TakeDamage()
17:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> never mind
17:27 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i trigger something here every 3 second ?
17:27 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1188880626850463764/Screenshot_37.png?ex=659c225d&is=6589ad5d&hm=30e083fcdde82c3edefaa9f33d7fa2337f5eb7a065612a118fe117a5dcfaa872&

17:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> hello guyz, how can i make a tee hook another tee through a blocks placed on diagonal, its not a cheat client, just asking for a friend
17:29 < bridge> <kekomonter> if(Server()->Tick() % Server()->TickSpeed() * 3 == 0)
17:29 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what is the point, you are not able to use it on any server
17:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :clueless:
17:31 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what is the different between Server() and GameServer() ?
17:31 < bridge> <kekomonter> Server() - engine
17:31 < bridge> <kekomonter> GameServer() - all game logic
18:48 < bridge> <teero777> aim -> hook -> success
18:48 < bridge> <teero777> duh
18:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> can u gimme code which does it?
18:56 < bridge> <teero777> #include "game/client/superbotlogic.h"
18:56 < bridge> <teero777> 
18:56 < bridge> <teero777> void SUPERBOTLOGICCLASS::GO()
18:56 < bridge> <teero777> {
18:56 < bridge> <teero777>          Aim();
18:56 < bridge> <teero777>          Hook();
18:56 < bridge> <teero777>          Success();
18:56 < bridge> <teero777> }
18:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> thanks, works like a charm üëç
18:57 < bridge> <teero777> its that easy
18:57 < bridge> <teero777> np
18:57 < bridge> <teero777> ```cpp
18:57 < bridge> <teero777> #include "game/client/superbotlogic.h"
18:57 < bridge> <teero777> 
18:57 < bridge> <teero777> void SUPERBOTLOGICCLASS::GO()
18:57 < bridge> <teero777> {
18:57 < bridge> <teero777>     Aim();
18:57 < bridge> <teero777>     Hook();
18:57 < bridge> <teero777>     Success();
18:57 < bridge> <teero777> }

19:37 < bridge> <kekomonter> xd
19:39 < bridge> <Ewan> george michael
20:01 < bridge> <baby frog> is there a way to make the console follow again
20:01 < bridge> <baby frog> after being locked
20:02 < bridge> <furo321> scroll to the bottom.
20:02 < bridge> <baby frog> but what if many lines are being created too fast for my scroll xd
20:02 < bridge> <baby frog> i guess clear_local_console works, but wondering if theres a hotkey or something
20:03 < bridge> <furo321> Use `End` key and it will go to the bottom or you can use `PageDown` to go down a page.
20:07 < bridge> <baby frog> awesome thanks
