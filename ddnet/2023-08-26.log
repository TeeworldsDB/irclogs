00:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> OMG, it seems the whole time i didn't even have rust installed to begin with. how did cmake generation succeed?
00:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> does the cmake not check for rust?
00:11 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> im 99.8% sure it does lol
00:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> seen it
00:12 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> does that count as "check for"?

00:17 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> try manually adding it to PATH if not done already.. maybe? idk.. weird
00:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> what's that got to do with the path
00:19 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> sometimes stuff is weird
01:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> using const char* in all of these containers is going to be an incredible pain in the ass
01:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> you really think i shouldn't use std string?
01:30 < bridge_> <Ewan> do you mean this for use in other containers as well
01:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> i'm happy to replace freestanding std strings with char ptrs

01:59 < bridge_> <yagiz_74> Is there anyone who can help me?
02:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I also had this problem, but on linux
02:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> switching to opengl3.3 worked for me
02:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> unusual
02:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> i noticed that somehow, on my 2GB vram GT 1030, the game was able to load my plethora of skins on OpenGL 3 but not on Vulkan
02:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> does GL have some sort of automatic system memory backing for textures
02:04 < bridge_> <patiga> yes
02:04 < bridge_> <patiga> opengl manages the memory by itself
02:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> that's gotta be possible in vulkan right
02:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> you just have to do it yourself
07:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> What's your hardware
07:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Yes but swapping memory around can potentially be problematic
08:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> Jup how to make async skin and asset loading work good
08:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> Still stuck with the wait x ms on main thread approach
08:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Why do u wait. What's the context for waiting?
08:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> If I don't wait then it just goes again and the other thread misses its chance to do its work. This happens a bunch of times until eventually, the main thread's and other thread's window of having finished line up to where the other thread starts, and then it hogs the thread
08:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> By waiting I'm expanding this window so that the other thread can do what it needs to pretty much every time
08:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> but it's fickle because it will have to be a different amount of time depending on speeds of stuff that we can't predict. i want to avoid it entirely
08:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> make it smart
08:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> So your problem is that new tasks are given too late?
08:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> well, the other thread is responsible for loading the file from disk, decompressing the png, and preparing the CImageInfo. that CImageInfo is added to a fifo which is protected by a mutex, and the main thread takes the CImageInfo and slices it & uploads its texture to the GPU whenever it gets a chance
08:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Yep, and your problem is that the other thread blocks this mutex too often?
08:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> Yes
08:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> The other thread just works until its done, waiting only on the mutex. the main thread is obviously bound to the game refresh rate
08:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Sounds Like you want to introduce condition variables
08:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> like a semaphore or smth?
08:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> But the problem is not that you simply have two million tasks? Xd
08:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> It's more like a notifier
08:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> they are not running in parallel, there are 2 tasks running at once
08:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> main & other
08:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> 2 threads
08:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> im not using a thread pool or anything that would warrant one
08:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Notify as soon as I can continue work . It frees the mutex while waiting
08:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> In this case i meant the tasks scheduled for the file loading. Not threads^^
08:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> ohhh ya i was gonna try that, and then i discovered that i couldn't do it without inheriting my other thread stuff from IJob iirc??
08:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> but now i am using  a job
08:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> As in: the file thread is always busy
08:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah
08:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> maybe i could try and make the cimageinfo atomic as well
08:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> so it just reads whenever it needs to without waiting
08:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> That doesn't work
08:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> sad
08:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> not like std atomic <cimageinfo> lol
08:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> like fundamentally making the cimageinfo members lockfree
08:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> But that has other guarantees than a mutex
08:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Eg the timing could be off and lead to unexpected states on one thread
08:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> what like data tearing
08:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> i mean i suppose so
08:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> my laptop is about to die
08:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Where is your gamer pc, you bought
08:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> Home
08:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> i am not home
08:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> not been for a week
08:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> @robyt3 sorry for ping, i remember you telling me about a way to signal to the main thread using a job and I donâ€™t remember what it is

10:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> bro wtf is wrong with the gitlab search field for issues
10:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> who coded that shit lmao
10:03 < bridge_> <learath2> Smort
10:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> if you have the patience to sift through code subjected to the mangling that is compiler optimization
10:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> then all software is open source
10:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> all code is open source for the underlaying hardware ðŸ˜‚
10:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> trueâ€¦
10:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this reminded me i wanna master asm with nasm
10:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ill do that on work hours :gigachad:

10:21 < bridge_> <robyt3> The only built-in way to synchronize with a `IJob` is its `Status`. You would start a job and keep a shared_ptr to it somewhere you started it. Then you periodically check if the job is done and use the result in that case.
10:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> thinks that never happen
10:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> things that never happen

12:11 < bridge_> <marmare_314> can we maybe add something like https://github.com/arsenm/sanitizers-cmake to make it easier to use them?
12:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> if u use the vscode workspace it's easy to use them
12:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1144939628160360488/image.png
12:26 < bridge_> <marmare_314> I do, but these dont show up for me. Maybe I didnt install them correctly?
12:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> other/vscode/ddnet.code-workspace
12:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> ?
12:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> r u on windows?
12:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> on windows its probably harder to get them working
12:28 < bridge_> <marmare_314> oh sorry thought you meant something different, in that case i am not
12:28 < bridge_> <marmare_314> no im using linux
12:35 < bridge_> <marmare_314> got it working, thanks!
12:39 < ChillerDragon> for me the cmd from the readme for asan just works 
12:39 < ChillerDragon> what breaks for you?
12:43 < bridge_> <marmare_314> they probably work just fine, its just that I have no idea how to configure them with the cmake extension manually
12:50 < ChillerDragon> @Iza fyi i did release a new chillerbot-ux version

14:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> the screenshot itself is unedited xd
14:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> but maybe i told it smth before xd
14:12 < ChillerDragon> rigged
14:12 < ChillerDragon> jopsti full time prompt engineer
14:17 < ChillerDragon> woah i just noticed the emscripten section in the ddnet readme
14:17 < ChillerDragon> so it has smooth official support? To compile a web client that is fully functional? o.O is there some official instance?
14:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> it worked once havent tried lately
14:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> UDP support does not exists
14:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> so it's basically useless not working
14:21 < ChillerDragon> yea the udp thing i knew due to web. But the ddnet servers hhave websocket support dont they?
14:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> yes, but i guess 1. not enabled, 2. too bugy
14:22 < ChillerDragon> Also i saw some web clients that were functional just no file access so no mapping or demo viewing because of that.
14:22 < ChillerDragon> but all those were someones toy project
14:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> https://aliveclan.de/ddnettest/
14:22 < ChillerDragon> thats why im surprised to see it in offical ddnet readme
14:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> https://aliveclan.de/ddnettest/load_map.html
14:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> ^ watch demos
14:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> watch maps
14:22 < ChillerDragon> oh pog

14:23 < ChillerDragon> cring
14:23 < ChillerDragon> ye that one i know
14:23 < ChillerDragon> but no ddnet.org instance huh?
14:24 < ChillerDragon> this emscripten wrapper looks like it was made with scratch game maker by a 10yo
14:24 < ChillerDragon> watermark moment
14:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> xdd
14:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> there is nothing hosted by ddnet.org yes
14:25 < ChillerDragon> time to put it into an iframe and slap into a facebook ad. Make it connect to some server on load and buy 1mio impressions. Easy ddos.
14:26 < ChillerDragon> yea cool stuff jopsti
14:26 < ChillerDragon> when finish android client
14:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> it's finished xd
14:27 < ChillerDragon> sure xd
14:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> just plugin mouse and keyboard
14:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i tested it over scrcpy
14:27 < ChillerDragon> compiling is not finished bruv
14:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> works without problems xD
14:27 < ChillerDragon> bro u gotta honor the mlg china gamer
14:28 < ChillerDragon> who gamed more ddnet points in one year not paying attention in school than me tryharding over decades on bleeding edge hardware
14:28 < ChillerDragon> he also deserves a android dev team
14:28 < ChillerDragon> alone*
14:28 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> lol
14:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> yes
14:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> you should sponsor that dev team for him
14:29 < ChillerDragon> ._.
14:37 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> chiller transfering to mobile
15:03 < bridge_> <XWA> i am back
15:04 < bridge_> <bencie.> hey, was there a change regarding audio? i have a custom audio folder with some of the sounds  deleted on purpose, and ever since a few days ago, those sounds now came back as the default sounds, even tho they are not in my custom audio folder.
15:04 < bridge_> <bencie.> before this, those deleted sounds would not make a noise ingame
15:06 < bridge_> <robyt3> If the files exist in your default `data` folder then they will get loaded from there anyway
15:06 < bridge_> <robyt3> If you want to disable some sounds, keep the files there but entirely empty
15:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> TIL that x86 actually has a instruction named "syscall"
15:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i only knew int 80h
15:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > The syscall instruction is the primary trap instruction in 64-bit x86 systems. Earlier x86 programs performed system calls by triggering an interrupt with the int $0x80 instruction; the kernel would use iret to return from the interrupt.
15:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ohh
15:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> int 80h is used for 32bit i think
15:08 < bridge_> <bencie.> is this new tho?
15:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/syscall
15:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/sysenter
15:09 < bridge_> <bencie.> is this new tho? i havent changed anything and now i get the default sounds back
15:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > For a 32bit kernel, SYSENTER/SYSEXIT are the only compatible pair. For a 64bit kernel in Long mode only (not Long Compat mode), SYSCALL/SYSRET are the only compatible pair. For Intel 64bit, IA32_EFER.SCE must be set, or SYSCALL will result in a #UD exception. IA32_EFER is an MSR at 0xC0000080, and SCE (SYSCALL Enable) is its 0th bit.
15:10 < bridge_> <bencie.> renamed default data audio folder and its good now, thanks :)
15:11 < bridge_> <robyt3> It's not new, the storage system has always worked like this. I don't know why it just started happening now.
15:11 < bridge_> <robyt3> If you change the default `data` then it will eventually come back when you do a Steam update or use the ingame updater
15:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> nice u doin x86 reverse engineering now?
15:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im learning nasm
15:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> aka x86 xd
15:23 < ChillerDragon> cring even i knew syscall
15:24 < ChillerDragon> and int 80h
15:24 < ChillerDragon> used both in hello world xd

16:02 < ChillerDragon> metal / direct = opengl
16:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> chillerdragon is an important person in our community
16:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> with his blabber
16:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> jopsti this, ryo tell me that, heinrich is x correct, lerato how to do this in C
16:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> chiller in a nutshell
16:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> actually idk what chiller asks learath
16:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also: robyt drop 0.6
16:04 < ChillerDragon> xaxaxaax
16:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :trollet:
16:04 < ChillerDragon> average chiler value
16:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> robyte works on server browser
16:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i am scared
16:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> we promote closed servers soon
16:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> closed source
16:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but he improved 200% perf in text
16:05 < ChillerDragon> ryowo good chiler impression but i say robsti instead of robyt
16:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> RawByte
16:05 < ChillerDragon> robi
16:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> robyt next job interview: "i improved the perfomance by 200% and brought 0$ profits to ddnet, but jupstar  was happy"
16:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
16:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> tbf
16:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> chiller r u still on that java job?
16:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u must be a java pro now
16:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 90% of news i read about performance, dont really improve the absolute performance a lot
16:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 
16:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> they simply optimize smth that is already insanely fast
16:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> and optimizing that by 2000% is not really the thing that will be noticable to the end user
16:07 < ChillerDragon> ryo i do not code for a living
16:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> it's still nice
16:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> if u look at the feature individual
16:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this is true, and compilers already know how to squeeze  more with novel techniques, but the problem is those techniques are just research and dont take into account compile times
16:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> which increase drastically
16:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u dont chiller?
16:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i thought u did
16:07 < ChillerDragon> i had a javaish job for like half a year
16:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what u do now
16:08 < ChillerDragon> my code was so bad company went bankrupt
16:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u travel with ur laptop showing tw 0.7 to the world
16:08 < ChillerDragon> ye
16:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lmao
16:08 < ChillerDragon> i quit work to focus on 0.7
16:08 < ChillerDragon> jk
16:08 < ChillerDragon> i rather not disclose to much about my job
16:08 < ChillerDragon> since it can be used for finger printing my identiy
16:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but is it code related
16:09 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yeah, the atlas performance improvements mostly apply when new glyphs are rendered for the first time, so it would only be noticeable if new glyphs keep being spammed in chat or something like that. Though using `std::unordered_map` and a better hash function for glyph lookup was also a good improvement for rendering cached glyphs.
16:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or tech
16:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or ur a farmer now
16:09 < ChillerDragon> its tech related ye
16:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> top5 things that will never happen in teeworlds:
16:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 1. learath admitting c is shit
16:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 2. breaking backward compability
16:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 3. ddnet 2
16:09 < ChillerDragon> farmer xd
16:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 4. accounts
16:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 5. rust being replaced by smth better
16:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
16:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and i hear std::unordered_map itself is slow
16:10 < ChillerDragon> @konsti someone said accounts
16:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> compared to other impls
16:10 < ChillerDragon> jopsti i think lerato openly hates C
16:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @robyt3 we know all glyphs right? cant we use a perfect hash function too?
16:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function
16:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> @robyt3 what would be your opinion if a closed source mod is insanely successful.. much more than ddnet
16:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 
16:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> and ddnet advertised it bcs of new server browser xdd
16:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 
16:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> would you just accept it as progress
16:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> or would u be mad
16:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> or do u simply not care
16:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> xd so much not worth it
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks all for perf
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i follow ur religion
16:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i bet the hash functions for integers are already really good
16:12 < bridge_> <robyt3> The hash consist of (font face, font size, glyph), I guess it could fit perfectly somehow, but hashing the font face pointer isn't ideal
16:12 < bridge_> <flurcxyy> hello
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u make multiple hashmaps
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for each font face
16:12 < bridge_> <flurcxyy> how to join game?
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but its prob not worth it
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> well tbf, whenever i feel like i have a design flaw:
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> fixing it usually also resulted in more performance ðŸ˜„
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> it seems to correlate up to a certain point
16:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> true
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> same with minimizing code
16:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> good design leads to good perf usually
16:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> less code means better cache? or smth like that
16:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> install linux
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> apt install ddnet
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> DDNet
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> f1 -> connect ger.ddnet.org
16:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> where is new server browser idea
16:14 < bridge_> <robyt3> I wouldn't say it's much advertisement. DDNet community would still be the default selection. And all the communities get is an icon in the server list that says they are a bit more trustworthy than the rest.
16:14 < bridge_> <Voxel> once these things are broken updates will be so much fun
16:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i know
16:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i am team future
16:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> bro
16:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> it's your own issue xD
16:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5654
16:15 < bridge_> <Voxel> idk how to START with any of those
16:15 < bridge_> <Voxel> minus the logo
16:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5654#issuecomment-1612162585
16:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> deens proposal
16:15 < bridge_> <flurcxyy> ?
16:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i kinda dislike it tbh
16:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> dunno why
16:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think ddnet should take a clear stance, and only support free software mods, we can create a environment where open source mods are the norm, and closed source mods get a massive disadvantage, we shouldnt support a community that doesnt give back, it will lead to tw and ddnet itself to die, specially in the case a new mod network like ddnet erupts due to modding
16:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> can't explain logically
16:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> well i answered your question
16:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> teeworlds lasted this long thanks to free software
16:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> if that wasnt the right answer. do a better question
16:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and  the excuse kog gives to not be open source is stupid af
16:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its just that they dont want to admit
16:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> kog is user hostile
16:17 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> 2000% is a lie my fps didnt go from 120 to 2400
16:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i want to have my essential freedoms
16:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> have the four essential freedoms: (0) to run the program, (1) to study and change the program in source code form, (2) to redistribute exact copies, and (3) to distribute modified versions.
16:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> the truth is simple:
16:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> kog source code is probably a mess
16:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> and he ain't wanna maintain it xD
16:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> buy new hardware past human
16:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> he doesnt wanna open source it claiming "he doesnt want to accept contributions" but thats not a reason not to open source it
16:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i am from future and can ensure you. Buy new hardware
16:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u can open source it with a free software license AND not accept contributions
16:18 < bridge_> <flurcxyy> who you
16:18 < bridge_> <Voxel> says the white name
16:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> I am an AI trained to answer questions quickly
16:18 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> i started thinking about it since every other game runs at 10-20 fps
16:18 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> :troll:
16:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> How are you?
16:18 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> Hey buddy.
16:18 < bridge_> <flurcxyy> no
16:18 < bridge_> <Voxel> hi new person
16:18 < bridge_> <Voxel> :monkalaugh:
16:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks the problem though is that kog existing is appealing to deen and heinrich due to ddnet having such a big exposure in the ecosystem, but i think this is just accept a "lesser evil" to fix the problem
16:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and its bad
16:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> @flurcxyy for more questions use #questions 
16:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 
16:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> also make sure to explain in your question what you did on your own
16:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 
16:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> questions like "How can i join game" are not useful
16:19 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> kog is evil? i fucking knew it.
16:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> thanks for coming to my ted talk
16:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i have to ask: What did you try
16:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> or What is your exact problem
16:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> so pretty obvious annoying questions
16:19 < bridge_> <flurcxyy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1144999662512787617/image.png
16:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> "Play"
16:20 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> cikis to you as well
16:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> yeah i personally don't even care if KoG is advertised as trusted
16:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 
16:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> I just dunno why ddnet, which allows to host almost any open source mod
16:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> suddenly has to do "fair" server browsers
16:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> as if these closed source mods have done anything for us
16:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yeah
16:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Why doesn't Avo simply do account system
16:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 
16:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> the ideas are clear
16:21 < bridge_> <Voxel> ngl i made my thing open source because i suck at coding and cant do half the features i want to do
16:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i also wanna keep ddnet tab itself
16:21 < bridge_> <flurcxyy> and

18:33 < bridge_> <louis> no more pirating ?
18:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> thats impossible
18:33 < bridge_> <louis> well its an attempt at it i guess ðŸ˜¹
18:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @louis.place do note this is for big online social communities
18:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> like twitter
18:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> facebook
18:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in fact they list them
18:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its for webs with over 45M monthly users iirc
18:34 < bridge_> <louis> oh
18:34 < bridge_> <louis> they already have moderation teams though
18:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the important bit is actually the fight against adverts using personal info btw
18:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well for me
18:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
18:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37263322
18:37 < bridge_> <louis> ig
18:37 < bridge_> <louis> i think the children part is more important
18:37 < bridge_> <louis> personal info doesnt pertain only to advertising
18:38 < bridge_> <louis> i think the children part is more important in terms of advertising and content moderation*
20:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> btw, could you lobby for unique to open up their ranks database? I'd hate all that to be gone if they ever die
20:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @timakro can u?
20:02 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I actually don't like it that much ^^
20:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why
20:02 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> posting code as images is annoying :/
20:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> > Under the new rules, online platforms must implement ways to prevent and remove posts containing illegal goods, services, or content while simultaneously giving users the means to report this type of content.
20:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> this sounds like easier censorship to me
20:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> e.g. youtube-dl's homepage got removed IIRC
20:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dont only therse apply to the super big social media webs?Â¿
20:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> then you can't talk about youtube-dl on a super big social network anymore? sounds bad to me
20:38 < bridge_> <solayer> chillerdragon:
20:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> can i have a custom status
20:56 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yes, but either you only read it when the job is done or you need to synchronize access to it
21:49 < bridge_> <Voxel> Is there a version of `html.escape()` for python that handles file management? so nobody manages to mess up their computer by typing in weird command line arguements?
21:49 < bridge_> <Voxel> idk this might only be an issue for server stuff
21:50 < bridge_> <Voxel> Is there a version of `html.escape()` for python that handles file management (symbols like `/`, `?`, `:`, `!`)? so nobody manages to mess up their computer by typing in weird command line arguements?
21:50 < bridge_> <Voxel> Is there a version of `html.escape()` for python that handles file management (symbols like `/`, `?`, `<`, `>`)? so nobody manages to mess up their computer by typing in weird command line arguments?
21:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> how would those symbols screw up command line arguments
21:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> worst case the program doesn't understand and aborts
21:55 < bridge_> <Voxel> i dunno im still learning
21:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> you shouldn't have to worry about all that. as long as you sanitize your inputs
21:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> probably worst case the program doesn't understand and aborts
21:56 < bridge_> <Voxel> and how do i do that
21:57 < bridge_> <Voxel> that was the exact thing i was asking, how do i sanitize my inputs
21:57 < bridge_> <Voxel> i tried googling but all that came up was `html.escape()`
22:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh i see
22:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> im not a python idk
22:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> i would probably end up writing my own fn which strips a string of bad characters
22:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> but it would definitely not be enough to prevent from bugs and potential security issues in a high traffic environment
23:15 < bridge_> <headshotnoby> you're a human
23:15 < bridge_> <headshotnoby> :troll:
23:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea
23:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> anyone gotten a MSVC build of DDNet to work with Vulkan? CMake seems to not be finding the Vulkan SDK by default (`-DSPIRV_OPTIMIZER_PROGRAM:FILEPATH=SPIRV_OPTIMIZER_PROGRAM-NOTFOUND`, `-DGLSLANG_VALIDATOR_PROGRAM:FILEPATH=GLSLANG_VALIDATOR_PROGRAM-NOTFOUND`)
23:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> so the game will compile but can't run because there are no shader tools
23:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh nvm it's included in ddnet-libs lol
23:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> that's crazy
23:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> i have 3 and it finds none

23:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh but the spirv optimizer isn't included in ddnet libs
23:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> this is probably a me issue
23:58 < bridge_> <deen> Hm, you're right, we don't ship the spirt-opt.exe, but require the vulkan sdk
23:58 < bridge_> <deen> I don't know how to add paths for MSVC
