05:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @Ryozuki  i mean i posted this pic about you months ago
10:30 <+ChillerDragon> ah thats where i know it from
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah i dont remember
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ChillerDragon:
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> go wire
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> What was the command to stop ignore clantag on friendlist?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Ok got it
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> does someone know how the internet works? :D i have a 10mbit connection and i wonder if i should upgrade. I do not mind waiting a bit longer on a git clone i just care about smooth tw expirience but I assume that is unrelated to the bandwith. Is that correct?
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah 10mbit should be enough
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cable internet has disadvantages
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> DSL and fiber are probs more stable ping jitter wise
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tho in the end it can also be related to the nodes the packet go through
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> yea i thought so thanks
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> still do not know the difference between cable DSL and fiber should probably look it up thought its all the same
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is ur upload also 10mb
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fiber has insanely way lower latency and allows for bigger speeds
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> DSL is copper
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fiber runs through light
18:02 <+fstd> why would fiber have lower latency
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> copper is just as fast
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> my upload is 1
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe even a bit faster
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wat
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also, most DSL connections end in a fiber spreader anyway
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chiller ur upload speed is the bottleneck
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its only from the next thing in ur street to ur house
18:03 <+fstd> the issue with "cable" is that it's usually a shared segment btw
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 1mbit should be enough tho
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> i need more than 1mbit to send tw packets?
18:03 <+fstd> so you're not 'alone' on your link
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki the main reason why fiber is "better" is efficiency
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe if u only used tw in ur whole internet and dont have any other app
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> i currently have a few lag spikes but those to not get better or worse when i for example watch a yt video
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1mb may be engough
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i doubt
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i experienced 10mb adsl with 0.5mb upload speed
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well i assumed no other apps ofc
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it was horrible
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> switch to fiber asap
18:05 <+fstd> ChillerDragon: how many machines are on your network?
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fiber probs has better routing too
18:05 <+fstd> including wifi clients
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since its newer installation
18:05 <+ChillerDragon> my test laptop and i also connected my phone to watch videos and stresstest
18:05 <+ChillerDragon> thats it
18:05 <+fstd> fiber always needs to be converted to electricity and then back in order to do anything with it routing-wise
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> i should have fiber i think
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> its not that i can choose
18:06 <+fstd> those conversions aren't instantaneous
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most internet websites allow u to put a address
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to check
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> the only thing i could do is pay more and get more up and down bandwith
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here actually fiber is cheaper than dsl
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> fiber doesn't run at full speed of light
18:06 <+fstd> ChillerDragon: no roomies or girlfriends or hidden machines pulling windows updates etc at all?
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> no
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> empty flat with a router and a laptop
18:07 <+fstd> and does it happen with any tw server (of about equal ping)?
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> also ouch for pointing out that im single
18:07 <+fstd> hey i left open the possibility of a boyfriend
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> fiber goes at around 70-80% of speed of light, depends of the fiber type, the quality of the cable etc..
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Issue with adsl is copper corrosion
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well the light refracts inside the cable so its not straight
18:08 <+fstd> fiber goes at the speed of light in fiber
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Ryozuki monomode goes straight in theory
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i guess
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The latency actually is mostly the same in most european cities as the cabinets themselves are usually connected with fiber already. Only the last run is on copper
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know much
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i jsut did 10 min research
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> fstd no
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it has a % of speed, not at full speed of light
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when i had adsl i didnt have 1ms when doing the speedtest
18:09 <+fstd> ReiTW: do by 'full speed of light' you mean the speed of light in fiber or the speed of light in a vacuum?
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> in fiber
18:10 <+fstd> what causes the extra delay then?
18:10 <+ChillerDragon> yea not very pleasing to test on this device fstd
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well thats an oxymoron, by definition light goes 100% the speed of light in fiber in fiber
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well you understood me, it doesn't go at full speed of light because of the refraction index
18:10 <+fstd> maybe it's because light go straight but cable go ~~~
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cable go brrr
18:11 <+fstd> that too
18:11 <+fstd> especially with construction equipment involved
18:11 <+ChillerDragon> yea i guess i will not upgrade if this should/could work and try to save some monthly coin
18:12 <+fstd> ReiTW: actually i didn't understand you
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is fiber actually more costly to u chiller?
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here is not the case
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Iâ€™d pay alot to upgrade from 50m copper to fiber
18:12 <+fstd> ReiTW: you acknowledge that there is a difference between c_0 and c_fiber
18:12 <+ChillerDragon> idk about the fiber thingy
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki in germany fiber is like non existent xD
18:12 <+ChillerDragon> i do not think i can choose that
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:12 <+fstd> (whch is due to its refractive index)
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in spain actually its everywhere
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the only good thing
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> fstd: sure, that's what I say
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Torino has 90% fiber coverage nowadays, my building is in the unlucky 10% that only gets fibre to the cabinet
18:13 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki the only thing i can change is buy more bandwith
18:13 <+fstd> ReiTW: then you should notice that you're applying the refractive index twice
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Full ftth or with copper/twisted pair for the last stretch?
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 u could create a house anywhere outside germany and still get fiber before me
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i bet
18:14 <+fstd> ReiTW: you should probably forget the notion of a "full speed of light", that's counterproductive and misleading
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/811646833600233472/unknown.png
18:14 <+fstd> there's just "the speed of light in $medium"
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki i'm more jealous about ur upload xD
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well not rly lol fstd, you only take the value of the speed of light in a vacuum and divide it by the refraction index of the material
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd love to have (almost) symmetrical down/up
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its usually simmetrical
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Yeah, and at the end the result is: it doesn't go at th e same speed, sure it's not the same environment
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fstd: technically we could do full speed of light communication in space between satellites ðŸ˜„
18:15 <+fstd> ReiTW: so that way we arrive at c_fiber, right?
18:15 <+fstd> now you're saying the speed of light in fiber is slower than c_fiber.
18:16 <+fstd> find the flaw
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I'm only saying that speed of light depends of the refraction index xdd, what's difficult to understand, I'm studying networking and telecommunication at school
18:16 <+fstd> bbl
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (c_fiber already accounts for the refractive index)
18:17 <+fstd> ReiTW: then we're not in disagreement
18:17  * ChillerDragon yo btw fstd u can ping discord ppl by prefixing the name with q
18:17 <+fstd> (you did say something different though)
18:17  * ChillerDragon @ *
18:17 <+fstd> q@*ChillerDragon ty
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (So saying light travels slower than c_fiber in fiber due to the refractive index of the material is an oxymoron)
18:17 <+ChillerDragon> no q :D 
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I mentionned the refraction index btw, so I didn't say smth different
18:17 <+ChillerDragon> thats was typo :D
18:18 <+ChillerDragon> ong troll
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> fiber travels at the light of speed.
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wait thatâ€™s illegal
18:18 <+ChillerDragon> do you guys know how i can find out of i have fiber?
18:18 <+fstd> ReiTW: maybe re-read the conversation then.  anyway if you're studying telecommunications, it's even more important that you don't use terminology like "the full speed of light"
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> im pretty sure i have it but idk
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> try to cut your cable
18:19 <+fstd> ChillerDragon: look at your wall socket?
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 4head
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Chiller ask your provider. 10M is very well within the capabilities of copper even copper all the way from the dslam
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> its 3 long holes
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chiller most internet websites allow u to search ur address
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ChillerDragon do u know ur modem?
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and check
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> modem is in my router right? its some fritzbox
18:20 <+fstd> ChillerDragon:  usually it's either a normal-ass telephone connctor, or something that resembles a network cable plug
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then just login it
18:20 <+fstd> 3 long holes sounds..weird
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> no network cable
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> fstd: well it's still usable, i'm always bad to explain, if I use it it's to mention the speed of light in vacuum
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> im in jupstar :D
18:21 <+ChillerDragon> it says DSL
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
18:21 <+fstd> ReiTW: let's call it c0, that's shorter anyway
18:21 <+fstd> bbl
18:21  * fstd got a CNC mill to build
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yeah c0 is fine too
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it says dsl itâ€™s at the very least not FTTH
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what does bbl mean
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So atleast the last stretch is copper which limits you to about 100 mbit depending on how close the cabinet is, the condition of the copper and whether the cabinet itself is connected with fiber
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe a rat ate urcopper
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :justatest:
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> haha
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> corrosion plays with the quality of the link
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> for adsl etc..
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does fiber degrade over time?
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i get 225 / 45 with DSL, and probs never will get more xd
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well everything degrades at some rate
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ofc
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i mean in a way that matters
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With fiber it should be completely negligible though
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> plastic degrades, but it takes millions
18:24 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1613582684.png thats  the thing fstd :D
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast in your lifetime ;P
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Well with fiber you have more problems when it's about a site under construction, someone digging & cutting a cable
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah splicing together fibre optic connections is not easy
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or if a rat eats ur cable
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but if it's well done there's some things used to tell that if they dig more there's cables below
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Don't really remember what are those, I think it's some sort of grids
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i bet in spain they dont do that
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> they just put it 30cm in the ground
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Already happened here that a cable got cut here at my job
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> at mine too
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here not
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and they did construction not long ago
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> catalonia grade cable best
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or some idiot bends it 90 degrees
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We lost the chile server for such a long time when they severed a fibre
18:28 <+fstd> ChillerDragon: that's a normal-ass telephone socket, aka TAE (Telefonanschlusseinheit)
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think at one time the entirety of south america had major internet outages when they severed a major link to america during construction
18:28 <+fstd> (which doesn't mean they still run analog telephony on it)
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lmao
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They phased it out in north italy mostly. Phones are also thru some new digital thing, never looked into it tho
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Who even uses a home phone anymore
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> everyone who has a business
18:30 <+fstd> yeah the largest carrier in germany has too (not sure about others)
18:31 <+fstd> no more DSL splitter required
18:31 <+fstd> and with VDSL2 and vectoring you get north of 200 Mbit/s
18:31 <+fstd> i think supervectoring is the new hip thing in the DSL world
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> north?
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to be very lucky to be close enough to get anywhere close to that usually, no?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk why but southern italy seems to still rock analog telephony
18:32 <+fstd> yeah true, i think the max speed is only over 100m or so
18:32 <+fstd> let's check
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> hey dev i have error with compile like that how fixed it xD?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> https://prnt.sc/zvnn6s
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i do get 225 with supervectoring
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i can also look up the length wait
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> maybe they dont want to invest
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> fstd: well normally the distance depends of the frequency used
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wow 225m jeez
18:32 <+fstd> Learath2: Huawai sez 300 Mbit/s within 300m
18:33 <+ChillerDragon> so could it be fiber fstd ?
18:33 <+fstd> ReiTW: DSL modems typically evaluate the line, called training
18:33 <+fstd> ChillerDragon: no
18:33 <+fstd> well
18:33 <+fstd> not from your home anyway
18:33 <+ChillerDragon> oh scam i think i was told its fiber
18:33 <+fstd> probably fiber starting from the box at the street
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 300m is much better than I expected, they really got nice improvements
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> xd
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Squeezing the last bit of performance from the ancient lines
18:33 <+fstd> but it's not like copper is bad
18:34 <+fstd> or fiber necessarily FaStEr BeCoZ LiGhT fAsT
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ¥´
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well it says 269 meters, but dunno if thats correct xd
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/811651778071887882/unknown.png
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Queen Julia 5th you forgot to implement a function you declared in the class CServer
18:34 <+fstd> the signals through copper are about the same speed, maybe evena bit faster
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah yes german text
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Queen Julia 5th> should i do it in src/engine/server.h?
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fstd: yeah the issue with copper is that the lines are ancient and you might aswell lay fiber if you bother digging it out
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And you can do far north of 300Mbit on a single fibre
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how can u get so much
18:35 <+fstd> idk probably too expensive, i mean you'd have to rewire every house
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> on dsl
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Queen Julia 5th well idk where you declared it
18:36 <+fstd> and terminate, install equipment maybe
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently supervectoring, I didnâ€™t know it was that good either
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in my city they do that
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in 10 years u need it anyways
18:36  * fstd gets about 80 Mbit/s over normal-vectoring VDSL
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tbh its just telekoms approach to get the last bit of money out of DSL xd
18:36 <+fstd> 90 if i allow for more errors
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and they dont get money for old cables
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fstd: turkey started rewiring all the way into the apartment in 2015, but they slowed it waaaaaay down when the turkish economy went to shit
18:37 <+fstd> shame
18:38 <+fstd> my street actuallygot some fiber runs last year
18:38 <+fstd> but they didn't do the houses
18:38 <+fstd> i guess you could pay it out of your own pocket if you really want teh gigabits
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> In france fiber is still in deployment, just people in countryside doesn't have the luck for now
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> But some countries decided to deploy 5G in countryside first to get more clients
18:38 <+fstd> but well, i only max out my connection when torrenting anyway, and i don't torrent that much
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> here they did do it in the house for 200â‚¬ or so
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> instead of 20k
18:38 <+fstd> and 80 Mbit/s seems plenty
18:39 <+fstd> knowing what 33.6 kbit/s felt like, even more so
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I asked in turkey they quoted me around 9kâ‚¬ for a fiber run right now
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wow thats cheap. i looked it up, and it costs around 10k, if i could convince my neighbours its like 1k per neighbour or smth xd
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> y
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The other solution is to petition all the neighbours, collect signatures and you get free fiber, within 10 years...
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and u have to make a deal for 2 years
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> after that u can change isp
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but they did it in every street thats why it was so cheap
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao at 200â‚¬ Iâ€™d guess the fiber is already in your street so you need a shorter run
18:41  * fstd 'd like to be an ISP himself
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nope
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> they had to do the entire village
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh or maybe government funds some of it, that could also work, oooor huge demand maybe could cover the cost
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> both
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The problem running anything underground is itâ€™s major disruption, so no one really wants to do it unless $$$ ;P
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and a lot competition here
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 4 isps doing it
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in some streets they put 2 different cables from 2 isps
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because the first 2 years the isps have exlusive use for the cable
18:43 <+fstd> Learath2: there's actually a nice rather new method, one sec
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh thatâ€™s nice. In italy we get 2 major players + 4 isps running on the other 2s lines
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually 3 major players but 1 of them owns the entirety of the last stretch so they make life hell for the competition
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Privatization of telecommunications is the most retarded decision a government can make
18:45 <+fstd> Learath2: can't find the vid, but the general idea is that they have a small vehicle with the cable spool, and the vehicle has a mill of sorts in front of it, and a glue/resin dispenser at the rear.  they'd drive along the curb, cutting a slot in it, putting the cable in, and sealing it back up in one go
18:45 <+fstd> which is far cheaper becoz no real digging
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah running the cable un the curb sounds like a great idea
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the tradeoff is that the cable is in a more vulnerable position, right?
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> isnt there a min height u have to do
18:47 <+fstd> yeah but i've rarely seen a broken curb.  but what they probably had to engineer around was trapped moisture expanding when it's freezing
18:48 <+fstd> which some soft cable sheath should deal with tho
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> didnt they put bigger empty tubes in the ground first so when theres some new technology they can just use them again instead of digging again?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> wtf
18:51 <+fstd> i guess in a perfect world that would have been done :)
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is it activated already jao?
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> im pretty sure they did it in my area
18:51 <+fstd> in the real world they probably chose the smallest pipes and tubings they can get away with becoz short-term savings
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how would u get the cable through it
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> its heavy and the tube isnt straight
18:51 <+fstd> you feed something more maneuverable first
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u cant bend it easily
18:51 <+fstd> and use that to pull the real cable
18:52 <+fstd> if you're fancy you send a robot vehicle down the tube :)
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ðŸ¥´
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> good luck
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> they just push the cable through.
18:52 <+fstd> i mean that works for plumbers in hella filthy clogged pipes
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> did they dig open every meter overground??
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> they make 2 holes and shoot between them
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and then pull the cable
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but u cant do that for long distances
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yea ik
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> every 20m u need a hole
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and u cant go in circles
18:53 <+fstd> oh, right, there's the feed-a-light-pilot-string-with-air-drafts way
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is the company WEMAG jao?
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> meh
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> all manual labour is done here and everyone is just waiting for activation.
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but they dont say anything
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> maybe they need to patch the cables
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but its been about 2 months now
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it takes a while
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if the pull-cord technique would work for the massive underground cables too
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> with strong hook ye
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the cord would have to be very thick so when you pull the tension doesnâ€™t break it if it snags
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In other news, I just successfully calculated the jacobian for a quadruple integral. I have never done anything so painful by hand in my life
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I guess itâ€™s the jacobian of the bijection for the change of variables but all the same, absolute pain
19:52  * fstd incepts a sudden desire to play nethack into Learath2's mind
19:52  * fstd clears throat
19:52 <+fstd> i said
19:52 <+fstd> @Learath2's mind
19:56 <+fstd> i mean heinrich5991's mind
19:57 <+fstd> fine, i'll do it myself.
21:12 <+Learath2> fstd: I'll play one, was cooking :P
21:12 <+fstd> cool
