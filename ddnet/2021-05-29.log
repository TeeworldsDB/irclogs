09:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u get the git submodules
09:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> git submodule update --init --recursive
10:48 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> what other typo Ryozuki?
10:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> check your pr
10:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> smbd know how to check if i killed someone in client?
10:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> i used to do it with killfeed but it not always works and if i turn killfeed off it doesnt work at all

11:10 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ripozuki
11:10 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> yo can we get some more modding friendly notification api?
11:12 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> I would like to use ``CClient::Notify(const char *pTitle, const char *pMessage)`` in my custom ddnet client but have my own configuration if notfications are shown.
11:15 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> Since ``m_pGraphics->WindowActive()`` is only reachable from within CClient one has to call the CClient::Notify() method and can not implement a custom one without editing client.cpp which means the https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/e5e2e46da295cec9587c28a0b8a57a9494ff68fb/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L4104 cl_shownotifications check is forced. So if i want to see custom notifications i have to see ALL ddnet
11:15 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> notifications which i do not :( any idea how to add custom notificaton code without touching too much of ddnet code base. Or can we change the ddnet code to make it more customizable?
11:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it's fairly customizable as is, it's just that your odd usecase is... well odd
11:24 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> why odd?
11:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should probably just comment out all uses of Notify that you dont want to see, or add minimally intrusive filtering, e.g. an enum for notification types with NOTIFY_DDNET being the default notification type
11:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then you can add an `if(Type == NOTIFY_DDNET) return;`
11:25 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> Commenting out all notify use cases sounds very intrusive to me
11:25 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> it would be nice to have own configuration of which notfications are shown without touching any line in ddnet code base
11:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean ddnet rarely uses notifications to begin with
11:26 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ye liek 3ish places
11:27 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> but those create a bunch of notifications already
11:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we were using them left and right I would agree to add some config options to only enable specific ones.
11:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Where are they used except for highlights and votes while you are logged in?
11:27 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ye sure we do not need that yet
11:27 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> but it would be nice if custom clients could add config
11:27 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> without changing ddnet code
11:27 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> do you know what i mean?
11:29 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> just something like this
11:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean the way I mentioned it would be only like 2 new lines 1 modified lines in client.cpp, 5 new lines 1 modified line in client.h
11:29 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> yes
11:29 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> thats waaaaay too much for me
11:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think that is clean enough that it would merge fine
11:30 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> if you add 5 lines here and there for that and then 2 lines here and then add another feature this client wont merge in 3 years anymore
11:30 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i feel like notifications is something that should be easy to use as a modder dont u think?
11:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I disagree with that. A single parameter added to a function and a new enum would never break anything
11:31 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> it can cause git conflicts
11:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Notifications are easy to use though, it's the fact that you want to remove some of our notifications that's complicating things (they are also trivial to remove imo)
11:32 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/8648b1a7dcf6711d1ca8c4dd1fc1adb552fd8411
11:32 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> that commit for example would have caused merge conflicts then
11:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would cause an absolutely trivial one. You can't avoid those
11:33 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> well you could if #3861 was in place
11:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean we can put code to disable parts of ddnet everywhere but that's just impractical
11:34 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> sure its impractical
11:34 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> and might not fit everywhere
11:34 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> but as i said notifications seems like a sane place doesnt it?
11:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does it though? It sounds like a solution to a problem that only you have
11:35 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> yes it does
11:35 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i mean it is a problem only i have probably
11:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ClShowNotifications is meant to disable ALL notifications. You turn it into "Disable DDNet Base notifications"
11:36 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> yes
11:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think that's just creating a loophole to then abuse. If we want to allow this weird configuration why not be explicit about it?
11:38 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> what do you suggest?
11:38 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> implement more complex configuration code into ddnet?
11:39 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> exposing ``m_pGraphics->WindowActive()`` would also work but that sounds even more hacky xd
11:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we have to have this in ddnet (I don't think we do since imo merge conflicts are just part of the deal), I stand by my initial suggestion. We add notification types
11:40 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> wait by We you mean ddnet repo?
11:41 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> sure merge conflicts are part of the game but wouldnt it be nice if they werent? :D
11:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes. That's the explicit way of allowing this, not decapitating a config option
11:41 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> could you shoot a pr then? :)
11:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I don't think it's necessary to begin with, so I don't think I will. Sorry, maybe the others think differently
11:44 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> doubt
11:44 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> veri sad
11:45 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> are there any c++ hacks how i can access private variables? :D that would also work
11:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> FWIW you calling NotificationsNotify yourself is waaaaaaaaay more hacky than just adding 2 lines to Notify
11:47 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i dont mind hacky
11:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cutting through the abstraction is nono
11:47 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> well its no abstraction
11:47 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ok maybe it is
11:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> chillerdragon: I have an idea for you, why don't you inherit from CClient and just override Notify?
11:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would just be like a 3k line patch 😄
11:51 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> xd
11:51 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> if the 3k lines are in my own files that would be ok
11:51 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> but i feel like it would require to alter ddnet code
11:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk for me the 2 line merge conflict that actually probably will never happen because git-merge is quite smart is so acceptable that I can't really think of a fix that would make both you and me happy
11:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> CClient::Notify changing signatures would be the only way a merge conflict happens and that's also incredibly unlikely
11:52 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> git merge gets confused quite fast imo even when code around it changes
11:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A separate if block almost never will trigger a merge conflict
11:53 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i think i saw those quite often
11:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> btw WindowActive() looks like it's public, why can't you use it?
11:55 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> cuz im stoopid maybe
11:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You just need to read it, right?
11:55 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ye
11:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and what do you have access to from your class? just CClient?
11:55 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i can only get access to the IClient thing not to CClient
11:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or IClient?
11:56 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i want to access it from my class
11:56 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> so i dont alter cclient class
11:57 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> LMAO
11:58 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i found something neat xxD
11:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just go through the kernel to get a pointer to IGraphicsBackend?
11:58 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ``#define private public        //This is the hack to access priviate variables of any class ``
11:58 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> make all vars public
11:58 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> with only 1 line of change
11:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> now that is absolute cancer
11:58 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> haha ikr
11:58 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> but not very intrusive
11:58 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> and covers quite some use cases
11:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You also need `#define protected public`
11:59 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ye
11:59 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> but wait
11:59 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> its private by default isnt it?
11:59 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> so i still need to add a public: at the top of all classes
11:59 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ok crap
12:00 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> <twbridge_ "[ddnet] <Learath2> Just go throu"> yes something like that
12:00 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> sounds hacky and expensive but how hard is it?
12:00 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> https://github.com/Narasimha1997/DirtyPointer-Hack/blob/master/PrivateVariable.cpp
12:00 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> sounds like this
12:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `((IEngineGraphics *)Kernel()->RequestInterface<IEngineGraphics>())->WindowActive()`
12:01 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> probably even more conflict prone when the offset changes due to member variables changing
12:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> here you go, your hack of the day
12:02 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> oh wait u mean tw engine kernel not linux kernel xd
12:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol you actually considered going through the linux kernel? 😄
12:02 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> urs looks really neat
12:02 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> haha
12:02 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> im desperate
12:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean you could probably using ptrace
12:03 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i watched too many security yt videos xd
12:04 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> using tw engine is so smart
12:04 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> wew it compiled
12:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> FWIW if you don't mind being hacky you can just get any graphics interface pointer and reinterpret cast it to a pointer to the implementation
12:04 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ok lets see
12:04 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> not bad
12:04 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> idk what that means but cool
12:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `IGraphics *m_pGraphics; IEngineGraphics *m_pEngineGraphics = reinterpret_cast<IEngineGraphics *>(m_pGraphics);`
12:06 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> why is code format bugged
12:06 < ChillerDragon> did u fail that or bridge?
12:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I sent it in one line, didn't want to spam irc
12:07 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i think only 1 line works anyways
12:07 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> otherwise u got `  in seperate messages due to irc
12:07 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> but here only one ` arrived so no format
12:07 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> sad
12:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I see two ` in quakenet
12:08 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> im sure ill get back to that cast one day
12:08 < ChillerDragon> woot how
12:08 < ChillerDragon> wtf
12:08 < ChillerDragon> i see 1
12:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> btw we want to get out of freenode soon-ish
12:08 < ChillerDragon> yikes
12:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we have a new matrix bridge
12:08 < ChillerDragon> ddnet also anti freenode cuz shitstorm
12:08 < ChillerDragon> i still dont k what happend with freenudes
12:09 < ChillerDragon> oh so a selfhosted bridge?
12:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we don't host it no
12:09 < ChillerDragon> ah
12:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> t2bot iirc
12:09 < ChillerDragon> bot
12:09 < ChillerDragon> :ban:
12:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tl;dr on the freenode thing: freenode sold, richman said worry not I won't interfere, staff said k, richman interfered, staff left, richman started taking over channels that moved to other networks so we were justified in being worried
12:11 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> richman is a name or a male having much moni?
12:12 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> wait so freenode was bought with staff but then staff rage quitted? xd
12:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> male with money, his name is Andrew Lee, bitcoin millionaire
12:13 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> so freenode is now run by a male?
12:13 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> thats so fucked up
12:13 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> literally the worst gender ok when can we leave?
12:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the fucked up part is that he is interfering with the day to day operations of the network
12:13 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> why does bitcoin millonaire always sound so negative? :D
12:14 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> like what exactly?
12:14 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> sorry to ask u all instead of doing reasearch
12:15 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i very much appreciate ur tldr
12:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well it all began with him wanting to inject his own people into the elected staff
12:15 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i mean he bought it
12:15 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> so who can blame him?
12:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well there is a bit of a story there, the old head of staff sold it unilaterally without asking, all of the volunteer staff was ready to quit right then
12:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but richboi said worry not, I won't interfere with the day to day operations at all, and staff agreed to stay under that pretense
12:18 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> how much shit storm did the person get who sold it? :D
12:18 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> cashing out on freenode lmao
12:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> she deleted her twitter
12:18 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> oh lol so she was female?
12:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep
12:18 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> haha love it
12:18 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> poor her
12:18 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> she now rich gal but cant flex it on twitter
12:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway, it is indeed mr richman's right to fill the staff with whomever he wants, he did buy the thing
12:19 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> learath go apply for staff
12:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but the volunteer staff has no obligation to stay, nor do the people who sponsor the servers to the network
12:19 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> and all those ppl moved united to new network?
12:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a sizable chunk of the volunteer staff set up a new network, owned by a swedish non-profit with bylaws that prevent this kind of thing ever happening again
12:20 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> do we stay on any irc?
12:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we stay on quakenet as we always have, Ryozuki and I are holding #ddnet on libera.chat incase we want to use it
12:21 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> is libera the swedish stuff?
12:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes
12:21 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> alright
12:21 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i feel so informed now
12:22 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> right... so how much to buy ddnet and intefer with daily operations such as notfication api?
12:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> most projects migrated to libera, some went to oftc, some are still staying on freenode
12:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> send 3 million euros in monero and I'll give you all the keys
12:22 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> oof yikes
12:23 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> but then u have to delete ur twitter
12:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> C'est la vie
12:23 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> learath ready to cash out leaked
12:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't use it anyway
12:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 3 million euros I can use to buy nice anti ddos and make a new ddnet 😛
12:23 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> hm
12:24 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> that freenode gal should do that
12:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> she probably wants nothing to do with any of this anymore
12:24 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> if she has money and free time maybe we can get here to play on ddnet :)
12:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> she got blasted when she first sold it, now that it all fell apart I don't think there is anyone that wants her to hold the keys to anything
12:25 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i would share my save codes with her
12:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> simp
12:25 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ye cuz she is female
12:25 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> and famous freenude owner
12:26 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> wait do we run into any risk now shit talking that mr rich guy?
12:26 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> since we do it on his network?
12:27 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> or is it not that bad?
12:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there are some popular channels he was watching for his name and k-lining people but he stopped that after people spotted it
12:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you mention libera.chat in your topic and the channel is larger than a certain size the freenodebot will come and take over the channel and change your topic
12:30 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> oh yikers
12:31 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> Yo Andrew Lee i fan pls send bitcoin
12:31 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i stay on freenude for u
12:43 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> OMAGAWD @Learath2 it works so good
12:43 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> pls marry me
14:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 you said in the pr " For servers not supporting the new serverinfo protocol, there is a 1/256 chance that a serverinfo is confused with another serverinfo that was requested by a different part of the code."
14:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Can't we remove the other code part? Ping 0 is still a big problem
14:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i get it like 50% of the times btw
14:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not 1/256
14:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, 0 ping shouldn't be a result of that tho, a random wrong ping would be the result I'd expect
15:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah dunno, maybe ping is clamped or smth?
15:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also had a lower than possible ping already
15:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm I doubt the random result can be negative. But since 50% is a lot maybe you can try a conditional breakpoint?
15:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If ping is calculated to be 0ms break and see wtf went wrong
15:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can try
15:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> `m_CurrentServerCurrentPingTime` equals time_get
15:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> client.cpp L1484
15:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe we can just ignore the extended server details or split the ping pong into 2 ints
15:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hum, so time_get() - m_CurrentServerCurrentPingTime somewhere equals 0?
15:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
15:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i assuem the client just tries to send another ping pong as soon as then extended server details come in or smth?
15:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not sure how this was implemented, I'll take a look
15:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah
15:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when i ignore ping pong if either vanilla server details were found or extended it works
15:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so dont allow it to happen twice
15:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 you should note that is for old servers
15:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that send both server detail packages
15:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> such servers exist? L:D
15:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> kog, fng
15:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought you either sent extended or vanilla
15:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so 90% of my favorite list xd
15:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (since extended is compatible with vanilla)
15:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> vanilla 0.6?
15:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, actually no, we did break compatibility there and modified the request instead
15:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but as soon as you get the request you know whether the client understands the extended protocol or not
15:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why send them both at that point?
15:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, tho it does happen
15:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby explain your goofery
15:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and i guess ddnet 10 or smth still expects this
15:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway, if we dont need vanilla server details, drop it
15:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <noby> fng is based on ddnet 10.8 and the info reply code is changed abit because its using caching
15:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do i need to fix something
15:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its alot of servers
15:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not only fng
15:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its also my fng code btw
15:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, maybe ddnet 10.8 behaved like that, I wonder why we even bother sending both
15:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i pasted alot of ur fng code into ddnet code base
15:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and edited it
15:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> guess 4 years ago that was the way todo it
15:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Is it okay that after i do SendKill(-1) in code it kills me after 5 seconds? I didnt make any delays or hard to calculate if statements
15:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since i also just looked into ddnet source
15:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, your fng2 code only seems to send legacy info, where do you send the extended one?
15:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway if we get vanillla details, we can also just ignore the extended always(for ping pong=
15:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wait but it does
15:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you send `inf3`, I can't even find the constant `iext` in your code
15:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (or I'm grepping wrong, it's possible)
15:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u gotta switch to 0.6 branch
15:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, found it, you send the legacy 64p serverinfo with fstd
15:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not iext
15:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/Jupeyy/teeworlds-fng2-mod/blob/fng_06/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L1490
15:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
15:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats possible
15:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But even back then we knew which to send to the client, did we really send both?
15:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway, as the server is aware if the client supports 64p
15:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as soon as the client receives the vanilla ones it can ignore extended forever for the ping pong process
15:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll checkout ddnet 10.8 to investigate
15:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i guess the client just didnt send the extension required
15:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like a extra bit that indicates it or whatever
15:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i see it just uses a flag
15:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Packet.m_Flags & NETSENDFLAG_EXTENDED
15:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, the last time this protocol was used was in 9.3.2
15:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But for connless both ddnet 9.3.2 and fng2 only send the correct one and not both
15:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> for ingame serverinfo both seem to send 2 indeed, god knows why
15:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe it was that the client just sends 2 requests
15:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cant remember
15:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but somehow it ended up like this
15:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd suggest you all adopt the actual new (been here since ddnet 10) extended protocol from #322
15:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/322
15:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> SERVERBROWSE_INGAME was how the double send was dropped, anyway the ping code needs to be fixed to cope with servers that can't upgrade, so let's create an issue
15:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think(tm) the serverinfo part of the code you can pretty much copy and paste into your own code fwiw. Hopefully I didn't code it too dirtily, it is a bit of a mess to keep a decades worth of compatibility around
15:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i agree on that, but many servers wont update tho
15:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ddnet also uses old code from me i think
15:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> old code? for serverinfo?
15:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> much of the serverinfo stuff was rewritten in the pr above and I rewrote a lot of it too to hack caching in there
15:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nah i mean generally
15:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> outdated code 😄
15:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like not latest master
15:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I don't follow, you mean as in the official servers are not running master?
15:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah they run like 1-2 years old code
15:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah you mean the fng servers, yeah we haven't really kept up
15:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah i just mean, the ppl running servers might never update
15:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as they dont care
15:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just like kog never updated until avo joined kog
15:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and imo the fix is ok client side
15:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I said this for you and @noby. I know many hosters don't care
15:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not too much trouble
15:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
15:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats why i wrote i agree on that
15:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's also less traffic for you
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if we drop all compatibility and show just a "download a recent version to play" how many people we'd drop
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like who even still plays with vanilla 0.6
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont even fear client side
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i fear that some mods wont work
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and then ppl are like why is bomb mod not working anymore
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> smth like that xd
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what do i have to change
15:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby well idk what you are doing right now, but if it's what jupeyy is doing you should probably just take what we have in ddnet and bolt it on
15:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it isnt
15:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im using a modified version of ddnet 10 info reply
15:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i just added caching and a few other small changes
15:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so you are correctly sending iext packets and only sending a single type to people ingame?
15:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im not sure id have to check
15:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> grep for `SERVERBROWSE_INGAME` if it's there you are fine
15:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he does send all server packets xD
15:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the https list is correct for his mod
15:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but it still has ping 0 apparently
15:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just like kog does rn
15:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway, I'll go back to math
15:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> gl
15:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess heinrich will fix the ping thing sometime and the servers can fix their serverinfo stuff if they feel like it
15:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and when native http serverinfo support comes along we'll all be golden
16:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀
16:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> i swear im gonna set a bounty on /swap fix
16:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> time for bounty hunting
16:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> :monkalaugh:
16:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/848212467339362344/RDT_20210529_165319505179631511469971.jpg
16:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh: ç
16:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My professors are seriously all so annoying, why are they renaming everything? The guy calls a gated d latch a d flip flop
17:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How am I supposed to follow this mans lectures when I have to correct his terminology in my mind all the time?
17:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When you say d flip flop I think of a positive edge triggered d flip flop
18:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> if you get used to something, it's hard to leave it 🙂
18:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There should be some regulatory body enforcing correct usage of terminology in lectures and maybe some standardized higher level mathematics courses
18:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Everyone just picking and choosing terminology means we can’t browse the vast internet for extra knowledge, means we can’t ask for help easily
18:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> is it really that bad?
18:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For math proofs I have to provide all the required definitions when asking for help because the author of this book decided to slighltly modify them
18:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> E.g. a region has to be G-Admissible for the gauss green theorem to be correct. Good luck finding the definition of g admissible anywhere on the internet
18:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> so only math is the problem, isn't it?
18:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well math is an example, as you see the computer architecture professor decided to define d flip flop as a gated d latch
18:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but that's somewhat obvious i think
18:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The ESTM professor likes to use SR NAND latches, the architecture guy SR NOR latches
18:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How is it obvious at all? An edge triggered d flip flop can be implemented as two gated d latches in series
18:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can’t use the part and the whole interchangeably :d
18:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it probably doesn't matter much unless you're going to design your own hardware
18:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why teach it at all then? The point of the course is to learn some computer architecture
18:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you don’t want to go that deep in your lecture then just give us blocks to put together
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> i think courses at uni are just too short to learn something in deep
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> and learning many different things at the same time isn't really helpful as well
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :sendhelp:
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Depends on the uni, Depends on your definition of deep
18:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'm glad I'm done with my degree
18:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :pepeH:
18:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have to learn and keep in mind proofs for all the theorems I use in analysis 2, that’s fairly deep, not extremely deep but very deep
18:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you are going to lecture me about micro seconds of delay on a ripple carry adder I expect you to atleast keep the terminology unchanged from other sources so I can google shit without having to translate
18:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would gladly pay someone to finish it up for me, whenever I start working on it I remember how useless it is
18:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :poggers:
18:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pisses me off that the useless degree has so much influence on your life. What do we even study for to be honest? Being miserable for 4-10 years just so you can be a little less miserable at work
18:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes, it's weird
18:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Post scarcity world when?
18:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> unis made sense in the dark ages when there was no internet, but today.... i think big update is needed
18:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 how old were u again?
18:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 23, approaching the 40~ years of uninterrupted misery quickly
18:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh so young
18:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thought u older xd
18:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Everyone thinks so for some reason. Is it my love for ancient programming languages?
18:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> guess its just bcs u always been here at ddnet
18:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> probably because you are a wizard
18:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and normally these ppl are like 50 years old xd
18:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and have 3 kids
18:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and tsfreddie as wife
18:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol, I think most of the long timers here are not that old
18:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 😳
18:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> guess deen is around 30?
18:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean its not old
18:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but also not young
18:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can imagine he gets kids soon and wont be here alot anymore
18:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> what does this supposed to mean
18:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No idea, if any of us is around 30 it's deen
18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I coded my first line like 11 years ago, wasn't teeworlds though iirc
18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt heinrich the oldest
18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> who knows xd
18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what my oldest teeworlds commit is
18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ttbh i assume he's from 1991
18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so probs around deens age
18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ and u?
18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 125 +- 100
18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 25?
18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe 225
18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> who knows
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Jupstar is 2021 years old, he personally saw jesus christ
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im 0x15
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I always had the impression that Heinrich is the same age as mine
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so young
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wtf
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats like kiddy
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> age
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i bet tsfreddie is like 19
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (21)
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 😅
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I wish
18:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 😮
18:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he's old af
18:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 49 weeb
18:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> plays kids game
18:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> actually, you nailed it, I'm 0x19
18:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh
18:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 😄
18:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Teeworlds trolls added 50 years to my life so I'm 73 in reality
18:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I tested my English vocab, I'm on par with a 5yo native speaker. So it might be hard to tell
18:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> With all these IRC logs, we are slowly doxing ourselves.
18:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean I have a fairly unique name anyway, so I'm instantly doxed
18:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :poggers:
18:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hello people reading irc logs
18:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you are from the future
18:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i may be dead
18:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i was here
18:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 👍
18:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine the internet in 2100
18:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder if even http itself changed
18:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe it's a robot reading these, learning about teeworlds
18:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or if C stiffness in the world still remains
18:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> an ancient relic of the past
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or we have all merged into a singularity and the irc logs exists in everyones mind
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://xkcd.com/1782/
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
18:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, ofc I'l connect with my irc bridge
18:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i was never on the irc train. i don't really get it
18:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its simple
18:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why i like it
18:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its decentralized in its own way
18:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not p2p but better than 1 discord
18:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and matrix is overly complicated and slow
18:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but at the end u gotta use what everyone uses
18:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or ur end alone
18:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its sometimes fun to read some irc chats
18:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its always about drugs
18:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i swear
18:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀 basically me trying to get my friends onto telegram
20:51 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> why telegram tho
20:51 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> sok
20:51 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> even signal is better than telegram
20:51 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> or whatsapp
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> telegram is fun
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the good thing about telegram is the bot api
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and the stickers I guss
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I literally use a telegram bot to manage my input method's dictionary
