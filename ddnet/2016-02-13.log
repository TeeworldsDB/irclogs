01:17 < Hamid_Jigool> hi again my friends
01:18 < Hamid_Jigool> how can i active random Brutal or any type of maps on votes
01:18 < Hamid_Jigool> ?
01:35 < Savander> Hey guys. I found a small bug. If you hold "hook" and then you jump into TP, then you'll do one more hook after teleportation
01:38 < Savander> it's for everyone, probably. Or at least, for players which were on server, where i was. 95.172.92.151:8304 - DDNet GER - Race [DDraceNetwork]

03:59 < vali> !help
04:01 < fstd> what do you need help with, son?
04:01 < ParANormaL_> he needs hands
04:01 < vali> yes sir
15:19 < laxa> Why actually none of the ddnet team is on IRC ?
15:19 < laxa> except EastByte and heinrich5991
15:34 <@deen> because only technical people use IRC
16:35 < gfgf> hola
19:56 < Ryozuki> ger is down
20:14 <@deen> looks just like 95% packet loss without ddos
20:16 < Trax> deen bist du da?
20:16 <@deen> hi Trax
20:29 < Gabeee> deen: nice
20:29 < Gabeee> any routing issue maybe?
20:29 <@deen> nah, regular routing
20:30 <@deen> I would guess they're having a DDoS attack, but not against us directly
20:31 < Gabeee> What hoster is it?
20:31 < Gabeee> Sometimes the DDOS is high so the other IPs on the same router also get some noise out of it
20:31 < Gabeee> I guess it's that
20:32 <@deen> yeah, i just checked and pinged a few other ips at the same location and they don't seem to be affected as much, so I mailed them about it
20:32 <@EastByte> Gabeee: no, other gameservers at nfoservers are stable
20:39 <@deen> GER should be fine again
