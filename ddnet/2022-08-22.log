00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> everything is either a duck or not a duck
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao's hairy kebab> is 🦢 duck ?
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no, 🦢 is swan
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I remember having that issue of having to set sv_high_bandwidth overwise server would lag
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe an oversight? it's not exactly obvious that applying velocity changes one by one would lead to some people having a weaker hook 😄
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> that will cause great physics change
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> teeworlds is ship of bugs that allows u to enjoy it
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrazyDevNEW> what command to shut down the server ddnet?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> shutdown
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrazyDevNEW> Thank
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrazyDevNEW> I also wanted to ask, is the “exec” command one hundred percent capable?
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrazyDevNEW> can she run a python file?
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it runs another cfg file, nothing else
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no Python
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrazyDevNEW> is there a function that will replace some parameter in the autoexec_server file for me already on a running server?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrazyDevNEW> I want to add one parameter in the voting for the map tab that will change sv_test_cmds
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you can use fifo file (if you're on mac or linux) to send command to the server (if i understood what you want correctly)
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrazyDevNEW> can be more
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrazyDevNEW> or documentation
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrazyDevNEW> @Chairn
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ?
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @CrazyDevNEW mkfifo /path/to/file.fifo
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> in autoexec.cfg
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sv_input_fifo "/path/to/file.fifo"
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> echo "broadcast test" > /path/to/file.fifo
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> and that no ig, only save_dry that dumps current values ?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrazyDevNEW> understood nothing
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I think he only wants a vote to enable and disable cheats
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But sv_test_cmds cant be changed ingame, you would need to modify code to allow that
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> How'd the tests go?
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I really like the new hookline design, much more accurate :heartw:
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1011337250514141234/unknown.png
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh yeah much better
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1011338412889997342/unknown.png
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oh sorry, still haven't tested it
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> make it thicc
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :gigachad:
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> why are the default values this tho
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why should they?
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> from what version did u upgrade?
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Not Keks are you worried about me having to rebase against months old code 😄 ?
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Not Keks updated this morning, there was one more update later
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i am worried u loose fun and the pr lies there as long as learaths pr xdd
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> actually i lost it
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> from what version tho?
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also was it no the case in the morning?
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i tried to work this weekend, and i couldn't do it 😦
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> BURNOUT KICKS IN
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> + on linux, i have potato machine so it takes time to compile, and on windows, it takes freaking 40 seconds for linking...
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> probably...
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> not sure what the number was on the first update
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok, bcs this sounds like a really weird bug 😄
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> are the default settings 0 and 100?
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 0 is the default
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well I had some values in the middle, assumed those are the default since I updated from a version that didn't have these settings
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and looking into the code it doesnt look like it could magically change, so this must be some weird bug either in the updater, or smth else
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh ok
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> funny setting tho, what's the use case? can't imagine why someone would want a phat hookline
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think the creator just wanted a bit thicker, bcs he could barely see it
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno the use case tho, i find it big enough
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ah maybe on some super high dpi display the 1px line could be hard to see
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> skinny one looks kinda ugly
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and opacity is very helpful
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but teeworlds isnt dpi aware
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 4k will look like full hd
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but maybe zooming out
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> zooming doesnt change width
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> hookline is always the same size even with zoom
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then i dont see the use case ^^
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if it gets upscaled on high dpi displays then idk xD
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but lynn also wants bigger UI, i find tw UI insanly big already
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how about some tooltip when hovering over the button ?
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> when huge ui overhaul update
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> when u code ot
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> when u code it
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ok give me 10 years
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> jk the ui is already amazing
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> only 0.7 one is a bit sexier
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 0.7 has too many scroll bars
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and little tiny extensions
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I could try to make tooltips, tho would it make more sense to have that as its own PR and not directly linked to the icon change?
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> im trying to sprout ideas for changes in ui setup if you havent seen already
