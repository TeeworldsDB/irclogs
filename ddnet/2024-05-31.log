06:02 < bridge> <Ewan> Slipknot fan much
07:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I like them
07:02 < bridge> <Ewan> fun
09:54 < bridge> <Ewan> o chiller can i get a bash review... <https://github.com/ewancg/spotifyd-notification/blob/master/spotifyd-notification>
09:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i hardly proofread this myself
09:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i just know it works
09:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> LGTM!
09:56 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
09:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> some people would complain because you're saving secrets and keys in plain text, but if it works, it works :gigachad:
10:01 < bridge> <Ewan> they expire
10:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> most keys do :P - Ewan what system are you running now btw? arch, plasma, systemd?
10:04 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
10:04 < bridge> <Ewan> i want gnome but its wayland compositor is so busted
10:04 < bridge> <Ewan> so i am destined to a life of plasma
10:05 < bridge> <Ewan> especially as it comes to fractional scaling
10:05 < bridge> <Ewan> gnome lacks a setting like this
10:05 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1246011677376380970/image.png?ex=665ad64d&is=665984cd&hm=67fd36234a8c0d4e0b452fd4243bae5b2c6bbd1105a2d80a7632a7a65d707a50&
10:05 < bridge> <Ewan> so every single x11 app will be scaled in post by gnome and have shitty filtering on it
10:05 < bridge> <Ewan> also it's particularly bad about nvidia
10:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> i tried wayland on arch with my old pc (nvidia gtx 1050ti) - that was the worst possible experience i ever had with Nouveau drivers. eye jitter, text-rendering issues
10:13 < bridge> <Ewan> gross
10:13 < bridge> <Ewan> i use official drivers
10:13 < bridge> <Ewan> for frames
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> hi
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> monday i can confirm i get a new apartment
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> bigger better
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> epyc
11:31 < bridge> <melo∆û> more place for even more fishies LETSGOO
11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can have a room for it
11:31 < bridge> <melo∆û> @heinrich5991 thanks for the bitwarden recommendation btw, loving it so far
11:31 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://tenor.com/view/oh-my-god-gif-26058891
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> More space for gf clothers
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill make my dev room
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> with rust merch
11:33 < bridge> <melo∆û> set  it up like linus torvalds
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> is wireguard good? i want to setup my vps to allow me to connect to my home pc behind a cgnat
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> but when i change home ill change ISP to one with ipv6 and no cgnat
11:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> not using CGNAT just makes it even easier no? - i like wireguard
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> i cant choose to not usa a CGNAT because my current isp uses a CGNAT
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not something i control
11:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/10vx69b/ultimate_noob_guide_how_to_bypass_cgnat_using/?rdt=43512
11:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh ok
11:54 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
11:55 < bridge> <Ewan> generally yeah
11:55 < bridge> <Ewan> more performant than openvpn
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf chiller, my brash broken.. i thought bash is divine & infallible
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `-bash: _comp_initialize: Kommando nicht gefunden.`
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> restart helped
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
11:59 < bridge> <Ewan> wtf
12:23 < bridge> <Ewan> https://youtu.be/PeWUwRZrHSw?si=l14MRB4GSk6btpdJ
13:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> works because your VPS's IP address does not change and your home PC can always connect to the VPS
13:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> wireguard sounds like a good fit here
13:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> look what i got at the office
13:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1246069022219436092/IMG_20240531_135229.jpg?ex=665b0bb5&is=6659ba35&hm=2dad297d3a2321079e287195a2def6c097d12306358baed6a7b0811e454dcaf5&
13:56 < bridge> <Peakies> DDNet android build failed on both Ubuntu 24 and WSL Ubuntu

17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> bt
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> wireguard i made by a gento odeveloper
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> Wireguard is written and maintained by Jason A. Donenfeld (zx2c4) , a Gentoo developer.
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/WireGuard
17:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> nice üôÇ
17:49 < bridge> <Pepsicola_o0> So, Im25now. May is may
17:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @robyt3 what about the other two occurences?
17:50 < bridge> <robyt3> Ah, I'll check
17:52 < bridge> <robyt3> The second one CMakeLists is not for Android though, or was that never necessary?
17:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'll check, sorry
17:54 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems necessary, both Android and Windows build fail without that one
17:55 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems necessary, both Android and Windows build fail without the ones on CMakeLists
17:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
17:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I came to the same conclusion. sorry for the false positive
17:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I come to the same conclusion. sorry for the false positive
17:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> thanks!
17:56 < bridge> <robyt3> Is #8419 what's causing the build failure on newer Ubuntu?
17:56 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8419
17:56 < bridge> <robyt3> Or only future potential issue?
17:58 < bridge> <robyt3> If your build fails, it's helpful to only debug with one arch first, e.g. `x86` instead of `all`, so you don't get the output for all builds interleaved
18:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> rust 1.100 will release in a couple of years
18:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so future issue
18:52 < bridge> <murpi> @louis.place I absolutely love the confetti effect, nicely done :D
