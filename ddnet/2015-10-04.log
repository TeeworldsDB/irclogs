00:32 <@deen> o_be_one: so, any progress with the Strasbourg server? I won't have much time to set it up, I'll be gone in a week
01:46 < eeeee> where are you going?
01:49 <@heinrich5991> I think he's doing a trip through europe
01:49 <@heinrich5991> there was something on the ddnet forums
01:49 <@heinrich5991> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2085
01:59 < eeeee> i see, quite a trip
02:00 < eeeee> someone should fix http://ddnet.tw/funding/ , i'm no longer sponsoring GER2
02:22 <@deen> yes, someone should but i'm not active anymore. i think the only person of the admin team in here is EastByte 
07:55 <@EastByte> I guess I should remove GER2 from funding since it's only temprorary
13:23 < Learath2> should get the team of admins in irc
14:16 < devnull> that would be a good thing
