19:16 < Learath2> deen, i really dont see whats happening here
19:55 < Learath2> deen, you around ?
20:01 <@deen> Learath2: what's up?
20:02 < Learath2> could you give it a try with a timed out name server instead of a wrong one
20:02 < Learath2> i tried on windows but i cant seem to reproduce
20:02 < Learath2> 78.46.174.82 should timeout 
20:03 <@deen> nope, can't reproduce
20:03 < Learath2> falls back gracefully right ?
20:03 < Learath2> back to the drawing board
20:07 <@deen> yeah
20:15 <@deen> i don't like these bugs that only a few people get
20:15 <@deen> like the mouse wheel thing
20:15 < Learath2> those are the hardest to debug
