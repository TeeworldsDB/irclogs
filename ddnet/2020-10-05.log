01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> Hello, I've been using the steam version of the game and I have a question about running your own server
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> What's the easy way to know the password of it? Where is the config?
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> I'm using ubuntu btw
05:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> winter night is ok, jungle night is nice.
05:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i'd have no problem with replacing heaven, and winter day/jungle day
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pepe it's written out on stdout, so not so easy to find with steam ðŸ˜„
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pepe I'd suggest making a "myServerconfig.cfg" and adding a `sv_rcon_password` there
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Hi, I have found a bug in the automapper when using the NoLayerCopy function.
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> At first here are the rules.
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762643546846789642/test.rules
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fish and chips> g
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> test will map this pattern
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762643650555019264/screenshot_2020-10-05_13-52-14.png
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fish and chips> woahhh
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fish and chips> i never tried editor
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fish and chips> this looks hard
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> and test2 will randomly change some of the stones with ID 34.
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762644036091641876/screenshot_2020-10-05_13-52-20.png
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> test3 is just test combined with test2, but it breaks the pattern?
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762644284788441088/screenshot_2020-10-05_13-52-30.png
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> How about with the non steam version? I just configure the server.cfg and it works @deen  ?
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pulsar> @mind not a bug, it's just kinda hard to understand it sometimes. Basically it will place 34 and immediately after it may change it to 33. It makes the first rule valid again and you get those repeats. Should work if you check 33 as well ```NOTINDEX 33 OR 34```.

14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Ah ok, I always had the impression that it would handle one Index rule after the other.
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Wait, so it's placing ID 34 before checking the conditions for ID 34?
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pulsar> no, it checks the conditions first, but they stay valid, if it places 33 and you don't check for 33
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Ok now I undrestand what's happening, thank you very much.
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pepe for the non-steam version you could check in standard output of the client (but then you have to run it from command line). I think adding your own cfg is always easier
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> is there any idea behind the physics layers (game, front, ...) having an automapper each?
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (i've already asked that a few days ago but that discussion ended rather abrupt)
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> what automapper?
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> you mean if you set any other tileset layer as game tiles?
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> they are not visible in the editor, but in the map format the game layer, front layer, tele layer, etc each have an automapper
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> .-.
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> which i would remove if they truly dont do anything and have no purpose whatsoever
15:57  * lol slaps ChillerDragon around a bit with a large fishbot
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Is there 0.7 skins to DDNet ones convertor? I could write one.
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> In my mod are predefined skins for zombies which looks different at 0.7 and 0.6 protocols as skin systems differs.
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I am thinking about making a tool that would convert 0.7 skins (json) to ddnet ones (png).
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> That way my 0.6 players will get the same experience and will finally see 0.7 skins in my game.
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ||This sed thing doesn't work||
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :tee_thinking: `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5">`
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki i used that before, but wanted a way to turn it off, so there's now a timer and button on https://ddnet.tw/status/
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I hope this query is cached for 5 seconds. Or else that's a nice DoS loophole.
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Sorry if that will sound like I am cryticizing you. I am not.
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But do you really need users to see those stats with a 5 sec resolution?
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> If you use that dashboard for yourself only, try nito.net it's realtime system monitoring and agregator. And it's free plan is very nice.
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Also that public dashboard is a nice way for attacker to know how successful are his attacks.
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @deen
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/762692538405617674/Screenshot_from_2020-10-05_18-07-38.png
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I'd considered every column except the first 4 as a security risk. That's why status pages even on very big services are laconic.
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> (in your status page)
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Also nito.com SaaS is so nice that it require about 1-22 minutes per machiine to set it up and start receiving graphs on metrics and alerts.
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Also nito.com SaaS is so nice that it require about 1-2/ minutes per machiine to set it up and start receiving graphs on metrics and alerts.
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "free plan" sounds like something ill never use then
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck we reloadit with 120 seconds, not 5 seconds
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> NITO looks suspiciously like Grafana ðŸ˜„
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I tried some such solutions before and they always had quite high resource impact, which I found ironic. The current solution is low-resource enough to run on all our servers
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm aware that attackers can also see if their attacks are successful, but this also means players can see if server is currently under attack. I wouldn't want to remove it.
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 @Learath2 91 alerts from the code scanning, haven't looked into them yet: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/security/code-scanning
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ‘€
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh well, mostly just our multiplications happening before conversion to larger type
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that python thing tho
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i guess it doesnt matter
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> localtime is thread-unsafe apparently
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> according to `man 3 localtime`
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think localtime_s
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is thread safe
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `_r`
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but what systems support it? does windows?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah _s is windows only
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah yea
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or not?
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/chrono/localtime
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or not
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The implementation of localtime_s in Microsoft CRT is incompatible with the C standard since it has reversed parameter order and returns errno_t.
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> since c11
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its implemented differently
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in windows
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eh baah
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz they are smart
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably because they had it before the standard(?)
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> localtime_r will be available with C2x, but god knows when MSVC will support that standard
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can do an ifdef
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/c11-and-c17-standard-support-arriving-in-msvc/
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 this is a blog from 14th
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> september
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "While there is currently no support for any C11 optional features, we are committed to providing the most impactful optional features in future releases." hopefully one day we'll have standard threads
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > For many years Visual Studio has only supported C to the extent of it being required for C++. Things are about to change now that a conformant token-based preprocessor has been added to the compiler. With the advent of two new compiler switches, /std:c11 and /std:c17, we are officially supporting the latest ISO C language standards.
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 > Atomic and threading support are on our roadmap.
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which insane developer at microsoft thought they should do a character-based preprocessor instead of a token based one? ðŸ˜„
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ‘€
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @deen what do you mean 'reloading in 120 seconds'? graphs are changing every 2 seconds now
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> here https://ddnet.tw/status/
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> isn't that the same for you?
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd guess whole page is reloaded every 120s, updating the player statistics below the server stats
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've talked about CPU graph and everything about your system internals
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it seems that this endpoint is not rate limited

18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I haven't changed anything in the top part
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> as I get new values every time
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> of course, what good would updating every 2 s be if the server doesn't allow it? ðŸ˜„
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and I think there is a bash script involved that starts a shell
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> that's my concern about DoS
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no idea what you mean
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I mean are those values on CPU time and each are coming from machines directly?
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> each machine runs a python script, that connects via udp to our ddnet.tw main server, and updates the values every 2 seconds
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> gets written into a .json file on disk every 2 seconds as well and nginx serves that through cloudflare
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> nice
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so if you request it more often you'll only stress cloudflare and maybe nginx, nothing else
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> That I was asking about proxying it.
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Yes, thanks!
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> *about caching
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Sorry if that wasn't useful. You have nice architecture already
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if you look through our website, you'll notice that much of it works that way, just creating static pages. some really don't like this approach, but I'm obviously a fan
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no problem, could've been that I missed something
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I am a huge fan of prerendering heavy pages too.
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I mean backend-heavy ones.
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Nice, thanks anyway
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Nice, thanks
