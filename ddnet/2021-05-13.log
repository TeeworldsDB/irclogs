00:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> edit: ah nvm, the dash is completely missing haha
00:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> can confirm

20:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> ðŸ¤”
20:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> I'm new to linux, can anyone help?)
20:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> are you using wayland?
20:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and since you are new my followup question is "are you sure you are using wayland?" ðŸ˜›
20:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> yes, but it seems like Xorg is still used
20:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/842464836779769927/unknown.png
20:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> :redstripe:
20:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm ðŸ¤”
20:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Um, not sure if that makes much sense. But run without the `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland`
20:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> DDNET_DRIVER=GLES
20:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or get GLEW-EGL
20:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> else it doesnt work with wayland rn
20:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> without it's working normal, but in fullscreen i have locked 60fps without enabled vsync
20:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i only know that arch has glew-wayland yet
20:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> didnt find any package on debian based distros
20:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think you can run both wayland and x11. Unless I'm misunderstanding what wayland does massively
20:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its xwayland then
20:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if he is on a wayland session
20:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why would the terminal be in an xwayland session?
20:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ^^
20:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u mean me
20:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i answered learaths question
20:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xwayland does run x11 ontop of wayland
20:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
20:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but why would the (presumably default) terminal of Matodor do that?
20:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway, I won't make more noise. I'm not familiar with this newfangled setup, as @Jupstar âœª said we only support GLES for wayland
20:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well he wanted to know how to run wayland, ofc he has to switch session
20:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (the thing `echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE` runs in)
20:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> whats the point rn xD
20:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
20:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 maybe a legacy WM?
20:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it works without GLES
20:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u just need GLEW EGL
20:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "Embedded-System Graphics Library" sounds like something we shouldn't be relying on given this is not a kiosk running android ðŸ˜›
20:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> x11 supports EGL too
20:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and our official build might use that soon maybe
20:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> EGL 1.5 supports normal opengl just fine
20:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is EGL just badly named?
20:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it kinda was repurposed yes
20:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its just khronos way of crossplatform window initiailization
20:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but first for gles only, later also for e.g. normal opengl
20:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> i found this on arch wiki:
20:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/842467303856537640/unknown.png
20:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> see GLEW entry xd
20:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did we even do a release with the new OpenGL ES stuff?
20:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ubuntu defaults to wayland session, doesnt it?
20:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so if ppl want native wayland support, thats they only option other than GLEW build
20:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> soon SDL will default to wayland
20:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that will be chaos for all aps that use GLEW
20:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, I guess people will use old sdl anyway
20:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tho with shipped SDL its no problem
20:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> shipped SDL and glew to be precise
20:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs x11 does support EGL, and SDL added support to force it
20:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> anyway, you said u sure u run on wayland session, but it shows x11?
20:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> guess u have to logout to be sure
20:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how is there no auto discovery for this kind of stuff yet? I'd think SDL should make this all transparent to the user and us
20:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its really more GLEWs fault, as it doesnt check for dynamic libs
20:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u either compile with EGL or GLX
20:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> no, I'm not sure, now I'm looking for how to set it to "wayland" session, maybe it's disabled by udev rules
20:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GDM#GDM_ignores_Wayland_and_uses_X.Org_by_default
20:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> btw we can still use it for actually embedded systems, such as android, so its not wasted ðŸ˜„
20:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno what DE u use, but there often <DE-name>-wayland
20:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> packages
20:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 :
20:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Actually quite funny. Nobody knows the real name xD
20:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> "The acronym EGL is an initialism, which starting from EGL version 1.2 refers to Khronos Native Platform Graphics Interface.[3] Prior to version 1.2, the name of the EGL specification was OpenGL ES Native Platform Graphics Interface.[4] X.Org development documentation glossary defines EGL as "Embedded-System Graphics Library".[5]"

20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> 30fpx ingame :redstripe:
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> 30fps ingame :redstripe:
20:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland?
20:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> not running with sdl_videodriver=wayland
20:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> guess u should try it, bcs who knows what xwayland does
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it should
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as said, glew-wayland package or DDNET_DRIVER=GLES
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what hardware are you even on?
21:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> im remove glew and install glew-wayland, now i can run with `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland DDNet`
21:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is it possible to use Unicode in sv_name
21:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and have it display extended chars in the browser
21:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wym
21:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u can have those fancy chars in sv_name
21:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> things like emoji, box-drawing characters
21:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I'm wondering if the text engine will display it properly
21:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that would have been a better question to ask xD
21:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah, its also in data/fonts
21:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u can install it in ur system and use in text programs or select it in that char map
21:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> support for font ui setting would be cool
21:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> would break too much ui
21:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and then ppl complain
21:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe yea
21:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but you could always swap it
21:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> like editor entities right?
21:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
21:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> config dir is like data dir
21:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so just copy the font dir and replace it as u want
21:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> thanks jupeyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
21:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Matodor u can start the client and press f1, if you on a nightly version, then you know your GPU
21:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u have nvidia it might not even support wayland no idea, but u defs have to install the driver, as the mesa driver probs too bad for nvidia
21:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u never used linux, maybe u should use ubuntu, as arch is probs too hard to start with, if you dont have commonly supported hardware(e.g. proprietary drivers etc)
21:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> 1660s, wayland not not supported variable refresh rate (gsync-compatible) its useless for me, need back on xorg)
21:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> gtx 1660s, wayland not not supported variable refresh rate (gsync-compatible) its useless for me, need back on xorg)
21:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but is that bad
21:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gsync is still sync
21:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its still worse than no sync
21:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> better than vsync sure..
21:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> @Jupstar âœª see, nice glitches in wayland ðŸ˜„
21:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/842487326054940713/unknown.png
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> @Jupstar âœª see, nice glitches while using wayland ðŸ˜„
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/842487326054940713/unknown.png
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah rip
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> anyway, make sure to install nvidia driver from nvidia  website, and also make sure no vsync or anything is on.
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Then i guess u should get good fps
21:54 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> whats going on with Back In Time ger2 server?
23:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> idk i was in the loading and the server instant crashed when i spawned ðŸ˜„
23:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> unlucky
23:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <nori> sway support vrr out of box, i never had issues with freesync
23:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <nori> ah anyway it's nvidia
