19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon ez look my first pr in ddnet
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> now that i have cmake ^^
20:57 <+Ryozuki> is reactjs that good ir it is just overhyped?
21:05 <+Learath2> it's a very opinionated framework
21:05 <+Learath2> it works really well but you either do it their way or you don't do it at all
21:06 <+Learath2> I think I enjoyed vuejs much more as it allows you to work the same way as react but also do what you want
