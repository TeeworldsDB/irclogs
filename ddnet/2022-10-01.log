00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I run them and they are down because the hoster is under constant DoS attacks
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If you know a good South African VPS hoster, tell me
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beelee> who is the current hoster?

00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beelee> whats the min requirements?

00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beelee> my previous company used these guys, as far as i know they didnt have problems
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks, server ordered
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beelee> No Problem, so i can end my struggle to create a proper SA server haha?
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sure, I'll set it up once they provide me the server
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Beelee server is running now
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> pretty bad ping spikes for me, but maybe it's better when closer to server
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beelee> ill have a quick look

01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beelee> small spikes for me as well, is this jhb or cpt based?

09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 @deen ^
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fixed
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ty, just noticed i apparently can do that too xD
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I found another one on github, also fixed
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> :issou: good luck
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I always wondered; what are the 15.1-devel to 15.5-devel branches in ddnet?
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> which branches xd
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm, did someone delete them?
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I also remember seeing thsoe
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah just deleted them ^^
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think these had our releases
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we use tags usually
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, they're still in the tags
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the development of these 15.1.x, …, 15.5.x versions happened in these branches
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deen branched off these versions so we could still PR to master, but new features wouldn't go into these releases
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Ah, that makes sense.
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Also, CodeCov? Is that a code safety checker?
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it's a coverage checker
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it is, it tries to record which paths of the code run during tests
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So you can learn how much of the code your tests COVer 😛
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Right. I always wondered what it's like. Especially the whole headless client "open client 1, record demo" thing.
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We don't do proper unit testing so our coverage will be very low compared to other projects

12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The .tw was fine for everyone who was aware that we started as a Teeworlds mod. For new players it's probably just confusing
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and chinese ppl get mad xDD
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> They only get mad about Taiwanese flag ingame, I haven't heard anything about domain name
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean we have negative steam reviews bcs of that flag, completly redicilous, steam should delete them and ban the accounts
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why should they ban the accounts?
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm not sure. If they feel seeing the Taiwanese flag in scoreboard during gameplay annoys them so much, maybe it's worth a bad review from their PoV
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i doubt thats not against the TOS
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's not like they are saying anything wrong in their review
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> writing reviews based on political views
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why would that not be allowed? "there's nudity in the game, and I don't like that"
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs its ridicolous that simple
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't share that opinion
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well u'd remove the taiwan flag if enough ppl give negative reviews?
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that's really stupid imo
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you seem to say that everything that gives bad reviews needs to be changed
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I think we actually do hide it in the chinese client
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we do? thats already sad enough
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thats racist
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6862-8119-C23E-EA7B
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "Religious, political, and other "prone to huge arguments" threads"
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so its against their tos
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and steam should delete them
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that seems unenforceable
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and unenforced
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I saw plenty of mentions of ukraine or gay rights on steam
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well we don't call it country flag in the UI
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so we don't judge about taiwan in any way
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and taiwan has an official flag, there is nothing political from our side
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so these reviews should be deleted yes.
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I know what you mean, but if the game does not mention gay rights in any kind, and somebody posts a review (be it negative or positive) "gay rights suck/are awesome" or smth like that that it should be deleted
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well we don't call it country flag in the UI
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so we don't judge about taiwan in any way

12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can see your point, the reviews are not really related to the game and about a topic that invites flamewars
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Nah actually hiding a flag for certain groups of people is just weird
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Beelee @TearlessAbyss46 Try new South Africa server, it's stable for me
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NovaShock> thanks the servers seem to be stable for everyone so far
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Hello, enumeration declaration inside protocol_ex are they connected in a strict order? If there is an offset on any side of the client or server? What would be the behavior in this case?
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its generated by python
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> I'm writing about https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/dbe6d8cb293ea7452c0d4f6613b60f591bbd7c48/src/engine/shared/protocol_ex.h
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> I can kind of see that it is, but I'd better check
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Neither the server nor the client cares about the actual order. These are translated to uuids at the protocol level
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Okay, thanks, I kind of figured out how it works with debugging server and client
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yahoo.de is missing A records: https://yahoo.de/
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is discarding the return of a write somehow insane? Am I missing something?
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> write(2) that is
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you don't care about whether it worked or not, it's okay
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't have much in the way of resolving the situation if it didn't
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can always crash the process. but I agree that gnu is insane here by not recognizing the `(void)` idiom
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think we can turn that warning off
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can just return it upwards and ignore it there, maybe that way it'll stop warning
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In most cases where it's used it's actually useful. Like a socket() or fopen() being ignored
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But a write, I honestly don't know what they were thinking
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I agree with them there that crashing is preferable to ignoring, if we think that it should always succeed
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> however, I disagree that `(void)` shouldn't silence the warning
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think clang handles this correctly
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so we could silence the warning on GNU, I guess
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that's hard, I guess
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So, should I assert or not that's the question
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do we think it can ever fail?
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if not, I'd write an assert
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't have a strong opinion on it
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's just how I'd do it
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how bout at least add an dbg msg
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm fairly sure it can't ever fail without a catastrophic failure in the kernel or gross user error
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> sounds like a should u check the return of a malloc type of error^^
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh there is one insane fail condition that ignoring would make sense in. If the pipe is full. Since all the info is to be discarded anyway there is no point writing, might as well ignore it, there is already stuff there to trigger select() to return
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How the pipe would get full is beyond me though
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then it's fine to ignore I guess
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do whatever you want
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can we pls remove this
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1025860694039597269/unknown.png
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its no error and nobody cares
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and it spams the console hard
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1025861214007472218/unknown.png
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1025861251634561034/unknown.png
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea, these shouldnt be in console_output_level `0`
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> change `dbg_msg` to `log_debug` or `log_trace`
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can u bcs u added it xd
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> xd
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no i can do it too, i'm just mad that SDL stuff never works under windows so i rq coding again
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> apparently u cannot kill a window under windows after only 1-2 frames were rendered... i cannot imagine it otherwise
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's the windows way, stuff that's completely arbitrary from the perspective of the user
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'm already mad that u cannot just open a msg box lmao xd
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> windows fullscreen is so weird, windows has no more control over exclusive fullscreen windows
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and the drivers apparently dont have enough control over the windows compositor to render stuff
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so basically they cancel each other out
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly, that's how I understand exclusive fullscreen on any OS. Isn't that like the point? The app that has exclusive fullscreen basically controls everything rendered on the screen
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhhhhhhhhhhhhh
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> linux solved it and it still has better input times
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's already bizarre to me that you seem to be able to render stuff on top of exclusive fullscreen apps under X
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but imagine it like this
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So bizarre that I wasn't even sure if what linux has nowadays is even exclusive fullscreen
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u dont render stuff from WM
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u have 100% exclusive
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there is a popup
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u have fullscreen(looks like before) but not exclusive
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u dont get 10 seconds black screen like on windows when going from fullscreen to minimize it should easily work
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean it might not be 10000000=% exclusive fullscreen
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but some if(hasevent) check cannot be a reason to not do it like linux does it
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Problem as far as I understand it is that that used to entail a mode change for the longest time, I don't even know when the requirement really went away
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this can never cause so much perf decrease
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like when you get a popup the app that had exclusive fullscreen now becomes borderless fullscreen on linux?
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, there is the same amount of information going to the monitor
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean just for the few moments another event is there, but yes
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think linux also calls it direct scanout
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok wayland calls it like that
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but they still force vsync
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> evil
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What I thought was that in this special mode that is exclusive fullscreen, there is no intermediate handling anything, it's like GDI handing the control of the entire framebuffer to your application. Or an example in linux would be going from tty to X, even when this doesn't involve a change of mode it still gets that black screen in between.
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should investigate it more, I honestly don't know much about the lowest layer of the graphics stack in either linux or windows
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just wonder why?
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean if X does nothing than just do a simple if(event) check for every swap in buffers
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it should be fair enough shouldnt it?
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in the end if x writes the framebuffer or other software does that really matter?
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they can simply switch whenever they like
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought the idea was avoiding an extra copy of the framebuffer. E.g. your software copies to a buffer in x, x copies the buffer to the driver, vs your software copies it directly to the driver
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Again, I'm not sure, that's just the mental model I had for it for the longest time when thinking about the difference between exclusive and windowed fullscreen
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok but then, why would x even get the framebuffer in first place, why not let the driver handle the x code
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i see them more as the same
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in the end its some call to the gpu kernel drm stuff
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the WM needs to decorate the window, cursors need to be drawn over it, there might be popups to render above it
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If X isn't inbetween, e.g. you have direct access to the driver, nothing can be rendered on top
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes i understand that, but then again just switch ur app between app only and window manager + framebuffer of the windowed game
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but tbh... why would a video mode change ever cause such blackscreens anyway?
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is the monitor processor so slow?
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean we are in 2022
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nobody can tell me init 4mb buffers takes 3 seconds
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That part I have 0 clue about, it might have something to do with legacy signalling standards
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like need to wait 100 vblanks before sending any new video so CRT tvs can catch up or sth
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lmao
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well who knows
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i ofc also dunno what linux does internally, or what monitors do
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but from my naive point of view i dont see a reason for it
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> at least not such times
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or maybe there are some signalling constraints, the monitor has to sync up to the signal properly, for which some sort of clock recovery needs to take place, that can take a while to settle
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u not changing resolution i'd also just render 16bit colors in the 32bit colorspace
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs why should this cause a video change
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No change in resolution usually does result in no blackscreen nowadays, so something did get better somewhere along the way 😄
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but windows for example does it, everytime for exclusive fullscreen, for some ppl even 3 seconds or more
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> now we at the start of our discussion again i know
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i simply cannot imagine a good reason
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought that didn't happen for you, does it?
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but windows updates also take 10-20 minutes
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that's also not logical to me ^^
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on windows for me it does it for like half a second
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but yes i also get this
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on linux i dont get any of that
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and funnily enough, we meassured input lag with a arduino light sensor and linux was faster or equally fast as windows in ddnet
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it's not like linux trades anything for it
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (the light sensor has 8khz refresh rate)
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This one I can actually explain, it's the shitty unefficient format of the delivered updates, they come in these small chunks that independently install and each create a rollback point so at any error during the installation it can be undone
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok, i just wonder why they dont improve it xD
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this cant be the best microsoft came up with
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> after 25 years of making OS
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No need to, it works, it worked for decades, they just do the updates when people don't use the computer and they heavily background it incase they have to coincide with computer use
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's also a profit seeking entity, if faster updates isn't something people would pay extra for, why bother?
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> everytime i start windows i can a big update.. so probs all 6 months xDDD
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and then the grant waiting starts
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you are absolutly right
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats probs their logic
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well do you boot into windows every day? Most of their users do, so they probably get smaller wait times at boot instead of one huge chunk like dual booters which make up a very small amount of microsoft clients 😛
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah ^^
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I'm actually interested in how windows and linux handle exclusive fullscreen differently, I'll dig a bit into it
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> At work I still saw this problem: Person comes back after long vacation, important meeting on first day, and Windows update decides to run at that time and person can't present for 20 minutes
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or are you talking about the time before update runs?
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice, i can just tell ya, with KDE compositor with some effect that requires bit of GPU work, it's defs slower if the window renders some overlay, e.g. alt+tab overlay
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it defs changes in between them "silently" 😄
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, don't big corporations just do their updates completely on patch tuesdays? I thought that was how they kept the corpospace happy
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> IT does updates on tuesday night through group policy, policy restarts computers completing the full update, then shuts them all down.
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I must admit I've never been in any corporation of significant size 😄
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> They came a bit later, but the updates still nagged me and if you don't react quickly enough they happen automatically
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and can't be turned off because of company policy I guess
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, maybe just suppress them until the very end of the work-day?
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How on earth did I break the integration test? :/
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They only fail on CI too, that's excellent
