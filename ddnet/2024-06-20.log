01:41 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> open sourceonaut sharing code
01:56 <+bridge> <Ewan> amazing
05:44 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sos any go devs awake i need some pointers hihi
05:44 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/Gz
05:45 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> It prints ``setting token: [0 0 0 0]\nmessages: [{[255 255 255 255]}]`` but i want ``setting token: [0 0 0 0]\nmessages: [{[0 0 0 0]}]``
06:04 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oke made it work https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/Zr
06:05 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> seems like golang is bitchy about modifing while looping. I thought its an easy language.

09:25 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> Is it possible to add a tooltip when hover over an input?
11:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when you hover your hand over your mouse, you want a tooltip in real life
11:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or how should i read your question? XD
11:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> text input?
11:36 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo: anything is possible if you code it
11:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> esp. with AR coder tsfreddie
11:36 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> what's a AR coder
11:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but you do virtual reality i guess.. but it's close
11:36 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> oh
11:37 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> like literally AR
11:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> augmented reality
11:37 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> but ye, I do VR mostly
11:37 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> not for long tho
11:37 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i wouldn't make anything VR if i don't have to work here
11:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> shots fired :lol:
11:38 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
11:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wait for nerve gear before i jump into the VR hype
11:38 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> plus I proably can't after leaving
11:38 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> some no-competing clause
11:38 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> things
11:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah yeah
11:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sucks
11:38 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> yup
11:38 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> valve is working on that
11:39 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> i could make it work for clear button
11:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok dunno if we already have that.. but shouldnt be hard i guess
11:40 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> @jupeyy_keks are you the minimum invasive brain interface type of guy or full only neurolink type of guy
11:40 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> @jupeyy_keks are you the minimum invasive brain interface type of guy or full on neurolink type of guy
11:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah hack my full brain to make me think i fly
11:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess it depends on the medical risk
11:41 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i guess too bad then
11:41 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> valve is only working on minimum invasive type
11:41 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> https://starfishneuroscience.com/team/
11:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean if it works well, fine to me too üòÑ
11:42 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> also gaben lost some serious weight
11:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> man gabe lost quite some pounds
11:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao
11:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> LOL
11:43 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> looking good tho
11:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
11:43 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> nice to know the PC overlord is about to live longer
11:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he owns more shares on my money than me
11:44 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I actually didn't realise he already is quite thin in that half-life documentary
12:08 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> it's actually possible, i was just in a cave man mode
12:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> morning peeps
12:13 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> it's actually possible, i was just in a caveman mode
12:20 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> norming

14:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> good afternoon
14:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
14:51 <+bridge> <0xdeen> How is the "Leak IP" in favorites tab supposed to work? It's not working for me and I can't find anything in the code that would make it work
14:52 <+bridge> <0xdeen> @heinrich5991 I think you implemented it, maybe it broke at some point?
14:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it only works if master server list is not fetched at all
14:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tbh we can also just remove that option, at least from GUI XD
14:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> except the idea was to use them for favorite servers that are not registered, but that then never worked i guess, so nobody seems to be missing it üòÑ
14:56 <+bridge> <0xdeen> I think we should fetch the IPs from all of your favorite communities by default
14:56 <+bridge> <0xdeen> IPs -> pings
14:57 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Because having out of date pings means people who sort by ping will never join a location again
14:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh we should defs use some kind of median for pings in the server browser
14:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i understand that pings are nice, but i dunno if i like having support for connectionless packets at all
14:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> outside of LAN
15:41 <+bridge> <murpi> Maybe relevant: `leak_ip_address_to_all_servers` in F1
15:43 <+bridge> <murpi> Although that doesn't seem to work on all servers
15:46 <+bridge> <murpi> Hmm, that seems to ping every server displayed in the currently active tab
16:05 <+bridge> <robyt3> Seems like the Favorite Leak IP feature broke at some point, the `m_FavoriteAllowPing` variable is not read anywhere except to update the checkbox
16:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh ok, but i am still pretty sure it only ever worked when the server list was not present at all
16:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it was present no server info was fetched
16:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and thus no ping was created

19:42 <+bridge> <AssassinTee> We had one colleage, who just disappeared one day. We later found out, that he went to become priest in the netherlands. This is very common for programmers üôà

21:29 <+bridge> <Ewan> awesome
21:29 <+bridge> <Ewan> so i've been having an issue with my internet today and yesterday
21:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> i got fed up and called my ISP just now because i was sick of messing around with the AI chatbot and it trying to tell me that everything was operational or it was my ethernet cable acting up or whatever (even though everything on the network was not behaving)
21:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> i got the nicest lady on the phone, who was able to deduce that it was somehow our wifi range extender's fault & sure enough I unplugged it and everything started working
21:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> and she was also able to order us one of the OEM wifi extenders free of charge
21:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> but i wonder how this happens out of nowhere, the configuration didn't change at all
21:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> but i guess somehow our xfinity gateway thought the range extender was the actual gateway and was trying to make outbound connections through that
21:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> i guess a firmware bug or something
21:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> but it was super weird, in 20-30 minute intervals our internet would switch between operational/not operational, connection to the gateway itself was fine but internet connections could not be made while it wasn't behaving. we could keep existing connections via. IP like to ddnet game servers and the spotify user session api stuff, but making any new connection or DNS request would fail
21:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> very bizarre, never seen it before
22:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u play ddnet with wifi?
22:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> No
22:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so it just destroyed ur whole internet? XD
22:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> the ISP-provided modem that I was connected to via. ethernet thought it was a router connected to another gateway, the range extender
22:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> pretty much
22:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> that‚Äôs my guess at least, no idea how it happens otherwise. sometimes you can set gateway IP manually
22:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> but i didn‚Äôt touch it
23:22 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> is there a way to know if someone has a certain weapon inside demos in vanilla gamemodes?
23:57 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> No
