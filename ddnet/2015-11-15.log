15:53 < BrokeYourServer> Hello Guy's :)
15:53 <@EastByte> hi
15:54 < BrokeYourServer> I hacked your Server.
15:54 <+Learath2> thx m8
15:54 < BrokeYourServer> np :)
15:55 <+Learath2> btw the apostrophe there is completely wrong. the smiley obv doesn't belong to the Guy
15:55 <@heinrich5991> he's talking to the smile of guy :)
15:55 <@EastByte> grammar nazi
15:56 < BrokeYourServer> Poland :)
15:56 <+Learath2> I learned from heinrich
15:57 <@EastByte> that was a kind hacker
15:57 <+Learath2> well we didnt get to learn what he hacked
15:59 <+Learath2> well if he actually did hack anything I probably annoyed him and am sorry for anything he does
17:53 <+ochristi> why are you attracting those crazy people like flies?
18:14 <@EastByte> ochristi: they aren't crazy, just trolls :p
20:45 <+ochristi> isn't that a subset of crazy?
