01:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Uhm are you out of ram? Idk what killed means during compilation. I get the same in my ddnet++ CI and am wondering for years how to fix it
01:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But same spelling. Also woah! Is it you? Marius?
01:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I guess you are the imposter not him. Did you know that the name was already in use?
01:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Unless you want to modify the client the binary releases of chillerbot-ux might help you. I am sorry I have no idea how to fix your issue :/
01:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Omg so the myth about the shotgun scrolling bind might be true? :D
01:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
01:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Decades ago some vanilla player claimed he found a way to switch weapons faster with a config file
01:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah no it’s a suggestion nvm.
01:31 < bridge> <Ewan> where's the source for the skin db server>
01:31 < bridge> <Ewan> where's the source for the skin db server?
01:32 < bridge> <learath2> there is no server, it's just a web page, should be in ddnet-web
01:32 < bridge> <Ewan> neat
01:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s this hype no code technology everyone is talking about
01:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 0 LoC skin db
01:36 < bridge> <Ewan> so true
01:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i saw skins.tw had an actual api at some point and assumed ddnet had one too
01:37 < bridge> <Ewan> but i guess theirs is all above and beyond
01:37 < bridge> <Ewan> used by 0 people
01:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> api could be more complicated than a regular web index
01:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> U can still list all and get by name via curl smoothly
01:38 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
01:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just search is annoying
01:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That’s where folders come in handy
01:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> a/ b/ c/ might also help with disk lookup speed
01:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Time to build yet another skin db using kubernetes and seaweedfs having an totally overengineered api https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs
01:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think they built seaweed at teeskins back in the days to solve their scaling issues
01:51 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
01:51 < bridge> <Ewan> enterprise scale skin lookup demand
02:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki sos ``void ClipEnable(const CUIRect *pRect);`` has no doc comment and idk wat it do
02:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pls fix
02:46 < bridge> <learath2> I think it might enable clip
02:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what is clip
03:00 < bridge> <Ewan> only render inside the boundary of pRect
03:00 < bridge> <Ewan> or only act inside that rect
03:00 < bridge> <Ewan> idk what context
03:04 < bridge> <Ewan> love flask
03:05 < bridge> <Ewan> it lets me make skin db server in low loc
03:17 < bridge> <Ewan> anyone change anything related to mouse grab recently? my mouse keeps leaving the game window when it shouldn't
03:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I still think ClipEnable is in desperate need of a doc comment!!!
03:23 < bridge> <Ewan> true
03:23 < bridge> <Ewan> why are we not adding doc comments for everything 🤔
03:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> too much work
03:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan but sure go ahead! Go as far as you can get. Would be amazing!!!!
03:58 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
03:58 < bridge> <Ewan> no thanks
03:58 < bridge> <Ewan> should just write them as the functions are added
05:31 < bridge> <Ewan> is http over libcurl being explicitly disabled in the client?
05:32 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller what time is it for u
05:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i wonder if libcurl in ddnet-libs should also provide curl-config executable
05:42 < bridge> <Ewan> didn't notice we have -DWEBSOCKETS. do any servers make use of it
05:46 < bridge> <Ewan> oh cool found `g_Config.m_HttpAllowInsecure`
06:03 < bridge> <Ewan> this can be fixed by turning on the `SDL_HINT_MOUSE_RELATIVE_MODE_WARP` hint
07:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan 
07:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1707113708.png
07:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan official ddnet servers had websocket support at some point so that the browser clients could connect to them
07:17 < bridge> <Ewan> 1231 dam
07:18 < bridge> <Ewan> i set up a skin proxy at `https://uniqueclan.net/skin/`

07:19 < bridge> <Ewan> and soon there will be one that contains all the skins in this pack https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/818975163680555028/837798631587184691/2000_skins_ddnet.rar?ex=65cfcfc7&is=65bd5ac7&hm=c9c908c432e298e1bccac82815355e7b7b098933a319d4d0711e785b1d43b303&
07:19 < bridge> <Ewan> but i need my host to give me a subdomain proxied through cloudflare so i can do https without messing with certs
07:19 < bridge> <Ewan> waiting on that rn but otherwise it's all set up
07:19 < bridge> <Ewan> so if u set ur community skin link to this then it will basically be able to find any skin in existence...
07:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this works ``./DDNet "$HOME/.teeworlds/maps/tmp/test.map"`` this does not ``./DDNet "tmp/test.map"`` is that intentional? Imo relative paths should look into all storage locations
08:07 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> Why would it look into other game's storage path, not like those games are the same:Pepechill: , it can't load tw7 maps anyway iirc
08:24 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i compile this on debian ?
08:24 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> https://github.com/headshot2017/teeware-mod
08:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> with cmake gives me this
08:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>  cmake ..
08:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> CMake Error: The source directory "/home/mamad/teeware/teeware-mod" does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt.
08:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and with bam it gives me this
08:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> bam
08:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> [string "src/base.lua"]:38: this file for version 0.4.x of bam. you are running 0.5.x.
08:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> bam: script error (-t for more detail)
08:28 < bridge> <Ewan> you need to use an older version of bam
08:28 < bridge> <matodor> try compile bam 0.4.0 from https://github.com/matricks/bam/releases/tag/v0.4.0
08:28 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> isn't there any other options, like pass something like bam -4
08:28 < bridge> <Ewan> unlikely
08:31 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> https://matricks.github.io/bam/bam.html#2
08:31 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> howto build
08:31 < bridge> <Ewan> how to run a script lol
08:31 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> :tear:
08:31 < bridge> <Ewan> fwiw
08:31 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
08:31 < bridge> <Ewan> git clone https://github.com/matricks/bam/
08:31 < bridge> <Ewan> cd bam
08:32 < bridge> <Ewan> git checkout v0.4.0
08:32 < bridge> <Ewan> make_unix.sh
08:32 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
08:32 < bridge> <Ewan> and then u have bam 0.4
08:32 < bridge> <Ewan> i think it does an in source build
08:33 < bridge> <Ewan> it will just poop out a file called bam in the root directory of the repo
08:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is there some proper way of sharing functionality between the editor and a client component?
08:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its tile layer touching code and i am porting a method that exists in camera.cpp into editor.cpp and as of right now i just duplicated the code and it works fine i just wonder where i would store this shared code once
08:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i did ./bam and now the file name bam is gone, also it gave me this
08:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```sh
08:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
08:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> bam: 'bam' error 256
08:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> bam: 'bam' removed because job updated it even it failed.
08:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> bam: error: a build step failed
08:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
08:47 < bridge> <Ewan> ls
08:47 < bridge> <Ewan> oh
08:47 < bridge> <Ewan> you had a build error
08:47 < bridge> <Ewan> it deleted itself?
08:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ls
08:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```sh
08:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> bam.lua   license.txt   make_win32_dmc.bat    make_winx64_msvc2005.bat  tests

08:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
08:48 < bridge> <Ewan> bizarre
08:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> after i run ./bam
08:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Anime.pdf if i start ddnet i get ``2024-02-05 15:47:46 I storage: added path '$USERDIR' ('/home/chiller/.teeworlds')`` its not another game. And yes ddnet can open 0.7 maps these days
08:48 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller do u know why bam is deleting itself
08:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just download my legit bam binary
08:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/crack/bam4
08:49 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
08:49 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hah
08:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> linux only ofc
08:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan anti virus maybe
08:49 < bridge> <Ewan> he is on debian
08:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:gigachad:960830678465933403>
08:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then my link works for him
08:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> enjoy the bitcoin miner
08:49 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> let me try it
08:56 < bridge> <Ewan> just to clarify this happened when u tried to build ur thing right
08:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> wdym
08:57 < bridge> <Ewan> teeware
08:58 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> no, i litraly run  ./bam  on the bam directory
08:58 < bridge> <Ewan> why
08:58 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> did i done something wring ?
08:58 < bridge> <Ewan> you're trying to build teeware right?
08:58 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> did i done something wrong ?
08:58 < bridge> <Ewan> why would you run bam in the bam source directory
08:58 < bridge> <Ewan> you should run it in the teeware dir
08:59 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 😂
08:59 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> like this  ./bam  teewaredirectory  ?
09:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> let me try again then 😂
09:02 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> right ?
09:02 < bridge> <matodor> put bam into teewaredirectory  and try ./bam
09:02 < bridge> <matodor> put bam into teewaredirectory  and try ./bam
09:02 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ok
09:07 < bridge> <Ewan> matricks is barbaric
09:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> fatal error: SDL.h: No such file or directory
09:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>  #include "SDL.h"
09:08 < bridge> <Ewan> did u install sdl and development libraries
09:08 < bridge> <Ewan> i think we went thru something similar for another teeworlds mod a few months ago xd
09:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i already build ddnet in it
09:09 < bridge> <Ewan> built ddnet in what
09:09 < bridge> <Ewan> on the debian machine?
09:09 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> in the same machine
09:09 < bridge> <Ewan> this is probably another case of SDL1 vs 2
09:09 < bridge> <Ewan> like last time
09:10 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet doesn't depend on SDL, it depends on SDL2
09:10 < bridge> <Ewan> but older mods or mods based on an old version of Teeworlds/DDNet will depend on SDL
09:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jopsti i found the ultimate productivity hack for quitting ddnet ``ctrl+c ctrl+z``
09:10 < bridge> <Ewan> lol ya
09:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't run ddnet in terminal doe
09:10 < bridge> <Ewan> or i would just & > /dev/null
09:10 < bridge> <Ewan> disown
09:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i think i must make a headless build ?
09:10 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
09:10 < bridge> <Ewan> server only
09:11 < bridge> <Ewan> is this a computer at ur house or a server you're renting
09:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``bam4 server_release``
09:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bam enjoyer chiler dreggen
09:12 < bridge> <Ewan> btw mamad u can put bam4 in a dir which is in ur path and then just type bam4 for in the future
09:12 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ./bam server ?
09:13 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i afraid of deleting bam again D
09:14 < bridge> <Ewan> just `mv bam4 /usr/local/bin`
09:14 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> only 10 days remains of the vps im using, but yeah
09:14 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
09:16 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i need to workout my brain, im tired of being forget things
09:18 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hora, i build it 🙂
09:18 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> now im happy
09:18 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
09:18 < bridge> <Ewan> are you using aws?
09:18 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what is aws ?
09:18 < bridge> <Ewan> amazon web services
09:19 < bridge> <Ewan> arguably the biggest server host
09:19 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> no
09:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i see
09:19 < bridge> <Ewan> well i was gonna say, last time I used AWS youcould can re-use the same credit card info for infinite free trials as long as you use a different account each time
09:19 < bridge> <Ewan> well i was gonna say, last time I used AWS you could re-use the same credit card info for infinite free trials as long as you use a different account each time
09:21 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i use this: Tejarat Pardaz Mahan Novin , some shitty company in my country
09:21 < bridge> <marciuk4> Cz someone comes from Poland
09:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> you found a bug
09:22 < bridge> <Ewan> an oversight 😃
09:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i can't put sv_register ipv4 in teeware cfg mod right ?
09:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and the server won't register with sv_register 1
09:27 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but you can join
09:28 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> bro, the music in teeware mod is masterpiece
09:31 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> @headshotnoby are you made the musics on the map of teeware mod ?
09:39 < bridge> <headshotnoby> no, most of them are from WarioWare games
09:39 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can you touch the sky in teeware  ?
09:40 < bridge> <headshotnoby> you have infinite jump, spam spacebar
09:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i want to steal your ninja ai for my block server 😄
09:47 < bridge> <Ewan> pve block would go crazy
09:49 < bridge> <Ewan> :gigachad:
09:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i register it tho ? it gave me this with this config sv_port 8304, sv_register 1

09:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and also how can i make it automatically check for an empty port to run itself ?
09:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> u can use 0 to let os choose the port
09:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> maybe :justatest:
10:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: did u make this? XDDD
10:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1203988527377948672/102901552.png?ex=65d318b1&is=65c0a3b1&hm=7cd83146a6c9b1d9b127496b5c22629d53f30ab90c16386cf187d395f220b058&
10:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> I never Had to specify the Port when it was Just one Server running, it defaults to 8303
10:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i have two right now
10:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> I think the Range is between 8303-8310 iirc
10:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> in ddnet.org it said when you put sv_port 0 it automatically find empty port between 0_10, but when i tried, sv was made but it's now available at any of those ports
10:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i see what port it's using 🙂
10:07 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i didn't find it on the text it dumps
10:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> It should say :registered to Port 8303-8310 No? I mean youre running a tw Server, Not ddnet, assuming it Looks for the tw master Server, so idk - chillerdragon? ^
10:10 < bridge> <meloƞ> Also why is autocorrect so damn ass, what is it with These comma Placements :pepeW:
10:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> `lsof -i -a -p $(pidof path/to/executable)` :nouis:

10:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i wrote it
10:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i can break only because u looked at it wrong
10:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean stable as in stable api not stable runtime
10:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> are you happy with the format?
10:18 < bridge> <headshotnoby> xd sure chillerbot.png is lyfe
10:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no proof
10:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yea, it will be ~ instead of ^

10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller u python
10:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wot pyson
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> u do it
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> often
10:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> id say a normal amount
10:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my biggest proj is probably this https://gitlab.com/teeworlds-network/twnet_parser
10:23 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is there a way that i tell the teeworlds based to do register on ipv4 ChillerDragon ?
10:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dont think so
10:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that is only a ddnet feature
10:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sv_register ipv4
10:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its quite new too
10:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> Ddnet Superiority !!!!
10:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can tell your linux to not use ipv6 tho @mamad_melanin 
10:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://www.golinuxcloud.com/linux-disable-ipv6/
10:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/default/disable_ipv6``
10:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6``
10:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> every time i use sv_register 1 i cant find my server on list, but with sv_register ipv4 it works perfectly
10:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the # means run as root not copy paste then its a comment xd
10:25 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller i forgot
10:25 < bridge> <matodor> bro nice example

10:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i was gonna ask for review but my thing was not on the internet yet
10:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @mamad_melanin its teeworlds based? i guess then ipv4 gets casted to 0 xd so that shouldnt list at all?
10:25 < bridge> <Ewan> can u review very short 30 lines i just don't python often so idk if im missing something obvious <https://github.com/ewancg/skin-fetch-server/blob/master/app.py>
10:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @matodor <:justatest:572499997178986510>
10:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i think so cus there is no more warning about register
10:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan ur missing type annotations :P 
10:27 < bridge> <Ewan> i can be explicit ?
10:27 < bridge> <Ewan> it's like rust right

12:03 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
12:10 < bridge> <Ewan> hi skeith
12:11 < bridge> <syrinok> @robyt3 Favorites should definitely ignore community filters, having the internet TAB be whatever you have filtered out, having your favorites be a more specific selection of servers you enjoy, and then having specific community tabs would be the best of all worlds I'd imagine.
12:11 < bridge> <syrinok> Hi Ewan
12:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> We might need something 0.7 introduced already: Custom tabs with custom filter options.
12:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Like that everybody could create their own DDNet or KoG tab
12:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I think the favourites tab should also stay filterable tbh.
12:18 < bridge> <syrinok> Internet tab - See everything
12:18 < bridge> <syrinok> Favorites tab - See specific servers out of a range of communities
12:18 < bridge> <syrinok> Community tabs - See only the specific community
12:20 < bridge> <syrinok> Internet tab - See everything (Or filter to see whatever you want)
12:20 < bridge> <syrinok> Favorites tab - See specific servers out of a range of communities
12:20 < bridge> <syrinok> Community tabs - See only the specific community
12:20 < bridge> <Ewan> agreed
12:20 < bridge> <Ewan> having the community filters apply to all tabs was a pretty weird idea
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You should create GH issue
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But recently robyte made a huge change
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno if communities are still in filters
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But maybe they will be moved out anyway
13:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> Is it possible to merge this If there arent any Changes to be requested? He closed it because it was His First PR and was confusing himself :owo: #7873

16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> edlang exists there
16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> and ddnet
16:18 < bridge> <robyt3> Prefer using a separate branch for each PR instead of making the changes directly on your master branch, or it becomes harder to update the branch later

16:18 < bridge> <pilonpl> for this kind of feature
16:19 < bridge> <teero777> Its fake... Try putting in chars it doesn't support...
16:19 < bridge> <robyt3> 0.7 filters feel too complicated to set up and use for users IMO, they are also really inefficient on 0.7 and the only reason the client is still usable is because the number of default filter groups is only 3
16:20 < bridge> <teero777> Its fake... Try putting in chars that don't exist on the page....
16:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> thanks for the cool community tabs btw @robyt3 ❤️
16:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and the communities before that
16:20 < bridge> <diariesvexar> I'm really noob in using github but i'll try to do it on new branch and ask someone before PR it
16:21 < bridge> <diariesvexar> I'm really noob in using git but i'll try to do it on new branch and ask someone before PR it
16:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> thinking about communities: what do you think about only allowing communities of certain size get shown in the filter box?
16:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it doesn't really make sense to filter for a community with like 1 or 2 servers
16:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or to have a tab just for that, I guess
16:22 < bridge> <robyt3> I'm not sure how the filter would work in the end, I guess we would show another proxy element "Other" in all filters which works to filter the small communities, or "none" also includes the small communities, which would be weird
16:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, unclear how that should work
16:24 < bridge> <robyt3> Makes sense I guess, other opinions on this? Slightly weird how the community filters are the same for Internet and Favorites tabs, but so are all the others filters, right?
16:25 < bridge> <robyt3> If you say it's more convenient for most users because they don't filter favorites by communities/countries/types then we can also no show those filters there.
16:25 < bridge> <robyt3> If you say it's more convenient for most users because they don't filter favorites by communities/countries/types then we can also not show those filters there.
16:26 < bridge> <syrinok> I think favorites should be used for servers you 100% want to always see, seems the most fitting, so having filters affect it seems weird to me
16:27 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems like an argument to remove all filters for favorites though?
16:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe the problem goes away with community tabs? @syrinok
16:27 < bridge> <syrinok> You could remove filters from the favorite tab, ya.
16:28 < bridge> <syrinok> Well, I want to see every **official** community server, rather than seeing servers hosted by random people, but I do occasionally want to favorite some servers that people host, which filters conflict with that
16:29 < bridge> <syrinok> I have to flick the filters on / off accordingly, and I'd imagine most people would want to always see their favorites
16:35 < bridge> <syrinok> If this was changed, it would feel like having the old system back, and just be an upgrade since you can now select which communities you want to be tabs
16:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> you can hit me up in a PM if you need help with anything specific
16:38 < bridge> <diariesvexar> sure tnx ❤️
16:43 < bridge> <pilonpl> i think /setcp, /loadcp commands would be useful for saving the position of a single tee and for whole teams i think there should be a command too. it could even be /save, just change its behavior when in practice mode
16:48 < bridge> <bts._.> you can pretty much achieve the same thing with `/tp` and `/lasttp`
16:49 < bridge> <pilonpl> i guess
16:51 < bridge> <pilonpl> but a dedicated command would be more convenient
16:52 < bridge> <pilonpl> and saving positions of a team would be useful too
16:52 < bridge> <pilonpl> when practicing with dummy

19:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> true
19:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://tenor.com/view/maid-dance-black-man-twerk-dance-twerk-gif-26318377
19:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can bench 80k rn
19:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can bench 80kg rn
19:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> probs more but im scared
19:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> you can bench 80000 whole grams? thats... a big number! - (nah fr 80 is pretty cool, i think i maxed out 90 once and almost died after 1 1/2 reps)
19:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> when i started my arms trembled with just the bar (20kg xd)
19:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> my friend does 105kg rn
19:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> but he ripped af
19:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> everyone who can bench over 100kg's scares me
19:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> they could just come and pick me up
19:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill do it soon
19:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> in 5 months maybe
19:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
19:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
19:43 < bridge> <teero777> i can. but it takes lon
19:43 < bridge> <teero777> i can. but it takes long
19:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> the best i can offer is 2 hours of sleep, 600mg of caffeine and 3 lines of coke to bench 95 on 10 reps
19:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can deadlift 125kg rn but i havent done much
19:43 < bridge> <learath2> everyone who can bench over 70kg scares me, they could just come and pick me up
19:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if he's a rust dev you better dont mention c/c++ in front of him
19:44 < bridge> <teero777> stops inbetween sets are used to code C kernel
19:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> 10 reps is insane tho
19:44 < bridge> <teero777> stops inbetween sets are used to code C
19:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> yeah i went to the gym activly for almost 4 years
19:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> and then i got married
19:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> :/
19:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> i hope if i ever get someone i keep going
19:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> my friend has a gf and still goes
19:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr how old r u
19:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> we talked about that a afew months back
19:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> we're the same age my guy
19:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> wtf
19:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u married?
19:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> u speeding life
19:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> my kid just turned 7200 minutes old
19:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> so i got that going for me aswell
19:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> (i dont know where the pause button is, help)
19:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> ? nah the 2 minutes inbetween sets are for leetcode problems on algebra
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn a kid too
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i doubt i wanna marry ever, a gf sure, also i wouldnt think about kids till 30+
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> love is nice and all, but downfall happens
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> 50% of marriages go south xD
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> and marriage implies legal stuff for ur assets etc
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw my parents arent married
19:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> Meh, i am her parents favourite child :gigachad:
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr anyway, make sure to teach him/her about rust
19:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> (im the Tech Guy who fixes the Internet and stuff)
19:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> On age 5 she'll learn Rust simply to Code ddnet 2.0
19:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
19:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> read the rust book each night :kek:
19:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> im sure she will fall asleep  fast
19:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> KEKW
19:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> :KEKW:
19:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> Okay *Insert childs Name* today WE Talk about ownership in Rust :owo:
19:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> doesnt he/she dare to skip fearless concurrency part
19:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> my kid will learn about edlang
19:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> 🇹🇩
19:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> *dad why do i have to learn this - i wanna become a GO Developer*
19:51 < bridge> <cyberfighter> Your kid has less hours on life than i have hours on ddnet

22:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> btw am I killing your server or my browser with these absurdly expensive queries?
22:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (last one took 88 seconds)
22:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> no, its normal
22:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> my server has 12 threads and it uses at most 6
22:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what I meant is: is it running on the server or in my browser?
22:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
22:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > A timeout occurred
22:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> server

22:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I suppose the query was too expensive
22:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah sadly happens
22:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```sql
22:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> SELECT ranking, percent_rank, time, map FROM (
22:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991>   SELECT RANK() OVER w AS ranking, PERCENT_RANK() OVER w as percent_rank, time, name, map
22:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991>   FROM (
22:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991>     SELECT map, name, MIN(time) AS time
22:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991>     FROM race
22:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991>     GROUP BY name, map
22:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991>   )
22:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991>   GROUP BY name, map
22:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991>   WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY map ORDER BY time)

22:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think this is the correct query, but I can't run it @corneum
22:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure what to do
22:37 < bridge> <corneum> Hmm (

23:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ddnet extensions?
23:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I haven't seen good wasm plugin systems yet, so I'd currently go with lua or JS
23:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i don't think plugin systems make sense with WASM
23:19 < bridge> <learath2> I'm a luajit enjoyer
23:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is lua memory unsafe?
23:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else i don't see any reason to ever use it over wasm
23:22 < bridge> <learath2> you just said you don't think plugin systems make sense with wasm
23:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs wasm is memory safe
23:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so you have to serialize memory
23:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> plugin system for me sounds like u want to change single functions
23:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sharing memory with guest for a single function is always lot of overhead
23:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> plugin systems are not rarely using memsafe languages though
23:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. in browsers
23:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or in wow
23:32 < bridge> <itom6176> Hi, i have a little question about the editor. Currently its not possible to move Tele. So if i missed a Tele between 6 and 7 i cant move 7 to 8 and add a new 7 tele. Its pretty annoying when you have like 50 teles and need to move teles one by one. For envelopes its already possible, why not for Tele? I would be so greatful if that would be added to the editor 🙂
23:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And why would u go with lua then?
23:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Rust compiles to wasm. Lua is an own language
23:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I haven't seen a usable wasm plugin system yet
23:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you know one?
23:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I've seen usable plugin/extension systems with lua
23:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. factorio
23:44 < bridge> <patiga> cloudflare had a wasm plugin system iirc ^^
23:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd claim ddpg is more then useable, tho I probably wouldn't call it plugin system
23:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But then it was factarios decision
23:46 < bridge> <patiga> https://blog.cloudflare.com/big-pineapple-intro/ this is the blog I had in mind, not sure if applicable
23:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Create GH issue and in best case impingement it your own
23:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah funny blog. I see some experience I also had using wasm
23:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And I agree using same language, especially if it's rust, is a nice to have, most stuff just worked
23:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> where do I need to look first?
23:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What does that mean
23:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> where can I see the wasm stuff in ddpg?
23:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In examples is a project called state
23:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But as said. It's no plugin system
23:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's more a library mod
23:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The whole state is basically just the game state library compiled to wasm
23:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think in game there is some base impl for the trait
