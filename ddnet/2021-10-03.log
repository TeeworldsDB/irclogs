09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Lesson for today: If you're going to allocate a bpf map entry **for each unverified packet**, make sure it's atleast limited to a certain size so it won't fill up the entire RAM, rendering the entire logic for said filter unusable ðŸ˜‰
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Easy solution is BPF_MAP_TYPE_LRU_HASH
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or avoid any allocation for unverified packets if at all possible
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> We allocate the entries to verify challenge
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> ```cpp
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> if(check_ddnet_handshake_header(udp_bytes, data_end)){
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> uint32_t challenge = bpf_get_prandom_u32();
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> bpf_map_update_elem(&ddnet_hashes_list, &challenge, &val BPF_ANY);
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> ```
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> then once we receive the challenge reply, it checks that map to match ip addr & challenge, then deletes the hash from the list
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I've simply changed the type to LRU HASH, that way if the map fills up, it won't cause huge issues
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> and instead "recycle" old entries
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Speaking about xdp
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> $ddos
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> ._. FRA is most certainly under attack right now
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nope, it's not
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Had trouble connecting & staying on
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> but I guess it got mitigated
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No, there is no mitigation active right now and I saw no attack
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> ðŸ¤·
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Just judging by the fact I couldn't connect at all really
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I am currently hacking around with freeze textures because i tend to confuse frozen tees with ninjajetpack or normal ninja does the client know if other tees are frozen?
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> got it https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/4ee5aa585b6bd11f4e12522ca9d6572db460ce05/src/game/client/gameclient.h#L353
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Is this server-sync'ed too?
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i think the client started at some point to reimplement server logic for better prediction
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Just asking as otherwise players could just compile the client, and force isFrozen to false, no?
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I would be very suprised if the client could sync up to the server and tell it about state
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> no \:D
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Good good
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> this is not minecraft haha
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Just wondering as i've actually seen cheat clients for this
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> (mainly people complaining about it in #reports
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> (mainly people complaining about it in #reports)
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i doubt that
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> what did you send?

10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Anyway, time for work.
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> ðŸ‘‹
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> the tw protocol is pretty safe regarding cheats by passing physics
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> iirc, the protocol is mostly just the client sending keyboard input to the server and the server returning a gamestate
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ye
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> how it should be in any sane game
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Itube> chillerdragon: uwu

10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think my old cpu was bottlenecking the gpu
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on dota i got nearly 50 more fps
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i also got new ram at 3200mhz
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from 2933
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i doubt it matters much
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Twice as fast as my i7 6700k (28s)
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with clang?
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, same command as you
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill try with gcc
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i had this too export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, llvm- is not enough
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 20 s then
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 17.7s for me with gcc
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so gcc is slower
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which means clang is even better for development
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> faster iterations

15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 weird behaviour on GER1 server
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> everyone got connection problems
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> without attacks :D after i rejoined it was also fully okay again
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> should i think about endianness while using std streams?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should almost never think about endianness
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> okeey
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A teeworlds data file will have a magic at the top. From which you can determine whether you need to flip or not
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (idk why that approach was taken instead of always saving datafiles little endian and swapping on big endian or vice versa)
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Might be caused by handshake timeout(?)
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah, no sane in this thing
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> meh, 130 clients handshaked
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shiro.> chillerdragon: send ur client version
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ger1 is so laggy rn
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @FÃ¤n
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> dont think i caught it on time
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> got it
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why is it laggy?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> 1 moment
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wow
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> connection problems again
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wtf
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> that's me recompiling the code
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> DUDE
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> D:
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> omg
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i tohught saves are gone
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> well, if people wouldnt throw attacks using protocols from 1998
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> o it
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> towards it
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> this wouldnt happen
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> anyway, there we go
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> just dropping any unknown protocol now
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> ok, good to go now
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you probably fucked a lot of runs with this btw
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> and saved a lot of them in the future
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Rather have it taken care of now than never
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Rather have it taken care of now than never tbh
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I'm surprised how protocols from literally 1998 are being used to attack stuff nowadays
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> who attacked, do you know that?
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> nope, doesnt matter anyway
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is there an attack running rn?
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> nope
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but was?
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> any attack that would affect the server should show up @ $ddos
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> and yes
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> and yes, until I patched that flaw
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh okay
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Code in germany is really far behind as it's quite outdated
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> and can't be updated to up2date until the new router comes on
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> and can't be updated to up2date until the new router comes in
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> still lagging
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> no attack here
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its lagging :D
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Might be you?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> like i said, no attack running
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> $ddos
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> ^
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> more likely the server
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ^^
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i am not lagging
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then it has to be the CPu
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> You mean the CPU running at 10%?
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or some other hardware
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> idk
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its definitely the server
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> https://ddnet.tw/status/
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> considering that most ppl are 19-40ms, atleast as of right now, I don't think anything major is going on
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> have you ever joined and tested yourself?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I am in it right now.
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its not unplayable but there are stutters
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> jumping around with no lags whatsoever.
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> You're also at 38ms
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> ðŸ™‚
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Have you tried reconnecting?
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wont help lol
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Check.
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no im in the run
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I'm jumping around with no lags whatsoever
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Only thing i could think of is that it somehow messed up packet sync or whatever during the time I had to recompile / restart filtering
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> which i've seen a
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> which i've seen happening in source games a lot
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> zooming out a lot makes the game lag
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> only on ger1
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (not the game, but it looks like the traffic doesnt work correctly, still > 500fps)
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Making changes is production just hits differently ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ˜‰
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Making changes in production just hits differently ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ˜‰
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @FÃ¤n seems like ur firewall is not working correctly yet
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Maybe its anti fokkonaut ðŸ˜œ
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Didn't affect much in this case, but we usually only do this during "emergencies"
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> or well, in this case, getting things to run ok
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Yeah ik. I'm just messing with yah. I do it as well on our firewall. Waste time in CAB.
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> idk how that would be related to game traffic / filtering. Once you are connected, you're whitelisted to send / receive traffic. There's no "traffic blocking" at that point
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Like I said, try rejoining. Chances are something messed up during the reconnect.
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> When you zoom out, you tell the server your zoom level
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe it's because you receive too many objects then?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Ok, like I said, you're either whitelisted to send traffic, or not. There's no in-between.
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Reconnecting doesnt help
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Maybe try it yourself ^^
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I did a while ago
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Again?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> sure
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> If I could I'd let deen host at where I work. 20GB links and we own a /16 on the internet. Pitty I dont own the organisation ðŸ˜©
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> On my own server with way more objects it doesnt lag at all
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Even with "20gbps" links, if your server can't handle the l7 load, there's not much you can do
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> from deen's blog post, the server literally dies at < 100mbps
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @FÃ¤n just tried it again, it really is only on your server
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> hm, maybe fragment-related?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> i just started dropping fragmented responses as this would bypass the filtering
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> but i can just let whitelisted clients send fragments, shouldnt be an issue
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it seems to be only on jao shooter
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Any other GER1 server works ok?
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> that's odd, maybe map-related or something?
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i guess, but this is also the one with most players
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> other players have no impact on your network performance
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> or mitigation
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> or anything
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> or anything really
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> We've kept that in mind
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> of course, more objects to be sent, i dont know how your firewall is constructed
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> We do not perform any rate limiting.
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> True but we got ddos mitigation upstream as well by our ISP before it comes to us over the 20Gbps links. I dont see why it wouldnt not handle it. We got a proper VMware infrastructure. But things like XDP and reading cloudflare blogs is more interesting.
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> like i said, once you're validated, you're ok to throw as much traffic as you want
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then it seems like i am a psyhco
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then it seems like i am a psycho
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and there is no lag
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> maybe a bug?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I have no idea, but i'm on there just fine
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> surely odd though
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> zoom out
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> max
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> with opengl 3 on, there should be a limit in zooming out
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and that state is still playable with 500 fps at least
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for me, but the network is lagging, and thats only on this server
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> "ddos mitigation" which is based on best-effort.
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> You will still see >1Gbps leaks every now and then.
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> 
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> There's not just packet size to consider, but also the rate of those coming in.
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> From what i can see, ddnet can handle about 300k pps with a decent CPU
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> tried any other ger1 server though?
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I'll check, my mac won't let me zoom out though, so it might take a while
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i'll check if thats the map, because it has an unusual amount of draggers and @deen changed the networkclipping to always send all objects in your area zoom distance (which on my server again works fine with wwaaaay more objects (so many that the snap fills up to max size when zooming out completely))
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Maybe it is fragment-related after all.
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> We'll see in a moment
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its a bit too on another server with this map, but the current server seems to be the worst (probably due to all the players)
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> check again?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> still
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Doesn't seem filter-related then.
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> My palo alto seems to be doing a decent enough job. No complains yet. We dont go as in depth as XDP at where I work. We pay for things to work out the box and let someone else handle development! :p
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> client restart also didnt help, must be the full snap then
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> hmm actually
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> what about now?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> still
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> yeah sorry, i can't really tell what it is then
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> 1 mom
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> oh dang
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> might've fat fingered there
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> -_-
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea seems like it did you crash the server?=
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> no
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the fuck is happening then
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> give it a second
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I fat fingered
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> connection problems, out of game back to back
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> ok, give it another try now
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> same
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> can't really tell then
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> im pretty sure its all the draggers when zooming out
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I'll check this out when on pc
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> the client i use includes bots \:-. so im not sharing it
