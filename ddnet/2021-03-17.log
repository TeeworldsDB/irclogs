00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Mhh I better wait for a response, he'd be the first
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> BTW the console output also shows the GPU vendor
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 new f-client has timeout code which also gets sent, can you look into making timeout protection work for 0.7?
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> @deen i also had issues on amd igpu, dunno is it related. but it's most likely driver issue bcs my gpu and xserver crashes, or just freeze
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> is ddnet client has jetpack prediction as well?
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> had = it works now?
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> hard to reproduce, it's random
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> usually i can play
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> sometime happens and i get dozens of amdgpu error on dmesg, but strangely only experienced it on ddnet
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> could you post those errors as a file?
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/4465
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean i also have an amd gpu, and basically never had a crash, atleast not on the stable driver
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cant be so insanly hard to reproduce xd
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i play everyday ddnet and it happened like 2 or 3 times in 3 weeks :D
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i often switch between mesa 20 and 21 and both run completly stable for me. indeed the only crash i had recently was outside of ddnet(probs not even opengl)
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but when i first got my gpu the driver were more unstable too, but that was also the time amd went opensource ðŸ˜„
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i had some freezes, but only the game
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and after some seconds it came back
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª oh, ddnet used to evaluate opengl-on-vulkan: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=zink-january-2021&num=2
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is that like a translation layer to run ogl on devices that dont have support for it but do have support for vulkan?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sounds like an extremely small subset of devices :P
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it broken? I thought I made this even work across versions
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> didnt test it, but there was a chat message
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> indicating that 0.7 client wont be able to load
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD he should have used the GPU benchmark tho ðŸ˜„
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but really cool
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think its more to replace opengl drivers, because 20% perf drop can be compansated by new processor generations ðŸ˜„
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just like DXVK etc.
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> d9vk even outperforms the native radeon driver
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ooh, I remember some issue with the stupid shuffling around if connect and disconnect messages I didnt bother finishing
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah it needs a massive revamp :/
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so it works in theory?
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The 0.7 client cant change its clientid
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It only works if you modify your client to let you accept changes to client id
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We need to do it the other way around
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Instead of changing the client id we need to "reparent" the tee
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, on my server i use idmaps due to the 128p support anyways
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats how i got it working there
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uh, I will take a look, if it doesnt look to hairy I'll try to get it in but honestly I've been in a shitty mood this entire month so it's kinda uncertain I can get to it
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want it certainly done you should PR it yourself :P
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont need it in very fast
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> im kinda unmotivated the last 1-2 months too
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Should we release another DDNet version? I don't remember if we had any big changes
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/compare/15.3.2...master
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know anything noticable either
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, just a minor bump if we do a release
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Can release another version with accounts ðŸ˜„
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3654
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> 
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Any idea why the style check/clang might be failing me? I've run the clang format locally  and it doesn't change anything. I've overwrote the ddracechat file with the master version but no changes were detected
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Zodiac probably you have a different clang-format version locally, it's quite annoying. Just ignore it I guess, I can fix it later
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Zodiac you need clang-format 10, I think
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> I've got clang 11.0 it seems. Will look to downgrade for the next PR.
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Do you use ArchLinux?
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I just installed clang-format-static-bin from AUR and then used /opt/clang-format-static/clang-format-10
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Going to do another check-in now. Downgrading the version.
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I pushed already
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it should be fine
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I hope it was okay that I pushed into your repo ðŸ™‚
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Yeah ofc - I see there is another file that is the issue. I am making it part of my build process
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Yeah ofc - I see there is another file that is the issue. I am making it part of my build process to prevent this again
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> I'm using Windows and Visual Studio which likely part of the reason ðŸ™‚
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Don't put effort into getting clang-format right, we need to find a better solution that uses a fixed version. For example we could just do the clang-format as part of the merge into master
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Too late ðŸ˜„ Figured it out. Should be smooth sailing from here
