13:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> @qxdfoxy what are you doing?
13:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
13:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> This is the third time
13:42 < bridge> <teero777> He did it again wooo
13:42 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> im stupid
13:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> How can one accidentally open a PR to ddnet 3 times
13:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> :justatest:
13:42 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> i have no clue
13:42 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> github keeps on sendin me to ddnet
13:42 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> not mine
13:43 < bridge> <melo∆û> Mostly because your client is a fork
13:43 < bridge> <teero777> Remove the upstream
13:43 < bridge> <melo∆û> ^
13:43 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> well
13:43 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> man
13:44 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> sorry
13:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> It's fine - just try not to do it again :harold:
13:44 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> will do my best
14:09 < bridge> <learath2> Keep doing it every once in a while, it's like a special event
15:19 < bridge> <Assa> After creating and loading multiple svg files into different softwares I finally understand why ddnet or teeworlds doesn't support it.
16:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> isnt the ddnet logo rendered as an svg in the client
16:48 < bridge> <teero777> no
16:56 < bridge> <sollybunny> vector graphics is yipee when i see it in games. svg that is svg2 in xml where you probably have to also support html is disgusting
17:22 < bridge> <Assa> let me not start about fonts in svgs, just embed them in base64 pls
17:24 < bridge> <matodor> rcon commands suggestion broken on 18.7?
17:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> its possible to convert them to paths so they work everywhere
17:24 < bridge> <robyt3> You might as well represent individual glyphs as paths, embedding the entire font into svgs would bloat the file size a lot, especially if you duplicate it in multiple files
17:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> figma does that
17:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> figma awesome
17:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> :brownbear:
17:26 < bridge> <robyt3> Works for me, did you connect to an old server somehow?
17:27 < bridge> <matodor> yes, on old server
17:28 < bridge> <matodor> ddnet breaks backwards compatibility? that's so unlike it
17:28 < bridge> <matodor> üòè
17:28 < bridge> <robyt3> Which version?
17:29 < bridge> <matodor> `d0c88ca830c34ccec9d562600c28d836a982ff9c`
17:30 < bridge> <matodor> 18.5.1
17:32 < bridge> <robyt3> Also works for me. Client 18.7 on server 18.5.1
17:34 < bridge> <matodor> oh, it's not working on dummy
17:34 < bridge> <robyt3> If your server is running a random commit then you should update, I don't think backwards compatibility with every single past commit or nightly version is expected, only release versions and current nightly
17:35 < bridge> <robyt3> Also works for me :justatest:
17:38 < bridge> <matodor> try:
17:38 < bridge> <matodor> - join server
17:38 < bridge> <matodor> - connect dummy
17:38 < bridge> <matodor> - F2 login
17:38 < bridge> <matodor> 
17:38 < bridge> <matodor> commands loading progress starts?
17:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Hmm, seems like I don't get all commands like that with 18.7 client and 18.5.1 server
17:41 < bridge> <robyt3> And main is not logged in for some reason, I though we had a feature to automatically login on main/dummy when you login with either
17:42 < bridge> <robyt3> Doesn't seem related to the old server version though, the same happens with 18.7 on 18.7
17:42 < bridge> <matodor> I think there is a split of login for dummy / main?
17:42 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, but it should automatically log-in with the other if you log-in with one
17:43 < bridge> <robyt3> If you login first then connect dummy you are logged in on both and get all commands
17:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Also seems like this is already broken in 18.5.1 (client and/or server)
18:57 < test__> hi
19:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> hi test
20:37 < bridge> <montikboom> Is this possible to encode server settings.cfg to make it work? If yes please say how, I really need this
20:38 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't understand the question. What do you want to do?
20:39 < bridge> <montikboom> I want to encode server settings
20:39 < bridge> <robyt3> I already read that, but I don't understand what you mean by that
20:39 < bridge> <montikboom> File
20:40 < bridge> <montikboom> If this possible to encode and make server don't break?
20:40 < bridge> <montikboom> I mean still work?
20:40 < bridge> <robyt3> yes? put the settings in the file and save with UTF-8 encoding
20:41 < bridge> <montikboom> Can you send site to encode it please?
20:42 < bridge> <robyt3> What text editor are you using? Select UTF-8 encoding in your text editor when saving
20:42 < bridge> <montikboom> Windows notepad :justatest:
20:43 < bridge> <robyt3> Then UTF-8 encoding is already the default
20:43 < bridge> <robyt3> What exactly is the problem?
20:44 < bridge> <montikboom> I wanna make the text unreadable
20:45 < bridge> <robyt3> You can only have one or the other:
20:45 < bridge> <robyt3> 1. readable text that the server can understand
20:45 < bridge> <robyt3> 2. unreadable garbage that the server cannot understand
20:46 < bridge> <robyt3> Once again, what problem are you trying to solve by doing this?
20:46 < bridge> <robyt3> https://xyproblem.info/
20:46 < bridge> <montikboom> Make unreadable garbage which server can understand
20:46 < bridge> <montikboom> Ddnet is open source, yes?
20:46 < bridge> <robyt3> As I said above, that's impossible
20:47 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, but it's theoretically impossible
20:47 < bridge> <montikboom> Can I try modify server to make it decode and understand?
20:48 < bridge> <robyt3> I already told you it's impossible but you are free to try anyway if you like a hard challange :monkaS:
20:48 < bridge> <robyt3> I already told you it's impossible but you are free to try anyway if you like a hard challenge :monkaS:
20:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Even if a modified server can understand the settings all one would need to do to understand the settings is use that modified server
20:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Even if only a modified server can understand the settings all one would need to do to understand the settings is use that modified server
20:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If all you want is to keep those settings secret then the solution is not giving them to anyone else
20:51 < bridge> <robyt3> You still haven't told us what problem you are really trying to solve. I assume it's like "I want to prevent others from reading the password in my config files".
20:52 < bridge> <montikboom> You already answered my question
20:52 < bridge> <montikboom> Ty
21:09 < bridge> <zaer1n> Cool site
21:09 < bridge> <zaer1n> definitely not me
21:39 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> why would anyone need that many buttons?
21:39 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1304545839548465162/image.png?ex=672fc87d&is=672e76fd&hm=8034354e71443f34ca6049e4c93bc306b1ad12291565534efc66196cc7ab2ab1&
21:39 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> it's just messy at this point
22:11 < bridge> <kebscs> Use ctrl f
22:11 < bridge> <kebscs> It'll set them all
22:38 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> i don't need to set all teleports to free, but having 8 buttons feels like a joke considering it was working great before
22:39 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> now you have to set cp/cp to, from/from to
22:39 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> like what is the purpose outside of being more complicated?
23:06 < bridge> <lomination> In the previous version, it was sometimes annoying to use the same number for independent things (such as tele and checkpoint tele). But maybe it is too much now. It would be great to separate normal tele from checkpoint tele, as they are always used independently. But since red, blue, hook and weapon tele tiles all lead to the tele to tile, I don't know if it makes sense to have different buttons for those tiles.
23:06 < bridge> <fokkonaut> purpose is that you can save as many teleporters as possible, as you can have number 1 cp, weapon, etc
23:09 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> Wasn't it the case before?
23:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Before it used to jump to number 2, even if you only used number 1 for cp for example
23:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Imagine a map with 255 parts. Each one uses a seperate cp. But you can also take the normal teleporters for weapons/tp to next part
23:12 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> And then, why not raise the limit of tps or make something different for those who make some crazy stuff?
23:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> i wish we could raise the limit :(
23:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> because that would require saving a lot more information
23:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> and would break compatibility i guess
23:12 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> It's just annoying having to click like 12 time to make simple stuff which required 4
23:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
23:14 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> It's just annoying having to click like 12 times to make simple stuff which required 4
23:30 < bridge> <kebscs> Maybe some keybind to increase all teles by 1?
23:31 < bridge> <kebscs> Something like current shift+mwheel that increases only 1 tele but for all teles
