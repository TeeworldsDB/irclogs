01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> github codespaces aren't half bad when you need to edit quickly on a computer you don't usually code on
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deleting a branch doesn't require a force push
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i got this fixed, but now i dont think my packet is sending
06:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i'm trying to send 1 sv_kill_msg_teams in here, but its not going through
06:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1053187766713851964/image.png
06:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i'm in a public server because LANs are not detected
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> nevermind i finally got it working... somewhat

09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 how does fix_style.py only check style of changes? It doesn’t even seem to check git
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice _D
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, it seems we removed that. @deen why did we stop running clang_format on just diffs?
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen for the playground, can we start just creating a new repo and give me full access to it?
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we obv don't need to make it open for everyone yet
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> however, i think it would be cool to have:
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> - nightly builds, that i can share with friends, with whom i will probably also design away some annoying limits of vanilla we always disliked. would also be cool if i can trigger the builds somehow, or simply copy them from some github CI ^^
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> - maybe a dns alias to my VPS so i can host some servers my own, or some vps i can connect to
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> @murpi Could you please send me the GitHub link for the file which contains the code for the new #reports discord bot replies?
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> wadafuuuuk💀 💀 💀
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> did we ever do that? I don't think so
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Why new repo? You want to start from scratch? You can have a branch/fork instead
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Rest sounds fine
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no but i guess its easier to manage(e.g. if i make prs to "myself") and silence the bot?
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just make a branch on your own ddnet fork, I can build nightlies from that
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> as long as you are the only one working on it
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok, i can also simply use my master branch, and can make prs to that 😄
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can make PRs to any branch btw
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah i just want to make sure its automatically selected
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since im not reviewing my prs, just so i have overview 😄
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but can probs change default branch
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> For the server, should I rent you a https://www.hetzner.com/cloud CPX11? Probably cleaner to have experiments on a separate VPS. Not connected to official ranks for now or should already be connected? (Then I'd have to add the flag to tell the ranks apart)
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/tree/playground
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> doesnt need to be connected yet. i can also pay it, doesnt need to be run by ddnet's costs
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If you want cheaper, OVH has for 2 € / month
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just want a ddnet subdomain, bcs i am also playing to try some new stuff out 😄
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> planing
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah should be fine for my needs
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Actually 1 € / month for a year now for new customers: https://www.ovhcloud.com/de/vps/
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do you want to buy it for me? should i send u money or simply donate to ddnet?
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can't get the new customer thing though
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and I prefer hetzner 😄
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so if you want to get the cheap one, you have to do it yourself
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i am also ok with paying more
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> or he can run instances using free credits at gcp, aws or any other
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently we ran on entire files, but only changed ones in the past
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oracle Cloud gives you a free 4 core 24 GB ARM VPS permanently 😄
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I would not recommend those, super easy to get an attack which causes outgoing traffic, and then after 1 night with 10 Gbit/s outgoing you are charged thousands of dollars
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tbh idc i just want a starting point 😄
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if i can get a subdomain and the nightly builds i can also do all stuff my own
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well if I understood well isn't it for testing purpose?
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> if yes why not just register 0
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you can also do a AA record to my domain name, then i can change servers as i want 😄
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> also free credits doesn't charge you, on gcp you use your free creds then when you run out of those they just ask you to switch to a normal acc, so they won't charge you for that
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or ANAME
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> CNAME
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> was it
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> right 😄
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So on the server you want the official maps etc?
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Then I'll set up a small Hetzner server for you now as pg.ddnet.org
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I am also planning with other mods in mind
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> So would generally be easier if I've access to it
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why don't you set up the server yourself?
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> saves deen some work
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I can
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I just want nightly build and sub domain.^^
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> So it's kinda official
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nightly build is up, subdomain I can only set when you have an IP
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> So no cname?
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Why do you want a cname?
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Else i buy vps later . When at home 2-3h
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Easier to change vps later
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But idc
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What should I point it to?
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> pg.aliveclan.de
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I'll set the server up to there then
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Done
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Thanks
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Playground is also a stream in steam,  I used a PW just to make sure people don't select it accidentally, password is `Playground23`
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Playground is also a release channel in steam,  I used a PW just to make sure people don't select it accidentally, password is `Playground23`
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Oh great
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If you want official server setup/database access etc then I should set up the server. If not, then you can go ahead
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yeah for now sounds better to not connect to official db
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Maybe in few months
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Alright, easier from my side then
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pog

11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> based linux distros got ddnet updated
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well liguros uses gentoo guru which its the one i update
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Now get it into Arch and Gentoo official packages, then it takes a bit longer
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupeyy_Keks first playground build is live. Links at the bottom of https://ddnet.org/news/nightly-build-revived/
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1053287807566741594/Screenshot_2022-12-16_at_13.28.18.png
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats the playground about?
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tomstar Thomas> https://t.me/pacexoitic
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it's a place where kids play 🙂
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> breaking compability
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thanks a lot^^
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Make sure to break it a lot
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes i am trying to create a complete new structure ^^
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just physics stay the same xdd
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks changing the protocol?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a good thing would be to merge ex messages or smth
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and make them extendable without hacks
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I might not have much time to help, but if you need any further infrastructure etc for these experiments, just ping me. I'm glad to provide this kind of playground to get ddnet to next level.
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupeyy_Keks anything in Rust? 😄
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd like to play around with that too yeah, maybe for modules u can cleanly split from game logic
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but no guarantes yet 😄
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Cool
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just rewrite ddnet in rust, go
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> go for it
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> honestly the interop is a bit meh cuz u cant harness the power of rust on the c++ side
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so it should all be rust
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even if i would i still use the c++ vk backend
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs rewriting that is lot of work
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> work  is
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but maybe u can make it more "correct"
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know what? The gfx backend would actually be a good candidate for a rust rewrite
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since concurrency is easier in rust
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there are no "real" vk bindings for rust
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> only abstractions
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://vulkano.rs/
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a relatively well split portion of the code
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wdym
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Another good candidate is the small auth_manager. I actually want to do that sometime so we can have a rust module in the code see how well our integration went
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well its not vulkan what u sent there
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> check this
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its a higher level abstraction
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> designed for rust
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think u can have vulkan in rust as is
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u mean t he sdk?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "Provides a low-levelish API around Vulkan."
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vulkano is low level
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it just designed to not allow u to do unsafe stuff
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lets say it like this
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if that lib would tell me "yo bro, here i have to insert a memory barrier, except you change this and that code"
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd say gg epic lib
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you even have direct vulkan bindings for rust? It'd all have to be wrapped in unsafe 😄
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but what probably happens is, that it does this implicitly
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```rust
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> let vertex_buffer = CpuAccessibleBuffer::from_iter(
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     device.clone(),
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     BufferUsage {
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         vertex_buffer: true,
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         ..Default::default()
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     },
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     false,
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     vec![vertex1, vertex2, vertex3].into_iter(),
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> )
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> .unwrap();
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1053312688161296405/image.png
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is low level
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the way it is is, you make a -sys crate, usually autogenerated with a tool looking at C headers
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and then u build a safe abstraction on it
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what https://gtk-rs.org/ does
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well all
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess this would actually be about what @Jupeyy_Keks would want. Completely unsafe though, so the gfx backend would all be unsafe code, unless he builds some safe abstractions of his own to build the backend on
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its stupid
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the safe wrapper just disallows things u would be wrong doing
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt add a higher abstraction
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that hides stuff
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk what exactly it wraps, but I can see it having different opinions on concurrency safety
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in the vulkano case tho i think they try to also be correct and not allow doing stuff which the vulkan api says u woudl be doing wrong
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A higher level abstraction can't know that it might not be worth dropping a lock because you are about to re-use it
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a -sys crate is like a library full of extern functions
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, idk. I'm just guessing what Jupstar wants, only Jupstar knows what Jupstar really wants 😄
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> problem is, its probably not like the rust compiler which tells u what u doing wrong. instead it implicitly adds stuff to confort to what rust can do
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so what i mean is, that it will not detect data races in the graphics pipeline, but instead abstracts the whole stuff so that u cannot even do that. It would be amazing if its such powerful, but that would require lot of work probably, since its like a completely new programming language
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean their github basically says it all
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1053315833046241290/image.png
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but vulkane is p high quality i heard
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vulkano
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well im not so knowledgeable about the pipeline so ur probs right, but it can prevent data races on code that runs on the cpu
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont doubt that 😄
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by design
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno vulkano, i simply doubt its great enough yet xD
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not try it
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best way to know
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but currently dont want to learn another graphics api xD
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean its not another api its more learning how the wrapper works
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but yeah
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for now i'd like to redesign/test some stuff in the playground i always had in my mind
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the vulkan concepts u know probs are 90% of what u need to know
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and i hope i dont get too lazy for that already xD
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok on a vps first time rust compiling is really slow xD
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do they plan for binary shipping some day?, but probs too annoying per rust version
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/cberner/redb
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> binary shipping what?
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the compiler is binary shipped
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> crates stuff xd
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dynamic linking when? Binary crates when? Smh, how is this even a srs language
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no, static linking
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just provide ready static libs so compiling doesnt take so long xd
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> at least for current stable rust compiler release or smth
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No, is bad for performance
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do they do it different rn?
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else ofc dont do it, all in for performance xd
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Afaik it's all march=native compiled rn, so you get the best performance possible
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah i c
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well then make it optionally
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If they ship you generic binary releases they wouldn't use epic vector instructions
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah sounds sane xDD
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on the other hand
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if ddnet ships ddnet release with rust, march native sounds wrong
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We probably set some flag that makes it generate generic x86-64 code
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah, default gcc behavior is only sse instructions
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it wont use avx if you don't ask it to
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Rust isn't compiled with gcc
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> dammit, got tricked by the flags 🙂
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Afaik rustc has march native as a default
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> thought you were talking about gcc 😄
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if someone actually came up with a solution to at load time swap out more optimized "modules" if e.g. avx is available
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know you can branch at runtime and the branch predictor is good enough, but you can't guarantee 0 mispredicts afaik
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont htink so
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cargo install doesnt install it with march native
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u gotta set the RUST_FLAGS
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> RUST_FLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought they changed the default sometime ago. I might be misremembering tho
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nono
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its by default x86-v1
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or just x86-64
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> portable simd is experimental
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/simd/index.html
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but there are libs
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> altho obviously with native cpu u get auto vectorization and stuffs
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> someone wanna play open club penguin w me? UwU https://ocp.zillyhuhn.com/
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nais, is it made in bash or what
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> oof i wish xd
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> nah its js :(
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> r u the legend? o.O
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, how can we communicate? move the letters we want to write? XD
16:55 <+ChillerDragon> chage name
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ez xD
16:55 <+ChillerDragon> ye i will add chat soon(tm)
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i believe you can set up a function pointer at start to specify which function should be called (at least in C/C++), but you still have the cost of indirect jump
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> defs epic game 10/10 would rebuy
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> ty
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> epic gaming
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Leave a big hole for it with a nopslide at the end 😛
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does anyone know an alternative for KCachegrind?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no i want one too, its just too epic
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why you need alternative?
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i want one that also works with other stuff than callgrind but is as good xd
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> other stuff being?
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> gprof
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Another question: Does anyone know a way to intercept signals and ignore them?
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or gperf
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they sound so equal xd
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Something like `sigignore <my-command-that-I-don't-want-receiving-the-signal>`
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not even sure such a `sigignore` binary is possible to make, but I'm interested
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nohup does it
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> okay, no way to change the signal it ignores
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but it's possible if you look at nohup code i guess
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/316186/how-does-nohup-work>
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> It's not on Github
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> is it private, or could you share the code?
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Yes, once im home
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> is it A or B? yes 😄
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> No, once im home
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> maybe once you're home :tee_thinking:
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ```
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Yes, once im home
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^ action
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> 
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Is it private? Yes, once im home = X makes no sense
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Could you share code? Yes, once im home = ✓ makes sense
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ```
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :greenthing:
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ```
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Yes, once im home
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^ condition 
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> 
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Is it private? Yes, once im home = X makes no sense
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Could you share code? Yes, once im home = ✓ makes sense
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ```
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :greenthing:
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as soon as he is home its private
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> We are overthinking this but.
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> Could also be:
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> is it private? -> Yes.
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> Could you share the code? -> Once I'm home
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> :greenthing:
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> clever clever
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Alright, this should do it. Trimmed down the important code.

18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :greenthing:
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> y'all weird alright
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jana> Nerds
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Quite weird thats its not in ddnet's repo but bot running this module 😄
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> It's part of the ddnet moderator module
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Makes sense:monkalaugh:
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> no one appears to be taking care of the discordbot repo, so I don't bother uploading the changes there
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :feelsbadman:
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yek> :brownbear:
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> and im shy
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> :happy:
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yek> If servers are added, is the update manual or automatic?
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yek> :tee_thinking:
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://info2.ddnet.tw/info is updated manually I think
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> That lion on your gh profile picture would make me instantly accept any of ur prs:poggers2:
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @murpi it’d be nice if you could pull request your changes to the repo
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we have to set up ddnet.tw again for some reason it’s a bit of a pain when there are local changes 😛
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wait heinrich used `#pragma once` in the code what did i miss lmao
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> didnt age well xddd
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> thanks
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Added to my list of things to never do "Make a kcachegrind alternative"
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u forgot "in rust"
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its the important bit
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> +10 marketing points
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I will never do: Make a kcachegrind altenrative +10 marketing points? doesn't make much sense if you're advocating for rust tho
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt read the negative
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> anyway is bevy in a good state? or should I try amethyst first?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> forget amethyst
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bevy is where its at
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://bevyengine.org/
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> ok :D
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's generated code
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Are there any documents about how to send packets properly? Because I'm trying to test it out, but I don't see anything appearing
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what packet are you trying to send?
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what are you trying? what do you observe?
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I added an extra sent packet as an extension for the killfeed
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1053403494855491645/image.png
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks good
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and in the client you can't see it?
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Yeah. I'm testing it through Wireshark
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wireshark won't be able to decode your new packet
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it might still show it
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you show how you decode it in the client?
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I:
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Sent that too early
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, do you realize that you only send it to one client, not all?
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I mean I can only assume the packet is being sent with the `sv_kill_msg` packet, since it's going out
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I'm not testing if it recieves, I'm just testing if it's actually being sent.
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you test it using wireshark?
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Yeah
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's dangerous, because you probably haven't tested whether this test method works before ^^
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could add a already known message
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so that it'll definitely show up in wireshark
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Voxel ^
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Maybe
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm, sounds like no
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Oh wait, for the question? Honestly, no. I know little to nothing about server-sided code 😅
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you probably want to send it to everyone?
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not just the client being killed?
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I mean, yeah. This is an extension for the killfeed, so I plan for when this is added in-game, all clients with this update can detect if a killed tee is in a team.
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> replace `m_ClientID` with `-1` in the `SendPackMsg` call, to send it to all clients, not just one
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Ohhh... That makes sense
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did that solve your problem?
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I'm not sure.
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Like you said, it still might be in there, but just not detected properly.
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could send a known message
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to check whether that works
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> send a message usually only sent by the client
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe cl_say
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Yeah
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then it won't be interpreted by the client
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> LMFAO
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1053418205206560910/image.png
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you like my code? ❤️
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> :p
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i love how specific it is
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> xd sure chillerbot.png is lyfe
