20:26 <@deen> Learath2: I'm on a server and 4 people here have WinXP
20:26 <@deen> I would say WinXP is still very much used
20:26 < Learath2> even microsoft dropped support for winxp and they are still using it ? :D
20:26  * fstd uses winxp too, on the machine i take to LANs
20:27 < fstd> Learath2: i still get updates (as of a few months ago, didn't check since)
20:28 < eeeee> tfw those updates actually open more security holes to make you update sooner
20:29 < Learath2> fstd: what do you think my chance is on converting a cross aligned altar ?
20:29 < Learath2> ops w/c
