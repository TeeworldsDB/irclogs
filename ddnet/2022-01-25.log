00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> how about a thing like @team7 and it gets highlighted in a chat?
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> do you often write to teams?
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> actually yeah i do but im not sure how about other people
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> a suggestion discord channel wouldnt be that bad imo
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Teams should be removed completely. Change my mind.
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30066078
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats some image quality there
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah especially team 0
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://xkcd.com/2030/
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Meh why is m\_HookedPlayer not set while spectating? \:c
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Ah because of this -.- https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/590f29944cd63f2a65f74a7011a318bec1872ca6/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L2208
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> So there is no prediction when spectating? Because its not needed?
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> *sad dragon noises*
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> how you didnt know that?
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> its obvious, when you spectate
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i even can see when there is input delay for someone just by looking at him
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i never noticed i guess i have a really good ping \:p
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Pretty sad tho since i use the prediction code to collect data for my hax client
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> so i cant spy in spec \:c
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> correct
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I thought about that too once, but yes, server also does not send everything when speccing
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea i noticed when trying to change the client
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i saw a client that allows to spec the others tee while you just play
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> it showed the spec mode in second window which you can move to second monitor
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> which data? i dont get it
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> that sounds cool!
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> Prediction data i use it to see who hooked who

19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> i killed ddnet.tw :troll:
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> works for me
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> same had to refresh
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> is it normal for ddnet client to use 700+ mb of ram right after launching?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> When was that? I tried to find it in logs, but couldn't find a 500
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> right when i sent the pic
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> really weird why it's not in the logs
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> immidiately after i refreshed it was fine though
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 410 MB for me. Depends on how many skins you have in skins directory
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @deen less than 30 skins
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 300MB for me (arch linux)
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen it's known that many skins let the client take way longer on startup, but i have a second weird issue with it, the first time i start ddnet after a fresh boot it takes significantly longer, i think twice as much at least
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like empty disk caches
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> right now my ddnet has 770 MB of ram, while just playing
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> later your OS has already cached some of the data, probably
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> alright
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why is it 770? :o
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> also because of the skins?
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I get 1.7GiB on arctic frost
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> depends mostly on map size
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and igpus also share memory with cpu
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so even more
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 1,020gb on arctic
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Gibibyte user
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 204MB in server browser after startup on windows
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> doesnt sound that much for nowaday
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 32 bits versions still crash there with opengl_major 3 :pepeH:
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just delete 32bit xD
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> everything below 8 gb sounds reasoable xdd
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> learaths dream
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> browsers that use 16gb RAM always
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> why are you a bot
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am AI
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> what is 9 + 10
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 17
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> :f3:
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> jupstar, do you have any ETA for https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4600 ?
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Chairn\: i usually don't add libs to ddnet-libs so guess you have to ask deen
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not fair, i can't @ you, but you can :cammo:
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think thats very fair
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Jupstar maybe you still get a ping if i do that üòÑ
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Jupstar ‚ú™ or this maybe?
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no \:P
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can add custom key words
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in matrix
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i deactivated it anyway
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Jupstar ‚ú™
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this highlights you, no?
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i killed reddit :(

23:24 <+ChillerDragon> wait u can turn that off? I get a ping on matrix from every irc message i sent xd
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> there's a general bad gateway issue going on today
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i also got that issue
