09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i have problems cross compiling ddnet from linux for windows
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ok 1 sec
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut whats with all the buffer issues in 0.7? What did they change?
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not sure if they changed much, except the info changes
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> as mentioned above, Rainbow is bascially impossible
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Does ddnet have a special system for sending the votes, like rcon cmds?
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> If yes, then that explains why it causes the issue in 0.7
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because i cant remember adding such a thing for 0.7 ddnet
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok yea, seems 0.7 doesnt have it
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> gonna add it
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yep, thats the issue. as vanilla doesnt allow many vote options but ddnet has ?i guess 8k?
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can anyone test this? 0.7 and 0.6 again have differences here, so not sure whether this works, cant test right now.
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> added my sources to the description of the commit
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and someone should check this out: (also in ddnet6) https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/commit/01dc689c5ba14898f199c0203c3837f797864797#diff-a2df712cfb938eda9a173f36c865c2ccR837
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I totally forgot about the limits we had
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What do you mean?
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was wondering why you had trouble with the votes
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Forgot we did aswell
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/e871fbbaad8e7f4fbed3f8ec7f5630d646794cc0
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Ddnet does not drop the clients when the connection is out of buffer
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> good job @fokkonaut the out of buffer on server type change is solved ‚ù§Ô∏è
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen would be nice if official servers could run on latest commit again
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @redix ddnet6, yes. which is technically stupid
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because the client glitches out then
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> It only does when there actually is a lost packet. But yeah... This behavior is questionable
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, probably for timeout protection(?)
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So, that even if client glitches, it can reconnect
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and gets back its tee
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> About your rainbow thing: you most not send new skin change packets while the server is resending packets. But right now there is no function for checking this from the game part
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ay
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can you help there?
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Maybe pr it :)?
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> I can look into it. But probably not before next week. Kinda busy right now =\
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Okay
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oh that might be the thing that got me stuck on timeout protection @fokkonaut
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or we can just move the playerinfo back into the snap
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I'd hope so
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> im struggling to build ddnet with the demo rendering enabled on windows
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the relevant error seems to be `Could NOT find FFMPEG (missing: AVCODEC_LIBRARY AVFORMAT_LIBRARY AVUTIL_LIBRARY SWSCALE_LIBRARY SWRESAMPLE_LIBRARY AVCODEC_INCLUDEDIR AVFORMAT_INCLUDEDIR AVUTIL_INCLUDEDIR SWSCALE_INCLUDEDIR SWRESAMPLE_INCLUDEDIR)`
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the relevant error seems to be:
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `Could NOT find FFMPEG (missing: AVCODEC_LIBRARY AVFORMAT_LIBRARY AVUTIL_LIBRARY SWSCALE_LIBRARY SWRESAMPLE_LIBRARY AVCODEC_INCLUDEDIR AVFORMAT_INCLUDEDIR AVUTIL_INCLUDEDIR SWSCALE_INCLUDEDIR SWRESAMPLE_INCLUDEDIR)`
17:56 <@deen> @Patiga hi. Do you have ffmpeg installed?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i tried to, but couldnt figure out how to properly do it
17:57 <@deen> that's also what I don't know
17:57 <@deen> and what's probably the problem
17:57 <@deen> are you trying to use visual studio or mingw?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> first i tried it via the official ffmpeg site, where i got a zip with the relevant binaries
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> via visual studio
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i think i managed to get them into path, but that didnt seem to help
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> next i searched for some ffmpeg installer, found one for audacity, however that didnt work out for me either
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i did manage to build ddnet without the demo renderer
17:59 <@deen> does the official ffmpeg even support CMake?
18:00 <@deen> i think the regular build is easier since we ship the libraries
18:00 <@deen> but we don't ship ffmpeg. maybe I should just try building ffmpeg for windows?
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that would be great
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i dont quite know how the entire build system works, so i dont actually know what it would require me to do (to get the ffmpeg system to work)
18:02 <@deen> i don't know how cmake works either :D

18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> would i need to dive into the ddnet source in order to do this manually?
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (i assume what you propose would fix the issue)
18:04 <@deen> let me make a pr for you to try
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ty!
18:09 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2060 & https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-libs/pull/3
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @deen i switched to your branch, but the error seems to persist
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> does the fix bundle ffmpeg?
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> when i do `-DPREFER_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON` on linux, ffmpeg isnt recognized as bundled
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (neither on windows)
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why is new ht liek 3 tiles?
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> which one to use?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hihi
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2031
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i just used the tile next to the old one
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Patiga also switched ddnet-libs?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> how do i do that?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> there should be a ddnet-libs subdirectory
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> check out my branch in it
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh yeah, that looks promising
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sadly the same error again
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> it still doesnt recognize it as bundled
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> would the cmake logs help?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you could post them somewhere
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe someone else can understand

19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> [2020-02-11 19:44:54][server]: client dropped. cid=9 addr=<{unknown type 0}> reason='Error sending data'
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i wonder why it does not show the ip
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> seems like its invali
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> d
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> otherwise it would Show ip or xxx
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, in log it would Show ip, in f2 xyx
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xxx
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i added the show ips thing to 0.7
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> But it shouldn‚Äôt be invalid huh?
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 cool that you use my executechatcommand thing and the /%s %s :)
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why didnt you push to master?
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't like the %s %s
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll make another one
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I did that to support old chat commands too
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> using actual chat
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But since this new system now this can be thrown away
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (before i only added important commands due to the limit of 22 cmds, now with your stuff ofc all can be used and the old chat system can be deleted)
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thats why i made executechatcommand()
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut can you give it a test?
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> In bed, sorry
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So early üòõ
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sure @ChillerDragon would love to give it a test for me
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> His laptop battery is empty
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im at home now but im busy now @Learath2 :/ ping me agian later/tomorrow and i can test it üôÇ
