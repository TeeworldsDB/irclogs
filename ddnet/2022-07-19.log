00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> is it possible that compiler may choose a value for enumeration?
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> okay, i got a really weird bug
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i have an assertion to test if memory has been zeroed, it fails on clang, but not on gcc
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but when i look up the memory with gdb, it is 0

00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> this is beyond me
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `sizeof(*pCursor)`?
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 104
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> which is actually weird given that i count 100 manually
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then there's probably padding?
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so i'd guess there's some extra data
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the last four bytes
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is there a `int64_t` in there?
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> there's a pointer in the middle
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah yea
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so the structure is padded to a multiple of 8 bytes
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 104 is divisible by 8
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Chairn do you understand the problem now?
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yup
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> looks like standard doesn't require padding to be initialized to 0
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, padding is indeterminate
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and can change at any time
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> `ptype /o var` shows padding in gdb
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> >      If T is an non-union class type: 
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> > 
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> >         all padding bits are initialized to zero bits,
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hmm, clang not compliant with standard?

01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> If we were to mainstream this into the actual game, it would require an update to the server to send over weapon/laser types. It's not perfect right now, but it's a very solid concept build.

01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Little correction: On an up-to-date server it works without antiping, but older servers fall back to the rifle laser color. If you use antiping on an older server it also shows the correct color :)
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Maybe nuborn can do something, that it predicts the laser color correctly when holding shotgun, we'll see

01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Hello, yes
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why don't you PR it? It would be easier to discuss it there
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Pull Request to the main ddnet repo?
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You can add commits later on, after the pull request is made already
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @fokkonaut can't wait for colored laser drawings on your server :justatest:

01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thought about that too already, but I can only let people choose color 1-4, cuz everyone can set their own colora
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the amount of knowledge by everyone in that question, wtf
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Let me just finalize the menu first, and then I'll PR
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> (after supper)
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> lol, nice github username
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> thanks 😅
03:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i feel bad whenever i do an if else statement  in code, because of how infamous it has become with bad programmers

03:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what?
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> :what:
03:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i dont know, i guess its just a self conscious thought that if i put an if else statement in a piece of code im going to be called yanderedev

03:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Voxel btw what is that conditional for?

03:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> shouldnt it be && or am i misunderstanding
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oops
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ah yup, that condition is always true ^^
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> :justatest:
03:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> given the code shown here, i think a switch would be better
03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> or not, some code path are completely exclusive
03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> thing is, if it was a switch there would be a lot more copied code
03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but i think compiler would merge code path on itself
03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> im not sure about conventions but i think readability is prioritized
03:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i'll change it to switch
03:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Don't forget to use the same enumeration value from <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5639/commits/636ea4a3f04fcd9393b6a6601921576291950095#diff-e195619de6313551c4860509fac98e9002a0e1bc76c465784eb111cbf24bc5cdR251>

04:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> wait i dont think i did it right
04:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> How do I call over the enums properly?
04:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you need to use pointer to variable of type CLaserData, not the class directly
04:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and for the enums, you probably need to include protocol.h
04:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> what the
04:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/998779938243088414/unknown.png
04:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> did the lasertype enum just delete itself?!
04:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> probably not
04:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> or maybe im just looking in the wrong place
04:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @_@
04:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> are you sure you included the correct files?
04:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> like you're trying to access a pointer to CNetObj_EntityEx without having the class definition
04:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> there's an enum in network.py
04:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> just the forward declaration
04:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> The thing it it was just fine an hour ago, and now it doesn't even build corrently
04:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> The thing is it was just fine an hour ago, and now it doesn't even build corrently
04:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i dont even know what happened-- what got deleted and undefined the whole load of lasertypes?

04:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> or maybe it was always like this,
04:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i dont get it.. it didnt have an issue last time i tested this
04:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/998785708162560021/unknown.png

05:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> sometimes visual studio will freak out and tell you that you have errors which don't exist and you need to restart it. but usually it will still build when that's the case
05:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> did you include protocol.h?
05:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you can also try to copy the include from items.cpp which seems to be working and then remove them one by one to find the one you need
05:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> otherwise, you can save your work with `git stash` to go back to safe state
05:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yes
05:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yes
05:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> the enum's in the x64 release protocol.h
05:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i think im going to take a break from this for today
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> if you click yes it does run and everything acts natural, though it's confusing why none of the programs recognize the enum in program
06:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mʎɹ シ> I have 2-3 incomplete gamemode with error like this, it can be bad generating, project include
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Voxel 1st rule: dont look at all the errors visual studio give u xddd
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> :monkalaugh:
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its a python file, it is to generate protocol.h for example.
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You can still b
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not build?
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You can still not build?
08:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> it says "build failed" but if i click yes, it works as intended
08:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I think it takes an old build, not the current one
08:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> rip
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can you show the errors?
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> the errors are all  to the enum
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> the errors are all related to the enum
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thats probably visual studio not recognizing it, because its in a generated file, that can happen sometimes.
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Look for other errors
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Errors that are in files you modified and that include things you made
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Solving 1-2 mostly solves the others, as they are just VS bugging out
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You see that here: It says they are not recognized, but they actually are, or once the build would be successful, they suddenly spawn in again
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/998839502560833546/unknown.png
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> all 80 errors are in items.cpp
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ok, stay in that file and try to build again
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then look at the errors again/look at the code you wrote
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> okay, the build failed. i have 62 errors but i cant scroll through them because windows wont let me until i do something with the popup
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You cant click it?
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Or click the top bar of it?
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i cant click anything in the main vs page until i click one of these popup buttons LOL
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea thats to be expected
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> click no i think
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> a lot of them are related to m_pClient or pCurrent
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can you show some
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/998842766165540925/unknown.png

08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Okay thats the same thing, they are also generated to visual studio doesnt recognize them
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Dont worry about those for now
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> you might got a real bug beside all the "pointer to incomplete class" messages and thats why you cant build
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea, he does
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Be he has to find it
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Between all this garbage
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D

08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It says that cuz it doesnt recognize the enum entry
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Dont worry
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> @fokkonaut  do we still have to guaran'tee' seven support in new PR's?
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No, of course not
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> thank good
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i'm still looking :(
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> clientside changes are only for ddnet clients
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or what do you mean?
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Oh
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, yes you have to guarantee it works and doesnt break
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> i mean the whole ToSixup  stuff
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea ofc
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> people should know about ddnet by now and just download it
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> all of the errors are just "this is imcomplete" or stuff like that
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can you try to click on "Project" -> Generate Cache
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> praise teeworlds and everything but its not continued
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> praise teeworlds and everything but ddrace is the future
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There is an issue on whether support for vanilla should be cancelled.

08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> can you link it please
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont have it
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but u should be able to find it
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Voxel classic :D
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> it was located in the switch case i just added too

10:07 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 any idea what this could be about? https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/issues/346 it is probably a ddnet++ issue but i did not edit the http or job pool as far as i know
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> everything in that mod is broken...
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> whats ddnet++ now
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's a mod by chillerdragon
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> what can it do
10:18 <+ChillerDragon> crash
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> xD
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 thanks for deleting my message btw wtf?

15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <destroyed230> he has new version
15:56 <+ChillerDragon> asking for a friend
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> @Ryozuki hello rustacean, can you briefly explain why this code wont work? 🥺👉👈
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> 
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> The error is 
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> ```log 
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> error[E0499]: cannot borrow s as mutable more than once at a time

15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> ```
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> But s2 goes out of the scope before i use s1, whats wrong?
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/998951920876126298/IMG_20220719_165141_723.jpg
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> declare it afterwards
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only one mutable reference may be live at the same time
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> meh okay
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this e.g. ensures that in the presence of multiple threads, only one thread can have a mutable reference to data
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also none of those references need to be mut to begin with, you aren't mutating through them :P
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> That was just a test 😁
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you give something more real-world-y, we might be able to suggest a replacement
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Sure, as soon as i would be doing something not ... test 🧐
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> But thanks
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 did I ever ask you to take a look at @DDNet? I really want to get back to it but I'm still very undecided on the modules, feels way too static
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really wanted something like a central registery of commands instead of passing all messages to all modules, but asynchronous callbacks are so hard to work with
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you have not (that I remember)
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> link?
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (also, I'm unexperienced with rust async stuff)
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/discordbot
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The configuration through environment variables isn't very pleasent either, I'll probably move to something like ini or json or toml
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true i would only use env vars for secrets
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://crates.io/crates/config
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i recommend this crate
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i used it before
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and imho toml is the most readable
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and simple
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill look into ur bot
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 would taking a closure returning a `Box<Future>` work for the command registry?
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, you need something along those lines like, been a while since I looked at it but this is about what I had `for<'f> fn(&'f ctx, &'f msg, &'f args) -> Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output=CommandResult> + Send + 'f>>`
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds horribly long but about right 😮
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The problem was lifetimes, the context of the command needs to just outlast the callback, but I couldn’t for the life of me get it to take anything that’s not static lifetime
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and i thought people wanted more expressive/human language
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that looks even worse than c++ template 😄
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (we don't do async stuff in c++ to be fair, no idea how that looks like)
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is an edge case where the rust syntax fails imo, in regular usage it’s much more pleasant than C++
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It looks much better since you don’t have to spend characters convincing the compiler. However the burden of making sure things live long enough is then upon the coder
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > for<'a> can be read as "for all choices of 'a", and basically produces an infinite list of trait bounds that F must satisfy. Intense. There aren't many places outside of the Fn traits where we encounter HRTBs, and even for those we have a nice magic sugar for the common cases.
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/hrtb.html
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not make a general command trait with an async function and each command is a struct that implements that trait and then u save it on a vector of those traits?
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://docs.rs/async-trait/0.1.56/async_trait/
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can give it a try, with async_trait I think I could make it work
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also if you wanna be database agnostic
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i recommend this https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a orm tho
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but yeah
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its built on top of sqlx
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it uses this https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i kind of did this pattern when making the paypal api, i made a endpoint trait <https://github.com/edg-l/paypal-rs/blob/master/src/endpoint.rs> and then the api endpoints are structs that implement it, this way it also gives the end user the ability to make endpoints that may not yet be implemented, and the api client can execute any struct that impls Endpoint <https://github.com/edg-l/paypal-rs/blob/master/src/api/orders.rs>
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kinda proud of this xd
