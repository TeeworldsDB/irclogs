00:37 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Chairn opened pull request #281: Fix debug compilation on Windows with MinGW.(by Savander) (master...master) http://git.io/v3ByB
00:40 <@deen> Hm, some Sat'LeeT°* guy is finding out private info about people on ddnet servers, strange
00:41 <@deen> really not happy with all the script kiddies on ddnet
00:51 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/v3BQn

00:51 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 84461a6 Dennis Felsing: Merge pull request #281 from Chairn/master...
01:02 < Learath2> Chairn: did you end up fixing the json thing ?
01:02 < Chairn> savander did it
01:03 < Chairn> this is the last commit on deen's repo
01:03 < Learath2> well i always end up renaming json.c to json,cpp to make it work :P
01:03 < Learath2> really excited to see what it was all about :D
01:03 < Chairn> it was a problem about inlining function
01:03 < Chairn> http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/tech/inline.html
01:42 < Chairn> ddos?
01:42 <@deen> Chairn: don't see one
01:42 < Chairn> we couldnt move for 5 secs
01:45 <@deen> weird, could always be an attack to another vps
01:45 <@deen> one of the problems of not having a dedicated server
01:45 <@deen> or just general network problems
01:46 < Chairn> and it killed us :(
01:47 <@deen> damn
01:51 <@deen> hm yeah, see it now too
01:51 <@deen> looks like an overloaded network, but not ours
01:51 <@deen> only some part of the network
01:52 <@deen> i asked qloc for some details about their ddos protection
02:04 < uchar> hi
02:10 <@deen> hi
03:08 <@deen> eeeee: something wrong with teewebs? I can only find 40 servers
09:09 <@EastByte> deen, WolfAlex: should we generally blacklist ips which are requesting info in a short interval?
09:10 <@deen> EastByte: might be a good idea to prevent the spoofing attacks
09:10 <@EastByte> right, should be harder to identify the ips then
09:12 <@deen> This attack for example: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1182&p=21450#p21450
09:15 <@EastByte> btw. https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/f457b58d68e72df83128a7bc779d71a5208dfe47#diff-8be0b73182ebc28e83f65ab6d3335e90R200
09:15 <@EastByte> do we already have vital forced msgs?
09:15 <@EastByte> spoofers probably only use non-vital msgs for attacks
09:15 <@EastByte> so we should implement that
09:18 <@EastByte> ah looks like we are already checking for VITAL
09:20 <@EastByte> damn, wrong branch
09:22 <@EastByte> I will merge this commit into ddnet and test
09:31 <@heinrich5991> deen: is there a naming convention for dummies?
09:35 <@EastByte> the standard dummy is named "brainless tee", otherwise customized by player
09:36 <@heinrich5991> mh k
09:37 <@EastByte> I think we have no way of finding out what players are dummys
09:41 <@heinrich5991> ok
09:44 <@EastByte> deen: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/master/data/maps/Kobra%204.map
09:44 <@EastByte> you added an empty map here
09:45 <@heinrich5991> in the commit "Don't ignore clan of friends by default anymore "
10:02 <@EastByte> someone attacking meskalin's client: "chat: [Whisper]: 'Baumalein is backdoored'->'nameless tee':  Meskalin implemented an backdoor in the client!"
10:39 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east opened pull request #282: force vital check on essential cl/srv messages and added additional s… (master...vitalcheck) http://git.io/v30QH
10:40 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: extra projectile is a game message right?
10:40 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: yes
10:41 <@EastByte> and the client now drops non vital game messages
10:41 <@EastByte> so no backward compatibility?
10:42 < Savander> what means Vital?
10:42 <@heinrich5991> Savander: that it gets a sequence number
10:43 <@heinrich5991> so it will be transmitted like in TCP, you know it'll be delivered
10:43 < Savander> ah
10:43 < Savander> okay
10:43 < Savander> so Vital == it "lives"
10:43 < Savander> ^^>
10:44 <@EastByte> vital means important
10:44 <@EastByte> so it shouldn't get lost
10:44 < Savander> ok, all is clear now for me ^^.
10:44 < Savander> thanks :)
10:47 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east closed pull request #282: force vital check on essential cl/srv messages and added additional s… (master...vitalcheck) http://git.io/v30QH
10:47 <@EastByte> backward compatibility should be fixed first
11:32 < Learath2> ""Not just people with your client" thats so funny because they are safe of being controled by anything including IP spoofing. Your just spreading lies now." How would he prevent being controlled by ip spoofing ?
11:35 <@EastByte> hm, what quote is tht?
11:36 < Learath2> Thats from meskalin in http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1182&p=21450#p21450
11:40 <@EastByte> he probably relies on ddnet spoof protection there
11:41 <@EastByte> but I'm pretty sure he removed this kind of protection to be able to spoof users of baumalein
11:56 <@EastByte> okay I was wrong, the token system is still in there
12:00 < Savander> https://github.com/savander/ddnet/commits/DDRace64
12:00 < Savander> latest two commits
12:00 < Savander> deen want too?
12:00 < Savander> helpfull for movie recording
12:10 <@EastByte> Savander: ehm, what demo is being played?
12:11 < Savander> Active
12:11 <@EastByte> active?
12:12 < Savander> this which you ran
12:12 < Savander> but maybe i should check if something is played
12:18 < Savander> ok i fixed it
12:18 < Savander> it works only when demo isPlaying
12:18 <@EastByte> but how do I select a demo file?
12:18 < Savander> no no
12:18 < Savander> standard command is
12:18 < Savander> play "filename"
12:18 < Savander> playdemo only pause and unpause
12:18 < Savander> via console/command
12:19 <@EastByte> ah, I see
12:19 < Savander> without pressing button in demoplayer
12:20 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] savander opened pull request #283: Improvements for demoplayer (pause/unpause demo is bindable) + you can hide scoreboard after death (master...DDRace64) http://git.io/v3ECI
13:24 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/v3Eip
13:24 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 7cc3fde def: Ooops, restore good Kobra 4 map and cfg
13:36 <@deen> doesn't it cause problems to force vital flags?
13:36 <@deen> like if a packet is lost, then it has to be resent
13:36 <@deen> and if you have high packet loss you end up with even more problems than without the packets being vital
13:37 <@EastByte> deen: those messages are sent with VITAL flag anyway
13:38 <@EastByte> the patch only ignores them when they are not flagged VITAL
13:38 <@EastByte> which can only be a custom program/client
13:39 <@deen> hm, you closed the PR
13:39 <@deen> the patch by Oy then?
13:39 <@EastByte> yes, there is an issue
13:39 <@EastByte> I'm waiting for Oy to fix this issue
13:40 <@EastByte> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1381
13:43 <@deen> should i add an autoexec-server.cfg and autoexec-client.cfg?
13:43 <@deen> to be specific?
13:44 <@EastByte> will it fallback to autoexec.cfg?
13:44 <@deen> yes, but when both exist, should it run both?
13:44 <@EastByte> not sure :p
13:45 <@EastByte> I think it should run both
13:47 < Savander> autoexec-client should be only ran when client ran i think? Then server autoexec when server ran
13:59 < anyone> hi ... i have a question
13:59 <@deen> hi anyone 
14:00 < anyone> deen? 
14:01 < anyone> or is a mapper online?
14:01 <@deen> I guess you can just ask your question
14:02 < anyone> 0k
14:02 <@deen> Here are mostly developers, if you want to talk to mappers http://forum.ddnet.tw/ might lead to more success, but we can try anyway^^
14:02 <@EastByte> anyone is allowed to ask questions
14:03 < anyone> i found the png pic "entities" in the data of my ddnet client, and now i dont know what is the hook thought entitie-> i need it for some part :)
14:04 <@deen> hookthrough is the 7th tile in the top row
14:06 < anyone> thank you, but if i play with ocerlay entities ingame i just see blue points at hook thought
14:07 < o_be_two> yop
14:07 <@deen> i know, we changed the way it looks ingame
14:07 <@deen> because the way it's in entities.png is way too distracting
14:07 <@deen> and many people actually play with entities ingame
14:07 < Savander> anyone, don't forget to place some hookable/unhoobale tiles too
14:07 < Savander> becasue hookthrough doesn't have collision
14:07 <@deen> if you want to see how something is mapped, generally just open another map in the editor and look at the part
14:08 < anyone> ? but i cant make hookable tiles AND hook through together 
14:08 < Savander> ofc
14:08 <@deen> anyone: you need to make a front layer
14:08 < Savander> you should
14:08 < Savander> deen,  he not, but should
14:10 < anyone> how i make two layers on one tile o.Õ
14:10 < Savander> you know how to make a layer?
14:10 <@deen> anyone: on the game group, right click and select "Add front layer"
14:10 < Savander> where you put images
14:11 < o_be_two> I'll work on OVH ddos security too, soon :D !
14:11 < anyone> oh thank you very much deen :)) i am not good at mapping its tze first time i do this ... you helped me thank you very much, mb i see you ingame BB
14:12 <@deen> o_be_two: great
14:12 <@deen> anyone: bye and good luck. I think there are some mapping tutorials you may be interested in
14:12 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1033
14:13 < anyone> i think the best is chiller dragons but its german and just for dm or ctf

16:01 <@deen> not sure how my database replication is supposed to work with > 90% packet loss to china =/
16:03 < Savander> where is lowest packet losS? to which location? It's possible to make replication through 2 servers?
16:04 <@deen> Savander: well, ddnet replication is a bit stupid^^
16:04 <@deen> it's a big circle of servers
16:04 <@deen> the problem is the connection from GER -> China
16:04 <@deen> China has trouble to each location (> 10% packet loss), but to GER > 90% right now
16:05 < Savander> i thinking about connection ger -> something -> chile... chile -> something -> ger
16:05 < Savander> ^^>
16:05 <@deen> right
16:05 < Savander> <crazy>
16:05 <@deen> It's this:
16:05 <@deen> ddnet.tw -> GER -> CHN -> USA -> CAN -> BRA -> CHL -> ZAF -> RUS -> ddnet.tw
16:05 <@deen> :P
16:06 <@deen> i wish there was a good way to do each-to-each replication with mysql
16:06 < Savander> oh
16:06 < Savander> xD
16:06 < Savander> ye, it looks like a circle ^^>
16:06 <@deen> maybe I'll just switch GER and ddnet.tw, then it should be fine
16:07 < Savander> oh, ger and ddnet.tw are 2 different servers?
16:07 <@deen> right
16:08 <@deen> i could totally run them on the same server, but then there's more chance for ddos attacks
16:08 < Savander> ofc, the best solution would be switching server depending on packes loss ^^
16:08 < Savander> i mean from chile to somewhere
16:12 < Savander> i have 2% paccket loss 
16:12 < Savander> to chile ^^;
16:13 < Savander> 1-2%
16:13 <@deen> china is the problem, not chile :P
16:13 < Savander> ah CHINA
16:13 < Savander> heh
16:13 < Savander> xD
16:13 < Savander> woah china
16:13 < Savander> most stable server
16:13 < Savander> 525 without restarting
16:13 < Savander> 525 days*
16:14 <@deen> haha yeah
16:14 <@deen> never restarted^^
16:14 < Savander> oh
16:14 < Savander> eheh
16:14 < Savander> 80% packet loss
16:14 < Savander> it's not that big!
16:14 <@deen> when i connect to the chinese server with ssh, i always proxy over USA to get less packet loss^^
16:14 < Savander> the problem is.. chinatelecomeurope.com
16:14 < Savander> !
16:15 <@deen> Host chn.ddnet.tw
16:15 <@deen>   ProxyCommand ssh -q usa.ddnet.tw nc -q0 chn.ddnet.tw 22
16:15 < Savander> from usa is the best?
16:15 <@deen> yeah, only 10 % packet loss
16:15 < Savander> so maybe you should make replication to USA
16:15 < Savander> then to ger or smth?^^
16:15 <@deen> yes, that's the plan
16:16 < Savander> will be the best
16:17 < Savander> http://www.cteurope.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=frontpage&Itemid=1&lang=en
16:17 < Savander> funny site

16:18 < Savander> maybe flash or smth
16:21 <@deen> yeah
16:23 < DawnDN> huhu east
16:23 <@deen> hi DawnDN 
16:23 < DawnDN> hey deen
16:27 < DawnDN> deen, I've a new idea for the DDNet Client
16:29 <@deen> DawnDN: what's that?
16:29 < DawnDN> also
16:29 <@EastByte> english pls
16:30 < DawnDN> also is english, lel
16:30 <@EastByte> well, continue your sentence then^^
16:31 < Savander> XDDD
16:32 < DawnDN> many tees stimulates it to that when they write and have a chat break, everything is deleted
16:32 <@deen> Maybe try saying it in German, I don't understand^^
16:33 <@deen> ah, you mean when you hit Escape while chatting
16:33 <@deen> that the chat should stay there when you continue chatting later?
16:34 < DawnDN> my idea is, that you can bind a key (for example 'E") and if you are chatting and you press like STRG + E or something else and the chat won't be deleted, and you can continue writing where you stopped
16:34 < DawnDN> and and and xD
16:34 <@deen> don't really like the idea
16:34 < DawnDN> why?
16:35 <@deen> it's another hidden feature that only 5-10 people will ever find and use
16:35 < DawnDN> then write it into news or something else :D or broadcast
16:35 <@deen> you could also just accept that DDNet is not a full chat program, but a game instead :P
16:35 < DawnDN> sure
16:36 < DawnDN> but if you writting a very long text and than you have to press ESC 
16:36 <@EastByte> deen: having small additional (and undocumented) features isn't so bad I think
16:36 < DawnDN> 'cause of a fail
16:36 < DawnDN> it would bring me to rage
16:36 <@deen> DawnDN: why don't you just press enter?
16:36 <@deen> and keep writing the rest later
16:36 <@EastByte> that's what WolfAlex always does in irc
16:36 < DawnDN> that's boring
16:36 <@EastByte> it's just stupid^^
16:36 < DawnDN> yea
16:37 <@EastByte> DawnDN: btw. you can just go to the beginning of the line, add a /, press enter
16:37 <@EastByte> then it's not displayed
16:37 <@EastByte> afterwards press up and remove the / again
16:37 < DawnDN> no time to write that, if someone is failing the map 
16:37 < laxadedi> Chairn: Je rentre plus tard que d'habitude ce soir.
16:38 <@deen> DawnDN: why do you write poems while your team is failing :P
16:38 <@EastByte> laxadedi: english pls
16:38 < Savander> xxD
16:38 < DawnDN> deen: maan, let me, I don't find arguments for that xD
16:38 <@deen> laxadedi: just walk over to your brother's room instead of writing him in irc :P
16:38 < DawnDN> it's teeworlds! :D
16:38 < Chairn> EastByte: he should have done it privately, blame him
16:38 < laxadedi> deen: I am at work right now :)
16:39 < Chairn> deen: im home, he's hardly working
16:39 < laxadedi> I am going to get Elky's autograph tonight :D !
16:39 < Savander> you're family ? ^^

16:40 < laxadedi> One of the first ever pro gamer in France and nowaday, best online poker player
16:41 <@deen> maybe we could have a setting whether escape resets the chat text or keeps it stored?
16:41 < Chairn> Savander: we're brother
16:41 <@deen> would that be good for you, DawnDN ?
16:42 <@deen> or just use f1, say "foobar"
16:42 < Savander> ^^
16:42 < DawnDN> sound good
16:42 < Savander> thats good solution deen !
16:42 < Savander> without any changes
16:42 < Savander> haha ^^
16:42 <@deen> DawnDN: f1 or the setting?
16:42 < DawnDN> settings
16:43 < DawnDN> ah, and another idea
16:43 < DawnDN> omg my brain is so good
16:43 < DawnDN> xD
16:43 < DawnDN> how about paste? if you copy a URL or a text from the browser or something else, go in teeworlds, open the chat and press STRG + V and it's pasted
16:44 <@EastByte> old one
16:44 <@EastByte> it's hard to do c&p platform independent
16:44 < laxadedi> Is it really ?
16:45 <@EastByte> no, not really, but wasn't the plan to wait for sdl2?
16:45 <@deen> paste would work with sdl2
16:45 <@EastByte> see^
16:45 < DawnDN> :D
16:45 <@deen> but there are a few problems with sdl2 i couldn't fix
16:45 <@EastByte> and that means no c&p for ddnet =)
16:45 < laxadedi> But, converting to SDL2 isn't as easy at it should be right ?
16:45 <@deen> alternatively someone can figure out how to do copy&paste on windows, linux and mac
16:45 < DawnDN> deen: but it's a good idea? :D
16:45 <@deen> laxadedi: it worked mostly, i had a list of bugs in the ddnet issues somewhere
16:46 <@deen> DawnDN: yeah
16:46 < DawnDN> I am so good :3
16:46 < DawnDN> deen: ah you know, I am groot? :D
16:46 < laxadedi> Well, not a good idea, for me everything should handle clipboard correctly xD
16:47 < laxadedi> I agree with deen, it's stupid to develop something that would be useless once teeworlds goes to SDL2
16:47 < laxadedi> another idea
16:47 < laxadedi> merge clipboard handle from SDL2 to SDL1.x, might be possible, or maybe not ^^
16:47 <@deen> DawnDN: don't remember any groot, sorry
16:48 <@deen> laxadedi: not
16:48 < DawnDN> UNSC
16:48 < DawnDN> :D
16:48 <@deen> DawnDN: ah, right
16:51 < DawnDN> ^^

17:06 < DawnDN> yeay :3
17:06 <@deen> it's not in any menu as I think most people are not interested in that
17:06 < DawnDN> ok ^^
17:07 < DawnDN> deen: if my website is done (http://ragent.de/oldschool/), Oldschool and DDNet may can be partners? :D
17:07 < DawnDN> OMG, dat english skills xD
17:07 <@deen> your website is missing content
17:07 <@deen> but nice flower anyway
17:08 < DawnDN> atm it's just the design
17:08 < DawnDN> the overlay
17:08 <@deen> anyway, I don't see a use in any form of partnering
17:08 < DawnDN> I think in end of the month the website is done
17:08 <@deen> you can of course post about your clan website in the ddnet forum
17:08 < DawnDN> ok ^^
17:09 < DawnDN> how do you like the design? the fonts, background, etc? :D
17:09 <@deen> looks very teeish
17:10 < DawnDN> :D
17:10 < DawnDN> also good or not so?
17:10 <@deen> good i guess, but i'm not a webdesign expert
17:11 < DawnDN> I mean, you're a teeworlder. You want to join a clan, a good one. Which can give you a good athmosphere, etc. He looks at the site to write an application. Do you think, he would write an application if the webside has a very ugly design?
17:12 <@deen> I never understood clans, so how would I know? :P
17:12 < DawnDN> ._.
17:12 < DawnDN> maybe our Clan can use your Teamspeak for speaking? :D
17:13 < DawnDN> also with an own "Oldschool"-Channel
17:13 < DawnDN> clan-channel
17:13 < DawnDN> whatever
17:13 <@deen> ask laxadedi about that, it's his TS server
17:14 < DawnDN> alexibexi
17:14 < DawnDN> laxadedi: hellu dear friend! :D
17:15 < laxadedi> ddracepro.net
17:15 < laxadedi> no password
17:15 < laxadedi> create your temp channel
17:15 < DawnDN> that's the prob
17:15 < DawnDN> we want a perm channel
17:15 < laxadedi> How is that a problem ?
17:15 < DawnDN> :D
17:15 < laxadedi> Well, you'll have one later, can't right now
17:15 < DawnDN> hrhr, thanks bra :3
17:35 < Nimda> New channel peak for #ddnet: 28 users online. Old one was 27 users online at 2015-08-10 19:04:29 (1 day, 22 hours, 31 minutes and 3 seconds ago)
17:37 <@deen> hi solala 
17:37 < solala> hi
17:44 <@EastByte> hello
18:16 <@EastByte> deen: I think now I have a proper solution against ip spoofing
18:16 <@deen> nice
18:17 <@EastByte> I overlooked the token system we currently have in ddnet
18:17 <@EastByte> it's perfectly usable to protect against spoofed connecting clients
18:17 <@EastByte> and for non-ddnet/vanilla clients I can use the gametick approach
18:19 <@EastByte> this is gonna be a long night :)
18:21 < DawnDN> for me, too :D but not because off programming ;))))
18:23 < Chairn> pfff, im stuck on the background thing
19:20 <@deen> Savander: maybe you have an idea: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=2016&p=21490#p21490
19:22 < Savander> GameServer-
19:22 < Savander> >/
19:22 < Savander> ??
19:22 < Savander> it should be m_pGameServer
19:23 < Savander> instead of GameServer
19:23 <@deen> right, want to respond?
19:23 < Savander> im working right now
19:23 < Savander> on trailer
19:23 < Savander> can you?
19:25 <@deen> ok
19:25 < Savander> thanks ;)
20:51 <@deen> qloc doesn't make a good impression so far, they ignored my mail asking about more details
20:51 < Savander> this hosting
20:51 < Savander> only with Windows?
20:52 <@deen> yeah
20:52 <@deen> but with good ping and ddos protection
20:53 < Savander> Ha! Maybe they know you
20:53 < Savander> and those big ddos
20:53 < Savander> !
20:53 < Savander> :>
20:53 <@deen> sure, I tell the hosters before what ddos attacks to expect and if they can handle it
21:54 <@deen> hi masoudd

22:12 <@heinrich5991> right now on the front page of the internet: test roast please ignore
22:19 <@deen> eh, got an answer by qloc finally, they only want to respond in teamspeak, not per email...
