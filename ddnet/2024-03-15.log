00:21 < bridge> <Ewan> i rly feel like the game UIs should have a separate software anti-aliasing implementation
00:21 < bridge> <Ewan> so that people can play the game at the lowest latency without their menus looking like complete shit
00:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i love the new spinner ui thing but it (like any circle) looks really bad with aliased pixels

02:57 < bridge> <Ewan> very good
08:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Today i had a c class and we were talking about `if` statements. There was such an example:
08:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
08:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```c
08:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> int i;
08:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
08:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if (i = 3) {
08:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     printf("i equals 3")
08:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
08:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
08:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :pepeW:
08:08 < bridge> <meloÆž> :owo:
08:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No way. Where was the example? In a book?
08:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> libtw2 or twmap? Python or rust? And by block you mean tile in a map?
08:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you want python twmap here is a 100 line example on how to set tiles https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds-reverse-gametiles/blob/master/reverse-gametiles.py
08:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: i think professor wrote it himself. He is abso fucking lutely clueless
08:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Idk how he still has a job
08:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> On like a sheet? What do your materials look like?
08:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea for me teaching C in high school seems like a crazy concept anyways. We had nothing technical what so ever. We did 1 day of html if you signed up for it.
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I can not imagine how a class looks like full of non interested teenagers when the topic is C. Nobody writes actual code I assume. So the teachers also donâ€™t have to be elite hackers.
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @milkeeycat: did you correct your prof?
08:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You got that easily with all examples I named
08:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Assuming your reply to (null) was my message xd
08:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also if itâ€™s http 1 the protocol is plaintext you can implement it probably in 4 lines vanilla go lang no dependencies
09:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: i didn't care, i was reading about pratt parser at the moment xd
09:54 < bridge> <Ewan> :feelsbadman:
10:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `i` does equal 3 there :p the `printf` is missing a `\n` though
10:12 < bridge> <teero777> And a semicolon xd
10:14 < bridge> <teero777> Do you not see edits on irc?
10:15 < bridge> <teero777> it's already solved thanks to imilchshake
10:38 < bridge> <teero777> But for clarification my question was to place tiles with twmap rust
12:30 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> ty
12:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: we had a bunch of haskell and C# at school, I think it was good ðŸ™‚
12:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Haskell :monkaStop:
13:39 < bridge> <teero777> We did java a little bit but not much really. I remember the code from the book had so many bugs. I have no idea how our teacher got a CS degree in the first place. She was kind of lost and when she didn't understand smth she asked me and a colleague of mine.

14:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wtf
14:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lmao
14:15 < bridge> <cyberFighter> wtf lmao

14:15 < bridge> <cyberFighter> goofy ass average fps
15:13 < bridge> <louis> @milkeeycat ur still in high school?
15:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> No, in university :p
18:08 < bridge> <zhn> which one?
18:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Pretty bad one ðŸ˜¬
18:27 < bridge> <zhn> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
20:00 < bridge> <learath2> With the single =?
20:00 < bridge> <learath2> The disrespect people have for C drives me mad, go teach whatever other language you know if you hate it so much
20:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Yea
20:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I like C :owo:
20:23 < zohan> nRx:
20:23 < nRx> q
20:23 < zohan> ChillerDragon:
21:12 < bridge> <peter0x44> Still, a bunch of education regarding C is HORRIBLE
21:12 < bridge> <peter0x44> Things like sanitizers should be mentioned on page 1, right after "gcc builds code" and such
21:12 < bridge> <peter0x44> Plenty of people are set up for failure
21:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> gcc should invoke -Wall by def
21:25 < bridge> <peter0x44> Oh yes, that too
21:25 < bridge> <peter0x44> Also worth noting, some warnings depend on optimizations
21:26 < bridge> <peter0x44> So probably -O1 or -O2 on top of that is good
21:31 < bridge> <hamidreza6> Shouldn't this be "Reload" or somethin'?
21:31 < bridge> <hamidreza6> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1218295474625314957/screenshot_2024-03-15_23-57-24.png?ex=66072513&is=65f4b013&hm=620a9fae642cb0253217d5a0d2ee48d1900d6e4a34a65d73048fdc75eb6f7a5f&
21:34 < bridge> <robyt3> There already was a lengthy debate about the name before this was added: #5823
21:34 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5823
21:40 < bridge> <hamidreza6> Interesting actually
21:45 < bridge> <hamidreza6> Though I believe "Reload" would be a better fit.
21:46 < bridge> <robyt3> It does say "reload" in the tooltip FWIW
21:47 < bridge> <hamidreza6> Yeah but "Readd" looks weird
21:47 < bridge> <hamidreza6> I thought it was a typo until I checked the src
21:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Makes sense to me because that's what it really does, it add the image again
21:48 < bridge> <robyt3> "Reload" could mean it reloads the image from the same map again
22:46 < bridge> <cyberFighter> hi
22:47 < bridge> <cyberFighter> theres a bug in this image, is it a default one?
22:47 < bridge> <cyberFighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1218314631420969041/image.png?ex=660736eb&is=65f4c1eb&hm=632959b300e560180058a6a1a698dea8f8da9f67e903ceea23aa9bed966c5946&
22:49 < bridge> <hamidreza6> Yes
22:51 < bridge> <hamidreza6> How did u even see that lol
22:52 < bridge> <cyberFighter> eagle eyes
22:53 < bridge> <cyberFighter> ok my game just crashed because i logged into my account in fokkonauts server
22:54 < bridge> <cyberFighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1218316306730713128/DDNet_win64-steam_crash_log_2024-03-15_22-50-03_8732_6df1d251d727946d4b14c8bb93b478457f65d0f9.RTP?ex=6607387a&is=65f4c37a&hm=94ad0595cf7287b6ee7c11eb8fbee0fab6a75f0851ca6e29436000791e60a783&
23:02 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks similar to #8101, thanks for the report
23:02 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8101
23:02 < bridge> <cyberFighter> oh i thought it was only because of the mod
23:03 < bridge> <cyberFighter> it has like a feature where you can choose different designs of the map and you like change map without leaving the server or anything
23:03 < bridge> <cyberFighter> and i crashed while the map was loading
23:03 < bridge> <robyt3> ah, it's probably related to that
23:04 < bridge> <robyt3> the other crash was on GER10 which might have weird map loading for protection
23:08 < bridge> <cyberFighter> ok thanks
