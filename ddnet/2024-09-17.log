02:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice @milkeeycat 
02:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can any matrix enjoyer still receive images? For me none of my desktop clients show them anymore.
02:11 < bridge> <furo> Works fine for me.
02:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which client?
02:21 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> a okay Cinny shows one now after reloading it twice interesting
02:22 < bridge> <furo> The element web client and SchildiChat on phone. The only things I don't see are larger files, which exceed the bridge file limit.
02:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hydrogen.element.io ?
02:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> oh yea indeed that works too
02:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> okay seems like only my element desktop and Cinny sometimes is broken
02:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks @furo 
02:30 < bridge> <furo> Nah, not this. I meant, https://app.element.io
04:28 < bridge> <m2mbo> i from russia
04:33 < bridge> <Ewan> congratulations
05:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THIS SECRET CONFIG VARIABLE!!!
05:42 < bridge> <Ewan> so true
05:42 < bridge> <Ewan> but actually this seems huge
06:02 < bridge> <totar> literally lol

07:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> During that time I made all the possible mistakes, it took me 30 mins to realize I removed broadcast type from address type and it wasn't packets ;-;
07:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> During that time I made all the possible mistakes, it took me 30 mins to realize I removed broadcast type from address type and it wasn't sending packets ;-;
08:16 < bridge> <pathos3005> For your 0.6/0.7 JSaurusRex's DM+/CTF+ server, can you link the repo?
08:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Jsaurus/ddnet vanilla branch
08:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why @pathos3005 ?

10:27 < bridge> <AssassinTee> does ddnet support 0.7 servers? I was wondering, because I find servers with teeworlds 0.7

11:09 < bridge> <justniceasalways> 
11:09 < bridge> <justniceasalways> Also I think it's better to load announcement file when server starts
11:19 < bridge> <zhn> wtf is this even
11:19 < bridge> <zhn> yeah it semi-does now with latest
11:23 < bridge> <.puch> cause ddnet is real client now even for vanilla players
11:24 < bridge> <.puch> I wonder if we could enhance vanilla hud like gamer client used to do
11:24 < bridge> <zhn> still no antiping there
11:24 < bridge> <zhn> sucks playing on 07 servers ngl
11:24 < bridge> <.puch> you mean when we play on 0.7 we don't have any antiping?
11:25 < bridge> <zhn> exactly
11:25 < bridge> <.puch> didn't even notice xd
11:25 < bridge> <zhn> try to join rus 07 servers if theres some xd
11:25 < bridge> <.puch> but yeah the feeling is weird cause it looks like a different game
11:25 < bridge> <.puch> cause it is ofc
11:25 < bridge> <zhn> 07 has another physics afair
11:26 < bridge> <zhn> i don't remember if ddnet can mimic it
11:26 < bridge> <.puch> yeah that's crazy
11:26 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> why
11:26 < bridge> <AssassinTee> just in a few edge cases, shouldn't be an issue or do you have any major physics change in mind?
11:26 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> whats the reason to do that
11:26 < bridge> <.puch> but 0.7 ddnet > pure 0.7
11:26 < bridge> <zhn> strong(tm) hook by default is the only i can recall now actually
11:27 < bridge> <zhn> but still bouncing is there
11:27 < bridge> <zhn> so nothing major
11:27 < bridge> <.puch> I have more fps on ddnet
11:27 < bridge> <zhn> idk why but some 07 players "feel game better with 07"
11:27 < bridge> <zhn> we still have 07 only vani players
11:27 < bridge> <AssassinTee> bouncing doesn't affect the 0.7 physics, because it doesn't affect it ( I was the guy who implemented it)
11:28 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> cuz they r stubborn
11:28 < bridge> <.puch> it's just cause the guys are used to that client
11:28 < bridge> <zhn> what do you mean it doesn't afdect it
11:28 < bridge> <zhn> affect*
11:28 < bridge> <AssassinTee> sorry what kind of bouncing do you mean? player bouncing or the bouncing tuning?
11:28 < bridge> <.puch> but imo nowadays ddnet won the fight of the best client I guess
11:28 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> theres no tuning in vanilla
11:28 < bridge> <zhn> player bouncing, i didn't mentiont elasticity, sry
11:28 < bridge> <zhn> mention*
11:28 < bridge> <AssassinTee> wild take and wrong
11:29 < bridge> <zhn> i need a hard eep rn
11:29 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ur wrong
11:29 < bridge> <zhn> ur
11:29 < bridge> <zhn> u can tune vanilla
11:29 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ok go make it bouncy
11:29 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I mean elasticity doesn't affect it, because elasticity doesn't affect standard physics üôÇ
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I mean elasticity doesn't affect it, because elasticity doesn't affect standard physics üôÇ 0.7 should be equal to elasticity 0
11:30 < bridge> <.puch> imo next step is ddnet take more & more into account vanilla like make evolve hud etc
11:30 < bridge> <.puch> even 0.7 we don't care anymore
11:30 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, i mean bouncing is an issue actually, its like a third leg that came out of current character collision check loop
11:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> already done https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/3136
11:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> already done <https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/3136>
11:32 < bridge> <AssassinTee> okay, wasn't aware of that, thank you!
11:32 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> its not released
11:32 < bridge> <AssassinTee> then go release it
11:32 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> why
11:33 < bridge> <zhn> cyb go replace oy
11:33 < bridge> <zhn> become a new tw maintainer
11:33 < bridge> <.puch> even matricks is showing in that discord compared to pure tw.
11:33 < bridge> <zhn> :troll:
11:33 < bridge> <.puch> it means ddnet really won cause development is there now
11:33 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i would rather work on ddrace and mods rather than the same 2 gamemodes  for 13 years
11:33 < bridge> <.puch> the change is there
11:33 < bridge> <.puch> :p
11:34 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I think at this point it would be easier to integrate teeworlds 0.7 stuff into ddnet and make it dead
11:34 < bridge> <.puch> you're the future anyway it's not about make teeworlds 0.7 dead
11:34 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> what is even missing from 0.7
11:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> Oy joining ddnet :greenthing:
11:35 < bridge> <.puch> anyway as a vanilla player I think we are happy with what you've done with ddnet
11:35 < bridge> <zhn> yeah imagine 1 mod killed original 5 mods
11:35 < bridge> <.puch> that's life
11:35 < bridge> <AssassinTee> there actually were some really nice teeworlds mods I am missing üò¶
11:36 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ddmax's fault for banning deen
11:36 < bridge> <zhn> same here
11:36 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> :gigachad:
11:36 < bridge> <.puch> 1 mod didn't kill 5 mods but 5 mods were dead cause they didn't evolve
11:36 < bridge> <.puch> ddrace was the future they integrated all other mods in their client
11:36 < bridge> <zhn> but they did, people don't want to pvp these days like this
11:36 < bridge> <.puch> vanilla just had to move with them that's all
11:36 < bridge> <.puch> community was more active update better that's all
11:37 < bridge> <zhn> i remember having like a tons of kog and alike mods with pvp in mind and they were playable
11:37 < bridge> <AssassinTee> easier said then done, go evolve a mod made for 0.7 for ddnet
11:37 < bridge> <AssassinTee> @Puch easier said then done, go evolve a mod made for 0.7 for ddnet
11:37 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i think its because the game isnt shown as a pvp game
11:37 < bridge> <zhn> by whom
11:37 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ddnet
11:37 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> where new players come from
11:37 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> steam page or something
11:37 < bridge> <AssassinTee> @gerdoe do you know, if the 0.7 skins/partial skins are now possible in ddnet?
11:37 < bridge> <.puch> I know that's hard @essigautomat
11:38 < bridge> <zhn> all ddrace players came from old race/vani mods
11:38 < bridge> <.puch> when I saw the nightmare to do a gctf server
11:38 < bridge> <.puch> we can ty chillerdragon for the work
11:38 < bridge> <zhn> and then ddnet established as second fundament of this game
11:38 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> im talking about new new players
11:38 < bridge> <zhn> yeah it does
11:38 < bridge> <.puch> but that's the point the problem was we didn't merge to one team
11:38 < bridge> <.puch> but that's the point the problem was we didn't merge devs to one team
11:38 < bridge> <.puch> we kept 2 different teams for what?
11:38 < bridge> <zhn> new new players are half blockers and half racers
11:39 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> block isnt real pvp
11:39 < bridge> <.puch> for ego? idk what happened
11:39 < bridge> <.puch> it's just ddnet evolved better in the end
11:39 < bridge> <zhn> what it is then
11:39 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> its dogshit
11:40 < bridge> <zhn> ddnet just merget everything that master didn't kek
11:40 < bridge> <.puch> idk what happened i wasn't there anyway
11:40 < bridge> <zhn> ddnet just merged everything that master didn't kek
11:40 < bridge> <zhn> still pvp/pve
11:40 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> idk i dont count block as a real gamemode because it doesnt have an end goal
11:40 < bridge> <.puch> that's a mode anyway
11:40 < bridge> <zhn> to become the best blocker ofc
11:41 < bridge> <.puch> the point is to chat and block players
11:41 < bridge> <.puch> xd
11:41 < bridge> <AssassinTee> missing the block trounament mode xD
11:41 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> thats like saying the point of ctf is to become the best player
11:41 < bridge> <AssassinTee> missing the block tournnament mode xD
11:41 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> and not to capture the flag
11:41 < bridge> <zhn> join bw or rb :p
11:41 < bridge> <.puch> @cyberfrighter you don't imagine the ego there is in ctf
11:41 < bridge> <zhn> thats a thing: u can set any goal in block
11:41 < bridge> <.puch> ofc you had some players they didn't care about the flags lol
11:41 < bridge> <zhn> map actually defines the goals
11:41 < bridge> <.puch> they were playing dm
11:41 < bridge> <zhn> mini arenas and all
11:42 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> theres still no finish though
11:42 < bridge> <.puch> mini arenas were cool I admit
11:42 < bridge> <zhn> if u enjoy with finish, go with finish kekw
11:42 < bridge> <zhn> still u have a goal
11:42 < bridge> <zhn> to keep ur arena clean and clear
11:43 < bridge> <.puch> anyway ddnet is cool a lot of good vani players play it
11:43 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> there is ego everywhere
11:43 < bridge> <zhn> its like king of hill, do you think it has no goals at all or what
11:43 < bridge> <.puch> @cyberfrighter yes but the level in vanilla was hard
11:44 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> wdgm
11:44 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> what level in vanilla
11:45 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> block is endless though
11:45 < bridge> <.puch> I mean we had plenty of players considering other mods like shit
11:45 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> idk
11:45 < bridge> <.puch> when ddrace opened
11:45 < bridge> <zhn> king of hill too
11:45 < bridge> <zhn> becausr no timelimit
11:45 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i dont know king of hill btw, i was talking about a koth mode i had in my head
11:45 < bridge> <.puch> but I also remember we had cool moments in oldschool maps in ddrace server xd
11:46 < bridge> <zhn> irl game
11:46 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> oh
11:47 < bridge> <zhn> u just trying until all u would head out of the game kekw
11:47 < bridge> <zhn> so still every mod has a goal if people play it
11:47 < bridge> <zhn> we had goalless mods that were mmorpg like
11:47 < bridge> <zhn> but its just specific of mmorpg
11:48 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> A lmao
11:48 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i actually want to try coding
11:48 < bridge> <zhn> would u call azataz or teeadventure dogshit because they have no goal?
11:48 < bridge> <zhn> i wouldn't personally
11:48 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> idk what either one of those are
11:49 < bridge> <zhn> azataz=reazataz=mrpg
11:49 < bridge> <zhn> and teeadventure was 07 mod
11:49 < bridge> <zhn> by mrcosmo and mranderson(?)
12:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I just crashed teeworlds server :justatest:
12:19 < bridge> <learath2> CVE

13:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: I still don't understand how to handle tokens, how can I store it to send connless packet with it? Teeworlds had `CNetTokenCache` for storing tokens but I can't see anything like that in ddnet
14:04 < bridge> <learath2> We generate our tokens deterministically from a seed and the source ip
14:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but teeworlds server doesn't, right?
14:10 < bridge> <learath2> idk I haven't cared about that part of teeworlds for such a long time
14:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I send 2 exactly same packets to teeworlds server and it returns different tokens

14:23 < bridge> <learath2> Mh, as long as the response token == request token, it's fine, no?
14:24 < bridge> <AssassinTee> does anybody know who [this](<https://github.com/sctt>) gh user (name sctt) is? He did a PR in ddnet a while ago and I want to PM him üôÇ
14:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I don't understand xdd
14:29 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe we are talking about different things. What packet are you sending? What do you expect to get? Why do you think it's wrong?
14:30 < bridge> <learath2> I just noticed I don't even have teeworlds cloned on this computer, that's how long it has been since I last looked at vanilla üòÑ
14:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I want to show local running teeworlds servers in lan tab in ddnet client. To send connless packet and get server info I need first get token from server, so I need to send ctrl packet first.
14:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that's what I did at least to get the data :justatest:
14:35 < bridge> <learath2> Huh, iirc lan servers bypass the token part
14:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :monkaS:
14:36 < bridge> <furo> They have two emails listed in the DDNet git log, if you wanna try that route.
14:37 < bridge> <AssassinTee> emails, hmm, nah xD
14:39 < bridge> <learath2> Okay, this 0.6.5 inspired token thing is not what I remember at all
14:40 < bridge> <learath2> Can you people stop implementing dead stuff into ddnet? I have to remember like 8 versions of the protocol
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @AssassinTee you can ping him in the official github livechat https://github.com/ChillerDragon/github-meta/issues/5
14:40 < bridge> <AssassinTee> there is a github livechat üòÆ
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes its marked as issues 
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but if you create a issue called "live chat" thats fixed
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pusi @AssassinTee 
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat yea you get a new token for every connection
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just store the first token you get from the other party and include it in your header from now on
14:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> where do I have to store it? xDDDD
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in your RAM
14:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> fair
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe a variable xd
14:46 < bridge> <AssassinTee> pusi? I don't think the urban dictionary one is meant <https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pusi>
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pussy as in scared because you did not ping him in the epic chat i sent yet
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what are you waiting for?
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and yes the urbandictionary description seems accurate btw
14:48 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yeah I noticed
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so wat u waiting for
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do you need a wingman?
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hey @sctt do you know assa?
14:49 < bridge> <AssassinTee> nah the topic is just too useless. Just wanted to thank him for this tool and show a map I made with it
14:50 < bridge> <AssassinTee> nah the topic is just too useless. Just wanted to thank him for this tool and show a map I made with it if he's interested
14:50 < bridge> <learath2> @milkeeycat what version of running teeworlds servers don't get displayed in the lan tab?
14:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats what this issue is for @AssassinTee if you can write stuff in ddnet #developer you can also write it there
14:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe he sees it maybe not
14:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> use client from github master branch?
14:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 0.7
14:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat master is fine
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> is 0.6.5 fine?
14:52 < bridge> <AssassinTee> @milkeeycat In the past the lan tab only showed ports 8000 to 8010, maybe this is an issue here?
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
14:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 0.7 server info is a different protocol it is just not implemented yet
14:52 < bridge> <AssassinTee> @milkeeycat In the past the lan tab only showed ports 8303 to 8310 maybe this is an issue here?
14:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but ye the same port range limitation exists its how the lan works. It spams out a request to the port range and waits for a response.
14:53 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I remember I "fixed" that and then crashed my router with 65K requests üôÇ
14:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao by "fixed" you mean you implemented a full range port scanner? xd
14:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :gigachad:
14:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> troll
14:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> don't forget the lan servers in other ip ranges hehe 
14:56 < bridge> <learath2> I actually for once do not understand at all how this even works in 0.7 `// connless packets without token are not allowed` isn't this comment wrong?
14:57 < bridge> <learath2> `SERVERBROWSE_GETINFO` messages are sent without a token
14:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u readin tw master?
14:57 < bridge> <AssassinTee> git blame the person
14:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but they have to be
14:57 < bridge> <learath2> yes
14:58 < bridge> <learath2> It's normal, that's how it's supposed to be, how are you supposed to have a token on a connless message, tokens are for connections to prevent spoofed connections
14:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea idk as a gamer i never really was interested in the connless stuff the only xp i have with it comes from talking to milkeey in this channel xd
14:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/c56fa9e6a20cfc9d7d16502e18c7d7633acdf492/src/engine/shared/network_token.cpp#L176 this function fetches token if it doens't exist in cache
14:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> (probably)
14:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 i assume it comes from the reflection attack times 
14:59 < bridge> <robyt3> There's a separate token for LAN requests on 0.7 AFAICT:
14:59 < bridge> <robyt3> - `m_CurrentLanToken = GetNewToken();`
14:59 < bridge> <robyt3> - `int SrvBrwsToken = Unpacker.GetInt();`
15:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> where there were saas businesses that sold ddos powered by tw servers responding to conless packets from spoofed target ips xd
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> Okay, it seems a token is indeed inserted there for even connless packets, but what is the point? Not like the server can check it at all, is it supposed to prevent race attacks or something?
15:02 < bridge> <learath2> Oh it can, it does a full token exchange
15:02 < bridge> <learath2> So "connless" messages aren't "connless" anymore in 0.7?
15:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye they do a full exchange
15:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1726578220.png
15:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and the client has to send a bunch of nullbytes
15:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so its useless for reflection amplification attacks
15:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 have you ever tried fixing the ddos? The 0.7 people already did.
15:05 < bridge> <learath2> The trick is to have the game only played by 20 people, then no one ddoses
15:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rude
15:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lerato now the real question is does ddnet also do a token handshake?
15:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :lol:
15:06 < bridge> <learath2> ddnet doesn't need a token handshake, we have space age http serverinfo
15:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because libtw2 dissector shows a token field but if there is no handshake that would be useless
15:06 < bridge> <AssassinTee> how does this prevent ddos attacks
15:06 < bridge> <learath2> It doesn't, but the large token messages make teeworlds servers a bad candidate for reflection attacks as it makes the amplification ratio abysmal
15:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it prevents reflection amplification attacks caused by spoofing as i said @AssassinTee 
15:07 < bridge> <AssassinTee> ah, like DNS amplification, I see
15:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye
15:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> now the client has to send more bytes than the server info size to get one back
15:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does rule #7 apply on github?
15:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i wanna comment on https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8972 xd
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No, but now that you mentioned it, it does
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> because that is part of the public knowledge now
15:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so i can say wat i want in the issue?
15:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> free speech ddnet?
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You could, if you wouldn't have baited ppl here
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> into clicking the link
15:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omagawd
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah sry
15:10 < bridge> <AssassinTee> You could also discuss that removing a bot-prevention-feature is not encouring botting
15:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: just delete the link :santatrollet:
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
15:12 < bridge> <learath2> (iirc we don't have this in the ddnet servers, so we just use iptables to keep the ratio down by just hard throttling vanilla getinfo requests that no one really uses anymore anyway)
15:13 < bridge> <learath2> Actually not even iptables, iirc the ratelimit is inside our code
15:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @AssassinTee discussion of rules is against the rules in the non free speech CHINA network
15:13 < bridge> <AssassinTee> If I open a ddnet server today, should I be worried to get ddossed into oblivion?
15:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this is not a safe space
15:14 < bridge> <learath2> Not a part of this discussion really, but you might want to throttle vanilla getinfo requests if you don't want to be part of an amplification attack
15:14 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Then they should come and get me
15:14 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Then they should come and get me üî™
15:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8972 is this okay lawyer josspit?
15:15 < bridge> <AssassinTee> that's not what I mean, I am asking for the current state of teeworlds and if I should be worries about my homenetwork if I do so
15:15 < bridge> <AssassinTee> that's not what I mean, I am asking for the current state of ddnet and if I should be worries about my homenetwork if I do so
15:16 < bridge> <learath2> Well the ddosers don't care about small home servers
15:16 < bridge> <thedyingsun01> how to download map?
15:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> connect to the server @thedyingsun01 
15:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then you have it in your downloadedmaps folder
15:16 < bridge> <learath2> They ddos big networks to maximize annoyance, but it all depends on who you annoy. If you annoy the mentally challenged, they will ddos you too surely
15:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if there is no server get it from heinrich5991.de
15:17 < bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps we also host all our maps here
15:17 < bridge> <AssassinTee> So launching the Assa-Network has to wait for another day
15:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i got ddos with 0 users already @learath2 
15:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does that mean that ZillyHuhn Conglomerated is relevant?
15:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can i get my community badge then
15:18 < bridge> <learath2> Can ddnet connect to 0.6.5 servers I wonder
15:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it can
15:18 < bridge> <learath2> Cool cool cool
15:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 45.142.178.158:8304
15:18 < bridge> <thedyingsun01> where from i can download maps?
15:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @thedyingsun01 did you edit your message or resend?
15:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which map do you need @thedyingsun01

15:20 < bridge> <thedyingsun01> thanks
15:21 < bridge> <learath2> I wish heinrich would be back so he can finish up on QUIC so we can have one more protocol üòÑ
15:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/c56fa9e6a20cfc9d7d16502e18c7d7633acdf492/src/engine/client/serverbrowser.h#L104 can someone explain to such a neanderthal like me what does this comment mean
15:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i really hope quic never happens
15:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> I hope we get quic and another protocol
15:22 < bridge> <learath2> quic brings with it accounts
15:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im not sure about accounts either
15:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if pink rat is against it im against it
15:22 < bridge> <learath2> If you don't like it we probably are on the right track üôÉ
15:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> opt in
15:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> .-.
15:23 < bridge> <AssassinTee> and then enforce it as a server hoster "You need an account in order to play here"
15:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> KOG style
15:23 < bridge> <jxsl13> opt in can be interpreted differently
15:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not the irrelevant KoG king of gores
15:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean KOG level mod
15:24 < bridge> <jxsl13> I'd like an opt in on a server level, where people still can just join and play without any need for an account
15:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dude i had so much fun playing KOG
15:24 < bridge> <AssassinTee> when we have accounts, is then a steam integration coming? /s
15:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: stop using fun and kog in one sentence
15:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if propriatary software or privacy invading tracking is required to play ddnet i quit without hesitating
15:25 < bridge> <jxsl13> grpc protocol
15:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can't wait to open a ddnet cracked server xd
15:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> reminds me of minecraft
15:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> good old days
15:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
15:27 < bridge> <.puch> ddnet > minecraft
15:27 < bridge> <.puch> üòÑ
15:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> minetee > ddnet
15:27 < bridge> <jxsl13> ddnet will be the reason why chiller becomes a drug lord
15:27 < bridge> <.puch> what's minetee xd
15:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @.puch haters would say terraria
15:28 < bridge> <jxsl13> started cracking ddnet, ended with cracking denuvo
15:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but there is a teeworlds mod that implements minecraft gameplay with destroying blocks and pixel graphics
15:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I think about this a lot tbh, but should be easy with an automapper and a bit of network protokol
15:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bbbbut demos
15:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @AssassinTee https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7666
15:33 < bridge> <learath2> We'll add a client side antibot that requires you to have your webcam on 24/7
15:33 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I like how you are able to hook air xD
15:34  * bridge <AssassinTee> connects livestream from twitch
15:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> totally not a bug
15:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 so like valorant?
15:35 < bridge> <learath2> Actually 2 webcams, one needs to show your keyboard and mouse. If it doesn't match your input we will swat you
15:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you don't need webcams to detect me my clients openly broadcast them selfs
15:36 < bridge> <AssassinTee> @chillerdragon you can do a lot on this end, using quadtrees for chunks, send mapchunks, send updates in tiles and maybe even batches of tiles
15:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bbut demos
15:38 < bridge> <AssassinTee> if you build the quadtree from the ground up, you can also make an infinite map, if you allow for serialized chunks, you are only limited by disk space and did I just make minecraft infinite?
15:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but can you also do demos for me?
15:39 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yes, Install shadowplay and press Ctrl + Z üôÇ
15:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk much about quad trees. I really want the feature in the client but heinrich says it won't get in if i dont solve demos.
15:40 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Doesn't need to be a quadtree. Imagine a chunk just having a link to every neighbor so you can get rid of coordinates
15:41 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Doesn't need to be a quadtree. Imagine a chunk just having a link to every neighbor so you can get rid of coordinates. I just want you to understand the koncept
15:41 < bridge> <learath2> Could this be avoided in anyway?
15:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it still needs local coordinates then?
15:42 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yes, but local coordinates are only relative to the chunk you're in... hmm relativity theroy in an infinite universe?
15:42 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yes, but local coordinates are only relative to the chunk you're in... hmm relativity theory in an infinite universe?
15:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Biggest out of context ping ever :lol:
15:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> How do you want to avoid it?
15:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i totally got it jopsti
15:42 < bridge> <learath2> It suddenly annoyed me very much üòÑ
15:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @AssassinTee so their size is lower because the numbers are lower? but then the chunk also needs to know its coordinates
15:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont get the neighbor think
15:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thing
15:44 < bridge> <learath2> Technically the proof of ownership of the account is the private key that never leaves the client, right?
15:44 < bridge> <learath2> I have a feeling there should be a way to add some extra data into the certificate, data that the owner of the account server can't craft
15:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and how can you login from a different pc?
15:45 < bridge> <AssassinTee> it doesn't, you just need to know it's neighbors and when you are crossing into the next chunk
15:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for what?
15:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> physics?
15:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have no idea what you are talking about do you want to rewrite ddnet physics? im out 
15:46 < bridge> <AssassinTee> in order to avoid overflows for example and to have an infinite scalable world
15:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nono we are not doing infinite
15:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just edit maps with their existing size
15:47 < bridge> <AssassinTee> with an infinite scaling world you could also combine all maps in existance to one üôÇ I totally see no evil there
15:47 < bridge> <learath2> Mh, I guess the only way that's easily possible is creating a security hole :/
15:48 < bridge> <learath2> Idk I have this feeling that we aren't really using our private keys fully, we are using them more like credentials
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well if our account server is stolen, then we fucked.. like with all account stuff
15:49 < bridge> <learath2> It's only better than a password in that it's very long
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if google is hacked you are doomed too
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
15:50 < bridge> <learath2> Well it is possible to have this 0-trust, but then signing in on a different machine is indeed annoying
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We could also request the client do verify the session on multiple different account servers for the first time connect to any game server (with THAT session) if you think that is safer.
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then the game server can safe the public key info
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah, it also makes stuff super complicated
15:51 < bridge> <learath2> I'm starting to think maybe just a password and password policy would be better if we are going to be this centralized anyway?
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And how do you share this information with other game servers?
15:52 < bridge> <learath2> You log in onto the central account server with your password, the account server issues the certificate just like how you originally designed it
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> How is that better? xd
15:54 < bridge> <learath2> Less complicated, what is the point of the private key in our scheme? We are just using it as a password with which it's easy to do zero knowledge proofs.
15:54 < bridge> <learath2> We can just use a password and SRP e.g.
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @learath2 before we end up in useless discussion that is lost.
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Prepare your criticism and post it in the accounts issue. Heinrich probably wants to see it to. It was mostly him I talked about the whole account stuff anyway
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We need a private key anyway for the TLS handshake
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Except we don't want it to be part of the connecting process
15:56 < bridge> <learath2> Why?
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> ‚ùØ cargo clean
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki>      Removed 184389 files, 73.8GiB total
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
15:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> (its a mono repo tho)
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 1. We use the fingerprint of the public key of the client for users that don't have an account yet (so the ranks are saved for them, and if they create an account they can claim these ranks)
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 2. If the account server is down, then the public key can be used to still save the ranks assigned to some kind of session that is unique (can't be stolen except stealing private key)
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 3. Directly in the TLS handshake makes it available before any packets come in (so basically always)
15:59 < bridge> <learath2> I will but there is no point to it if I'm just speaking non-sense. It's much easier to figure that out here
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> pff
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my record is 200GB xd
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> cargo seems to like to keep some previous artifacts
16:00 < bridge> <learath2> I guess it's nice that it allows claiming of ranks done before creating an account
16:02 < bridge> <learath2> It's a bit annoying that we can just forge sessions, it creates a situation where you have to have complete trust that ddnet manages that server properly
16:02 < bridge> <learath2> It's a bit annoying that we can just forge sessions, it creates a situation where you have to have complete trust that ddnet manages the account server properly
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U can still use the sessions for your own account system
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's just that every new session has to be verified then
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with your system
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/342454474117218334/1281378468608610385
16:08 < bridge> <learath2> So I just discard the certificate you send me signed by the evil ddnet people and just use the public key you used to establish the TLS connection?
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The TLS connection is established with the client's private key anyway
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Someone with account server cannot fake your session
16:08 < bridge> <learath2> I guess that's enough support for people that don't trust us
16:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> _only_ your account_id
16:17 < bridge> <learath2> Well I'm convinced again, no need for me to say anything in the issue
16:22 < bridge> <learath2> When are we starting to sell hats?
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think the new meta is to sell cheats. We could get pay2win ehehhe

17:08 < bridge> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks I know a little bit of bash, what's up?
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we use printf to round a float number:
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```bash
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>

17:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
17:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we already added LC_NUMERIC=C LC_ALL=C bcs it broke in past if u had other locale than english.
17:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>

17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did they change behavior of printf lmao
17:11 < bridge> <learath2> Are you sure you are using bash?
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes i typed "bash"
17:11 < bridge> <learath2> It works fine for me on `GNU bash, version 5.2.26(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)`

17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what is your output with
17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `LC_NUMERIC=C LC_ALL=C printf "%.0f" "255.99"`
17:12 < bridge> <learath2> 256
17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for me it's nan
17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
17:14 < bridge> <learath2> Try `bash --posix -c 'printf "%.0f" 255.99'`
17:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> omg u such a pro
17:14 < bridge> <learath2> Did that actually work? I was just messing around üòÑ
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but how does it work if i execute a bash script
17:15 < bridge> <learath2> I mean you can just execute it in a subshell üòõ
17:15 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder what changed
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it doesnt work xD
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i did bash --posix
17:16 < bridge> <learath2> It works if you directly write it, but it doesn't if you execute it in a subshell?
17:16 < bridge> <learath2> Absurd
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it opened a new shell
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i rewrite this shit in rust
17:16 < bridge> <learath2> LOL
17:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> LOL
17:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> Rip
17:17 < bridge> <learath2> Try perl or pyson instead, much quicker
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> OMG XDDDDDDDD
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i changed the 
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> #!/bin/bash
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> to
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> #!/bin/bash --posix
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in the shell script
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and it works
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> funniest thing i've ever seen
17:22 < bridge> <learath2> `echo "$source_w_text" | perl -ne 'printf("%.0f", $_)'`
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dont understand perl
17:24 < bridge> <learath2> Careful with the posix shell btw, you won't be able to use bashisms
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno what that is
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the less bash, the better
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> now i have to fight against github actions
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i cant believe it
17:28 < bridge> <learath2> Actually apparently posix mode doesn't disable bashisms huh
17:29 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder if just creating a new shell is fixing it, have you tried in a fresh shell?
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a fresh shell for me means zsh
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont work in tty or smth xd
17:31 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, so all bashes are fresh for you
17:31 < bridge> <learath2> tbf, I use bash everywhere for everything so idk
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tbh, if it works it works
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my bash brain is small by design
17:55 < bridge> <learath2> Firefox still does not support slack huddles. Slack promised to fix it so webcompat team removed the user-agent override. Slack didn't fix it, webcompat team won't let people add the override back
17:56 < bridge> <learath2> I swear some of these people at Mozilla must be industry plants to make Firefox look bad
18:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
18:10 < bridge> <learath2> Actually they apparently fixed it for windows and macOS, so the important ones are covered, now they can toture the linux people forever because we don't represent a large enough market share
18:12 < bridge> <shibastik> What echo?
18:12 < bridge> <shibastik> Who know how to make fake player for your server
18:13 < bridge> <shibastik> Well, like a player who just stands there
18:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i accidentally reseted --hard my changes xddd
18:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> time to rewrite i guess
18:15 < bridge> <shibastik> For example, a player for aim training, that is, when you enter the server, it immediately stands, more precisely, I am talking about the server script
18:15 < bridge> <shibastik> Im can use dummy in know
18:15 < bridge> <shibastik> But I'm want create more dummy for my local server
18:17 < bridge> <furo> You can recover it with `git reflog`
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-string-switcher/
18:18 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, I have an override for slack.com pretending it's windows

18:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> :justatest:  my poor internet beeing abused
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If you want to test it out, report me back if it:
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - looked good
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - worked without lags on ur pc (say GPU name if laggy xdd)
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's funny that it only has a download button for sure
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> on chrome, firefox & vlc it works fine for me on PC (RX 6900 XT)
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But on my phone (poco f5) it sometimes laggs a bit
18:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Next goal add AV1.. 
18:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That should work better on high res shouldn't it üòÑ
18:45 < bridge> <learath2> Every google executive deserves permajail for how they are worsening the youtube experience on firefox

18:45 < bridge> <learath2> Every google executive deserves permajail for how they are worsening the youtube experience on firefox
18:46 < bridge> <learath2> Like never getting back out, no appeals. Just permajail in siberia
18:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> wat's wrong with youtube on firefox? 0_o
18:47 < bridge> <learath2> If I have useragent chrome it works perfectly fine, if I have firefox it randomly keeps freezing
18:47 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe fed directly to hungry hounds. They don't deserve to live anyway
18:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> works fine for me :p
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> They roll it out to random groups of people so it's not so obvious
18:49 < bridge> <learath2> If they get lucky and it's all normies they roll it out to, normies don't investigate at all and switch to the now artificially superior browser
18:51 < bridge> <learath2> I bet they also roll it out randomly per video, so it's a hard to diagnose issue just incase it gets rolled out to someone that can diagnose it
18:54 < bridge> <learath2> 33.6 seconds of perfectly fine buffer, but it just stops playing randomly
18:57 < bridge> <cellegenrih> how much virtual memory did it eat?
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 13GB RAM, 2.3GB VRAM
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1285646372447453235/image.png?ex=66eb06fd&is=66e9b57d&hm=85c2376bd0ba79bc558b73dd481ba31b1f871da50a6470e344278b4e3bc3eb68&
19:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> from a few 4k images? dang
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why 4k images?
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont use any 4k image
19:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> or was all truly 8k? xd
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you have to understand u dont need 8k textures, so the skins look good on 8k
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 8k textures = every pixel of that texture fills 1 pixel on your 8k monitor
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but your skin does never use ever pixel of your monitor
19:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> even if you have an 8k monitor, 1080p resolution with proper intiger scaling still would look good, so yes it doesn't need it
19:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway, the RAM usage is mostly by ffmpeg. VRAM is probably the high res textures + the 8k framebuffer
19:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I wondered why teeworlds won't convert the 4k image into a properly sized one, saving it as a cache and use it in memory, instead of the 4k one
19:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean 4k is not forbidden, it's just that you cannot utilize it before 32k monitors exist
19:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i don't like breaking forward compatiblity
19:03 < bridge> <cellegenrih> 32k monitors by apple, requries you to sell your house :kek:
19:04 < bridge> <cellegenrih> when generating textures by AI? :troll:
19:04 < bridge> <cellegenrih> or AI enhancing, that probably sound better
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> epyc idea
19:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> AI enshittification
19:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> oh yes

20:45 < bridge> <Ewan> Your video is very broken for me

20:45 < bridge> <Ewan> Currently playing at the 30 second mark of a 17 second video
20:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What player do you use?
20:46 < bridge> <learath2> By changing the game code. We have the message for redirects but we dont have a tile for them in the game yet

22:30 < bridge> <louis> i love windows
22:32 < bridge> <totar> it also does not play for me
22:32 < bridge> <totar> it just downloads the video
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah for me it also doesn't work inside discord üòÑ

22:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> If it can, it doesn't work for me, if it doesn't watafak is `SERVERINFO_VANILLA` type then
22:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> If it can, it doesn't work for me, if it can't watafak is `SERVERINFO_VANILLA` type then
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe bcs i use discord in web
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or bcs u some nitro first class person
22:53 < bridge> <Ewan> works in firefox
22:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i see what u mean now on desktop it takes u to download

22:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dont do floats in bash @Jupstar ‚ú™ 
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bro T_T
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why are there even floats in our SVGs
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
23:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @shibastik compile with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug then you can run ``DDNet-Server "dbg_dummies 1"`` and you have a tee. Or get DDNet++ and write **/dummy 1** in chat as admin https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/releases/tag/v0.0.7
23:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat SERVERINFO_VANILLA referrs to 0.6 in the ddnet codebase. Thats vanilla 0.6 without ddnet extensions. Which is not the same as vanilla 0.7
23:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> vanilla 0.7 for example added ``skill``
23:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Aaah
23:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ok
23:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/9bfd8a6a0d1d9665202c01868fe1974daaa99fcc/gamenet/generate/spec/ddnet-15.2.5.json#L1241-L1257

23:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> How can I check if it's 0.7 server info and not 0.6 :thonk:
23:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 2nd field is the version in both
23:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ok, thank you so much for answering the questions xd
23:19 < bridge> <Ewan> wat
23:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> c:
23:19 < bridge> <Ewan> because they are vector graphics sir
23:19 < bridge> <Ewan> oh chiller i replied to jopsti "why are there even floats in our SVGs"
23:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but they are just rounding errors
23:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the width should always be 256 and height 128
23:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but some svgs have 255.99999999999 for some reason xd
23:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i figured ewan im jedi when it comes to replies
23:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I am sith
23:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> imo we should fail the CI in that case and fix the svgs
23:21 < bridge> <Ewan> u should still never expect an SVG to only be comprised of integers xd
23:21 < bridge> <Ewan> just use jq
23:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea actually what ewan says. In bash you just dont do floats. If you need floats in bash dont use bash.
23:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``awk`` can do floats
23:22 < bridge> <Ewan> oh sweet
23:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> pro ping me properly üòÇ
23:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah we dont read all svg paths
23:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> only width & height
23:35 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
23:35 < bridge> <Ewan> (i dont remember if i pinged you in my reply)
23:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i turned that off by default
