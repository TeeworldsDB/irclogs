03:07 <+Learath2> Nothing needs to be changed, you just need to port the entire mod
03:09 <+Learath2> Protocol message extension, Snap object extension, 64p, mutes (not sure if they are in 0.7), tune zones, sound envelopes, datafile extensions, rcon auth system are a few things that'd need to be patched in to the source
03:12 <+Learath2> Then comes the hard part of porting all the client features. HUD extensions, gfx improvements, updater, http map downloader, editor improvements, serverbrowser things, scoreboards, demo recording, ghosts (I'm probably missing some here)
03:13 <+Learath2> And after all that you sitll haven't even started porting the ddrace core, freeze, deep freeze, stoppers, doors, plasma, bullets...
03:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon since the bridge is dead I'll put this here

03:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now if you'd rather merge it (which is smarter then re-doing it given we have about 0 full time devs)  there are 5560~ commits, merging that one by one is just not an option, letting a merge algorithm have a go at it wouldn't work too well in that case either, that leaves merging by hand. You'd need to get a list of changes in 0.7 (a comprehensive one at that) then one by one add <message clipped>
03:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One other option is a translating proxy to let 0.7 people play but that's not what you want anywyas
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also it's not laziness, it's that all of us have actual lives as well. Many have a job and the rest have university to attend.
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That said, I wouldn't mind migrating over to 0.7 If anyone dares take on the massive undertaking of properly porting ddnet over.

03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fyi we didn't get many if any new players from the steam release of teeworlds so it's pretty tough to believe that we'd get any new later
04:29 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Jupeyy opened pull request #1365: Border corner minimum fix (master...pr_bordercorner_fix) https://git.io/fxQzT
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Awesome thanks for the answer @Learath2 
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> What do you think about the idea of creating a cheap ddnet 0.7 First? That only holds the ddrace basics ( no plasma and crazy stuff). And the database stuff so we have the same points System. And then add only a few servers that hold some hand picked maps that dont Need all crazy features like tunes plasma jetpack, ...
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> And that thing could be released pretty fast and we have a bridge to 0.7 because players can collect points on the same network.
07:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> This bridge is a good advertisement for new Players. They can See that there is this big network in 0.6 and we show only a little bit of it in 0.7
07:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
07:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> And also old players can test 0.7 and collect actual ddnet points.
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> TW has a CVE: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-18541
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (just got the Debian Security update today)
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> rly a CVE xD
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4329
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ‘€
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ya saw that on tw github. Looked cool but i didnt get it. it was listed on various sites that looked important and way bigger than teeworlds.
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> What does it mean?
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> CVE are Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> a big db that lists so much "security breach" @ChillerDragon if that was your question

16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @DaRealFreak why u dont upload tw_serverinfo to pypi?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> was too lazy so far xD
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> gonna upload it when I added 0.5 and 0.7 master servers to it
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :(
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pypi makes it rly easy
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and uploading is super fast lol
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://pypi.org/project/twine/
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use this
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> already got some packages on pypi was just too lazy as I said before xD
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> And didn't expect for anyone to actually be interested in it tbh xD
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have a package too but it doesnt query masterservers and im lazy to do it
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so i wanted to use urs
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i see u are equally lazy as me
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> i started programming bcs i was too lazy xD
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> Hey, sometimes when i connect my dummy, i only get some hook sounds, i get the one when i hook a tee but don't get the sound when hooking a wall,  disconnecting/reconnecting the dummy fixes the issue. I didn't yet figure out how to reproduce that it seems to happen randomly.
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @ReiTW | Blizzard (about the CVE stuff) ye it was my question but i also expected that answer xd
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i mean is it hard to get something in there?
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> becuase it seems like an public important list and teeworlds seems a bit small compared to it for me
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @ChillerDragon well again an example of a recent cve, the webkit breach has its own cve
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> Also the bug with the viet' char to "crash" an iPhone
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye @ReiTW | Blizzard but these are big players and not a small game that no one knows

23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Can anybody tell me to what extent the token implementation in ddnet and 0.6.5 differs? Too lazy to look into the code...
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Does the 0.6.5 one have any advantages? Will ddnet migrate to it?
