00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soapy Sandwich> I would be ok with abrupt changes.  I mean I think it would be ideal to have a tile that restarted all animations when you touched it.  You could make visual timers for your switches then.  Although I imagine that might be a bit of work to pull off and might not get enough use to be worth.
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soapy Sandwich> 
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soapy Sandwich> I just had a few map ideas that would require animations restarting when touching the start line.
00:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> yes a tile that is linked to animations to reset them would  allow for amazing designs
07:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yes, now there is a tooltip component
07:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The element may be constructed even if there already is an element with the key in the container, in which case the newly constructed element will be destroyed immediately.
07:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm
07:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> :feelsamazingman:
07:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not yet super dope
07:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for now its just 1 line of text
08:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> oh
08:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i see
08:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so a skeleton instead of impl or just weird looking
08:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its like a default alt text in browsers
08:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ah ye
08:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> kinda like 1px border simple bg regular text
08:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> no border radius
10:25 <+ChillerDragon> Why is it called map in teeworlds and world in minecraft? Is this term dependend on the size?
10:25 <+ChillerDragon> or the amount?
10:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why does this matter
10:26 <+ChillerDragon> im just wondering
10:27 <+ChillerDragon> I like the term map better. And in my game i call it map. But that somewhat conflicts with the function named map from the standardlib
10:27 <+ChillerDragon> I feel like if i would refactor it to world it would be named wrong since its more a map :D
10:28 <+ChillerDragon> no idea how to call it otherwise
10:30 < irc_tester> test
10:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in teeworlds map would be the static tiles
10:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the world are the entities
10:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in fact gameworld manages the entities
10:44 <+ChillerDragon> ou so the term map vs world is about it being changeable?
10:44 <+ChillerDragon> i wonder if i should name it gamemap :D 
10:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Game**World** is handling all entities
10:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Game**Map** is just the static part. It contains walls, floors and so on
10:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Game**Entity** is dynamically spawned in the Game**World** and handled during runtime.
10:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Game**World** is handling all entities
10:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Game**Map** is just the static part. It contains walls, floors and so on
10:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Game**Entity** is dynamically spawned in the Game**World** and handled during runtime, it can interact with the Game**Map**, walking and running on it for example
10:47 <+ChillerDragon> yay edits
10:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Sorry, forgot about the bridge not handling edits well
10:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> big text edits
10:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hi avo
10:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> <a:yeee:631547536288514051>
10:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> ðŸ‘‹ bridge can translate emojis?
10:48 <+ChillerDragon> yea but the static part is interesting
10:48 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1651049325.png
10:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> chillerdragon: u think toooo much
10:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> ah nice
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> I like the name map :c but its conflicting syntax
10:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why?
10:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Why? In terms of what
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> map is also a function 
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> to map over an array
10:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> call it CMap?
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Context is different lol
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> depending on what you tryna name
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u name ur classes lowercase?
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> not the class name
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> more like the instances
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c++ right
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use namespaces
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> ruby :troll:
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Call it GameMap not just Map
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk about ruby
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> yea im about to call it game_map :D 
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> call it m
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> m -.-
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> noby style
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> xd
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> buse
10:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> chiller when come over to discord again
10:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its a nice time here
10:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> <a:whooo:631548554267328514>
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> ._.
10:59 <+irc_tester> will you ever go back chillerdragon?
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> not planned right now but who knows
10:59 <+irc_tester> I see
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> i think i would first get whatsapp back before i get discord
10:59 <+irc_tester> lmao
10:59 <+irc_tester> Did you leave for privacy reasons?
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> something like that
11:00 <+irc_tester> wish I could just leave
11:00 <+ChillerDragon> why cant you
11:00 <+irc_tester> The friends that I met there, the people and servers that are in Discord
11:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The dreaded network effect
11:01 <+ChillerDragon> ah so discord? I thought you talk about whatsapp
11:01 <+ChillerDragon> i feel pretty much connected. I spam this #developer channel all day so i dont miss discord
11:01 <+irc_tester> Will get rid of whatsapp once I finish high school
11:01 <+irc_tester> I see xd
11:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't we all want to drop these proprietary NSA spyware communication products? Alas I couldn't communicate with any of my family or friends without whatsapp
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> but yea deleting whatsapp had an impact on my social life for sure. But also there is covid.. so who cares :D
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 forcing family was ez for me
11:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And dropping discord would mean I don't get to play games with friends
11:02 <+irc_tester> Learath2: Some don't care really
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> eww friends
11:02 <+irc_tester> I thought you had a friend/enemy list
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> fair
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> but only 1 friend
11:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Family have their own friends they talk to on whatsapp. I guess I could get them to use sth like telegram for within family stuff
11:03 <+irc_tester> Who is it
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> some 14yo egirl
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> i simp
11:03 <+irc_tester> sus
11:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ILLEGAL
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> yikes
11:03 <+irc_tester> what if it's a 50 year old man in disguise
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> im 90% sure its a 50yo man
11:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I already called the cops chiller, you have no way out
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> but idc he cute
11:03 <+irc_tester> Lmao
11:04 <+irc_tester> fair
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> but after school comes work
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> for me it would have been easier to ditch whatsapp in school than to not use zoom/slack/teams at work
11:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> irc_tester: By don't we all, I mean people that are tech concious, like people that might hang out in a dev channel such as this one :D
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> we all what?
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> ah dont care
11:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chiller
11:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why r u using ruby
11:06 <+ChillerDragon> ro
11:06 <+irc_tester> Yes, but for example why you're here talking through Discord with us?
11:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for ur game
11:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use rust
11:06 <+ChillerDragon> but rust is so hard
11:06 <+ChillerDragon> ruby is literally Game.new and u done
11:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/968800430551343125/unknown.png
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> but im actually thinking about rewriting the client in rust so i can ship it :D
11:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust is orders of magnitude faster
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> its hard to distribute a ruby desktop application since it can not be compiled
11:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also look at memory usage
11:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> of ruby
11:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> irc_tester: I explained my reasons. Can't afford to become a social outcast
11:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ruby bad
11:07 <+irc_tester> Learath2: Same
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> i dont run into performance issues rn just in distribution/release issues
11:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> write the server in rust too
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> hm
11:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> making state machines isnt that hard too in rust
11:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since sum types and enums are awesome
11:08 <+irc_tester> You guys are rewritinf DDNet in Rust?
11:08 <+irc_tester> rewriting*
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> man my rust game is rly frustrating me tho tbh
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> and its without gui :D 
11:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what engine are u using
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> for rust?
11:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it may be confused to use a ECS design when ur not used to it
11:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
11:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> confusing*
11:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ddnet server in rust might be pretty cute, heinrich has one almost working and it works pretty nicely
11:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye rust is cuter than c
11:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we have a mascot
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> i use crossterm :D
11:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> No C is the cutest
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/chidraqul/chidraqul5/blob/master/Cargo.toml#L17-L21
11:09 <+irc_tester> What are the advantages in wrting DDNet server in Rust?
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> multi threading everything
11:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> memory safety
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> so we can scale
11:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fearless concurrency
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> to 1k slots
11:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
11:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur writing a terminal game
11:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bruh
11:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ruby is fine then
11:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The main advantage would be getting to cleanly rewrite the ddnet server imo. Doesn't even matter what language we do it in
11:10 <+ChillerDragon> nah the ruby one is gui
11:10 <+ChillerDragon> but my rust attempt is terminal
11:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
11:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Drop vanilla compat while at it
11:10 <+ChillerDragon> but the terminal one in rust i already rq so not sure if i want to rewrite my gui game in rust
11:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wgpu is awesome, if we used it as our graphics backend we would have support
11:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for
11:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> opengl gles directx vulkan and metal
11:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 udc wat lang? would u also use posix SHELL !?
11:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I doubt we could do a posix shell ddnet server implementation :D
11:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Too hard
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> there are even mc servers in bash
11:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe rewriting the client is too much, but the server could be rewritten in rust
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> ur just too closed minded
11:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that bash server has minimal features
11:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not complete
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> and 1 connection at a time max :D 
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> not that the rust mc servers are any better :p
11:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u try any
11:13 <+ChillerDragon> all the rust mc projects are so early in development none of them is useful
11:13 <+ChillerDragon> i tried them all
11:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah probs
11:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mc is gigantic after all
11:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but u can do cool stuff
11:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://veloren.net/ is proof
11:18 <+ChillerDragon> VALORENT
11:18 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:18 <+irc_tester> Never heard of it
11:18 <+irc_tester> Let me try it out
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> I really dislike when clean voxel art mixed with some wannabe realism https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/634860358623821835/962236741522173982/screenshot_1649484859373.png
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> and omg they use discord as a cdn on their website ahhahahahah
11:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now that is smart thinking
11:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Free cdn
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> pf
11:22 <+irc_tester> Jeez the performance sucks
11:22 <+irc_tester> It lags badly
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> if its free YOU are the product @Learath2
11:23 <+irc_tester> > GPU with either Vulkan, Metal, or DirectX 11.2+ support
11:23 <+irc_tester> Doesn't even support OpenGL?
11:23 <+ChillerDragon> but Metal thats apple pog
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> when does ddnet get metal
11:24 <+irc_tester> I thought you use Linux
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> i do :D
11:24 <+irc_tester> then why do you care about Metal?
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> I grew up as apple fanboi tho. That will always stay.
11:25 <+irc_tester> Ah I see
11:25 <+irc_tester> I grew up with Windows
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> i just realized 3 virtual fake dollars shorting dodge coin. Road to daytrader!
11:25 <+irc_tester> It's rare to find Mac PCs in my country
11:26 <+ChillerDragon> Im surrounded by mac ppl 
11:26 <+irc_tester> xd
11:26 <+irc_tester> your family uses apple products?
11:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I am indeed the product chiller. Very hard to avoid in 2022
11:26 <+ChillerDragon> yes
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> but not only my family
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> also work friends and strangers. Apple is all over the place.
11:27 <+irc_tester> Rip
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> so if i want to sell them some ddnet clients it better runs well on their fruitbook
11:28 <+irc_tester> "Sell"?
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1651051737.png
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> thats me
11:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "if its free you are the product"
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> irl
11:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats untrue for stallman approved softwarew
11:29 <+irc_tester> Sus
11:29 <+irc_tester> Let me view it in Tor
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> ah rip irc has no image preview 
11:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://twitter.com/spectatorindex/status/1519100757215412224
11:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
11:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> new covid incoming
11:30 <+irc_tester> ChillerDragon Lmao
11:30 <+irc_tester> You convert people to the DDNet cult?
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> yes
11:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who r u
11:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> irc_tester
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> irc_tester is my dummy
11:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> konsti?
11:30 <+irc_tester> Were you successful so far?
11:30 <+irc_tester> Ryozuki: Lol
11:31 <+irc_tester> You don't know me
11:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> i recruited like 3 somewhat active players like years ago. One occasionally plays still today
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> the two others rq
11:31 <+irc_tester> Yes I meant, no we haven't met before
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> im honestly rocking ddnet merch 
11:32 <+irc_tester> "recruited" do you bribe them into using DDNet? xd
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> i got the green, white and purple ddnet shirt :D 
11:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have the ddnet magnet
11:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on fridge
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> not green omg
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> yellow*
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki do you pitch it to visitors?
11:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u think someone visits me
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :fuckyousnail:
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> even i get visitors occasionally
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> i am certian you do
11:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes i get ur mom
11:33 <+irc_tester> Who knows maybe ChillerDragon is planning to visit u
11:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sry it was too easy joke
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> lol
11:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> yes please pitch ddnet to me
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> idk it
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> im more the teeworlds vanilla dude
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> wat is this ddnet thingy
11:33 <+irc_tester> I can teach you
11:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur the annoying teeworlds vanilla guy
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> i also still use MultiMC bcs forks sok
11:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol

11:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur pepega
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> xaaxaxax
11:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> multimc is antifreedom
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> u know stevernerlla?
11:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use polymc
11:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont want to talk to you anymore
11:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> visit https://stallman.org/ and repent
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:34 <+irc_tester> xd
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> it was trol
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> i actually switched to PolyMC and yt-dlp
11:35 <+irc_tester> oh
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> i am even leafish maximalist
11:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/968807560582930452/unknown.png
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> and heck i spam the ddnet#developer not teeworlds#developer right?
11:36 <+irc_tester> Maybe cause it's more populated?
11:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> teeworlds is dead
11:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> long live ddnet
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> i think contribution forks with new shiny features are nice. But i like to also honor the origin that made all possible
11:38 <+irc_tester> How long do you guys know each other?
11:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm
11:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe 2015
11:44 <+irc_tester> 7 years
11:44 <+irc_tester> I see
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> feelsoldman
11:44 <+irc_tester> xd
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Teeworlds not ded, it only has covid or cancer since Oy
12:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsin> Oy is a great guy he just have tooo much faith in rule KISS. Somtimes this rule is good for projects and sometimes it can cause more damage than it should.
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh ye
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> KISS all the time
12:49 <+ChillerDragon> KISS my ***
12:49 <+ChillerDragon> axaxaxax
12:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> @deen what are the map changes that happened the start of this year? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps/commit/d709977bcdc952a3773000f599768bbad88afc63 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps/commit/1ebf87916dbed8024d5041136f4a9c7ae0b55fa2
12:49 <+ChillerDragon> i didnt notice Oy doing that tbh do you have some examples?
12:49 <+ChillerDragon> its cosmic rays corrupting the map files hehe
12:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> Deadcore and Koule 3 both have a weird bug on them now that I want to fix, so I'm wondering how they were produced
12:50 <+ChillerDragon> @Patiga there is an awesome rust project that lets you convert maps into json. So you can have a look at the map diffs :p
12:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> well the map doesn't parse any longer ^^
12:50 <+ChillerDragon> oh yikers
12:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> KISS applied to programming is nice, to entire projects not always
13:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> the map settings are apparently just zlib-compressed nothingness. in `game/editor/io.cpp`, line 264 (https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/e3eeec762d0634d93aef6d076e6c414e013ff9d2/src/game/editor/io.cpp#L264) it clearly shouldn't add any data if there are no map settings, except maybe if there was a zero length map setting which shouldn't make sense coz they are at the very least zero-terminated
13:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> @deen simply resaving the maps in the editor worked, could you please replace the maps? sry for the many pings ^^

14:04 <+ChillerDragon> There should really be a CI for the maps repo using twmap
14:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Restarted my phone with a new sim. Spotify deleted all my downloaded songs. Thanks spotify
14:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is another one of those companies that I'd genuinely work free for just to fix some bugs
14:47 <+irc_tester> Learath2: *Keeps using Spotify anyways*
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Spotify is way too convenient to drop, I'd have to pirate and spend time trying to discover new music
14:57 <+irc_tester> fair
14:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I could look into competitors though, maybe apple or yt music works well now
15:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> sv_min_team_size was added to those maps I think
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm the map settings seem empty in the editor, but yeah, the map settings are the broken thing about the maps
15:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I didn't use editor but command line tools to edit them
15:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> config_retrieve and config_store
15:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> alright, will have a look at them later
15:51 <+ChillerDragon> there is a linux desktop spotify client written in rust :D 
15:51 <+ChillerDragon> omg im becoimg ryo
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Avolicious> i am using ncspot ðŸ™‚
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u could add support for it if u want
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> niveau of the opengl 3 renderer is pretty ez to implement
17:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> how can i read a .map file?
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Where? In tw source? In C++? In Rust? In Python?
17:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> I don't know, I would like to understand how it works to be able to convert the map of that file (the entities for example hookable blocks, non-hookable blocks, freeze, ...) to convert it into another type a 3d map or a txt sheet with # instead of blocks hookables and * instead of unhook blocks for example
17:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> in python it would be handy
17:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> use patigas map to blender tool
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> ?
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> I don't know, I would like to understand how it works to be able to convert the .map of that file (the entities for example hookable blocks, non-hookable blocks, freeze, ...) to convert it into another type a 3d map or a txt sheet with # instead of blocks hookables and * instead of unhook blocks for example
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> patigas?
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <everestkio> blender tool?
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://pypi.org/project/twmap/
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> he wrote tools to convert teeworlds maps in different vormapts
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> he wrote tools to convert teeworlds maps in different formats
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Patiga's twmap library has python bindings you can use
18:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the past it looked bad when mappers used these envelopes that sync with race time because the background changed abruptly. I can see your use case. what would it show before starting? as if it was 0:00?
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soapy Sandwich> I think it would have to have a checkbox so you could make certain animations reset only.  If it changes abruptly then mappers should be aware and map accordingly (No resetting animation around the startline).
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soapy Sandwich> 
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soapy Sandwich> But yeah wouldn't work without a checkbox to turn it on and off atleast XD.
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> depends on the jurisdiction and on chillerdragon's age
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Chiller has to be old enough to not be covered by being underage himself. He is a wagie afterall
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And I don't know many places on earth that has a 14yo age of consent without asterisks. Better call the cops just to be safe :P
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think most of europe has something between 14 and 16
18:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (with star)
18:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (with asterisk)
18:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> japan
18:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in japan its only legal to like 12 years old anime girls
18:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
18:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rest is illegal
18:47 <+ChillerDragon> i am 12
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> im just gonna say the age of consent anywhere is 18 because anything below is just gonna have people crying about it anyways
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd think that people below the age of 18 should have the right to experiment sexually with others in the same age range
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> this developer discussion is amazing
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> this developer related subject is amazing
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its about developing ppl
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so its fine
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> aah I see
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Not Keks btw is it still worth learning opengl nowadays or directly vulkan, heard that vulkan is way harder
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> (and also in "early stage")
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes its harder, i'd say depends on what u want to archive
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> apparently drivers for vulkan are better, even though it's newer?!
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> a tripple A title that already runs on like 60fps only should probs use vulkan
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> idk, want to practice and tw is boring, I'm following that guy who worked at EA (TheCherno)
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> and I found that quite interesting
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u could probs argue its easier to develop a vulkan driver, since its more low level
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> opengl has a lot of garantuees
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> by that Imean you can have still some issues since it's "recent"
19:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> by that Imean you can have still some issues since it's "recent" compared to opengl
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the problem is, if u want todo a 3d game, u probs have more from intensivly training geometric algebra
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so quaternions matrices etc and try to visualize what you are doing, bcs that will help you more than just being able to put together some buffers
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i guess you could say
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> learning vulkan makes you a better opengl developer xd
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> even tho you also think that opengl is kinda annoying sometimes bcs it leaves certain stuff to the OS rather than having it in spec
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just yesterday a good example
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> changing FSAA in vulkan is a vulkan problem
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> changing FSAA in opengl would require you to change the pixelbuffer over some system dependent calls, or write a custom MSAA shader maybe(cant speak of opengl 4.5, which added a lot of new stuff, but never really used it)
19:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yeah have to dive into all of that, just for fun tho, that's still not my job, but just a hobby
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah just do it xd
19:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> tryin' to find different pages, docs.gl is good, thecherno's videos are amazing as he knows very well what he does and has some experiences working with directx, opengl, and vulkan etc.. and there was learnopengl.com I think
19:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah learnopengl covers most important stuff
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think when i started learning opengl the first days i used opengl 1.x without shaders (didnt even know about shaders back then)
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but the performance sucked hard (did some terrain tool)
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and then i found out about opengl 3.3:
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> over this website https://www.mbsoftworks.sk/tutorials/opengl3/
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> first i found shaders annoying
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but once u notice how much more flexible you are with it, you start to like it ðŸ˜„
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> But i also was like 17+ back then and just realized java sucks xddd
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ig I'll try to cover multiple documentations
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also nvidia drivers allow anything xDD
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think i did so much stuff wrong (by spec) but it still worked
19:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> the only hard part for me will be maths
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i give you one advice, accept that you have to learn quaternions XD
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gimbal lock will haunt you sooner or later
19:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Well ig I can find some good docs from my university or ask one of my teacher from my master to help
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but learn it, its worth it
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe some terrain, some animations of objects (rotations, translations, scaling)
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and some basic shading, maybe with a global light point(the sun e.g.)
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u'll understand limitations of computers, e.g. floating points, texture sizes are huge limitation factors which require approximentions/offsets etc. to fix them
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Worth it xd
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> texture sizes because of memory limits?
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah and creating big textures every frame is expensive
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> e.g. shadow maps
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> basically viewing the world from the eyes of the sun
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> at least if you dont want to start with raytracing directly xD
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Afterall good old ways:
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Piece of paper, a pencil, and u write
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> btw we have to skip SDL2 2.0.22 for linux @deen in case you thought about updating soon
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also tried to convince them to not use patch versions all the time, bcs i swear we can barely ever update, something is always broken xD
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/5572#issuecomment-1110525521
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> our windows SDL2 is still on 2.0.16 xD
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they improved turning off relative mouse mode on windows lately as far as i read, should maybe test if the desktop fullscreen bug is finally gone ðŸ˜„
20:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks i have this saved
20:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://thebookofshaders.com/
20:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to learn shaders
20:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XsXXDn
20:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah cool they have nice math visualizations
20:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
20:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #define t iTime
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #define r iResolution.xy
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord ){
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     vec3 c;
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     float l,z=t;
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     for(int i=0;i<3;i++) {
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         vec2 uv,p=fragCoord.xy/r;
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         uv=p;
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         p-=.5;
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         p.x*=r.x/r.y;
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         z+=.07;
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         l=length(p);
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         uv+=p/l*(sin(z)+1.)*abs(sin(l*9.-z-z));
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         c[i]=.01/length(mod(uv,1.)-.5);
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     }
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     fragColor=vec4(c/l,t);
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> }
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so simple
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yet so complex i guess
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to come upon ur own xd
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wow nice loading screen xD
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/968943328240476210/unknown.png
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye they have cool math visuals
20:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is like
20:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the foundation
20:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> of shaders
20:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4s2SRt
20:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> another stupidly crazy shader
20:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this site is really cool ðŸ˜„
20:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so few lines of code for such cool effects
20:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> I spend too much time on that site xD https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Tater
20:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ty
20:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lol nice one
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Ns3XWf
20:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> wtf
20:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we have a pro among us
20:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's the difference between `std::lock_guard` and `std::unique_lock`?
20:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> I'm not actually that good at computer graphics I just know a lot about raymarching which is like 70% of shadertoy
20:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Tater lmao I've enabled AA on that link i've sent above, it crashed webgl
20:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/968949092199841822/unknown.png
20:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> xd
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> there's a lot of random driver specific crashes that exist which are hard to fix
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> might also just be because it took too long to compile
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> doubt, it froze and yeah
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The difference is that you can lock and unlock a std::unique_lock. std::lock_guard will be locked only once on construction and unlocked on destruction.
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20516773/stdunique-lockstdmutex-or-stdlock-guardstdmutex
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, so I want a `std::lock_guard` because it can do less, by default?
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess?
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, apparently `std::scoped_lock` is a better version of `std::lock_guard`
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> someone says > Use lock_guard unless you need to be able to manually unlock the mutex in between without destroying the lock.
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, but C++17
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so `std::lock_guard` it is
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > In particular, condition_variable unlocks its mutex when going to sleep upon calls to wait. That is why a lock_guard is not sufficient here.
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > std::unique_lock can be moved but std::lock_guard can't be moved.
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we use c++17
21:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not rly
21:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i couldnt use std::optional
21:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz some stupid compiler didnt implement it yet smh
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (i could in my pc not on some ddnet server)
22:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://publiccode.eu/
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just found this site out on hn
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i agree
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> that's a good point I've never thought about that before
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://marian42.de/article/wfc/ Such an ingenious idea, do you think we could maybe generate teeworlds maps like this? I've seen people using this for 2d games
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> nuclear missile plans should be public as well
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> :troll:
23:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> open source all the NSA 0-days
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so many exploits could be patched
23:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> could definitely make a decorative world
23:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> maybe it would feel blocky tho
23:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> I just got recommended a bunch of youtube videos about wave function collapse
23:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> never heard of it before but it looks really cool
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD  since it is "teeWORLDS" they are more like worlds xD than maps xD
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol nice
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Me too, algorithm picked them up somewhy
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here i am waiting for a new  3Blue1Brown  video
