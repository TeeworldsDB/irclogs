06:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> lol, is vpn protection on DDNet servers?
06:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> cuz i can join with a vpn
06:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and i mostly got my lags gone
06:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> mh i don't think you understand how vpns work, yeah a vpn can in certain case get you a better ping but there is no such thing as "vpn protection" on servers i mean you can use a vpn on  a server but it'll be totally unrelated to your own vpn
06:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> not meant for saying that vpn made my internet better, that was not the case, but its good to see that ddnet supports selfprotection, otherwise KoG is doubt
06:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> ddnet doesn't "support" vpn that's what i mean
06:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> there is no such thing as supporting vpns or not
06:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> it's like a proxy
06:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> with support, i mean actually not taking care of that
06:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> yeah it doesn't
06:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> should ddnet servers do the same tho?
06:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> a vpn is just a bridge for your internet connection
06:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like if in any case ddnet database will be hacked
06:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> from ddnet's point of view the fact that you use a vpn or not doesn't change anything
06:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> first safety
06:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> anything could happen
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> leaks
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> anything
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> that's usually a bad idea for the servers themself to use a vpn, just because it adds a hop
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> also it would not work that way
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> a vpn isn't really "safer" from that point of vue
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but better than nothing
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> duh
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> i mean the traffic is encrypted from your computer to your vpn provider, but from your vpn provider to ddnet's server it's all not encrypted
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> which means, that with the fact, that i cant be harmed, but the connection could?
06:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> it just means that the nodes between your computer and your vpn provider can't see what data is being transmitted
06:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> your computer can, any node between your vpn provider and ddnet's server can too
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so literally there is no case for doing a vpn bridge with ddnet servers
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> while there is no way for leaks?
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> no, that would requires a vpn server on ddnet's servers
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> im just worried and thinking to the worst
06:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> most people use vpns to evade bans, that’s what he means
06:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> i mean sniffing traffic on huge network nodes is quite tricky, and for something like a game there's no valuable data you can get
06:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @jao but it wont change real ip adress isnt it
06:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> it does
06:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> what would be more abusive
06:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it connects you with a different ip
06:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> then how is come to the fact, that vpn can be detected?
06:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and not make it like, when you are changing ip with vpn, it actually detects it?
06:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ._.
06:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I guess they are collected somewhere
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like, okay looking up for every vpn thats possible and gain their ips to actually detect smth
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but that would be ultra gay
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> vpns can be detected because usually the vpn servers ( the end of the bridge ) are known everyone can get there IPs
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and not counts for custom services?
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like an ai that can remember
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> nah bullshit
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> kek
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> that's huge effort for something that could be tricked
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why you need an ai for comparing ips on a list lol
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> idk
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> xd
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but weird that how KoG come to VPN blocking
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> for whatever reason
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what’s weird about it
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> the reason
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> why
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> they can just ban every IP known to be a vpn server
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> at the OS level not in game
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> they have an account system on kog
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> to there should be no ip changer either to detect the ip change?
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> disallowing vpns helps them enforce it
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> wait bullshit eng
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> what are u talking about xd
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> vpn ure welcome
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> who
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> u
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> so they have their own client, i mean if it's closed source there are plenty of way to detect who is who, but with an opensource application it's difficult 'cause anyone can read how you do it
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> vpns dont change ur ip they just route ur traffic through proxy servers
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> the proxy servers address ranges can be looked up online or with an api
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> they don’t have their own client
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but the clients arent connected into some sort of application?
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like ip changer in the client
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> yeah i don't know i've never looked into kog
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> 2 different thing combined
06:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> didn’t you say you use vpn yourself
06:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> we should do the same account system as KoG has, so we wont get fake ranks, be ourselfs and have responsibility for our races
06:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> idk it was just an idea, but for real, how many times we just brought up this topic
06:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and KoG made it but were not?
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why don’t you make it
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> teach me programming that fucking teeworlds shit
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ty
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> im giving speech, not programming
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> WhY
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> stop troll pls
06:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you don’t know what you’re talking about
06:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why giving speeches
06:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> to be honest, i should've started programming long ago, but i found it too hard
06:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and im still onto making some game development
06:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> wtf
06:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> i don't think programming it is the issue, in itself it's pretty simple but there are a ton of problems like "how you transfer everything correctly" and ideological things like is that the right way to do it, and so on
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no that’s easy
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> there are many ways that could go wrong
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you don’t transfer at all
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> losing all of our ranks and points
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it only works with a clean cut
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> delete everything and start from 0
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> making security for even get assec to our profile
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> yeah i'm pretty sure most people would love to keep their rank
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> do people even want accounts to be mandatory
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i would guess no
06:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> i don't feel they're necessary
06:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> dont speak as the whole tw community
06:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> its all about the reason for racing actually
06:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> accounts have a lot advantages but it means loosing all points
06:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> people will lose their fate of racing, cuz they will know, that there will be no rewards or even purpose for that
06:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> now "racing for fun" became "racing for points"
06:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> literally
06:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so why were you asking why there is no account system on ddnet
06:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> im just curious that why it wouldnt come in the first place.
06:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well you seem to know the answer
06:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> if this is a race system with prize in the end
06:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> what is the purpose of getting it
06:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> for flexing?
06:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> cmon there must be a better idea for showing up why you have collected all of your points during the years
06:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :ww:
06:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @onby why you are questioning it
06:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> im listening to you if you have better ideas
06:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> better than what
06:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> this topic
06:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> how to improve the meaning of racing
06:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ban bots
06:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> as we already do
06:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> kindof
06:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like detecting it too
06:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> again, kindof
06:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> thats gonna be a long day to find out what exactly needs for a better experience
06:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 1. no lag/ddos
06:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 2. no bots/cheaters
06:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 3. no blockers
06:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> isnt that about it
06:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> okay, the ddos issue can be just blocked by getting good servers
06:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it cant
06:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> then decrypting the ips of the servers so nobody would even find the way of ddosing it?
06:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it doesnt matter how good the server is if the firewall and the application arent good too
06:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> idk if thats posible
06:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> idk either
06:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> or even the debuging itself should be encrypted with different code
06:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so if somebody wants to look up for ip, that wouldnt be the right one, but connects into the real one
06:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> you can't 'encrypt' ips like that, your computer needs to know them to connect so there's always a way to sniff connecting, i mean you can't send a packet to an encrypted ip because your computer and the network needs to see that ip to actually transmit the data
06:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> or just even hide it,
07:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> with not vpn, but a better server
07:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> how does that fix the problem
07:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> idk
07:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> xd
07:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> you can't, you can hide the "real" ip by using some sort of proxy or vpn, but nothing is blocking anyone from ddossing the vpn/proxy itself thus ddosing the servers
07:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> then what onby said about the firewall and application performances, that ...should be improved?
07:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> again i dont know?
07:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yes but dealing with ddos is probably the hardest of those three things
07:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> better server just means ddoser needs to ddos more
07:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> which is probably not hard for them
07:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> then we should get a backup server or somewhat
07:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> right
07:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> good solutions exists for that but it cost so much it's unrealistic
07:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> well they have a backup server ger2
07:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like thousands of euros
07:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ye probably
07:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> yeah, per month
07:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ...
07:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> better wait for a chance for even somebody sponsoring it
07:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> okay, lets just say, that most of the ddos attacks could have been solved by that way,
07:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> whats next
07:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 🤖
07:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> no
07:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> u
07:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u
07:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> probably the next step would be getting more developers to even help with bug fixing and design / code changing
07:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> how hard would be make the teeworlds company working with us
07:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like for real
07:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> wdym
07:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> getting all developers we all know and only caring about ddnet?
07:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> since its the closest thing for teeworlds?
07:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ye how hard can it be 😄
07:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> HMMM oy
07:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> him first
07:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> is actually the hardest
07:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> lets aim for magnus first
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> cellegen pls
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> what
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> stop the cringe
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> im speaking
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> you cant stop me
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yes he can
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> xd
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I can ban you
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ._.
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> for what reason?
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> cringefest
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> non dev related spam in the dev channel
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ^
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> exuse me
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yeah, that
07:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :monkaS:
07:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but what i said first was about vpn which is definitely dev
07:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and now im talking about more other dev things
07:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> is that so bad?
07:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you should try to google stuff first before holding lectures about it
07:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
07:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> im just try to help with something that is in my mind okay?
07:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then take a minute to think about whether it’s actually helpful
07:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and believe it or not people are listening to it which is nice either way
07:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> xdd
07:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> everyone laughs at you
07:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @jao well for making it helpful, i need to start it somewhere
07:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you should start by taking a step back
07:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like how far is that step
07:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> :lol:
07:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and actually acquire some knowledge about what you say
07:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> idk, not far
07:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> okay, then ***protend that i didnt say anything***
07:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> cuz i cant say anything for now on because of you, cuz you have that idea that what am i saying, isnt close enough for even mentioning some topics
07:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> that worth speaking about
07:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> english please
07:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> just gtfo of my life for real
07:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and you are saying to me to stop trolling
07:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> bravo
07:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> chill
07:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it’s just kinda hard to communicate with you
07:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> its just kinda hard to understand you brutally handed answers that make people trigger like me
07:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> stop saying all the time english please
07:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> you know that what i meant to write
07:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> dont make me trigger man,
07:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i had enough already from you
07:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> thats not normal what you are actually doing with me man.
07:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and the other just keep saying me that because of you continuesly doing it
07:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> you will get to a point where i'll trigger so much that i'll leave to the discord server
07:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> rq
07:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> you will get to a point where i'll trigger so much that i'll leave on the discord server
07:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> exactly
07:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but never coming back
07:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no I don’t know what you wanted to say
07:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that’s why I said it
07:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/homedepotcanada/p_1000108114.jpg?$plpProduct$
07:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> there is the door cellegen
07:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> then why didnt you said it like a normal person for the first time????
07:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @Im 'corneum fck u
07:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> do you wanna say you say anything like a normal person? lol
07:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and that means that you do the same?
07:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> im not even trolling with you
07:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then what’s your point
07:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> I mean he is right it's actually difficult to understand what you really mean sometimes.
07:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> What jao means is that it's great that you're interested in this game and that you're thinking about possible solutions to the issues players encounter, but when for example you're talking about "the debuging itself should be encrypted with different code" that just makes no sense whatsoever ^^
07:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> First things first try to understand how programming works, what debugging is, and then you can figure out a sentense that makes sense.
07:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> Getting better in english will come with time and effort, if you read a lot of english and such that'll come quicker than you think
07:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> listen to me without making it worse
07:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> thanks for the positives man, can be understandable in that case... if jao actually means it
07:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like how the hell could be much rude than "just google it"
07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like i havent tried before
07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i did.
07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> It's really not that hard to understand those concepts, you can get a hand of it in a few hours just by reading and experimenting
07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> that was more painful.
07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> did you really?
07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but there is nobody who could give me a hand into how he does that
07:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> you know how much i wanted to involve myself into projects jao?
07:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> you don't need anyone to help you with that, to get started you only need a computer and internet
07:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well most of what you say sounds like throwing smart coding related words together
07:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but doesn’t make much sense in the end
07:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> learning from an 8 hours video, while there are 5 more ones with more different stuff on it which isnt count the programming what tw have,
07:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> just painful
07:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> im not gonna make it alone man
07:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i did look up for c++ and phytron
07:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> phytron
07:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if you really want to involve yourself, you should be able to learn the basics on your own
07:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and how tw includes the basics
07:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> basics of coding I mean
07:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> you need to start really low, you can't just start by understanding how tw works you need the basics first
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @onby cython
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> that should be a technice for understanding how teeworlds sticks with those commandlines
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and learning from that
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what the heck is that supposed to mean now lol
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like learning from teeworlds codes?
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that’s exactly what I meant with smart words
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> "technique, commandline"
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> just smart words thrown together without any sense
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> get into basics is like.... no way there could i find a good guide for
07:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> no you can't learn programming just by reading teeworlds code, like at the start you'll do simple stuff like a console program that take a word in input and output that work, something that counts to 10, things like that
07:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u have to learn phytron technices for debugging the commandlines
07:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lol
07:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i already learned it kinda on school
07:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but in a weird way
07:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> omg
07:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> really
07:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and what did you do?
07:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> my teacher was cool, but not for long... when i was travelling into germany
07:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> lmao
07:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> @onby i agree
07:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :troll:
07:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like i was able to program with basic languages, making at least a calculator which counts with 2 digits, making random number generators, and having a cool window feature
07:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> kinda thats all about it
07:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what languages
07:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> basic c, or
07:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> wait
07:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> when you say you've kinda learned it you're familier with the concept of class/objects/pointers/variable assignement/operators/linker/compiller/debugger and so on ?
07:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> not like with visual studio, but similar to
07:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> visual studio isn't a programming language
07:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> only with the linking and the object tracking was actually the things i was missing
07:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> with visual studio
07:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> gosh i forgot the name
07:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> probably c++ but only the basics of it
07:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @♪♫ too many smart words
07:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> with a cool program what we used in school
07:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> but i mean from what you've said earlier it's pretty clear you don't have a clear picture on how you can use all those things to make a simple program
07:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i should have find a way for it, but not on the internet,
07:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> if i would getting learning coding with my teacher tho, i should be able to do some cool stuffs with it
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> you really need to have acess to the internet to code properly today, looking for error messages, looking for documentation on libraries and stuff
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> well im not gonna fall into it, since im trying to learn game engines
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like Godot what onby sent me?
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i guess ?
07:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> maybe you should start with something lighter than c++ and visual studio
07:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> Godot is perfect for it because its similar to Python, but its more understandable in a way
07:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i could now make sprites, characters with animations, getting it on a solid object, adding gravitation and motion movement there,
07:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> adding textures, making camera positioning, object positioning, and other stuff
07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it makes more sense to start learning with command line only stuff
07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> no graphics
07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> not even tried to concentrate to graphic designs yet
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> only for making a single platform to test some character features
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [12:41 AM] onby: it makes more sense to start learning with command line only stuff
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [12:41 AM] onby: no graphics
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> with i mean single platform, i mean a platform to test gravitation and movement configs
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> how much c++ do you know
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> now very much now since i was travelled
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> now very much now since i was moved out
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 12:40 AM] Cellegen: adding textures, making camera positioning, object positioning, and other stuff
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> this is all graphics stuf
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> very much?
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i mean if i can make a fast look into all of the courses i've done before, i could have remember almost everything i learned
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i even learned about how the routers, the servers and inbetween the connection works
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that’s not c++?
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> basicly
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> aaaa
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> maybe
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you’re so confusing
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and confused
07:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> thanks
07:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> i'd agree that you need to be confortale with the basics to then be able to do more difficult stuff, it's not that complicated, in let's say a few weeks you can learn C basics, then cpp differences, start using Qt/sdl and stuff, all that in a few weeks by putting like a few hours of efforts into it every day.
07:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> Like you're saying you know how inbetween connections work but you don't really know how vpns works for example, that doesn't really make sense, if you had basic knowledge on how networks works you should understand that instantly
07:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> i'd agree that you need to be comfortable with the basics to then be able to do more difficult stuff, it's not that complicated, in let's say a few weeks you can learn C basics, then cpp differences, start using Qt/sdl and stuff, all that in a few weeks by putting like a few hours of efforts into it every day.

07:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> correct, u should start with c
07:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> whatever, once i'll get enough lifepower
07:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> The most important thing is to not get discouraged by it, like i remember when i first learned about things like pointers and bitwise operations i was so confused like i wasn't even realizing how those would even be usefull, today it makes sense to me
07:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Horrible> Why starting with c, since c is subset of c++? Btw cellegen just read a book about the language u wanna learn, then u are good to go to any direction u wanna go deeper i.e. graphics, networking, engines or the tw stuff
07:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u just answered ur own question
07:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yes thats why
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wtf xd i was watching some netflix and there was this one question:
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> "if foo object first object oriented"
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and the answer was
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> "then bar = binary arbitrary reason"
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> dfq? is this agian some weird movie shit or could this make sense? xd
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea sonetimes i can giggle about hilarious hacking scenes in movies but at the same time it makes me sad that i cant learn something new. And i think IT is not the only sector that spreads fake news in movies.
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> movies suck
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wew
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would recommend learning C over C++ @Horrible
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also didn't ready any programming book
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i prefer learning by doing and looking at docs
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best source
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> does anyone know how to prevent the bug where typing `bans` in f2 times me out? or is it just a limitation of tw protocol
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/527762737812471809/Screen_Shot_2018-12-27_at_2.18.55_AM.png
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on ddnet that doesnt happen
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> im using ddnet client wat
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well, that i remember from my mod times
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and my server is based on ddnet
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mmm maybe u have to many bans?
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [2:20 AM] Ryozuki: i prefer learning by doing and looking at docs
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ^ this
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and ye maybe
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i have 650 now
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> fewer than 10 of them are rangebans if that matters atall
10:22 <@heinrich5991> laxadedi: already arrived?
11:05 <+laxadedi> heinrich5991: Yeah
11:05 <+laxadedi> Watching the opening talk
11:05 <+laxadedi> but dont speak german haha
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what r u talkin baut?
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 35c3?
11:07 <+laxadedi> Yeah
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh its in germany
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> are the tickets expensive?
11:19 <+laxadedi> Not really, 150 euros for a 4 day pass
11:19 <+laxadedi> But its completely sold out
11:19 <+laxadedi> You have like 2 minutes to get your ticket before its already too late :)
11:20 <@heinrich5991> laxadedi: where do you sit?
11:21 <+laxadedi> I am on the left
11:22 <+laxadedi> with a bunch of french speaking people
11:22 <+laxadedi> the translation mumble is dead so far :(
11:22 <@heinrich5991> :(
11:22 <+laxadedi> We are going to go to TLS 1.3 after the entry talk I think
11:22 <@heinrich5991> yea, us too
11:22 <+laxadedi> Haha nice
11:22 <+laxadedi> Maybe we can find each other after or for lunch break
11:24 <@heinrich5991> pff. too little optimism
11:25 <@heinrich5991> we're totally gonna find each other before TLS1.3
12:13 <@deen> Enjoy, laxadedi, heinrich5991 
12:14 <+laxadedi> Thanks !
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Yeah enjoy it:GWqlabsFeelsGoodMan:
14:12 <@deen> sigh, where is the mysql cppconn's createStatement documented?
14:12 <@deen> I think it's causing our occasional segfaults on Chile
14:20 <@deen> our mysql threading is still horribly wrong
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> horribly horribly
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not just the things dealing with mysql directly
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but also the mysql writing stuff into the main thread without any synchronization
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *the mysql thread
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @onby admin rcon times me out pretty often, didn’t happen with mod one tho
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @deen  you always have those nice charts. can you make one where you can see the mappers with the most maps? afaik silex should be on top
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I can do that in 10min
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ok pls
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @Im 'corneum cant you do it yourself:

17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> np
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im not even top100 -.-
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> stap decline mi mappos
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i thought i onl yhad 30 maps o.O
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I thought you had like 100
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> not yes
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> not yet
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no edit msgs in #dev
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> Unkown Mapper: 19  😄
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats where my maps go
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hehe
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 193 mappers with one map
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> maybe we can ask push or fudgyking about the unknown racemappers
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @Im 'corneum ``` select Mapper, count(*) from maps group by Mapper order by count(*) DESC; ```
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yea would be nice
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> does it work? aren't mappers in the db combined?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> well... i mean its 19 maps i can claim for myself ;))
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> like "Im corneum & Silex" counts as one
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you need to split that up
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> 
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/527889227728420865/unknown.png
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yeah that's wrong
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> well
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I dont know how you store data
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> but yea if multiple mappers can be one, thats wrong than
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yea
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> or count as half a map?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> idk if you can do that in sql 😄
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ```run_three, run_shadow, run_away, run_groove, run_miniatur, run_firestorm, run_2rocketstwo, run_4mystery, run_neonlight, run_greygrey, run_birthday, Desolation, Brown Suger, Ambrosia, Encore, StrangeNight, 1TeeMap, Aufnahmetest 3, Hardcore 2 Solo```
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> these are with unkown mapper
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> all by me i swear haha😅
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> 2rocketstwo is from ShrekO
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> who made 1teemap 🤔
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> are there OG's over on kog discord?
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> maybe they know
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and hardcore 2 solo is by cube I guess?
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> run_grey_grey by kickZ
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> run_2rocketstwo by shrekO
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> run_4mystery by kickZ
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> the rest I dont know out of my head
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I just know that Aufnahmetest is a map by the old encore clan, probably by Kintaro*
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I just know that Aufnahmetest 3 is a map by the old encore clan, probably by Kintaro*
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> there is also a map called encore. isnt ther eliteraly a name mapped at the end?
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ye, says "encore patrick" at the end
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so patrick is the mapper? 😄
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i think he was in encore clan.  it could be a shoutout tho 🤔
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Fudgy can you help with the race maps

18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fudgy> its the same guy
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i thought he is shreko
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fudgy> he is

18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2564
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> is this run_away?
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Arem Shin  can you confirm for if fudgyking is right?
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye he is
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> we are right with race maps
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Arem Shin  can you confirm  fudgyking is right?
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> omg n00b dont question the king of fudge
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Well why not ask the creator himself, maybe he knows the ones which are leftover.
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> But yeah, i didn't doubt him tho
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Well why not just trust us

19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> theres a bug in the editor, when you put a layer on detail it disappears.
19:32 <@deen> enable high detail
19:32 <@deen> obviously :D

19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but i think she didnt rly want the credits for it xd
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @deen i mean it disappears in the editor right when i click on detail: yes
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> so i cant edit it unless i take it ouf of detail
19:45 <@deen> Im 'corneum: f1, gfx_high_detail 1
19:45 <@deen> and it should work
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i dont think you understand 😖
19:46 <@deen> SAme
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i dont mean ingame, its all fine there. but in the editor you can put some layers in detail. but when i press that button it acs like i pressed the S button or hide layer or what its called. so i cant see that part in the editor anymore. i have high detail on
19:47 <@deen> yes, the ingame setting has an effect in the editor

19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:rlol:403135527542456321>
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but dont judge me jao, you pressed border all the time (((
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> border should be removed
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> evil button
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or just add a confirmation msg
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> 😄
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen https://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/rev/9091b20040cf
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> seems like others noticed it too already
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ouch
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but since 2.10 isn't out, I'd rather revert
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think our updater can update dlls
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, it can, so how do I specifiy it?
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Especially so that x86 and x86-64 get the correct ones
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Anyone here who can tell me if the SDL2.dll gets updated if you update in client on Windows? (wine is broken with letsencrypt apparently)
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> otherwise just download it from website again I guess
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chevy> yes
