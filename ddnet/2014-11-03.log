12:26 <@EastByte> deen: are you there? :)
12:27 <@EastByte> hello BeaR 
12:27 < BeaR> hey
12:28 <@EastByte> do you know whether it's possible in nimrod to create two objects and make a reference to each other object in it?
12:28 <@EastByte> so obj1 has reference to obj2 and vice-versa?
12:29 <@EastByte> BeaR: question was directed to deen :)
12:30 < BeaR> I guessed as much :D
12:31 < BeaR> "In dieser Woche werden wir erstmals den Wettbewerb
12:31 < BeaR> gemeinsam mit dem Karlsruher Institut f√ºr Technologie ausrichten."
12:31 < BeaR> heh
13:06 < BeaR> hm it the map name 'Pharoah' intended or a spelling mistake ?
13:06 < BeaR> is*
13:56 <@EastByte> hm not sure
14:41 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
14:42 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
14:46 <@deen> Hm, BeaR is gone again, I just added the reference for the Haskell contest to my website: http://felsin9.de/pp ^^
14:46 <@deen> EastByte: I'm not sure about Pharoah
14:46 <@deen> EastByte: I think it should work in nimrod
14:47 <@deen> you just need to use refs
14:47 <@EastByte> I mean
14:47 <@EastByte> type asd1 = object
14:47 <@EastByte> type asd2 = object
14:47 <@EastByte> asd1 can't access asd1
14:47 <@EastByte> asd1 can't access asd2*
14:47 <@deen> write them in the same type-block
14:47 <@deen> type
14:47 <@EastByte> because at this time it's not defined
14:47 <@deen>   asd1 = object
14:47 <@deen>   asd2 = object
14:47 <@EastByte> that works?
14:47 <@deen> yes
14:48 <@deen> I think it's stupid that order matters
14:48 <@EastByte> okay and what if they are in two different files?
14:48 <@EastByte> import from both modules seems not to work
14:48 <@deen> you can declare the object at the top of one of the files
14:48 <@deen> (i think)
14:48 <@EastByte> and do import after that?
14:49 <@deen> i need an example to try out^^
14:49 <@EastByte> okay
14:49 <@EastByte> I solved it differently though^^
14:49 <@EastByte> now I'm going to finish spooky!!
14:50 <@EastByte> well I failed and I'm waiting for my partners
14:50 <@deen> but i think it's bad style to have cross imports
14:50 <@EastByte> ^
14:50 <@EastByte> I think so too
16:20 < cris272> hey deen , i just noticed my forum confirmation email has been detect as spam on outlook
16:34 <@deen> cris272: =/
16:34 <@deen> spam detections don't like mails from taiwan?
16:37 < cris272> idk, but it's does not matter because he forum does't need confirmation link
16:45 < cris272>     Open Internet Explorer by clicking the Start button Picture of the Start button. In the search box, type Internet Explorer, and then, in the list of results, click Internet Explorer.
16:45 < cris272>     Go to a website that you want to check.
16:45 < cris272>     Click the Safety button, point to SmartScreen Filter, and then click Check This Website.
16:45 < cris272> if anyone have internet explorer, he can test : How do I check a website manually?

19:24 <@EastByte> NICOS: so you just figured out how irc works?
19:24 < NICOS>  yea
19:24 < NICOS> lol
19:25  * NICOS slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
19:25  * NICOS slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
19:25 < NICOS> what is SLAP? @EastByte
19:26 <@EastByte> some useless feature of the webclient you are using
19:26 <@EastByte> just don't use it
19:26  * NICOS slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
19:26 < NICOS> ahah
19:27 < laxadedi> kxD
19:27 < laxadedi> Fuck, still at work :(
19:27 < NICOS> laxadedi

19:28 < NICOS> how can i see ghost again? :=
19:36 < laxadedi> finally going back to home, cya <3
19:36 <@EastByte> no holidays?
19:37 < NICOS> XD
19:40 <@deen> NICOS: settings -> ddnet -> Show others, also alpha higher, then try /showothers
19:40 < NICOS> ok ty
19:40 < NICOS> deen
19:40 < NICOS> you have to see
19:40 < NICOS> my post in
19:40 < NICOS> DDRACENETWORKT
19:40 < NICOS> there is a bug in MULTIMAP
19:41 < NICOS> i try now
19:42 <@EastByte> please try to chat in full sentences
19:42 <@EastByte> afk
19:43 < NICOS> THANK YOU @deen
19:43 < NICOS> it was the alpha
19:43 < NICOS> i put it on middle
19:43 < NICOS> for see the ghost!
19:43 < NICOS> TYYYY
19:43 < NICOS> now i can see tournaments again! YEP
19:43 <@deen> about multimap, it's a known cheat, it will stay in the map
19:44 < NICOS> uhm, ah, ok but in RUN-GUY 25 you disabilited the hiden blocks
19:44 < NICOS> then you changed an "oldschool" map
19:44 < NICOS> so you can change this too
19:44 <@deen> yes, because it was stupid to have hidden blocks
19:45 < NICOS> yes, you're right
19:45 < NICOS> it was so annoying
19:45 < NICOS> ok, i will find other bugs... don't panic LOL
19:45 < NICOS> Deen
19:45 < NICOS> another thing
19:46 < NICOS> if i want to be a tester in ddracenetwork
19:46 < NICOS> what i should do?
19:46 <@deen> nothing, i decide who gets a tester
19:46 < NICOS> i saw, some tester like Ama and index
19:46 < NICOS> they are NEVER ONLINE
19:47 < NICOS> I need help for my map
19:47 < NICOS> I don't have a lot of time
19:47 < NICOS> but i can be a pretty tester if you want
19:47 < NICOS> :D
19:47 <@deen> no, sorry
19:47 < NICOS> ... ok xD
19:48 < NICOS> there are some maps
19:48 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
19:48 < NICOS> like Koule_1, koule_2.....
19:48 < NICOS> they really suck
19:48 < NICOS> they are not large
19:48 < NICOS> ... i don't like them
19:48 < NICOS> I'm asking ama and index for 1 mounth
19:49 < NICOS> they are ALWAYS AFK
19:49 < NICOS> do something pls :)
19:49 < NICOS> should go... bb
19:49 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!

20:01 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
20:26 < xrothx> deen:  Did you close starblock? 
20:27 <@deen> I thought I reenabled votes on the always empty blocker servers
20:27 <@deen> but maybe i was wrong
20:28 < xrothx> Could you reenable starblock? Some people asked me :)
20:28 <@deen> done already
20:30 < xrothx> yhx
21:49 <@deen> hi noother 
22:03 < noother> hey
22:12 < laxa> wow
22:12 < laxa> noother there !
22:12 < laxa> Hi <3
22:12 < laxa> Just finished Pharoah, pretty damn happy, this adrenaline at the end of the map was killing me
22:13 <@EastByte> and I finished spooky today <3
22:13 <@deen> good job guys, i finished spooky myself^^
22:14 <@EastByte> :)
22:14 <@deen> fun map
22:14 <@deen> no idea why everyone rages at the inverted jetpack parts
22:14 < laxa> deen: you failed the last release !
22:17 <@deen> oh, again?
22:17 < laxa> Yes
22:18 <@deen> ah, indeed, i remember
22:18 < laxa> If the bot doesn't announce the release in 5 minutes after it
22:18 < laxa> then there is a problem
22:18 <@deen> yeah, i forgot to add the file^^
22:23 < Nimda> FaCe by Zerodin just released on Moderate at 2014-11-03 20:15
22:23 <@deen> "just"
22:23 < xrothx> Good night!
22:23 <@deen> good night xrothx 
22:24 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
22:24 <@EastByte> good night chile!
22:24 < xrothx> Damn.. What is that always with chile
22:24 <@deen> hopefully just a bad connection to europe
22:24 < xrothx> :s
22:25 < xrothx> I am working on a webinterface where people can create/manage a tw server 
22:25 <@EastByte> hehe
22:25 < xrothx> I will add several locations once its done. Might concider chile to help you out
22:26 <@deen> i think we're the only server in chile right now

23:24 < eeeee> EastByte: so have heard you're familiar with webgl
23:25 < eeeee> do you know if theres a workaround for power-of-2 texture size requirement?
23:26 < eeeee> more specifically i'm getting an error like
23:26 < eeeee> Error: WebGL: A texture is going to be rendered as if it were black, as per the OpenGL ES 2.0.24 spec section 3.8.2, because it is a 2D texture, with a minification filter not requiring a mipmap, with its width or height not a power of two, and with a wrap mode different from CLAMP_TO_EDGE.
23:26 < eeeee> but that doesn't mean anything to me :/
23:28 <@EastByte> https://github.com/east/tw-webgl/blob/master/twwebgl.js#L757
23:28 <@EastByte> hm not sure what I've done back then
23:28 < eeeee> oh so "minification filter" is downsampling?
23:28 <@EastByte> it was only about mipmapping for me it seems
23:29 <@EastByte> I don't know :/
23:29 < eeeee> but doesn't clamp_to_edge break quads in tw maps?
23:31 <@EastByte> I just tested a tons of combinations for texParameter until the quads looked normal
23:31 < eeeee> hm okay, i'll try your solution then
23:31 <@EastByte> couldn't get around the borderartefacts
23:32 <@EastByte> what are you trying?
23:32 < eeeee> http://tw.qwe123.info/DDNet_x86_d.html
23:33 <@deen> oh, nice
23:33 <@EastByte> that's interesting
23:33 <@deen> wow, it works
23:33 <@EastByte> asm.js?
23:33 < eeeee> yep
23:33 <@EastByte> cool
23:35 <@deen> eeeee: have a repository for this?
23:35 <@EastByte> oh it's live?
23:35 <@deen> i think the times are just current ones
23:35 <@deen> same as in demo player
23:36 <@deen> in normal client
23:36 <@EastByte> ah right
23:36 <@deen> because i don't see these players on any public server
23:36 <@EastByte> ^^
23:36 <@deen> so many cool possibilities
23:36 <@deen> demo viewer, live tournament viewer
23:37 <@EastByte> eeeee: did it require a lot of hacking on the tw source?
23:37 <@deen> EastByte: exactly why i want to see a repository
23:38 <@deen> i didn't know emscripten is that advanced
23:39 <@heinrich5991> deen: http://blog.humblebundle.com/post/100007693045/try-ftl-in-your-browser-right-now-with-the-humble
23:39 <@heinrich5991> last week you were able to buy asm.js games :)
23:40 <@deen> looks cool, but teeworlds is probably the only game that runs on my computer anyway
23:40 < eeeee> EastByte: nah changes are minimal
23:40 <@EastByte> what about threading?
23:40 < eeeee> no threading
23:40 <@EastByte> k
23:41 < eeeee> i can make a repo once i figure out the build system
23:41 < eeeee> i couldn't get it to build with bam so i just generated a makefile from bam -v output
23:41 <@EastByte> I can't imagine how asm.js ist fast enough for the tw layer rendering engine
23:42 < eeeee> this is all using the "slow" legacy gl emulation mode 
23:42 <@EastByte> gl emulation?
23:42 < eeeee> yeah coz webgl doesn't have some functions like glMatrixMode
23:43 < eeeee> so all of that has to be emulated
23:43 <@EastByte> right
23:43 <@deen> need to steal EastByte's tw-webgl work!
23:43 < eeeee> tw uses it a lot
23:43 < eeeee> if we got rid of those functions it'd be even faster
23:44 <@EastByte> just put all the buffers on the graphicscard and let the gpu rendeer it^^
23:44 < eeeee> yeah but without matrixmode you'd have to write custom shader codez which do that transform
23:45 <@EastByte> sure, but that's even easier and cleaner I think
23:50 <@EastByte> hmm porting old games to asm.js looks like fun
23:50 <@deen> too bad udp doesn't work^^
23:50 <@EastByte> the webrtc standard allows unreliable datagrams :D
23:51 <@deen> ok, so we need to extend the server to webrtc
23:52 <@EastByte> "Error: pragmas are only allowed in the header of a proc"
23:52 <@EastByte> the only thing I do in nimrod is fighting error msgs
23:53 <@EastByte> sometimes it's just crazy
