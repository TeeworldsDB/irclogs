00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Not Keks its this time of the month again!
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I figured out that the colors were still a little of when rendering to a srgb surface. and this time, I really definitely finally finally fixed it forever!
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> so last time I was already quite close, where I simply converted the output of each fragment shader to srgb
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> however, while this worked for single colors and looked kinda fine on maps, it was off when alpha is used, sometimes only subtle though
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the problem was simply that while each color is correct, alpha blending with srgb is simply not straight forward, maybe simply impossible
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> so now, I render everything to a texture and run an extra renderpass to convert rgb->srgb while rendering to the surface
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (but only with a srgb surface, I skip that indirection for rgb surfaces)
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> hello guys
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i want to put teeworlds 05 font in my ddnet client(nightly latest version) how do i do that
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> how do i make it?
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> 05 uses tfnt font file so i cant just replace ddnet's one with 05
04:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> @deen hope you can merge it before release 16.2, just realise i uploaded wrong translate file which have 1 translation error
07:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ^^ very hard mystery solved

12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> :sueur:
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> U can now teach ur boy to make kernel modules
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I do
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Not Keks the one definition rule also applies to non-member `static` stuff?
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I guess the only reason for this is if parts of a map can be done out of order. But skips would normally only lead to checkpoints with higher number but not with lower, then higher again. But if nobody has concerns about it I can implement it.

12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> That would also help, if mappers accidentally placed the checkpoints in wrong order.
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's probably mitigated by the testing process
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but yes, I also see no concerns to allow checkpoints out of order
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Does anyone know if pdfs can be encoded with anything else than utf8
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Implementing a parser in rust with nom atm
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wdym, utf8 encoding in pdfs?
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the text parts?
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the pdf objects themselves can be compressed and definitely aren't valid utf-8 anymore in that case
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Only if u do jumbo builds
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I mean the strings for example
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ik streams can be anything
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> haven't found a good source; it seems you can have encodings different from utf-8, I haven't found that you can actually use utf-8
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "MacRomanEncoding", "WinAnsiEncoding"
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sure

14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > PDF supports one fundamental string object (see 7.3.4, "String Objects"). The string object shall be further
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > qualified as a text string, a PDFDocEncoded string, ASCII string, or byte string. The further qualification reflects
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > the encoding used to represent the characters or glyphs described by the string
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all encodings should burn in hell and only utf8 exist thanks for coming to my ted talk
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :Sadge:
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Quickly delete it or someone will come tell you about the benefits of utf32 and how ram is cheap
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The #server-bridge channel on my server contains over 5 million messages, and if I try to search anything in there, it wont show newer results than 06.06.2022 :D
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It seems to be very broken, lol
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Even without any filter, it does only show messages up to 06.06.

18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the internet forgets
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> finally, something that i CAN do
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> xD
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ive been using scratch since forever, so thats like, my only fluent coding language
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> Rule of Three, learned something new. Thanks for the fix.
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> Rule of Three, learned something new. Thanks for the fix. @Not Keks
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> is that Manuel Valls?
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i gave up on making a pdf parser
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> too much work and too little time
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but nom the library is rly gud
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> YES
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> utf8 & utf16 are best, #5490 & #4348 & #4111 & #3938 & #3331 & #3285 & #2742 & #2724 & #2534 & #1423 & #1396 & #231 agree
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sry for github spam, you can ban me now
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice github ignores
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets just force english only
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and do no encoding
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "no encoding"
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you mean ascii
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's pretty widely supported, yes
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My initial message actually had s/someone/jupstar/
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ðŸ˜„
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and I think those issues rather speak volumes to the bad encoding support of C/C++, not UTF-8
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know my audience
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i only saw it bcs ryozuki talked about a PDF parser
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well variable lengthed stuff simply sucks to deal with
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> utf-32 doesn't help you with that
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you have combining accents etc.
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah if you pro enough to respect it xD
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we dont do it
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But not using a billion tb of ram simply rocks
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> our game still works
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think you still need to atleast skip that
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xDDD
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not really
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its one by one codepoints
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you gain from that?
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> from what
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> having codepoints one by one in an array
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its fixed length
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you say that like it's some directly desirable goal
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't see that
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can't even index into that properly either, no? Chopping utf32 at the end accidentally still breaks strings too
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rust also cannot handle grapheme clusters, i dunno what we talk about rn
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Not Keks there's a grapheme clusters crate
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but why also dont support it rn
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but why is utf-32 beneficial?
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs u know the str length directly
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u can access code points directly
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> string length doesn't exist, unless you specify what you mean by it
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you? I think accents break that too
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know a single use case for 'direct code point access'
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> only grapheme clusters
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we dont use them
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the characters also exists as "normal" character
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> single code point
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only those that were also present in legacy encodings
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AFAIK
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean if we want smiley support maybe ðŸ˜„
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but you haven't told us yet what access to 'number of codepoints' helps
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [9:28 PM] heinrich5991: yes, but why is utf-32 beneficial?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [9:29 PM] Jupstar: bcs u know the str length directly
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [9:29 PM] Jupstar: u can access code points directly
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these don't sound like end goals, so what do they enable
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> performance ez
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these don't sound like end goals, so what do they enable?
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, tell me a thing where they enable more performance
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u dont need to decode
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just pass to freetype
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you need to decode at some point. why is 'string rendering' a bad place for it?
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> freetype accepts utf32 codepoints
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. you need to encode your string into utf32 at some point
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why is 'string rendering' a bad place for that?
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what do you want to encode?, our rendering still doesnt support multiple characters
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you said you need to encode your string into utf32 to pass it to freetype
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so at some point in the program that needs to happen
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why is 'string rendering' a bad place for it?
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well but we only support single codepoints and they fit into utf32 without encoding
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> have u seen utf32 code in our code?
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we seem to be talking massively past each other
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> freetype accepts strings as utf-32, according to you, right?
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes and our utf8 decode results in exactly the same value
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, so we need to perform the string conversion into utf-32 (that we currently also perform) at some point in our program
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do we currently perform a string conversion into utf-32?
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well only once at IO level
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so yes
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if we dont make the IO also use utf32
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but whats faster, once or every frame?
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't actually know
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> RAM is free af xd
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> depends on the cache effects of strings being 4 times as large
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well cache, what cache, L3?
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> l1 wont fit most strings anyway
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also not utf8
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it'll fit up to 4 times as many strings
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah, but teeworlds is no text editor
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> take 1000 chat msg
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and u are still around 1MByte only
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but you just claimed that using more cache for strings makes the program faster than decoding them on-the-fly
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how is 'teeworlds is no text editor' a retort to this?
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean with that, its not using like 3000000 lines of code or smth
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u know its not an hard edge case
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but go ahead do benchmarks, i bet against utf8 ðŸ˜„
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> great, then we'll just do what most programs do and use utf-8
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> since we're not an edge case
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so we do what most programs do and use a software renderer?
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or console rendering? xd
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well anyway, i only trust benchmarks, and discussing such topics is annoying.
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you started it ^^
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you proclaimed that using utf-32 would be faster
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and safer
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I haven't seen a benchmark, but I'm googling)
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "i only strust benchmarks"
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where's your benchmark?
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the issues i posted
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where does it say that utf-8 is slower?
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> slower in coding right stuff
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and concentrate into improving vulkan afterwards
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, so you didn't intend to make a call about runtime performance
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for more fps
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fine
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well i did obviously, code correctness is always top prio
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> without that your performance is not worth it
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't understand
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are you making a claim about runtime performance?
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah sure
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if so, where's the benchmark?
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i bet its faster for us
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you claimed you only trust benchmarks
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes, have i implemented utf32 yet?
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, so that's a claim without a benchmark
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i have no benchmarks, i say i bet against utf8
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i said that
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> here
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bet != proof
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [9:42 PM] Jupstar: well anyway, i only trust benchmarks, and discussing such topics is annoying.
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [9:42 PM] heinrich5991: you started it ^^
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [9:42 PM] heinrich5991: you proclaimed that using utf-32 would be faster
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [9:42 PM] Jupstar: and safer
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah i still claim it, but i cannot proof the claim
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i am not saying it's a MUST
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay ðŸ™‚
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I was probably too confrontative. sorry @Not Keks ðŸ˜¦
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> utf8 is the best
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >     The number of code units per Unicode character is variable, because not all characters are in the BMP. Until emoji became popular, this didn't affect many apps in day-to-day use. These days, certainly for messaging apps and the like, developers using UTF-16 really need to know about surrogate pairs.
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >     For plain ASCII (which a lot of text is, at least in the west) it takes twice the space of the equivalent UTF-8 encoded text.
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> when utf-64 ?
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> is that even enough for all diacritic combination ?
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not even sure ðŸ˜„
