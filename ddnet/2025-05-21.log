17:27 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I downloaded Zen Browser and was disgusted by how opinionated it was
17:27 < bridge> <gorp_tw> Got Floorp and I'm probably never using another Firefox fork
17:28 < bridge> <gorp_tw> you can't even disable some stuff in Zen but I found a way to make Floorp even more minimal (which is Zen's goal)
17:28 < bridge> <gorp_tw> if anyone knows a strong independent ~~woman~~ browser that renders CSS3 well, let me know
17:28 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i was going to try ladybird but idk
17:31 < bridge> <ar1gin> gm devs, does Graphics' `ClipEnable` require any special handling..? i seem to get lots of segfaults because of it
17:32 < bridge> <ar1gin> (i am clipping in-game objects)
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> how did you find out it's the clipping that causes the segfault
17:37 < bridge> <ar1gin> oh huh, seems more like it crashes because i zoom out too much
17:38 < bridge> <ar1gin> modding the codebase, the only thing I added so far is use of `ClipEnable` and `ClipDisable`
17:39 < bridge> <ar1gin> sometimes it crashes out of the blue, but i guess that was because i didnt properly close enable with disable
17:40 < bridge> <ar1gin> on the side note, when i zoom out too much, it crashes too, so i guess i linked these two to the same cause
17:40 < bridge> <ar1gin> even though it crashes when zooming out even without clipping
17:40 < bridge> <ar1gin> ðŸ¤”
17:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The only thing i could imagine that could make problems is if you use a width or height of <= 0
17:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> send a stacktrace
17:41 < bridge> <ar1gin> uhm... how so? it gets SIGSEGV and outputs nothing, and im pretty sure i did that `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..` thing
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> attach gdb
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then do bt
17:42 < bridge> <ar1gin> brilliant
17:43 < bridge> <ar1gin> hold on, let me test on vanilla to be 100% sure its not just my poor code
17:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> what does vanilla have to do with that ðŸ˜„
17:44 < bridge> <ar1gin> I mean, unmodded code
17:44 < bridge> <ar1gin> who knows what else did i break ðŸ˜…
17:46 < bridge> <ar1gin> ye, its not my client

17:46 < bridge> <ar1gin> repo's checked out at 19.2 i think
17:49 < bridge> <ar1gin> can this be an SDL2 problem? cause I got only SDL3 installed along with their compatibility lib
17:55 < bridge> <ar1gin> just realized, why is this opengl even
17:55 < bridge> <ar1gin> i had vulkan set as default since forever
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> tja
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Is the crash reproducable for you on some map?
18:07 < bridge> <ar1gin> yes, on tutorial map? just slam `-` till it zooms out to infinity ðŸ˜Ž
18:07 < bridge> <ar1gin> it might be resolved for me since this problem does not appear on vulkan renderer
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I cannot reproduce it on OpenGL 3.0. How far do you zoom out?
18:08 < bridge> <ar1gin> still not good that its there
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I am on mesa 25 too
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> AMDGPU
18:09 < bridge> <ar1gin> dunno.. maximum allowed? it starts lagging and stuff, I can almost see the whole map before it dies
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Make a screenshot or smth
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> So i can estimate it
18:10 < bridge> <ar1gin> hmm, vulkan-radeon for me
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> wait what?
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> `glxinfo | grep string`
18:11 < bridge> <ar1gin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1374781605041672222/image.png?ex=682f4ca4&is=682dfb24&hm=a8a6975037c10e73694a5b84261d386a9411c6d6cc3a7330089c94b63f77f965&
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Oh ok
18:11 < bridge> <ar1gin> oh uh, there are just multiple drivers available on arch, the one im using is called vulkan-radeon or something
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> radeonsi
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but that is the only opengl driver afaik
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> there are multiple vulkan drivers tho
18:13 < bridge> <ar1gin> the last frame
18:13 < bridge> <ar1gin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1374782225899585616/image.png?ex=682f4d38&is=682dfbb8&hm=a4aedd2c213e6dd959509ec6cd86cd946a4220120f1e06428e024a2ed280755a&
18:13 < bridge> <ar1gin> before it died
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> On which OpenGL is that now?
18:13 < bridge> <ar1gin> oh wait, it's still alive
18:14 < bridge> <ar1gin> 1.4.0, extremely laggy
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Well 1.4 you should not remove the zoom limit
18:14 < bridge> <ar1gin> wait i think i know the problem ðŸ˜‚ I might have ran out of vram or something
18:14 < bridge> <ar1gin> cause it did crash when i had like 3 clients open
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> This crash was defs not on opengl 1.4
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it was either ogl 3.0 or 2.0
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> This is what i get on ogl 3.0
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1374782637628985364/Bildschirmaufnahme_20250521_181330.webm?ex=682f4d9b&is=682dfc1b&hm=b2ae2e23932805d80fdbbe52c2bf123e4ebd9827d622d607894bf4c5f6decc79&
18:15 < bridge> <ar1gin> yes, 3.0.0, crashed here
18:15 < bridge> <ar1gin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1374782650644037674/image.png?ex=682f4d9e&is=682dfc1e&hm=5a101e171b47f9d563273dae06cce4a0f12ec0d959d19158621398f01e8b2386&
18:16 < bridge> <ar1gin> this time for real
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Funny, in self compiled debug mode i also get this crash
18:19 < bridge> <ar1gin> :susge:
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It crashes in a `__memmove_avx512_unaligned_erms`
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> inside the driver
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I'll check if we do a out of bounds call, otherwise you can report it to mesa
18:20 < bridge> <ar1gin> nobody uses opengl these days :nouis::nouis:
18:20 < bridge> <ar1gin> apart from some people with extremely outdated setups
18:21 < bridge> <ar1gin> very obscure bug i'd say
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> In OGL 3.3 I also cannot reproduce it.
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The offset of the render call is 4 bytes aligned and seems to be fully in range of the buffer object
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> So I assume the driver does smth invalid here
18:23 < bridge> <ar1gin> but i dont wanna call big guys at mesa... im not even competent enough to draw a triangle :justatest::justatest::justatest:
18:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I mean you can just report it under fake name or smth xd
18:26 < bridge> <ar1gin> this is the feature ive been working btw (so ctf gamers stop accusing me of cheating with zoom)
18:26 < bridge> <ar1gin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1374785465978323014/image.png?ex=682f503d&is=682dfebd&hm=1d97a08d5b0c73d23ebad8b9b9363f5f6231ac4ad782f1c2254ee36de7821abd&
18:27 < bridge> <ar1gin> (notice the cut-off tee at point beyond default zoom 10)
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lmao
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> You play 20:9 or what
18:27 < bridge> <ar1gin> 16:9 but the monitor is DAMN big and im sitting almost in front of it :greenthing:
18:28 < bridge> <teero777> XD
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 16:9 is the aspect ratio basically everyone in this world uses
18:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh right there was this funny cheating idea I had, having wm keybinds to change the aspect ratio of the game window
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Do you uses non-fullscreen?
18:28 < bridge> <ar1gin> its so that i can play with zoom other than 10, 7 in this case
18:28 < bridge> <teero777> cheating in ctf with 42:9 monitor
18:29 < bridge> <ar1gin> without cheating
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ah you _want_ to zoom
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> off
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> uff
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> :banhammer:
18:29 < bridge> <ar1gin> yes yes, sorry my eyes are all over when its 10
18:29 < bridge> <ar1gin> i just cant see
18:29 < bridge> <ar1gin> its that simple :greenthing:
18:29 < bridge> <teero777> hes cheating to not cheat :banhammer:
18:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> use a smaller game window :balls:
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> U have to make sure to not cheat in the vertical direction too
18:30 < bridge> <ar1gin> its basically clipping a rectangle in the middle
18:30 < bridge> <ar1gin> just as i would see with zoom 10
18:30 < bridge> <ar1gin> its al good
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But still I have to say this is a cheat and defs bannable
18:30 < bridge> <teero777> hmm works correctly no?
18:30 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1374786418861277288/image.png?ex=682f5120&is=682dffa0&hm=7fe8af7d98df88cbf6da7775d5b88425777bed402e0271240fd3b0007a27e96d&
18:30 < bridge> <teero777> looks like zoom 10 to me
18:30 < bridge> <ar1gin> these star particles though.... they dont render on the same layer as other particles or what?? they dont give a damn about my clips
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Looks correct, since it automatically zooms in
18:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> idk how seeing more of the map is a significant advantage
18:31 < bridge> <teero777> yes there is no way to zoom with a different aspect ratio
18:31 < bridge> <teero777> seeing others.
18:31 < bridge> <teero777> you can react earlier
18:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Doesnt matter if it is significant. you have an advantage
18:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> is the edge of the clipping rectangle any different to the edge of your screen in this sense?
18:32 < bridge> <teero777> what?
18:32 < bridge> <ar1gin> any ideas what to do about this (ive tried everything)
18:32 < bridge> <ar1gin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1374786890552578138/image.png?ex=682f5191&is=682e0011&hm=58d131d071f052c8b742b2a05ed88747b141e3a9bf93225142746fefa0229571&
18:32 < bridge> <teero777> @ar1gin btw what are you trying to do? there is no way to see more without zooming
18:32 < bridge> <teero777> except dyncam
18:33 < bridge> <ar1gin> there is, you definitely see players earlier with unlocked zoom on fng
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> he tries to clip the whole ingame objects
18:33 < bridge> <teero777> unlocked zoom is cheat
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I recommend you use windowed mode
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> otherwise it's a cheat
18:33 < bridge> <ar1gin> im trying to uncheat it ðŸ˜Ž
18:33 < bridge> <teero777> what does this mean?
18:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> they're hiding tees outside the area that you'd normally see with zoom 10
18:33 < bridge> <teero777> ?? the default client doesn't have it unlockd
18:33 < bridge> <ar1gin> look at the screenshot, the tee is cut off
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> basically clip everything as if they are at normal zoom
18:33 < bridge> <teero777> serverside?
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> client
18:34 < bridge> <ar1gin> clientside
18:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> screenshot would be nicer if the other tee wasn't super low opacity
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bro he posted 20 screenshots
18:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> took me a couple seconds to see it
18:34 < bridge> <teero777> but only cheatclients can unlock the zoom bro
18:34 < bridge> <teero777> what is he changing then wtf
18:34 < bridge> <ar1gin> sorry, i dont wanna join random fng servers for tests ðŸ˜­
18:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> change the map to not tutorial maybe
18:35 < bridge> <ar1gin> anyways, i see you guys still think of this as cheating ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
18:35 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks can you join vc rq
18:35 < bridge> <teero777> why are you doing this again?
18:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1374787695452360805/image.png?ex=682f5250&is=682e00d0&hm=411d1addeab9f8e67856cb8b680035796ba10a27691aa8ccd4086bd77017adad&
18:35 < bridge> <teero777> bro i see it
18:35 < bridge> <teero777> but why
18:35 < bridge> <ar1gin> its TOO hard to see anything with zoom 10 on this big monitor (but i dont wanna uglify my gameplay with windowed mode)
18:36 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I don't think it's a big deal but it's probably for the best you don't try to argue it anyways
18:36 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> solution is big black bars, surely :)
18:36 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> that's actually what some people do in osu!
18:36 < bridge> <teero777> yea just make the window smaller
18:36 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the game just straight up has that as a feature
18:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so you can be fullscreen but still have a smaller viewport
18:38 < bridge> <ar1gin> think if this was in the official client ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
18:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> speaking of seeing more, would people have issues with a minimap?
18:38 < bridge> <ar1gin> would be nice to have for sure
18:38 < bridge> <ar1gin> probably, most likely, especially on competitive servers
18:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> you could have the minimap not show others in competitive modes
18:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> or take the heavy handed approach and completely disable it in competitive
18:39 < bridge> <ar1gin> \> see more
18:39 < bridge> <ar1gin> \> see further
18:39 < bridge> <ar1gin> \> zero drawbacks
18:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> in drag or gores it really shouldn't be an issue
18:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ig in gores it matters because you can't just spec whenever you want
18:40 < bridge> <ar1gin> @inv41idu53rn4m3 are you doing a minimap
18:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and zooming in and out while playing is a bit difficult
18:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> just thought of the idea the other day but it's not like high on my list of things I'd want to add
18:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I was just thinking it could help with playing drag maps since you'd need to spec less at times
18:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> wanting to know whether the bottom of a pit is dangerous is such a common scenario
18:43 < bridge> <ar1gin> wanted to try to draw a minimap, turned out my skills at low-level graphics are garbage and i dont know ddnets codebase enough :feelsbadman:
18:43 < bridge> <ar1gin> sure is a kickass feature to have though!
18:43 < bridge> <ar1gin> esp with /showall
18:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i'd say ddnets codebase simply makes it too hard xd
18:44 < bridge> <ar1gin> maybe... its too hard to develop something without encroaching on every system
18:44 < bridge> <ar1gin> its a major turn off since i wanna keep up to date and rebase every release
18:45 < bridge> <ar1gin> perhaps, isolate it in a component and it'll be fine?
18:45 < bridge> <ar1gin> anyway, i'll post clip feature when I finish it and gather some insight and opinions :greenthing:
19:50 < bridge> <gorp_tw> seems all that really needs to be done for QUIC is testing, timeout protection, and ensuring disconnect and max conn / throttling edgecase stuff works as intended, as well as testing windows + cross-comp
19:50 < bridge> <gorp_tw> @jupeyy_keks do you think you would be able to work in part of hein's PR to see if you can affect the model over QUIC?
19:51 < bridge> <gorp_tw> also, probably more QUIC types needed for the auth methods you added (not sure if he had considered Steam during it)
19:53 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I guess we also need to update the game in preparation, error messages for the network, like account not linked, account key invalid/incorrect, rate limit, etc.
19:53 < bridge> <gorp_tw> and decide if this should be otherwise transparent in the UI
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> you mean aggounts?
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> steam + email are supported
19:58 < bridge> <gorp_tw> ye okay
19:58 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i talked with hein a bit about the PR
19:58 < bridge> <gorp_tw> seems like its just annoying edge case type stuff left
20:00 < bridge> <gorp_tw> timeout protection is probably the biggest thing
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> k
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I'd have said timeout protection can be done on higher level
20:26 < bridge> <totar> Why does timeout protection need to change? I think if you provide the timeout code the server should just let you resume your session. Im can't think of any vulnerabilities with that but idk.

21:03 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I guess ensuring the account session is maintained, not removed
21:03 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I'm not sure how timeout really works honestly
21:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Then we'd need random timeout codes. Else other servers can steal account sessions ig. Dunno how current timeout codes work, but probs static?
21:08 < bridge> <totar> the timeout code generation right now is pretty good, I think it's seeded with the map name, server address, and a private seed stored on your PC.
21:09 < bridge> <totar> but I don't think you'd need to change anything about accounts to make it functionally fully random
21:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> k
21:10 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I guess it just needs to be sent and associated and nothing elsr
21:10 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I guess it just needs to be sent and associated and nothing else
21:10 < bridge> <gorp_tw> Is timeout set on map join?
21:10 < bridge> <gorp_tw> for the server
21:11 < bridge> <totar> ideally we'd have something like a cookie storage system, where the server can just send you a timeout code and it would automatically expire and be deleted from your PC eventually
21:11 < bridge> <gorp_tw> yeah server authoritative would be better because there's one less step to the handshake right
21:12 < bridge> <gorp_tw> but client would still need to ack I guess?
21:12 < bridge> <totar> I think both are secure enough technically
21:12 < bridge> <gorp_tw> yaya
21:12 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i don't know how "reliable" QUIC is anyway
21:12 < bridge> <gorp_tw> or really what that means in networking :P
21:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But when we have accounts why not simply use the acc info? XD
21:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> accounts technically are a session
21:13 < bridge> <gorp_tw> good point
21:13 < bridge> <totar> idk I guess you could yeah
21:13 < bridge> <gorp_tw> you would just be logging back in essentially
21:14 < bridge> <ykzjapan19_16404> possible optimize prediction?
21:14 < bridge> <totar> is it too slow for you?
21:14 < bridge> <ykzjapan19_16404> ye
21:14 < bridge> <totar> why
21:14 < bridge> <ykzjapan19_16404> idk
21:15 < bridge> <totar> the game lags?
21:15 < bridge> <gorp_tw> hmm doesn't tclient have a fine tuned system already
21:15 < bridge> <totar> it's not faster tho
21:15 < bridge> <gorp_tw> you can tweak it at least
21:15 < bridge> <totar> the tweaks make it slower technically
21:15 < bridge> <gorp_tw> ahh
21:16 < bridge> <gorp_tw> wouldn't you have to add some kind of prediction based on the mode
21:16 < bridge> <gorp_tw> like if someone is playing ddrace, likely held inputs with 1 hooked and in freeze will continue
21:16 < bridge> <gorp_tw> etc
21:16 < bridge> <totar> it handles that already
21:17 < bridge> <totar> the prediction changes slightly depending on the mode
21:17 < bridge> <gorp_tw> but for more complex cases it could be extended, though opinionated
21:17 < bridge> <gorp_tw> is there like "fly" prediction?
21:18 < bridge> <gorp_tw> fly on high ping still feels bad, it would be nice if a whole hammer cycle ahead could be predicted
21:18 < bridge> <gorp_tw> with some adjustable buffer that tries to figure out if a fly is happening
21:32 < bridge> <Ewan> thought u were talking about the game mode
22:37 < bridge> <gorp_tw> wdym, kinda talking about it?
23:32 < bridge> <gorp_tw> gonna try matrix bridge
23:45 < bridge> <chairn> looks like it's not a successfull try
23:45 < bridge> <gorp_tw> nah got busy
23:59 < bridge> <gorp> done
