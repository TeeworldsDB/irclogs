16:01 <+laxa> deen: use !lockdown when bots are spamming
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> Blocking irclink messages here until someone fixes this spam xd
16:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Rico> Someone seems to have much free time
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> not really, just bot
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you don't need to have time
16:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Rico> Well you must check it sometimes to see if it runs correctly
16:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Rico> ðŸ˜„
17:06 <@deen> laxa: well, I just check the channel from time to time, I don't get notifications or anything
