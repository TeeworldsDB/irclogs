00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> never, ddnet rely on too many undefined behaviors ðŸ˜„
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ddnet code is rustproof :poggers:
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <APFFF> Just a minor thing: 
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <APFFF> Given by how the Assets (HUD) look, I'd assume the freeze bar is copied horizontally (at least the edges). Would it be possible to change the loading bar rendering in a way, that an asset of the full bar is being rendered, so asymmetrical designs would be possible?
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> wasnt this already requested 3 days ago
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <APFFF> Didnt see it, sorry
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It was requested, and it is under consideration iirc
03:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> yo guys
03:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=4760 maybe we should revive this mode?
03:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> dm with many new maps and ELO would be cool af
03:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> we can also add drrace things there like freeze of laser pullers
05:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> anyone have the link to the browser ddnet build?
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> DDnet dont revive mods, i would consider saying that it's killing them
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not our fault mods donâ€™t keep people interested long enough. We host new mods we promote new mods, not like we go around trying to kill them
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSt9tm3RoUU
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> I used to listen to this music a lot, he's also a really good composer
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I think what he means is that you kill mods without noticing it
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Since ddnet has a huge server list, new mods or evn old are kinda hidden in this giant amount of ddnet servers
12:26 <+ChillerDragon> so you need ddnet clients server filter and exclude "ddnet" :D 
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> https://projecteuler.net anyone doing this?
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Once upon a time I did like the first 10, it's a little too mathy for me so I dropped it
13:35  * Konsti slaps Ryozuki around a bit with a large fishbot
13:39 <+Konsti> @dev on latest client LAN server wont accept my password in autoexec_server.cfg. I have to open the server in terminal and copy that shitty cryptic password. (linux)
13:40 <+Konsti> for rcon*
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you probably forgot to remove leading `#`
13:45 <+Konsti> thanks! Never had to do that before 
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> someone know the master link for kog servers? i wanna know if a tee finished a specific map
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @everestkio ask on their discord
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> idk where, there isn't a section
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> kog.tw
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://kog.tw
14:02 <+ChillerDragon> pink rat
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> Â§?
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Konsti: maybe try to have your autoexec_server.cfg in the user directory (appdata) then it should never get overwritten by updates
14:59  * Konsti slaps ChillerDragon around a bit with a large fishbot
14:59 <+Konsti> appdata :kek:
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We have a higher players / server ratio than the rest of TW.
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> DDNet players: 2054, servers: 670, players / server: 3.1
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Rest of TW players: 526, servers: 442, players / server: 1.2
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes, but I mean that that amount of servers kinda hide other small mods
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but yes a big success to DDNet, pretty cool also
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> lol rly 670 servers
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> wtf
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> at least 3 other people had the same problem recently
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> `mem_copy(pSkinName, s_vSkinList[NewSelected].m_pSkin->m_aName, sizeof(g_Config.m_ClPlayerSkin));`
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> saw this in the code and wondered, 
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> isnt it bad style to use different variables for the value and the size, or is this style ok?
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> `mem_copy(pSkinName, s_vSkinList[NewSelected].m_pSkin->m_aName, sizeof(g_Config.m_ClPlayerSkin));`

16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> isnt it kinda bad style to use different variables for the value and the size?
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk the exact place you found that, but the pSkinName points to either clplayerskin or cldummyskin, and those are both the same size
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> My bad. Yes, you are right pSkinName points to ClPlayerSkin ðŸ™‚
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> yeah im not consistent, but i like the urge to code something really small.
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> to solve the prob
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I like programming and CS oriented challanges more, so doing leetcode and Advent of Code is how I scratch that itch

17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ? xd
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gollip, gollip
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 should we do anything about that? Unlikely they actually support 16k players
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Wait how much resources and what hardware would a server need if it could support that mant servers
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Wait how much resources and what hardware would a server need if it could support that many players
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think any simple modification to the code could allow that many players to inhabit the same gameworld
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can have them as spectators though, would be easier
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, that you could probably support
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess that just requires a very beefy network and a fast cpu that can push out the packets in time

17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Ravie and I just overworking part of the "hud.png"  and now just talking about merging it with extra.png. for example like that:
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Now the question, do we want to also add arrow.png and strong_weak.png to it, so we have all textures related to our game in one png?

18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> So what do you think, is it ok if we add arrow.png and strong_weak.png too?
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they are hud elements, I don't see why not
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> wouldn't be nice to have all those Assets from one custom ingame tileset, so you don't have to customize every single one of the hud elements which has custom variants in the game.pngs? ðŸ™‚
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well i personally don't care too much, nothing speaks against more images either, we should just think about what is useful for future now already, bcs after 1-2 years there are many customized versions of this image and adding stuff then is not really easy.
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> So I guess it wouldn't hurt to add as much as possible now
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but not all elements have the same size i guess?
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> If you can mash them together, you could potentially save more space
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> in a coding standpoint too
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I do not understand what you mean xD
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> In code there is no need to
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> nvm that, anything which will improve hud editing is nice anyway
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I mean, all those hud Assets can be accessed through one tileset, but I guess it only needs the id of the cells
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> So yeah 0 iq moment from me
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, easier for customization if we have more pngs I guess, but with spritesheets it's easier to get a consistent look
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> in one png, movement arroes? jump arrow? herewith i apply for a place for those in that png as well
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> if you put strong weak indicator there, if i understood correctly, why not those as well?
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> already working on that
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i guess its arrow png, nice. i like it, then you can have all the hud icons have the same style, i really like it
