03:40 < bridge> <sedonya> i am Kisao but in the future I want to give up this nickname, Sedonya is the main one
03:40 < bridge> <sedonya> Did you want to ask me something?
04:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @sedonya yea i wrote you on the wire messenger
04:52 < bridge> <animepdf> ChillerDragon: what is my matrix username, I can't remember it, and it says my email is not registered
04:53 < bridge> <animepdf> <a:smokepepe:920747242627932162>
05:01 < bridge> <animepdf> Nvm, found it. It was linked to GitHub

07:51 < bridge> <teero777> Hello developers
07:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> hi developa
08:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> did you follow the readme ? If using mingw did you add it to path and properly installed everything ?
08:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
08:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> What IDE are you using ?
08:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
09:30 < bridge> <avolicious> Good morning macos enjoyers & others üôÇ ||I know this triggers a lot of ppl||
09:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> morning C chads and others
09:32 < bridge> <avolicious> https://www.winglang.io/
09:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Every day new programming language is made xd
09:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Soon it will be able to compete with speed of creating new js frameworks
09:33 < bridge> <avolicious> Nooo, js world is crazy
09:34 < bridge> <avolicious> https://www.npmjs.com/package/brototype
09:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://dayssincelastjavascriptframework.com/ :lol:
09:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> this one is not accurate
09:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://dayssincelastjsframework.com/
10:33 < bridge> <teero777> Til pseudo random number generators can't generate  every number sequence.
10:33 < bridge> <teero777> Not just that you'd need infinite luck. They just can't
11:48 < bridge> <0xdeen> Intuitively I thought this makes sense to me: What you can do is create a prng with an internal state that is larger than the number sequence you want to generate, then you obviously can. But using finite state to generate a specific infinitely long sequence is harder.
11:48 < bridge> <0xdeen> But imagine a PRNG that just returns you digits from pi, and the seed/state is the digit of pi you start with/are at. Now any sequence will be returned since pi contains every number sequence.
11:49 < bridge> <aegisub> It's not actually known that pi contains every number sequence, just conjectured
11:52 < bridge> <Assa> good enough, either it will work or I disprove the theorem
11:53 < bridge> <Assa> but I see another problem: we don't know every digit of Pi
11:54 < bridge> <Assa> looked it up: we just know 100 ... trillion
11:55 < bridge> <0xdeen> I never said it's a good PRNG üòÑ
12:26 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon
12:27 < bridge> <woidless> And how can you find a flag, or spawn it
12:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless put a flag in the map
12:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in the editor there are only 2 one red and one blue
12:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> once it is in the map there is no way to move it as an admin. You have to collect it at its stand. There is also no way to locate it using ddnet client.
12:37 < bridge> <teero777> Til pseudo random number generators can't generate every number sequence.
12:38 < bridge> <aegisub> it's actually easy to construct normal numbers, i.e. numbers whose (say) decimal representation contains all subsequences with equal uniform probability
12:38 < bridge> <aegisub> 0.12345678910111213... is such a number
12:39 < bridge> <aegisub> but that's not very useful as a prng
13:58 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon You can do it
13:58 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1305879405368840202/Screenshot_2024-11-12-17-57-32-387_com.discord.png?ex=6734a278&is=673350f8&hm=88c0b0c86dad2756700d751efcd67ef7104a1cab9d6779fa2a8d9ca6f5d1f9bf&
14:27 < bridge> <manikoo> clap with my devs chat
14:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> I think it's fair to assume the rather harsh sounding sentences come from language barrier.
14:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> I'll send you to the shadow realms if you don't stop posting this damn sentence or the gif in random channels constantly outside of #off-topic :thisemoji:
14:43 < bridge> <kollpotato> clap with me melon
14:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> ü•î üçà
15:15 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> can you tell me how to make a delay for example for 7 seconds in your client.cpp console command
15:50 < bridge> <zhn> what do you want exactly
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1305915819632627803/image.png?ex=6734c462&is=673372e2&hm=64bb426f3b5bf5d4f72862da1f3ad3e2763867f03d5df1bcd0df5c8fb955f609&
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> me at work basically
17:26 < bridge> <Ewan> good morning
17:26 < bridge> <Ewan> am i the only one that enjoys all the desktop OSes :justatest:
17:28 < bridge> <louis> i enjoy all too
17:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> never used a mac but I could see myself finding a perverse sort of enjoyment of Windows if I managed to beat it into submission
17:46 < bridge> <louis> mac is just so visually pleasing + the quality of the machines themselves output some sense of enjoyment
17:58 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1gpoo9m/dlss_frame_generation_is_now_available_on_proton/
18:24 < bridge> <lsdglsgdflk> for example I used the command and it changed my skin then waited 7 seconds and changed it back I need a timer
18:28 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
18:28 < bridge> <Ewan> this i will probably use
18:28 < bridge> <Ewan> not the upscaling
19:52 < bridge> <chairn> afaik, most prng never generates 0 for instance
20:40 < bridge> <chairn> lol, github forcing 2 factor auth and the app i use (FreeOTP) tells me that the token given by github is too weak and shouldn't be trusted
22:45 < bridge> <sollybunny> #8381
22:45 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8381
22:45 < bridge> <sollybunny> if the color is saved per message it would mean behaviour of different types of messages (and their configs) would be inconsistent
22:49 < bridge> <sollybunny> cl_nameplates_size  for some reason isnt in a... sensible unit
22:49 < bridge> <sollybunny> and 0 is a false origin
22:50 < bridge> <sollybunny> which is way too big
22:50 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1306013205361070080/image.png?ex=67351f14&is=6733cd94&hm=5836f21f59ed9a5c1fb5413c89df690f71c3c5ce6cc9b5da8c90ff1de9b2092f&
22:50 < bridge> <sollybunny> this is 0
22:50 < bridge> <sollybunny> and i would say this is accessably big still
22:53 < bridge> <sollybunny> could there be a new option for every font size unit to be in whatever is used internally
22:53 < bridge> <sollybunny> which is on by default except for new configs
22:53 < bridge> <sollybunny> o i gues that would break compatbility with old versions
22:53 < bridge> <sollybunny> or rather when downgrading
22:53 < bridge> <sollybunny> or the size could go negative which is a 1 line change x-x
23:52 < bridge> <avolicious> üò¶ When colors for normal chat
23:52 < bridge> <sollybunny> you can already change them
23:52 < bridge> <avolicious> But not server-side
23:52 < bridge> <sollybunny> o
23:53 < bridge> <sollybunny> i dont think id want that
23:53 < bridge> <sollybunny> what would you use it for?
23:53 < bridge> <sollybunny> i cant think of any use
23:53 < bridge> <avolicious> Highlight important messages or fragments of it
23:54 < bridge> <avolicious> Using a broadcast is the last option as its pretty invasive
23:54 < bridge> <sollybunny> i thought you can render arbritrary stuff through some magic
23:54 < bridge> <sollybunny> infclass does that
23:54 < bridge> <avolicious> in broadcast?
23:55 < bridge> <sollybunny> not in broadcast
23:55 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1306029674815815780/image.png?ex=67352e6b&is=6733dceb&hm=b35cc2a077d667da7bfcc0f57fd15fa714220b14ca29ba49570236e14a7af5b6&
23:55 < bridge> <sollybunny> and it highlights when u hover over it
23:55 < bridge> <sollybunny> doesn't work in entities
23:56 < bridge> <sollybunny> and isnt part of the map
23:56 < bridge> <sollybunny> idk how it works
23:58 < bridge> <avolicious> It nice, but also invasive
23:59 < bridge> <avolicious> During a run I cant display this üòÑ Its annoying
23:59 < bridge> <sollybunny> you can stick it in some corner probably
23:59 < bridge> <sollybunny> or above where chat would be
23:59 < bridge> <sollybunny> but i think the server being able to send colored msgs might be a bit invasive
