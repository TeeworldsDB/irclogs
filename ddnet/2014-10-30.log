00:00 < BeaR> I guess the limit was 64 ?
00:00 < BeaR> could add more ofc
00:00 <@deen> it's probably bad that kintaro used the circles to make long rectangles^^
00:00 <@deen> 10 small sounds next to each other
00:00 < BeaR> yeah :D
00:02 <@deen> so it's not something we can easily fix now, right?
00:03 < BeaR> well, you can increase NUM_VOICES (:
00:03 <@deen> no bad effects?
00:03 < BeaR> but this will also increase the time the audio thread will spend mixing the voices
00:04 <@deen> hm
00:04 < BeaR> could be too slow if the polling rate is too high
00:04 <@deen> so we need a reasonable limit
00:04 < BeaR> didn't expect ppl to set so many sounds to be honest :D
00:06 < BeaR> would require maybe some optimization in the mixing loop, but didn't profile it
00:07 <@deen> are you sure it gets slower with more voices?^^
00:08 < BeaR> yeah but as I said didn'T profile it, probably can handle up to 1024 voices easily
00:08 < BeaR> also depends on client settings
00:08 <@deen> i set it up to obscene values
00:08 <@deen> and nothing changed in cpu load
00:08 < BeaR> good (:

11:16 <@deen> hi
11:22 <@deen> xRoThx_: i'm still trying to get the daily high ping issue resolved with nfoservers, but it's a bit difficult since they only respond after 2 hours, and then it's gone already^^
11:22 < xRoThx_> :P
11:22 < xRoThx_> Why you are using the gamer2play advertising map
11:22 < xRoThx_> ^^
11:22 <@deen> what?
11:23 <@deen> ah, on blocker?
11:23 < xRoThx_> yes
11:23 <@deen> i just used the maps someone sent me
11:23 <@deen> the people who wanted a blocker server
11:23 < xRoThx_> I will edit it
11:23 < xRoThx_> r0x.fr is down? 
11:24 < xRoThx_> the v3royal
11:24 <@deen> no, i see them
11:24 < xRoThx_> Cant find it
11:24 < xRoThx_> h ok
11:24 < xRoThx_> I filtered -Has players 
11:26 <@deen> Special Halloween servers running
11:26 <@deen> will get a surprise there, hopefully later today
11:26 < xRoThx_> From Teeworlds? 
11:26 < xRoThx_> or DDNet? 
11:26 <@deen> ddnet halloween, yes
11:26 < xRoThx_> okay
11:26 < xRoThx_> :)
11:26 < xRoThx_> How to edit a map on a laptop? 
11:26 < xRoThx_> Cant move the map withou
11:26 < xRoThx_> without mouse*
11:26 <@deen> no idea
11:27 <@EastByte> touch pads usually have a left/right button
11:27 <@deen> ah, you're editting blmapv3royal?
11:27 < xRoThx_> yes
11:27 < xRoThx_> I had 2 versions of it 
11:27 < xRoThx_> When I hosted them
11:27 <@deen> i think bip is reworking it
11:27 <@deen> for us
11:27 < xRoThx_> Okay
11:27 <@deen> but he said that 4 days ago
11:27 <@deen> and hasn't written anything since
11:28 < xRoThx_> Okay, I will try on my laptop
11:38 < xRoThx_> won't work 
11:39 < xRoThx_> maybe somethig for ddnet 7
11:42 <@deen> what?
11:45 < xRoThx_> A possibiity to map with a laptop
11:45 <@deen> i think you need left mouse click, right mouse click, shift and ctrl
11:46 < xRoThx_> ill try
11:47 < xRoThx_> cntrl shift mouseleft
11:48 < xRoThx_> But I can not move the mouse while I hold Space
11:49 < xRoThx_> So still can not map 
11:49 <@deen> weird
11:49 <@deen> works fine on my laptop
11:49 < xRoThx_> to map aswell? 
11:49 <@deen> but i don't have a touchpad, so no idea
11:49 < xRoThx_> Ok
11:49 < xRoThx_> Well I only wanted 2 small edits
11:50 < xRoThx_> 1 www.gamer2play.de -> www.Ddnet.tw
11:50 <@deen> hm, i wouldn't change stuff like that on a map
11:50 <@deen> the mapper should do that
11:50 < xRoThx_> 2 Down the www.ddnet.tw ->> [DDoS-Safe] by xRoThx
11:51 < xRoThx_> Gamer2play is just a guy like me. He betrayed me
11:51 <@deen> i don't think you should advertise ddos-sae^^
11:51 < xRoThx_> P
11:51 < xRoThx_> I think I should :P So players will see what servers are safe enough to play
11:55 < laxadedi> it's not like blockers have anything to loose if server is getting ddoses
11:55 < laxadedi> ddosed
11:56 < xRoThx_> The blockers are notting without the racers
11:56 < xRoThx_> And racers have things to lose
11:57 <@deen> i think when you advertise that you're ddos-safe you will just attract bigger attackers
11:57 < xRoThx_> I don't think there are a lot big attackers on this game :)
12:13 < xRoThx_> deen:  I have sent you an email
12:14 <@deen> hm
12:15 <@deen> now it will say "Thanks to xRoThx on every server we have worldwide
12:16 <@deen> also, the website is ddnet.tw, without www
12:18 < xRoThx_> Okay :) Nice ^^ but those aren't all thanks to me right? 
12:18 <@deen> yeah, that's why i meant it's a problem
12:19 < xRoThx_> And when I look at what you host.. Damn man.. that is a lot on such a small server
12:19 < xRoThx_> after like 5 I get laggs with windows.. :o
12:26 < xRoThx_> Sent
12:26 < xRoThx_> without www
12:41 < xRoThx_> deen:  In the blockserver(s) you should disable the voting for maps etc
13:10 < xRoThx_> !ddnet stats
13:10 < xRoThx_> !ddnet
13:10 < xRoThx_> !players
13:10 <@deen> xRoThx_: huh, why?
13:10 < xRoThx_> :p
13:10 <@deen> xRoThx_: why shouldn't they vote for maps
13:10 < xRoThx_> Just to know :p
13:10 < xRoThx_> Because its a blockserver
13:11 < xRoThx_> Blockserver should stay stable Not fun if you are blocking good & some noobs change map just to empty the server
13:12 <@deen> we always had map changes on them
13:13 <@deen> since we have more maps than servers, how else would we run them?
13:16 < xRoThx_> Get more servers ;)
13:16 < xRoThx_> I understand it on a ddrace server
13:16 <@deen> but they are always empty anyway, so who cares?
13:16 < xRoThx_> but on a blockserver :o
13:17 < xRoThx_> The blockers, because some noobs are voting every couple minutes just to be free of those blockers.. 
13:59 < SSAB> hi
14:00 <@deen> hi
14:01 < SSAB> how can i define fuckin boost header in linux for compile? :|| i tried codeblocks , eclipse , netbeans ide and defined additional lib patch but it didnt work :@@
14:01 < SSAB> ide detect header and can open it but compiler says no such file or directory
14:02 <@deen> no idea
14:02 < SSAB> :|
14:02 < SSAB> which ide is suitable to edit src on linux?
14:03 < BeaR> compile headers ?
14:03 <@deen> vim and emacs are popular on linux
14:03 < SSAB> yeah , header of boost lib
14:04 < BeaR> you dont compile them :d
14:04 < SSAB> i know , i got this error no such file or dir !!
14:05 < SSAB> i set the include path in ide but
14:05 < BeaR> set the correct include paths ?
14:05 < SSAB> didnt work!
14:06 < SSAB> when i click on #include <boost/xxx.hpp> ide opens it and knows the path of it but when i compile project it says no such file o directory !
14:09 < SSAB> is it possible to define path of external lib in lua config file?
14:10 < BeaR> with bam? sure, settings.link.libpath:Add("yourpath")
14:11 < xRoThx_> 169K|548K lol, GER is the most used server
14:13 <@EastByte> it always was
15:09 < xRoThx_> deen: 
15:09 < xRoThx_> ddos attack 20sec ago
15:09 < xRoThx_> ay problem ingame
15:09 < xRoThx_> ay problem ingame?
15:11 <@EastByte> I'm ingame now
15:11 <@EastByte> themix tells me that there were laggs
15:12 <@EastByte> about ~30 seconds long
15:22 < xRoThx_> oke
15:22 < xRoThx_> Well now its fixed 
15:22 < xRoThx_> Or it should$
15:22 <@EastByte> yep smooth
15:31 < BeaR> deen: when the game is paused, the envelopes will still be updated as usual ?:
15:32 < xRoThx_> Alright :)
16:13 < CookieMichal> Hey
16:13 < CookieMichal> Just quick thing
16:13 <@EastByte> hi
16:13 <@EastByte> quick!
16:14 <@EastByte> you are too damn slow
16:14 < CookieMichal> I am on linux and I have created link to ddnet executable. Like 10s ago I have started ddnet client using that shortcut and it has updated but in wrong place
16:14 < CookieMichal> please make it update, where the executable is
16:15 <@EastByte> hm you should switch into the directory before starting the binary
16:15 < CookieMichal> also ddnet.upd appears on my desktop (where the shortcut is) instead of in that folder (containing executables and stuff)
16:16 <@EastByte> you are right, this should be fixed
16:16 < CookieMichal> :)
16:16 < CookieMichal> Bye :)
16:16 <@EastByte> cya
16:17 <@EastByte> deen: this might be the reason for steam users not being able to update ddnet (over shortcut)
16:57 < Spyker> hello

20:21 < Savander> Hi
20:21 < xRoThx_> yo
20:22 < Savander> question..
20:22 < xRoThx_> Sure, not sure if I can help. But you can ask 
20:22 < Savander> what is it ? "tracroutes and mtrs." in network
20:22 < xRoThx_> :)
20:22 < Savander> how to get information about it
20:22 < xRoThx_> deen: 
20:28 < Savander> EastByte: ! :c maybe you know

20:30 < Savander> from now
20:30 < Savander> because i need help
20:30 < Savander> I have network problems on my vps
20:30 < eeeee> problems like what
20:30 < Savander> i have really weak connectino
20:30 < Savander> and packet droping
20:30 < Savander> but when i make ticket request
20:30 < Savander> to my hoster
20:30 < Savander> they said
20:30 < Savander> "we cannot say what it is as long as we do not have any tracroutes and mtrs."
20:31 < Savander> and don't know what i can do now..;x
20:31 < eeeee> yeah they out of "traceroute" or "tracepath" commands
20:31 < eeeee> output*
20:31 < eeeee> do you have packetloss to everywhere or only certain ips?
20:32 < Savander> i dont' know
20:32 < Savander> server laging for everyone
20:32 < eeeee> try ping -i 0.2 4.2.2.2
20:32 < eeeee> and then ctrl+c it and look what is the packet loss
20:32 < Savander> now i don't have
20:32 < Savander> but i had 1 hours age
20:33 < Savander> a lot of packet loss
20:33 < eeeee> if there's no packet loss this way then you vps hoster probably won't fix anything
20:33 < Savander> ah, and ping jumping often..
20:33 < eeeee> you have to catch the moment when server lags and run that command
20:34 < eeeee> if it shows significant packet loss then you can attach copypaste the output from your terminal to the ticket
20:34 < eeeee> coz that'd be a real issue
20:34 < Savander> and next problem, don't know why they shutdowned my VPS few times in this month..
20:34 < eeeee> would also be helpful to tracepath or traceroute 4.2.2.2 when you see packetloss
20:34 < Savander> but i think, you can say anything about that, but thanks for help
20:35 < Savander> okay !:) Thanks
20:35 < eeeee> would help them to figure it out
20:35 < Savander> i will
20:35 < eeeee> in addition to 4.2.2.2 can also do the same for another ip like 8.8.8.8
20:37 < eeeee> both ips belong to high profile internet companies so should be very stable, so if you see packetloss to those then the problem is likely on your side. that's why these ips are often used for debugging
20:37 < Savander> eeeee: can you ping this ip?
20:37 < Savander> traceroute 4.2.2.2 
20:37 < Savander> wtf
20:37 < Savander> wait
20:37 < Savander> 62.113.205.186
20:37 < Savander> :PP
20:38 < Savander> my VPS Ip, nad for me
20:38 < Savander> 24-72 ping
20:38 < eeeee> what's the jitter
20:38 < eeeee> you should get output from ping like
20:38 < eeeee> round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 62.176/65.617/67.129/1.635 ms
20:39 < eeeee> if stddev is high then that's also a very big problem for teeworlds
20:39 < Savander> on windows it looks a bit different
20:39 < eeeee> windows :S
20:39 < Savander> :p
20:39 < eeeee> in that case it's more likely that you just have a virus or something :P
20:40 < Savander> but
20:40 < Savander> other player's have lags too!
20:40 < eeeee> or automatic genuine advantage pro enterprise windoze update
20:40 < Savander> maybe not now
20:41 < Savander> because works  not bad.. but from 3 days i have 
20:41 < Savander> big problems with this vps
20:41 < Savander> maybe more
20:41 < Savander> i send to EastByte 
20:41 < eeeee> wait your vps runs windows or your home computer?
20:41 < Savander> ehm, file from
20:41 < Savander> no
20:41 < Savander> debian VPS, filemedia.de
20:41 < Savander> i using putty
20:42 < Savander> to connect via SSH
20:42 < eeeee> oh okay, so you have to run the ping in that putty window
20:42 < eeeee> otherwise you're diagnosing your home internet connection
20:42 < Learath2> i think you should invest in getting a vps from a more reliable company
20:42 < eeeee> which wouldn't help with your vps connection
20:43 < Savander> i send you file, network dump
20:43 < Savander> when i had a really big network problem
20:43 < Savander> a lot of connections problems, ping
20:43 < Savander> jumping to 400+
20:43 < Savander> for everyone
20:43 < Savander> it was 3 days ago...
20:43 < eeeee> so whenever that happens you can do all that ping and traceroute/tracepath crap and send all of it to your hoster
20:43 < eeeee> that's the only thing you can do
20:44 < Savander> ye, i'll do this
20:44 < Savander> or change hoster
20:44 < eeeee> if those are really connection problems and they don't promise you to fix it then yeah changing is the only option
20:45 < Savander> ye, they have on website
20:45 < eeeee> very srs
20:45 < Savander> 1gb port, and i had 700mbs upload/download
20:45 < Savander> but now i have 30 xD. nvm, 
20:46 < Savander> i'll do traceroute to 8.8.8.8
20:46 < Savander> and then i'll send it to them.
20:48 < Savander> thanks for help ;)
21:51 <@EastByte> deen: what you think about changing the working directory on client start?
21:51 <@EastByte> chdir("<root path of binary>")
21:51 <@deen> hm
21:51 <@deen> that would solve CookieMichal's issue
21:51 <@deen> but wouldn't the proper way be different?
21:52 <@EastByte> yes I guess
21:52 <@deen> it's difficult to even know what the root path of the binary is
21:52 <@deen> it can be a symlink or whatever
21:52 <@EastByte> but why would tw need another working directory then its own
21:52 <@EastByte> hm
21:53 <@EastByte> well IStorage seems to solve it on its own
21:54 <@EastByte> only the autoupdater needs to be fixed
21:54 <@deen> yesw
