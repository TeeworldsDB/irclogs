00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> But it's also scary because its possible to just create pain
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And I don't care if my pain isn't real on some higher level, for me it's totally real
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to go sleep
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> What
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Why
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just talking about myself xd
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good night
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Literally the best topic
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Actually i think the universe doesn't need any meaning
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And lack of any meaning is actually the best thing that can happend to us
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> It's weird that anything exists
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Like why
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> But actually maybe it would be weird for nothing to exist
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Idk
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> No matter the reason I don't like that something actually exists
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> It's just scary you know
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> But my opinion is very unpopular for some reason
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Most people want thier life to be meaningful on some higher level
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> And they want god to be true and heaven
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> already 1 hour late on my schedule ðŸ˜„
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> gn8
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I don't even have a schedule
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> TIL about std::span
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And that they are a replacement for void f(char *buf, size_t bufsize)
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> void f(std::span<char> buf)
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But msvc still doesnt optimize it well
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Stupid microsoft smh
