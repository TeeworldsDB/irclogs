00:11 < bridge> <Assa> I never read the standard directly, I had a C course explaining it
00:19 < bridge> <learath2> Read it rn
00:20 < bridge> <Assa> I'll do as soon as I need C in my life again
00:40 < bridge> <aegisub> which one
00:59 < bridge> <learath2> The one true C standard, C99
01:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why is c99 the best
02:48 < bridge> <teero777> - funy exclusive features
02:48 < bridge> <teero777> - not c89
02:48 < bridge> <teero777> - idk, compatibility with everything
02:49 < bridge> <teero777> everyone and their grandma has a compiler that can compile c99
03:21 < bridge> <totar> I wish you didn't need macros to do so many things in c99. that's the only part I don't like.
03:22 < bridge> <totar> every project makes its own set of cursed macros
04:05 < bridge> <Ewan> c provides no actual way to do exclusively compile time logic without the preprocessor
04:05 < bridge> <Ewan> smth c++ is pretty good at
07:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
07:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Moin
07:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> Actually in C you can compile a program and run it at compile time of another program
07:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> It's totally possible just not very convenient
07:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @essigautomat: hah! I knew this existed! A while ago I was talking with someone saying this is a thing. But forgot how to turn on these quad lines and got accused of being crazy.
07:42 < bridge> <pilonpl> Because when you try to code in C99 it turns out not even binary literals exist
07:42 < bridge> <pilonpl> I guess hex does exist
08:08 < chillerbot12> Elo @chillerdragon I just wanted to remind you that: add issue with milestone of next release to either polish profanity filter or comment it out to avoid releasing wip features

08:39 < bridge> <pilonpl> okay actually i'll try to just set map settings to writable before a map load and then set them back to read only

13:55 < bridge> <kebscs> why not move all at once?
13:56 < bridge> <robyt3> My trick for not sending a PR too early with Shift+Enter is leaving the title blank and drafting it in the description
13:56 < bridge> <robyt3> Easier to review when GitHub diff doesn't simplify the code being moved
14:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kebscs too much work and too many potential bugs and too much to properly review
14:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @robyt3 I usually don't send too early i just forgot that the title is garbage because it contains two commits
14:01 < bridge> <robyt3> That's also where I usually send too early, because I try to use Shift+Backspace but hit Enter instead

15:52 < bridge> <Teero> show
15:53 < bridge> <zelamusinc> do you mean you will create a fork or you already have a fork?

16:51 < bridge> <pilonpl> Why doesn't it show style errors at compile time locally?
16:51 < bridge> <pilonpl> Am i doing something wrong
16:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because that takes time, same with clang tidy
16:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can and should (to save time) run ./scripts/fix_style.py
16:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> before commiting
16:52 < bridge> <pilonpl> Yeah
16:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> clang tidy takes so long u mightaswell let the ci do it
16:52 < bridge> <pilonpl> I am not sure if my PR is good enough quality anyways
16:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @.cammo. <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9128> i think this is waht we saw on kog
16:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im not really sure how read only fixes the problem
16:54 < bridge> <Cammodude> kog has deepfly 0 ?
16:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the map probably did but the client didnt get an update about it
16:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so prediciton broke
16:56 < bridge> <Cammodude> kog sux so bad i cant even test it lmao
16:56 < bridge> <Cammodude> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1416437419032445030/image.png?ex=68c6d7a4&is=68c58624&hm=e1ab4dc3c4e27318bf00c4c9ea93a66eb5faf274f515b748e968adebf0d16b04&

16:57 < bridge> <pilonpl> making map settings read only was the proposed solution
16:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its map specific
16:57 < bridge> <pilonpl> but they have to not be read only during a map load obviously
16:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and u have to change map in the same one aswell
16:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh wait is this editing via sv_...
16:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is it not possible to send an update
16:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or even hot_reload
16:58 < bridge> <pilonpl> but should that be done implicitly?
16:59 < bridge> <pilonpl> but yeah i guess that could be a solution too
17:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think readonly is easier but sending an update is a better solution
17:07 < bridge> <pilonpl> yeah so is it even possible to run something when a config with `CFLAG_GAME` changes
17:07 < bridge> <pilonpl> i'll look into it
17:07 < bridge> <pilonpl> because yeah that seems like a great idea
17:08 < bridge> <pilonpl> btw where am i supposed to get clang-format specifically version 10
17:08 < bridge> <pilonpl> i have the latest version installed
17:09 < bridge> <pilonpl> are there any differences?
17:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> YES
17:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and fix style.py will complain at u
17:11 < bridge> <pilonpl> yeah i noticed
17:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> err google it but for arch based its in the readme
17:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we should probably describe a "will always works not very package manager" solution
17:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which is done for tidy
17:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> tidy has less version differences though
17:13 < bridge> <pilonpl> it would also be nice for the python script to tell you that you have a different version installed
17:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> err
17:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well idk if that worth it
17:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> either u have 10 or you dont
17:13 < bridge> <pilonpl> i guess
17:16 < bridge> <Assa> oh solly, you won't like my review :pepeW:
17:17 < bridge> <pilonpl> now the question is how to fix not the latest commit in git
17:18 < bridge> <pilonpl> git is so annoying
17:18 < bridge> <pilonpl> i guess it's whatever since we found a better solution
17:20 < bridge> <pilonpl> btw what do you mean by "sending an update"? is it a distinct thing from jsut hot_reload ing?
17:20 < bridge> <pilonpl> btw what do you mean by "sending an update"? is it a distinct thing from just hot_reload ing?
17:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> hot reload is like a map change but the server retains information via a structure that is always missing stuff
17:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which is why its always a bit buggy
17:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> by sending an update i mean informing the client and its prediction that a server setting has changed
17:27 < bridge> <pilonpl> oh
17:27 < bridge> <pilonpl> that's complicated
17:31 < bridge> <pilonpl> I guess i'll think about this issue for a bit longer
17:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @pilonpl this solution is perfectly fine especially since the "better" one is much harder
17:48 < bridge> <Teero> fun fact: ddnet actually is in fact not running at 50tps because of the inaccuracy of the timing system
17:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 49.99999 or 45
17:49 < bridge> <Assa> it's running on server time
17:50 < bridge> <Assa> can be even more then 50 if a tick takes too long on a server
17:51 < bridge> <Assa> and the client update rate is much much higher than 50, interpolating between ticks with intraticks
18:07 < bridge> <pilonpl> How does interpolation work tho
18:07 < bridge> <pilonpl> That's what i never understood
18:08 < bridge> <pilonpl> Because you need two ticks to interpolate between
18:09 < bridge> <pilonpl> And that could cause lag?
18:13 < bridge> <Assa> use current and previous tick and be off by 1 tick
18:13 < bridge> <Assa> or use current and predict next tick
18:14 < bridge> <Assa> and yes this absolutely causes lag
18:14 < bridge> <pilonpl> I think doing a `hot_reload` shouldn't be too hard and even if it is buggy it's not really a problem i think since changing map settings from rcon is only useful for testing
18:15 < bridge> <pilonpl> It could also allow for changing settings from rcon but only apply them on reload
18:17 < bridge> <pilonpl> Although on reload settings are reset i guess
18:18 < bridge> <pilonpl> So it might be not so easy
18:20 < bridge> <pilonpl> I'll try anyways because i see how it could potentially be convenient to change a map setting from rcon during testing
18:25 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't think it's the correct solution for this issue. Map settings should only be applied from the map. If you want to change map settings easily during testing, open the map in the editor, add the setting, save the map --> it hot reloads automatically.
18:56 < bridge> <pilonpl> Alright then, I'll PR the original solution
18:57 < bridge> <pilonpl> I'll also add myself to credits
18:57 < bridge> <pilonpl> One person was added after fixing typos lol
18:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ur already a dev which means u already have a merged pr which means u should be in credits regardless
18:57 < bridge> <pilonpl> I don't think i am in the credits
18:58 < bridge> <pilonpl> So yeah
18:58 < bridge> <pilonpl> Being listed in the changelog is cool
19:02 < bridge> <pilonpl> oh Robyt3 left some comments great
19:15 < bridge> <pilonpl> yeah that's actually so easy
19:18 < bridge> <pilonpl> how did i not think of that
19:25 < bridge> <pilonpl> nooo i force pushed and now i can't reopen the PR
19:25 < bridge> <pilonpl> i hate git
19:32 < bridge> <pilonpl> i guess adding new commits is the proper way of fixing issues with a PR
20:03 < bridge> <robyt3> Credits are in contribution order and only updated by deen, so adding yourself wouldn't put you in the correct position
20:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oops!
20:03 < bridge> <pilonpl> fair enough
20:16 < bridge> <Teero> this kind of

20:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> o nvm it loaderd
20:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ish
20:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and thats

20:18 < bridge> <filoqcus> "tas editor"?:nouis:
20:18 < bridge> <Teero> where does it say that?
20:19 < bridge> <filoqcus> It looks like some kind of TAS editor. IDK
20:19 < bridge> <filoqcus> 🦐
20:21 < bridge> <filoqcus> tas editor?:nouis:
20:30 < bridge> <pilonpl> wooow
20:31 < bridge> <pilonpl> what is this thing
20:32 < bridge> <blazulite> question mark
21:50 < bridge> <louis> has anyone built ddnet successfully on mac recently i dont want to sift through all these build  errors :justatest:
21:54 < bridge> <robyt3> Did you follow the README? If building doesn't work with those steps then we need to fix the README.
21:55 < bridge> <louis> yep just brew installed dependencies and tried the two cmake commands (failing on the build cmd)
21:55 < bridge> <robyt3> Can you share some errors?
21:56 < bridge> <louis> ```

21:59 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems like this issue: https://stackoverflow.com/q/77250743
21:59 < bridge> <robyt3> Try if you can compile a minimal hello world program
22:02 < bridge> <louis> yep, hello world works
22:04 < bridge> <louis> gonna follow the comments in that thread
22:09 < bridge> <louis> okay lol this worked
22:09 < bridge> <louis> > Seven months later, I finally figured out the problem.
22:09 < bridge> <louis> > 
22:09 < bridge> <louis> > Upon closer inspection of the error message, it was complaining about /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/, and on my MacBook there were multiple versions of this SDK installed (MacOSX, MacOSX13.3, MacOSX13, MacOSX14, MacOSX14.4).
22:09 < bridge> <louis> > 
22:09 < bridge> <louis> > I ended up sudo rm -rf'ing all but the 14.4 directory, and now g++ (and clang++) no longer complains.
22:09 < bridge> <louis> seems rly sus though
22:12 < bridge> <louis> doing that somehow didnt break one of my other xcode projects thankfully
22:15 < bridge> <melon> okay cool
22:15 < bridge> <melon> 
22:15 < bridge> <melon> when ddnet on ios tho
22:15 < bridge> <melon> :kyaruXD:
22:16 < bridge> <louis> idk what needs to be done to get it running on ios
22:16 < bridge> <melon> license + following their ToS
22:16 < bridge> <melon> or rather key, no idea what the actual term was
22:16 < bridge> <Assa> you probably need to shove money in their ass
22:16 < bridge> <melon> ye its 100% annually iirc
22:16 < bridge> <melon> ye its 100€ annually iirc
22:17 < bridge> <louis> i mean from a build point of view
22:17 < bridge> <Assa> this is something I'd honestly reverse fund each year, first get funding, then make it real
22:17 < bridge> <louis> u technically dont need to pay, u could build locally to ur iphone if u have a mac
22:18 < bridge> <robyt3> https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README-ios :justatest:
22:18 < bridge> <Assa> then we'd also need a person who is able and willing to maintain it
22:18 < bridge> <melon> their App Store requirements require some things like profanity filters, an ingame report system, and i guess we need our own TOS
22:19 < bridge> <robyt3> (It's SDL3 docs because those are richer, but it should be similar for SDL2)
22:19 < bridge> <melon> i can see how they just straight up reject it because of a missing account system tbh xd
22:19 < bridge> <louis> just remove the chat feature 😅
22:20 < bridge> <robyt3> Those would also be necessary for Google Play, but not necessary for side-loading like on Android
22:20 < bridge> <louis> emotes is good enough for mobile players probably
22:20 < bridge> <robyt3> Also only community servers, no players names
22:21 < bridge> <blazulite> fair limitations honestly
22:22 < bridge> <melon> we also dont have a defined privacy policy
22:23 < bridge> <Teero> kjjjjjjkkkk
22:30 < bridge> <melon> :kekw: update to this

22:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wtf is "blocked"?
22:31 < bridge> <melon> cant interact with the repository anymore
22:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> !!
22:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why is that on the issue
22:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> does it show everywhere they were particpating
22:33 < bridge> <melon> idk that
22:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im investigating
22:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont think its totally fair
22:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> pasting in chartgpt is silly billy tho
22:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i wouldnt have known nvoglv64.dll is something i control at first
22:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but then chartgpt/google tellls you and chartgpt says what to do
22:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so nvm
22:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> totally fair
22:36 < bridge> <Teero> shartgopt
22:36 < bridge> <Teero> shartgpt
22:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ssrlive only has the single issue
22:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> more repos than mejesus
22:40 < bridge> <melon> he answers all issues with memes

22:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that list might be exhaustive
22:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but its exhausting me
23:36 < bridge> <Teero> @jupeyy_keks do you have any stats on how your skin renderer in ddnet-rs is?
23:47 < bridge> <Teero> @jupeyy_keks do you have any stats on how fast your skin renderer in ddnet-rs is?
23:48 < bridge> <Teero> since my physics do support infinite tees i was going for the goal of >5k tees in real time
