00:31 < bridge> <totar> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/ddnet_06.html
00:31 < bridge> <totar> technically xd
00:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> haven't seen those docs yet
00:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they look wrong though. the type IDs for extended items aren't fixed and change from version to version
00:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> only the UUIDs don't change
00:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the items also don't get type ID 0, that's only the meta items for the UUIDs
00:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> did you generate these hover texts, or did you manually write them, ChillerDragon? https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/ddnet_06/snap_items.html
00:52 < bridge> <learath2> Why? Do you want to give it a try?
00:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because a lot of people get banned by our current solution, and I'm wondering whether I need to fix the current system or can wait for yours
00:53 < bridge> <learath2> I had a small prototype but I didn't like how it looked
00:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I see
00:54 < bridge> <learath2> What is on your mind? I'm unsure whether what I'm making will fix the issue that's why I was slowly working on it
00:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm not sure
00:56 < bridge> <learath2> I'm basically just making a data structure on which I could aggregate many sources of vpn detection. And we can keep track of different providers error rates
00:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd estimate that we currently lock out > 100 players due to the bad VPN bans, but it only helps us defend against < 10 ban evaders
00:58 < bridge> <learath2> We can probably disable it again until we have a more reliable way. Perhaps we can keep the dnsbl result on ranks as I proposed to help murpi out with evading replaybotters
01:04 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe with Robyt3's last change enabling it when needed is a better experience
01:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> You could also simply keep a whitelist for players/ip ranges that are mistaken
01:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Or like, the endpoint by *** that is being used could store the whitelist, so no server change is required
03:56 < bridge> <headshotnoby> sega dreamcast is ingame
03:56 < bridge> <headshotnoby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1269111514166595685/image.png?ex=66aedfb3&is=66ad8e33&hm=642b9396f5a9e6555a2111c1dc3f870617cf4653ce61288763ec593e930ee55e&
03:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How can lea replace multiplication
04:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea I dumped that in there while i was trying to understand them. And did not get to finishing the docs now that i know how it works.
04:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The docs are all hand written
09:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why does it even work at all? the dreamcast only had 16 MB RAM
09:09 < bridge> <headshotnoby> and so does the DSi yet that also works........barely
09:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did you remove some textures to save VRAM?
09:10 < bridge> <headshotnoby> i removed all countryflags except default, only load vanilla skins by default, and textures that have width/height larger than 256 are downscaled to that
09:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah i see
09:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> impressive that ddnet 9 could be stripped so much to only use 16MB RAM
09:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> newer ddnet's already use 16MB RAM for chinese font xddd
09:11 < bridge> <headshotnoby> jesus
10:05 < bridge> <learath2> This is what we do, but the issue is that some people probably just never come here and report. They just go play some other game
10:27 < bridge> <rutujek> anyone have good vps in germany or hosting for ddnet servers?
10:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what is your budget
10:30 < bridge> <louis> hetzner
10:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> servercompass.com?r=chiller xd
10:32 < bridge> <rutujek> 10,16 usd
10:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea hetzner is really good
10:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> +1 on hetzner
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hetzner, netcup
10:33 < bridge> <rutujek> what is hetzner
10:33 < bridge> <rutujek> vps?
10:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hetzner is basically the biggest hoster in germany
10:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> great service fast support, never had any complains
10:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://www.hetzner.com
10:33 < bridge> <rutujek> thx
10:34 < bridge> <rutujek> btw who is ?

10:34 < bridge> <louis> please dont try to prompt engineer it
10:36 < bridge> <rutujek> x
10:36 < bridge> <rutujek> i love this for now

10:37 < bridge> <louis> ye, should be more than enough for multiple ddnet servs
10:37 < bridge> <rutujek> 1 ddnet server how much ram need?
10:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with database or without?
10:37 < bridge> <rutujek> with
10:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe 50-100mb
10:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also depends on the map
10:38 < bridge> <rutujek> 1.5 mb map
10:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> smaller maps = fewer ram
10:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that doesnt work, it's about the width & height
10:38 < bridge> <rutujek> ooh
10:38 < bridge> <rutujek> 2000 2000
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well this vserver will have more than enough
10:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How many servers do you want?
10:39 < bridge> <rutujek> i mean how many i can "AI"
10:39 < bridge> <rutujek> for 10 usd
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😅
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you even have a player base for it? xD
10:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You want as many server as possible? What are you planning to host?
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe around 50 servers
10:41 < bridge> <rutujek> 10 max
10:41 < bridge> <rutujek> for now
10:41 < bridge> <rutujek> thx
10:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you only need one server I can offer you a cheaper option. You rent out managed tw servers for 2euro a month.
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> your bigger problem will be ddos anyway xd
10:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you only need one server I can offer you a cheaper option. I rent out managed tw servers for 2euro a month.
10:42 < bridge> <rutujek> yeah but antiddos not gonna work :/
10:44 < bridge> <rutujek> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1269214208285999114/image.png?ex=66af3f58&is=66adedd8&hm=3afd05c62ac82f835e7b24ce7c21b8c86a93805654782e455b2f787f75e73908&
10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they say a lot of stuff xd
10:44 < bridge> <rutujek> oh
10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but anyway, just try it out
10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can simply cancel the subscription if you think it wasnt good enough
10:46 < bridge> <rutujek> 14 days?
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno exactly
10:48 < bridge> <rutujek> they have ftp ? bc big hostings dont have
10:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you should use sftp
10:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ftp is not secure
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they have ssh, so they have sftp
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if that answers your question
10:49 < bridge> <rutujek> ooooo
10:50 < bridge> <rutujek> sftp better
10:50 < bridge> <rutujek> if i will need help with ddnet server can i ask you?
10:51 < bridge> <vappy19> 2 euro what, will be the most unstable server
10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why
10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he can simply use a vps from hetzner and share it with him
10:51 < bridge> <vappy19> Hetzner is a host?
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
10:52 < bridge> <rutujek> no
10:52 < bridge> <vappy19> A
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> vps hoster
10:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yep I already have a vps and I subrent
10:52 < bridge> <rutujek> this yes
10:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It will be cheaper and less work if you only want one tw server
10:53 < bridge> <rutujek> for start i want 5 but after if i will configure everything i want to make 10
10:53 < bridge> <vappy19> I always thought the cheapest one was 10 euro hehe
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i have a full VPS for 1.89€/month xd
10:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's super weak, but enough for teeworlds
10:54 < bridge> <rutujek> i saw for 1 €/month
10:55 < bridge> <vappy19> Too many DDos or unplayable?
10:55 < bridge> <rutujek> 2gb ram 10ssd and 2 vcpu
10:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sounds good. Where?
10:55 < bridge> <rutujek> dont remember bc i was looking for vps 1 year ago
10:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I mean you can also get 64gb ram for free xd
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for <2000€/month all ddos protection will suck lmao, except you have control over the filter
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it can easily handle 200-300 players if there is no ddos i'd say
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the network adapter is good
10:56 < bridge> <rutujek> if i remember oracle
10:57 < bridge> <rutujek> or something
10:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 2tb ram\*
10:58 < bridge> <rutujek> WHAT
10:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://youtu.be/Vrid-H3UPSs
10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
10:58 < bridge> <rutujek> i feel scam from it
10:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Looks legit to me
10:59 < bridge> <rutujek> in poland was hosting with 64gb ram and 15tb ssd and 16 vcpu for 3-4 usd
11:00 < bridge> <rutujek> but it was scam :/
11:00 < bridge> <rutujek> every youtuber in poland was advertising it when it was popular
11:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> This looks more like a free sample server with limited uptime
11:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> aws and google and the other big players all do it
11:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Free tier servers
11:01 < bridge> <rutujek> uptime for 30 s
11:01 < bridge> <rutujek> xd
11:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes xd
11:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you want longer uptime come to me and pay 2 euro!
11:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I need the cash
11:01 < bridge> <rutujek> okay but who are you pls tell me bc its not ai bc its webhook
11:01 < bridge> <rutujek> and webhook cant see messages
11:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im not a hooker
11:03 < bridge> <rutujek> hmmmmmm 🕵️
11:03 < bridge> <rutujek> okay i go doing server when i will have problem i will text you
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am hooked by you
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon is very trustworthy. i bet if you ask kindly he even adds a 0.7 server for free to the offer
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> i'll sell you one for $5
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i sell you a premium deluxe one for 200$
11:14 < bridge> <Ewan> overpriced
11:14 < bridge> <Ewan> mine is very pirformant
11:14 < bridge> <Ewan> mine is very performant
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mine is written in rust, blazingly fast

11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mine is yet to be written

11:16 < bridge> <louis> wasnt someone giving out free name.teeworlds.xyz server domains
