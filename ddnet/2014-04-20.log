01:33 < Yensu> I've got a question when you get a chance
01:33 < Yensu> How do you make blocks you can't move through, but can shoot through?
02:39 <@deen> hi
02:40 <@deen> Those are stoppers
02:40 <@deen> in the entities, far right below 10,11,12
02:43 <@deen> Yensu: 
03:38 < Yensu> thanks, was away
03:40 < Yensu> With those It feels like ice, like you slide on it. perhaps that's just the last one. I'll have to test when I get back
05:59 < Yensu> so yeah, it feels like you're on ice or something. It doesn't feel like you're on solid ground.
05:59 < Yensu> Is there any fix to this?
08:06 < Yensu> also, is there a way to make it so your hook won't break when you go through a teleport? I have endless hook on, but when you teleport the hook breaks
08:28 < Yensu> I think it's the distance breaking my hooks
09:41 <@deen> No fix for that
09:42 <@deen> No, it's not the distance that breaks your hooks, that's a property of regular teleports
09:42 <@deen> If you don't like this behaviour you can set sv_teleport_hold_hook to 1 in your server config or map config
09:50 < Yensu> will that make it endless length?
12:52 < Yensu> I assume it will make it not break with teleports
