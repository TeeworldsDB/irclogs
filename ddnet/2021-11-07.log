01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> sample rate 48000 is pretty much todays standard
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> you dont need to adjust anything
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @heinrich5991\: how do i do that? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4316#issuecomment-962502174

08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> leak \:D
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ignore that '-'
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> irc does not forget hrhr
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> How do i do a ddnet release build for linux so all libs are statically linked and stuff so it runs on every system?
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You have to build with a really old glibc system lib, I use Debian 6
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh fak
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> and what cmake options i need?
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oldest sys i have is debian 11 yikes
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> See https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/release/build.sh#L104
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but i guess im rlsing only for my self anyways so thats fine
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ty
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i dont see the part that tells it to statically link?
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> is that make package\_default ?
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> or bundled libs?
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> bundled libs
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> bundled libs takes the ddnet submodule libs instead of system right?
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> and also links then statically oke
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but we don't statically link all libs
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> only what's in ddnet-libs
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> cool thanks \:)

12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ouch ddnet git log is full of unticked checkboxes ;c
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> makes me nervous
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Hi, i have issue with teeworlds 0.6 server (not ddnet one). If u use ddnet client, connect to this kind of server and connect dummy i will see literally nothing but u could controll ur tee, u can also open scoreboard and see this
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/906868809049186304/unknown-5.png
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Is this with DDNet client 15.6.1?
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Anyway, the issue is in teeworlds server and maybe u can point me where i can fiz it there
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Prob in most of ddnets
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I use older client and same issue
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Its smth with 0.6 net codeðŸ¥º ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ‘ˆ
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I couldn't reproduce it, any specific server?
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> enter vanilla server
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I did, connected dummy, works fine
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ughm
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Okay let me check on other device
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I get a segfault when connecting dummy to vanilla
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but i thought that is not meant to be supported
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1698
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i think 0.6.4 works better
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, i didn't test on 0.6.5
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, actually I did, but it was one of the ddnet ones
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wow issue dupe
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> hmh
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 My server isnt in the http master anymore...
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Now it is?! so weird
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @fokkonaut\: what changed in your server compared to yesterday?
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i have entityex in aswell as switchstate implemented
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and yesterday not?=
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think my server is pretty much a 15.6 server for ddnet clients xd
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yesterday too
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok strange
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why?
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yesterday macos crashed, now it doesnt
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i get multiple reports about players not being able to join xd
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> also without macos
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> starting from 15.6
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> @fokkonaut is it possible your servers sends the same ID for multiple netobjects (tthat are not EntityEx)?
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yesterday i could reproduce it every time i connected, over the span of 1-2 hours
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> shouldnt, i think
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, you mean like ID 1 for characters and ID 1 for a door or so?
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> not character I think, but more something like 1 for door and 1 for pickup, or something similar
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> btw there are 2 fokkonaut servers
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is one not real?
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> one is test server
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if it says [TEST]
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> otherwise i dont see any second one
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> shouldnt, i use snap newID
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok, just to be sure since you and vali are so big friends
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that should take care
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> yes, should
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> btw, from #bugs it looks like it happened on fng too
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> isnt it possible to use wireshark or so to check?
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> I tested on your server with a debug print earlier today and didn't see anything like that, so don't think it happens now
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> (and could also have been an entirely different bug)
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hmm
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> as in, could have been a client bug
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You could try to visit the plots, use `/pause Fluffy`
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There are many objects, entityex is only sent when you are on the same plot as the objects are built in, to reduce filling the snap :D
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It probbaly wont be enough objects, since they dont get clipped with zoom, so they only have the normal range
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i can place sme more doors if you wanna test
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> outside of plots
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what i get often and also only on fokko is```

15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```Tho i dunno if that speaks for a broken snapshot or if that happenes generally sometimes
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can you tell me how to trigger it or what it does/where it is?
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i cant say, it happened sometimes, i can look if the demo triggers it too
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay, because i had some weird snapshots for sure... I still dont know how to find it or how to fix it, it seemed to be a broken character snapshot for some players
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It would glitch the characters, their positions have a small offset, etc
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> very weird, and it could cause connection problems i think

16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> funny to see at insan pinging nenny in ddnet dev channel \:D
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen u probs missed it but main page still downloads 15.6 instead of 15.6.1
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki thanks
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hopefully no more bad bugs popping up in 15.6
