02:51 <@deen> ddos on Chile
02:53 <@deen> NTP reflection attack
02:54 <@deen> I'll never be able to go down to lower traffic again. I believe the hoster is ddosing me :P
02:55 < eeeee> in that case hoster will probably offer some expensive ddos protection soon
02:56 < eeeee> "offer you can't refuse" style
02:56 <@deen> or increase my traffic more and more so i have to keep upgrading
02:56 <@deen> it's not like the ddos attacks even get through to Chile
02:56 <@deen> their connection to the rest of the world is so terrible that only 30 Mbit/s ever get through^^

15:17 < GreYFoX> Who is playing ?
15:17 <@EastByte> deen is currently online I guess
15:17 <@EastByte> oh not anymore
15:17 <@EastByte> !twp deen
15:17 < Nimda> deen is currently playing Caventure II on server : DDNet GER - Moderate [DDraceNetwork].
15:18 <@EastByte> ah
15:19 < Learath2> GreYFoX: morning
15:23 <@EastByte> go home Q
15:33 <@heinrich5991> steam support seems pretty bad :<
15:35 < BeaR_> huh?
15:36 <@heinrich5991> they basically don't answer my question, pointing me to many unhelpful FAQs as I try to make them understand what I want
15:37 <@heinrich5991> (and that for two weeks now)
15:37 < BeaR_>  /:
15:37 <@deen> hi GreYFoX 
15:37 <@deen> heinrich5991: what's wrong?
15:38  * BeaR_ derps around at UpNDown
15:38 <@deen> BeaR_: hopefully with music!
15:38 < BeaR_> yes but i'm stuck :D
15:38 <@deen> that happens a lot in that map, it's more about thinking than skill^^
15:39 <@deen> GreYFoX: let's play a round?
15:39 <@heinrich5991> yea please
15:39 <@deen> !twp GreYFoX 
15:39 < Nimda> GreYFoX is currently playing Kobra on server : DDNet GER - Novice [DDraceNetwork].
15:39 <@heinrich5991> can I join you?
15:39 <@heinrich5991> I'm very mad right now :<
15:39 <@deen> sure
15:42 < BeaR_> finally, this was tricky :<
15:45 < Edible> oh
15:45 < Edible> thats a nice feature
15:46 < BeaR_> and failed lol
15:46 < Edible> can i get a CLI nimda?
16:10 < laxa> Edible: ask noother
16:11 < laxa> nimda is open source anyway
16:19 < laxa> if you want the !twp thing in CLI, it's just an API behind it, you can use anything to call it with a simple script
16:21 < laxa> https://github.com/Laxa/Nimda3/blob/master/plugins/user/Plugin_TwPlayerStatus.php
16:54 <@heinrich5991> deen: do you happen to know what pTilemapItem->m_Tele = *((int*)(pTilemapItem + 15) is supposed to achieve?
16:54 <@heinrich5991> src/game/editor/io.cpp:776
16:56 <@deen> get the address of the tele layer, which is at position 15 in the data structure?
16:56 <@deen> not sure, looks a bit strange
16:59 <@heinrich5991> mh. git blame leads me to GreYFoX :D
17:00 <@deen> Good that you're here, GreYFoX!
17:01 <@heinrich5991> ah
17:01 <@heinrich5991> I got it now
17:01 <@deen> explain please
17:02 <@heinrich5991> ddrace introduced new variables in CMapItemLayerTilemap
17:02 <@heinrich5991> namely m_Tele, m_Speedup, m_Front, etc.
17:02 <@heinrich5991> but then vanilla also added a new field, m_aName[3]
17:03 <@heinrich5991> so depending on the vanilla version of the CMapItemLayerTilemap item
17:03 <@heinrich5991> ddrace needs different offsets for its variables
17:05 <@EastByte> doesn't cause that incompatibility to old ddrace maps?
17:06 <@heinrich5991> the mentioned code is the backward-compatiblity :)
17:06 <@EastByte> oh
17:06 <@heinrich5991> it's "if vanilla version <= 2, use old offsets"
17:06 <@EastByte> okay
17:30 <@deen> right, makes sense
19:14 < Nimda> HellCore by MaDLeX just released on Brutal at 2015-06-27 19:07
20:50 <@deen> nice, mpv can play 4k videos on my old system now

21:03 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/vt0Ex
21:03 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 c6d90c6 def: Add Catalan translation (by Ryozuki)
21:03 <@deen> see, now everyone is working on translations only
21:03 <@deen> better not to have them at all^^
21:03 < laxa> deen: you said to me once that you didn't liked that :)
21:03 <@deen> Saavik is working on improving Polish translation, hi_leute improving the German one
21:03 <@deen> they could be testing maps instead...
21:04 <@deen> it's better for players to learn a bit of english anyway
21:04 <@EastByte> ^
21:04 < laxa> Yay, but well, not everyone is like you :)
21:04 <@deen> nah, they're just used to everything being translated i guess
21:04 <@deen> i used to play games in english as a kid and never understood a word
21:04 < laxa> only developpers are like that I think
21:05 <@deen> just tried stuff out until i knew what happens
21:06 <@EastByte> nah online gamers often have pretty good english knowledge aswell
21:07 <@EastByte> e.g. gamers who always want to be at the front (testing out new games in alpha/beta)
21:08 <@EastByte> or international leagues
21:11 <@EastByte> meh, it's getting hot next weak
21:11 <@EastByte> bad sign
21:11 <@deen> bad sign?
21:12 <@EastByte> it's just too warm in my room
21:12 <@EastByte> so I need a reason to go outside
21:15 <@deen> doesn't sound that bad :P
21:18 <@EastByte> maybe I should go on vacation
21:18 <@EastByte> again
21:18 < Learath2> EastByte: just take a walk for no reason
21:19 <@deen> yeah, like a 5 hour walk, they're fun
21:19 <@EastByte> I usually do
21:19 <@EastByte> can't waste enough time with that
21:19 <@EastByte> well 5 hours, yea
21:19 < Learath2> 5 hour ??? that would most certainly kill me 
21:19 <@deen> Learath2: I love walking and bicycling for long times^^
21:19 < Learath2> cycling maybe
21:33 <@heinrich5991> NooBxGockeL: hey! would you mind zipping your downloadedmaps folder and uploading it to some file host (e.g. https://solidfiles.com/)? I'm asking because I'm creating a map collection and need as many maps as possible :)
21:34 < NooBxGockeL> heinrich5991, ill try, i have shitty upload tho, lemme see how big ^^
21:35 < Savander> what kind of map ?
21:35 <@heinrich5991> Savander: teeworlds maps
21:35 < Savander> all?
21:35 < Savander> i had somewhere 1k+ maps
21:36 <@deen> heinrich5991: you shouldn't ask ddnet testers for the maps, they'll have 100 versions of the same map^^
21:36 <@heinrich5991> it would be nice if you could upload these (and maybe also your downloadedmaps folder)
21:36 < Savander> if I find, I can give you
21:36 < NooBxGockeL> 376 MB 1,1 k maps :D
21:36 < Savander> it was map
21:36 < Savander> from 2010 ~
21:36 < Savander> or smoething like that
21:36 <@heinrich5991> deen: the good thing is that you keep a repo with the official versions
21:37 < Savander> for steam?
21:37 < Savander>  ^^?
21:37 < NooBxGockeL> deen, im no tester ^^
21:37 <@heinrich5991> so if I get around to publish it one day, then I can mark the official maps
21:37 <@heinrich5991> Savander: no, it's a different project
21:37 < Savander> okay! :D
21:37 <@heinrich5991> namely, archiving all tw maps :)
21:37 < Savander> automatically or?
21:37 <@deen> heinrich5991: yep, so you can even track when maps were fixed. i hope github won't complain about us hosting binary files
21:38 < NooBxGockeL> it'll take a while heinrich5991 but im away now anyway, ill pm you later again
21:38 <@heinrich5991> NooBxGockeL: thanks!
21:38 <@heinrich5991> Savander: dunno what you mean with automatic
21:38 <@heinrich5991> I'm manually asking people for their maps
21:39 <@deen> heinrich5991: thought of modifying a client to connect to all empty severs and vote through all available maps?
21:39 <@heinrich5991> yea
21:39 <@heinrich5991> I think I have a partial one of that lying around
21:39 <@deen> but i guess many maps get lost to time
21:39 <@heinrich5991> but I stopped doing it when I saw ddnet :D
21:39 <@deen> which is why we're doing ddnet ddmax
21:39 <@deen> becuase otherwise no one is hosting the old ddmax maps
21:39 < Savander> client (bot)
21:40 < Savander> connecting to servers and downloading a mps
21:40 < Savander> maps
21:40 < Savander> if no exists
21:40 < Savander> :P ^..
21:40 <@heinrich5991> because I would have to figure out some clever voting scheme for ddnet
21:40 <@heinrich5991> because there are votes that change the vote list
21:41 <@heinrich5991> Savander: so, do you have some maps lying around? :)
21:41 <@deen> oh right^^
21:41 < NooBxGockeL> regex checking ? heinrich5991, hardcode the server modes or sth
21:42 < Savander> yes
21:42 < Savander> but i can't found old downloadmaps folder
21:42 < Savander> probably i don't have. .!;/
21:42 < Savander> 1500 maps
21:43 < Savander> where you want?
21:43 <@heinrich5991> upload it to e.g. solidfiles.com
21:43 < Savander> okay
21:43 <@heinrich5991> and give me the link afterwards ^^
21:49 < Savander> sent on pm
21:53 <@heinrich5991> thanks! downloading
21:53 < Lady> GreYFoX
22:01 < Savander> it's website project heinrich5991 ?^^ I'm curious!
22:01 <@heinrich5991> the goal is to create a web interface for these maps one day, but I'm not sure what you mean with "website project" :)
22:02 < Savander> just website with downloads/manage (?) for those maps
22:03 <@heinrich5991> yes, just a website for viewing, downloading and uploading these maps
22:03 <@heinrich5991> but that's just plans... nothing has been done in that direction
22:03 < Savander> :)
22:04 <@heinrich5991> your upload seems to be better than my download :D
22:04 <@heinrich5991> still not finished downloading
22:04 < Savander> haha
22:04 < Savander> 30/30
22:04 < Savander> symetric network
22:04 <@heinrich5991> heh nice!
22:05 < Savander> and its cheap!
22:05 < Savander> maybe 15€ 
22:05 <@heinrich5991> are these maps your downloadedmaps or your own archived maps btw?
22:05 < Savander> per month
22:05 <@heinrich5991> ah
22:05 <@heinrich5991> that's nice
22:05 < Savander> downloadedmaps
22:05 <@heinrich5991> ok
22:05 < Savander> i can't found
22:05 < Savander> my own archived maps
22:05 < Savander> i had somewhere
22:05 < Savander> but i can't found :(
22:06 < Savander> i had script also 
22:06 <@heinrich5991> what did the script do?
22:06 < Savander> for those maps :P, was on website
22:06 < Savander> downloads/tree
22:07 < Savander> and count of downloads
22:08 < Savander> uploads via ftp
22:09 < Savander> teeworlds.pl
22:10 < Savander> want to redirect something?
22:10 <@heinrich5991> redirect?
22:10 < Savander> to teeworlds.com
22:10 < Savander> like alias
22:11 <@heinrich5991> I know what redirect means, but still don't know what you want to say :|
22:14 < laxa> heinrich5991: I have 4153 maps
22:15 <@heinrich5991> laxa: could you upload them? would be very nice
22:15 < laxa> oldest map is from 06/08/2010
22:15 < laxa> which format ?
22:15 <@heinrich5991> any format. in doubt, use the format that compresses better :)
22:16 < laxa> wtf
22:16 < laxa> teeworlds folder is 8 GB ;D
22:18 < Lady> heinrich5991 you want maps?
22:18 <@deen> laxa: autorecord on probably?
22:18 <@heinrich5991> Lady: yes! could you upload your downloadedmaps folder? (or any map collection you have?)
22:18 < laxa> deen: I like to keep everything, auto screenshot, auto demos etc...
22:18 < Lady> heinrich5991 you should definitely ask Broken
22:18 < laxa> 1 GB maps
22:19 <@deen> laxa: well, i don't have that much space, i remove everything every few months
22:19 < laxa> I have 2 TB or smt
22:19 <@deen> still grew to 3 GB again
22:19 < Lady> heinrich5991 he had every map I was asking for :P
22:19 < laxa> and I don't download that much movies
22:19 <@deen> laxa: 110 GB SSD is all i have^^
22:19 < laxa> lol
22:20 <@heinrich5991> Lady: thanks for the tip â€“ but apparantly someone else has already given me that tip too, already got Broken's maps :)
22:20 < laxa> 110 GB is my ssd for my system :p
22:20 < laxa> heinrich5991: if you need some hosting for the maps, I can provide one
22:20 < Lady> oh :(
22:21 < laxa> Beh, teeworlds maps don't compress very well :p
22:21 < laxa> I'll try to think about uploading them tonight
22:23 < Lady> heinrich5991 I have 3485 maps in my folder, it starts with 2009-12-02
22:23 <@heinrich5991> wow :D
22:23 <@heinrich5991> that is about the time I started playing IIRC
22:23 <@heinrich5991> ^^
22:24 < Lady> do you want that? how should i upload and send you heinrich5991?
22:25 <@heinrich5991> Lady: could you upload the maps to a site like https://solidfiles.com/ and give me the link?
22:25 <@heinrich5991> (of course zip them first)
22:25 <@heinrich5991> (or whatever archive format you want)
22:25 < Lady> I hope there's nothing embarrassing ^^
22:26 <@deen> Lady: they will all be put online for everyone to see forever
22:26 < Lady> :( ok I have to make clean up
22:26 <@deen> haah
22:26 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: why exactly are you collecting private mapfolders?
22:26 < Learath2> he is making an archive
22:26 < Lady> the biggest one is 3 617 KB :o
22:26 < Learath2> of maps
22:26 < Lady> heinrich5991 I used your collection many times
22:27 <@EastByte> maybe Lady has some private embedded images in one of the maps
22:27 <@heinrich5991> ah, nice to hear that it has users
22:27 <@heinrich5991> mh. private embedded images = unpublished tilesets?
22:27 < Lady> yes heinrich5991, always opened in my tab!
22:27 < Learath2> EastByte: thats where i hide my porn
22:27 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: yep
22:28 < Lady> ye, there are for sure my not release dmaps and stuff :P
22:28 < Lady> heinrich5991 but what if a map has 3850852 versions
22:29 <@heinrich5991> that shouldn't be the problem
22:31 <@heinrich5991> Lady: e.g. for ddnet or ddmax we have the official versions, so it doesn't hurt if there are more
22:31 < Lady> they all will be put online?
22:32 <@heinrich5991> that's the plan (?)
22:33 < Lady> but if I need one map, I have to download all versions and search the right one?
22:33 <@heinrich5991> currently yes :<
22:34 <@heinrich5991> that's a pretty big limitation right now
22:34 < Lady> there is a map iDEEN
22:34 < Savander> heinrich5991,  maybe
22:34 < Lady> ye, that's so bad that I can just change name skynet -> Skynet and I have to download it
22:34 < Savander> you sould upload just
22:35 < Savander> latest modified verison?
22:35 < Savander> version?
22:35 < Savander> you'll have
22:35 < Savander> mtime 
22:35 < Savander> or smth :p
22:35 < Lady> Savander but there could be many remakes and it can be just wrong map
22:35 < Savander> remakes?
22:35 < Savander> with same name?
22:36 < Lady> I saw 73509 versions of skynets :D
22:36 < Lady> and if I need the old one? with generic stones and brown background?
22:36 < Savander> last version +
22:36 < Lady> and not this new, colorful?
22:36 < Savander> get size of files
22:36 < Savander> it'll resize amount of maps
22:37 < Lady> Savander mapper redesigned these maps 2 times, so there are 3 'official' versions, I should be able to download all of them
22:37 < Lady> where is GreYFoX? I'm trying to say hi since a few days :c
22:38 < Savander> <Lady> and not this new, colorful?
22:38 < Savander> <Savander> get size of files
22:38 < Savander> <Savander> it'll resize amount of maps
22:39 < Lady> deen can we add LongCat map?!
22:40 <@deen> Lady: add where?
22:40 < Lady> ddnet, release
22:40 <@deen> Lady: is it in the ddmax releases or what?
22:41 < Lady> no
22:41 <@deen> so it's a new map or an old one?
22:41 < Lady> old old
22:41 <@deen> i guess? I don't know if it's any good or if we want a discussion beforehand
22:42 <@heinrich5991> I played that map once
22:42 <@heinrich5991> I think it was on ddmax?
22:42 < Lady> heinrich5991 and you will have for sur many not finished maps, because people were testing them
22:42 < Lady> no, never
22:42 <@heinrich5991> Lady: yes, there will be unfinished maps
22:43 <@heinrich5991> but I'd rather not miss any *finished* maps
22:43 <@heinrich5991> and I htink I'd do that if I were more selective
22:44 < Savander> you'll do preview?
22:44 < Savander> (EastByte tw map viewer)
22:44 <@heinrich5991> yea
22:44 < Savander> hmm 
22:44 <@heinrich5991> a diff viewer would be nice as well :P
22:44 <@deen> yep
22:44 <@EastByte> yea...
22:44 < Savander> xD
22:45 < Savander> preview of maps, 20 per page
22:45 <@heinrich5991> well. before I do any of that website stuff, I first have to finish my map library
22:45 < Savander> one screenshot (small sizes)
22:45 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: map lib?
22:45 <@deen> heinrich5991: not sure. i think if you make the website many more people will send you maps
22:46 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: yes. library for reading maps
22:46 <@EastByte> neat
22:46 <@deen> oh
22:46 <@heinrich5991> deen: but currently I could barely display anything on that website
22:46 <@deen> like tml?
22:46 <@heinrich5991> like tml
22:46 <@EastByte> in rust?
22:46 <@deen> i use that to extract information for ddnet website
22:46 <@deen> takes forever for big maps^^
22:46 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: yes, in rust. sorry :/
22:47 <@EastByte> I knew it :D
22:47 <@EastByte> that's perfectly fine
22:47 <@heinrich5991> deen: what exactly do you extract?
22:48 <@heinrich5991> my lib might already be advanced enough to do it :P
22:48 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: here I just made a nice map uploading panel for you: http://eastbit.net/priv/upload/index.html
22:49 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: can you extend it so it automatically filters out known maps on the client-side?
22:49 <@EastByte> whaat?
22:49 <@heinrich5991> I can give you a list of map names
22:50 <@heinrich5991> that don't need to be uploaded
22:50 <@heinrich5991> (if that's possible to do client-side)
22:50 <@EastByte> well the thing is people would need to upload archived anyway
22:50 <@EastByte> archives*
22:51 <@heinrich5991> oh ok
22:51 <@heinrich5991> misinterpreted that
22:51 <@deen> rust libs are fine, they can be used in nim :P
22:51 <@EastByte> ^
22:52 < eeeee> we should hack some simple image fingerprinting codez to cluster the maps (by looking at layers as images)
22:52 < eeeee> and then diff maps highliting the differences in webgl viewer
22:52 <@deen> heinrich5991: https://github.com/def-/tml/blob/master/properties.py
22:52 <@deen> heinrich5991: map size and whether some tiles are present
22:53 <@heinrich5991> I can do that already \o/
22:53 <@EastByte> pff
22:53 <@heinrich5991> although not for the front layer probably
22:53 <@deen> oh yeah, other layers are also not working with my edited version of TML
22:54 <@heinrich5991> have you hacked on tml to allow front layer?
22:54 <@deen> the hack is in properties.py^^: https://github.com/def-/tml/blob/master/properties.py#L139-L145
22:54 <@heinrich5991> ah yea
22:54 <@deen> ah, but also in tml: https://github.com/def-/tml/commit/d5f36e30e47adab52aa430518ad98a2ec95f121d
22:55 <@heinrich5991> you determine the front layer by the name :D
22:59 < Lady> deen?
22:59 < Lady> I have to have an account to open issues? on github
22:59 < Lady> I mean create new
22:59 < laxa> I think so
23:00 < Lady> heinrich5991 I have the .zip, how to send?
23:01 <@heinrich5991> Lady: upload it to a file sharing website like https://solidfiles.com/
23:01 <@deen> Lady: yes
23:01 < Lady> Sorry, but you've exceeded the maximum file size.
23:01 <@heinrich5991> ok
23:02 <@heinrich5991> nice :D
23:02 < laxa> well
23:02 < laxa> welllll
23:02 < Lady> xd
23:02 <@EastByte> try it here http://eastbit.net/priv/upload/index.html
23:02 < laxa> do you have winscp ?
23:02 < Lady> I will make 2 zips
23:02 <@heinrich5991> no
23:02 <@heinrich5991> do you have winscp?
23:02 <@heinrich5991> or upload to EastByte
23:02 <@heinrich5991> if he has enough free space
23:02 < Lady> what is winscp
23:02 < laxa> I can provide a remote shell for winscp right now
23:02 <@heinrich5991> ok
23:02 <@EastByte> /dev/sda2       439G   42G  375G  10% /home
23:03 <@heinrich5991> can you upload to eastbyte then?
23:03 < Lady> it's 563 KB
23:03 < Lady> yep
23:03 < laxa> MB you mean
23:03 <@heinrich5991> 563MB or GB?
23:03 < Lady> sorry MB
23:03 <@heinrich5991> ok
23:03 <@heinrich5991> then here: http://eastbit.net/priv/upload/index.html
23:03 <@EastByte> I can't guarantee that the transfer will stop in the middle or something :P
23:03 < Lady> it will take forever!
23:03 <@EastByte> it's some experimental websocket shit
23:04 < Lady> ok 2%
23:04 <@EastByte> 5 mbit/s incoming
23:06 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: did you think about making a new mapfile format?
23:06 < Savander> http://githut.info/
23:07 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: not really, I mostly thought about what incompatible mess the mods have created :D
23:07 < Lady> heinrich5991 you want all mods?
23:07 <@EastByte> would be nice to store tiles vectorized instead of tilebased
23:07 <@heinrich5991> Lady: yes
23:07 <@EastByte> mods are evil
23:13 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: what do you mean, vectorized?
23:14 <@EastByte> e.g. searching for areas of equal tiles and building a 2d vector model out of it
23:16 <@heinrich5991> mh
23:16 <@heinrich5991> is that practical?
23:16 <@EastByte> well it reduces the mapsize
23:16 <@EastByte> ignoring images^^
23:17 < eeeee> teewebs stores map layers RLE-encoded in memory, kinda limited version of what you want
23:18 <@EastByte> huh? really?
23:18 <@EastByte> so you don't have plain 2d tile arrays in mem?
23:18 < eeeee> yes, because otherwise it OOMs on maps with lotsa layers
23:19 < eeeee> yep. 2d array is only for collision layer, because you need fast lookup
23:19 <@heinrich5991> what does RLE encoded mean?
23:19 < eeeee> encoded with run length encoding :P
23:19 <@EastByte> but what about the rendering engine
23:19 <@EastByte> it also needs fast lookup
23:19 <@heinrich5991> you mean like 100 times collision
23:19 <@heinrich5991> and then 10 times nothing
23:19 <@heinrich5991> and then 100 times collision?
23:19 <@heinrich5991> like this?
23:20 < eeeee> no, i mean the game layer is stored as plain array
23:20 <@heinrich5991> yea, but for the other layers
23:20 <@heinrich5991> (like this? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1156)
23:20 <@deen> eeeee: i still want a patch to have that in regular ddnet. it would work, wouldn't it?
23:20 < eeeee> other layers are encoded like [10 x empty, 5 x tile A, 7 x empty, 10 x tile B, ...]
23:21 < Lady> EastByte 100%, is it uploaded?
23:21 <@EastByte> Lady: seems like
23:21 <@heinrich5991> why would you want it in ddnet, deen?
23:21 <@heinrich5991> lower memory usage?
23:21 <@deen> heinrich5991: the main limitation for my servers is memory usage, yes
23:21 < eeeee> i believe it won't be useful on server
23:22 <@deen> oh well
23:22 < eeeee> because server only ever does collision
23:22 < eeeee> server doesn't even have to load all the fancy gfx layers
23:22 <@deen> for client the use is a bit limited, they usually have more memory, only few people complain about memory usage of ddnet client
23:22 < eeeee> yep that's why i didnt pullreq it :P
23:22 <@deen> ok^^
23:23 <@deen> then the skins thing!
23:23 <@deen> on demand skin loading *
23:23 <@EastByte> Lady: http://eastbit.net/priv/downloadedmaps_LS.zip
23:23 < Lady> yep, that's me!
23:23 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: there is the link
23:23 < eeeee> browsers however are seldom happy with js scripts using 80mb of memory, so have to use it there
23:24 <@heinrich5991> thanks Lady, downloading it now
23:24 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: thanks for providing the space
23:24 <@EastByte> eeeee: prepare for webassembly :)
23:24 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: no problem
23:24 < eeeee> prepare how
23:24 < eeeee> have heard it's just rebraded asm.js
23:24 <@EastByte> yes, probably nothing to do
23:24 <@heinrich5991> plus new encoding
23:25 < eeeee> which i dont have to care about because emscripten probably already supports it
23:29 < eeeee> heinrich5991: heres my memory patch if you're interested https://github.com/eeeee/ddnet/commit/a1e656070bced6acd23124cd868daaa5bed2837a
23:32 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: thanks
23:45 < Learath2> the only thing that annoys me in nim so far is the fact that semicolons arent needed
23:46 < Learath2> literally keep putting them everywhere
23:49 <@deen> not needed but don't hurt, do they?
23:53 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: just like in python :)
