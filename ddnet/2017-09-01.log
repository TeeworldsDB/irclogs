00:00 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> @heinrich5991 tests run fine under Ubuntu for me, except I enable websockets in which case make all works fine but make run_tests does not link and rather complains about missing websockets symbols
00:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> django == python ?
00:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> deen
00:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> No idea why, but after update ddnet don't want to start
00:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i'll try to debug it
00:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Soreu> mine was just blocked by Avast antyvirus xd
00:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I have fresh windows installation
00:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
00:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but DDNet 1.8.1
00:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 10.8.1 worked
00:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 10.8.2 not
00:15 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> @Savander django is a webframework for and written in python
00:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> deen: first of all http://www.wasz.ovh/img/NjxjldOa80513
00:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you forget to register commands ?
02:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/834 should be reopened?
07:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Ravie> Hello technical support? I updated DDNet and now this happends ._.
07:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/353044631497474069/unknown.png
08:19 <@deen> @Ravie should be fixed in 10.8.3, sorry
11:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> After reinstalling my system, I was expecting no problem with connection. Maybe you can remember, that my connection was established after few minutes, not how it should in few seconds. In safe mode, it works perfectly, but with full loaded system nope. I still don't know what causes this problem, but I'm sure this is a problem directly from windows.
11:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :/
13:37 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/v5BkR
13:37 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master ed59b0f Dennis Felsing: Fix binary dirs for installed locations on POSIX...
14:03 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: are you going to fix install and package sometime?
14:04 <+Learath2> (that sounded a little too passive agressive)
14:09 <@deen> yeah, would be great to have them
14:09 <@deen> since I had to fix bam stuff again for release
14:10 <@deen> I'm very happy when we don't have to maintain 2 build systems anymore
14:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> hey
14:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> wait
14:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> nvm
14:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> sry
15:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> hey
15:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> @Savander @Ryozuki can i use puttygen to generate keys private and public?
16:02 <+Learath2> @Ezy sure
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> <nub> bugged offset for linebreak in chat is only with this heart enabled, @deen  So I guess this is causing the issue.
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> @Learath2 ok but i dont unsterstand how this will secure my server more
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Doest make any sence to me
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Doesnt
16:35 <+Learath2> @Ezy a pub-priv keypair is like a VERY long password and to verify the password the server doesn't need to know it
16:36 <+Learath2> so the VERY long password never leaves your computer, and it's much longer then any password you can memorize
16:36 <+Learath2> so it's more secure
16:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> But you can access the server through other pcs
16:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ? ðŸ˜„
16:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> So the server is stored by the provider  and if you have account details u can modify the server
16:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> And the server doesnt run through my pc or anything
16:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> How does the key on only my pc help then
16:41 <@deen> disable passwords
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Server passwords?
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> And then u can only access the server through the key or what
16:44 <@deen> yes
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Hmm
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> im trying to compile ddnet on WSL
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> (windows submodule for linux)
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's actually Ubuntu in windows.. anyway)
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> But somehow,  ( in my opinion ). Compiler tries to take windows dlls, on linux environment
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
16:46 <@deen> yeah, because the build system recognizes that you're on windows
16:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but
16:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> cmake says
16:46 <@deen> so you have to force linux in the build system
16:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> linux 64bit
16:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> arget OS: linux 64bit
16:47 <@deen> use higher verbosity
16:47 <@deen> good luck debugging
16:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> good, i can compie server
16:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> enough for me
16:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i couldn't run DDnet at all
17:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> ok so ive done the keygen but how do i set the server up so that it has to take the key in order to continue or however it works
17:36 <+Learath2> copy your public key in puttygen, paste it in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server
17:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> inside that file
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> y but how with putty
18:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i will record movie for you
18:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Xd
18:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> xD
18:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> do it
18:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> for real xD
18:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/353213971785973760/Video_01-09-2017_18-24-59.mp4
18:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Xd
18:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> this is ppk file
18:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> XD
19:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> works?
19:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Dunno xD
19:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Ima do it tommorow
19:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> So once ive configured the keys
19:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Will i have to do something with them after ive configured them?
19:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no
21:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> somebody any idea why ddnet client crashes after closing obs?
21:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> obs ?
21:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Open Broadcast ?
21:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> Open Broadcaster Software
21:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> yes
21:20 <+eeeee> Ram: please create an issue at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues with as many details as possible (link to obs, which version of obs, version of windows, version of ddnet, does it happen every time or sometimes, etc..)
21:20 <+eeeee> someone might take a look then
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Ram it's with latest version?
21:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> its OBS Studio
21:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or Classic?
21:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> Studio
21:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> im not sure if its a ddnet bug <eeeee>
21:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> could be due to the gamehook from obs
21:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it could be related to opengl
21:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> using directx11
21:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> no opengl support here q_q
21:24 <+eeeee> if it works fine with other games, there could be a way to fix it for ddnet
21:24 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> same problem in vanilla teeworlds?
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> <eeeee> im too poor to test it with other games
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> im gonna test it
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I*
21:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> also crashing
21:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> just tested
21:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> so no issue deleted to ddnet
21:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but could be related to teeworlds code
21:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Anyway, tell me what you did ?
21:27 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> then test another open source game, like hedgewars
21:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> friend of mine just told me that it doesnt crashes for him
21:28 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> ok, then it might depend on your graphics driver
21:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> not really
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it crashes for me as well
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> gpu driver are up to date
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> but since its a 7 year old gpu idk
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://pastebin.com/rdcbMFzj
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> also have a 3 year old apu here also crashes
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i didn't even had to close obs
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> just minimized
21:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> lol
21:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Could i do anything more deen?
21:32 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> yes, read the source code and try to understand what's going on. use the debugger to inspect the values and why it's going wrong
21:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> actually im not c programmer
21:32 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> and if you want/need to debug SDL, then build a debug version of sdl and use that dll
21:33 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> it seems to be the swap command
21:34 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> you could try gfx_asyncrender_old 0
21:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> still crashes
21:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> same results
21:36 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> and other games, savander?
21:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> works
21:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i used obs
21:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> very often
21:36 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> So why does SDL_GL_SwapWindow crash for us but not for others?
21:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> oh, you talking about sdl games. Then i don't know which one
21:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> uses it
21:37 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> hedgewars, linked above
21:37 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> or i forgot to link maybe
21:37 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_using_SDL
21:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> SuperTux!
21:38 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> I assume it is might be because of threaded graphics rendering
21:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> this ^
21:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i will try hedgewars
21:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but it seems to be a long  journey
21:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> very slow download server
21:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> deactivated texture compression
21:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> works
21:40 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> interesting
21:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> ah nvm
21:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> it depends on how long i had tw open
21:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Curious. ..
21:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> still crashes
21:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> savander whats your gpu?
21:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> radeon hd7950
21:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yours ?
21:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Baaam, that GPu has problems
21:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> radeon hd6870
21:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> okay, it could be radeon specific
21:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> seems like those babys are too old
21:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> my friend has a 920 m and it works flawless
21:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i don't think so
21:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i had update
21:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> a 2 months ago
21:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> but guess still radeon specifc
21:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> my laptop has a radeon gpu aswell, also crashes
21:44 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> Well yeah, it crashes inside the ati driver
21:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> sad
21:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> atioglxx.dll
21:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> D:
21:45 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> oh, and there is a hook by obs in there
21:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yes, thats why we are talking about Obs ðŸ˜®
21:46 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> (in the backtrace)
21:46 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> i just looked at the ddnet source code stuff
21:46 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> well, make a bug at OBS
21:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> taht Hedgwars
21:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> is on SDL yes?
21:46 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> yes, but maybe not opengl
21:47 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> few people use opengl on windows as it's known to perform worse
21:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> OK
21:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> its SDL related
21:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> that game crashed as well
21:49 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> i think opengl related
21:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> yeah
21:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or, i don't know ðŸ˜ƒ
21:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so we had to report it on OBS
21:49 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> yeah, anyway, not ddnet related, good!
21:50 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> either sdl2, amd's implementation of opengl or OBS
21:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> hmm
21:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i can try another software
21:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> i guess its caused by the hook
21:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> so obs related
