00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> üëå
05:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can evolution please evolve humans a syslog or a debugging port?
05:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why do I get spurious wakeups?
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know if its true, but sometimes ur heart rate goes rly slow when sleeping and ur brain sends like  a shock and it wakes u up
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It's normal to wake up at night, but usually you just fall asleep again and don't even remember the next morning.
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Last week or so I've been waking up at 4-5am and being completely awake. So odd
09:47 <+ChillerDragon> Could anyone explain why my screen is making loud noise? And why does it stop when i have the scoreboard open? :D Its a non tw issue its just my screen making different noise depending on what i do or what is displayed.
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, that's odd. You sure it's the screen? I get the same issue but in my sound output
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Depending on what's displayed I get a different whine
09:49 <+ChillerDragon> Oh yea could be 
09:49 <+ChillerDragon> i assumed its the screen
09:50 <+ChillerDragon> But shouldnt chaning volume then affect it?
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not really
09:50 <+ChillerDragon> hmk
09:50 <+ChillerDragon> its a feature i guess
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well if you are using a speaker or an amp, changing volume should affect it
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> tbh idk where my sound comes from :D
09:52 <+ChillerDragon> im used to the noise i was just wondering if its common
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> coil whine is common, especially in gpus and other high-power devices
09:52 <+ChillerDragon> oh k
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> and it gets heavily affected by suddle changes as rendering a scoreboard?
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and electrical noise affecting audio output is also common with onboard audio if they don't isolate it well
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> its impressive
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's heavily affected by the power load of your GPU
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> hm
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> So i guess the GPU has to work more when the scoreboard is rendered
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> our text rendering probably needs much more power üòÑ
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> bot not every GPU has those problem, my current RTX doesn't have it, old GTX 1080 has really noticeable noise
09:54 <+ChillerDragon> ye im rocking a 980 :D
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> either your GTX 980 manufacturer used cheap coils or coils in it weared out by time
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but you can locate source of whine, it's rather easy
09:55 <+ChillerDragon> i see funny bunny ty you informed pros for the informative response :)
09:55 <+ChillerDragon> nah im fine with a bit of whine
09:55 <+ChillerDragon> imagine not hearing when scoreboard is open its like playing without sound
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> so it's like comfortable background noise for you?
09:56 <+ChillerDragon> i guess sometimes more sometimes less
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> by the way all modern phone systems are adding small background noise to get the feel of presence
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Is there a DDNet-Advent of Code Leaderboard?
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Would be kinda nice :0
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and it's called like that: comfortable noise
09:57 <+ChillerDragon> lol
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @stnwtr for the normal advent of code or should we have our own ddnet-specific tasks? üòÑ
09:57 <+ChillerDragon> oh
09:57 <+ChillerDragon> that would be nice
09:57 <+ChillerDragon> go build something deen
09:58 <+ChillerDragon> solve issue xy lol
09:58 <+ChillerDragon> such christmas
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> For the normal I would say, however .. something ddnet specific sounds nice as well üòÆ
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> For the normal I would say, however .. something ddnet specific sounds nice as well :0
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, nothing planned. i didn't even know advent of code still exists
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> However, 1. you would have to build something on your own, 2. which languages would you allow? only cpp because ddnet dependencies? In this case you could motivate more people to get more familiar with ddnet source
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> > no, nothing planned. i didn't even know advent of code still exists
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> ||it does||
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> I think it would be funny üòÑ
10:01 <+ChillerDragon> go u build it then :p
10:01 <+ChillerDragon> i can sponsor you and give you 1k money on BlmapChill and 10 multis on onbgy fng as donation
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Can I get the 1k by only creating a AoC Leaderboard as well? :>
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1k money for what
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> digital
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :nouis:
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> > 1k money on BlmapChill
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> For a ddnet-specific AoC
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> blmapchill
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> :justatest:
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> yo Ac1dBeef u here?
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> @becc 1k is nothing xd sure do what ever u want and ill give u 1k
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> im pro trader
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> 1.1 !

17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> Thats the health of ddnet code?:justatest:
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> couldn't find a way to exclude the external directory though
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> How does the Masterserver thing work?
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> There are 4 default master servers `masterN.teeworlds.com`
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> So, if I create a server it asks all of them for serverlist?
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> And if I create a server it registers (if enabled in config) to a random one of them?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ‚ÄúPrimitive obsession: A high degree of the functions (44 %) have primitive types as arguments, which hints at a missing domain language.‚Äù So ideological
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think primitives are great
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ddnet coders are trolls
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This kind of ideological code analysis is so silly. It‚Äôs ‚Äúmodern‚Äù programmers flexing on their seniors
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only interesting metric I find there is ‚Äúcomplexity‚Äù
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @stnwtr your server registers with a random one, client requests all
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Primitive obsession lmao
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> üå∂Ô∏è
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Okay, thanks!
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> So, I should be able to force my server to register to a special one?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> (If I change something in the Code somewhere? xd)
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> + What will happen if I let it connect to more than 1?
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> > So, I should be able to force my server to register to a special one?
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> > + What will happen if I let it connect to more than 1?
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> probably nothing noticeable?
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> so the clientside serverlist is basically a set which does not allow duplicated entries?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fluday> i have a question, when you save a map while you're holding a tile
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fluday> when you reload, will it hold or release the hook ?
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fluday> or is it supposed to hold ?
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if the server reloads the map, you'll start hooking again I think
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fluday> because i failed a 2h54 run due to this
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fluday> Chairn thought it would hold
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fluday> but it didn't
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fluday> and i didn't have enough time to react sadly
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ^ small misunderstand i think, you should differentiate between `reload` and `/save` into `/load`
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fluday> okey so we tried on another map
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fluday> it doesn't hold 100%
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fluday> we will retry to be 100% sure
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, do you mean /load /a
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, do you mean /load /save?
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fluday> yep
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you need to start hooking before typing /load to not drop the hook immediately after loading
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. hold right mouse button. press chat button. release right mouse button (hook will stay because you're in chat). type /load savecode
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fluday> okey that's sad then
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fluday> didn't know that
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fluday> i thought it would hold without pressing a key
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fluday> 2h54 lost i guess
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> rip
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fluday> feelsbadman :/

20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> can someone help
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i copied DDNet-Server into ddnet-maps and ran it and this comes up
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Dont copy DDNet-Server into ddnet-maps
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> got it
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yea i had to clone the maps into the already existing
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <üñ§Smetanolubüíé> omg.
