04:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> tiny bug in changelog
04:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/939727273374941184/unknown.png
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Oh cool a macOS installer I always missed that \:) who made it?
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ehm, maybe calling it an installer is too much. It's just a background image when you open the dmg and then you drag the files into applications. But most applications on macOS didn't use a real installer, but this approach instead
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://master2.ddnet.tw/ddnet/15/servers.json
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> An error occurred during a connection to master2.ddnet.tw. Peerâ€™s Certificate has been revoked.
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Error code: SEC_ERROR_REVOKED_CERTIFICATE
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's a revoked let's encrypt certificate
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know which server it's on. can you help me, @deen?
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie aren't you running master2 ^?
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (we have bad monitoring btw ^^)
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I should try setting some up
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think I have any control of that, just know we have master1
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We should probably do some more monitoring for the other ddnet stuff too
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I noticed they cut off my crontab emails, not sure why
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> Ye thatst mine
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> I forgot let's encrypt is a thing
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> Was it supposed to be revoked this month?
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they revoked certificates somewhen, you probably got hit by that
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, revocation, not expiry
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> I know
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> Heard that
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they revoked certificates because they were valid for 90days + 1 second instead of 90 days IIRC ðŸ˜„
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> :justatest:
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> I dont actually know how to force caddy to renew cert
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> Let me google a bit
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> delete the cert, restart caddy
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should workâ„¢
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sigh
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do you do monitoring at work?
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I've seen people use prometheus and grafana for fancy graphs and also alerts
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I have no experience with either
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm running a simple https://healthchecks.io/ installation at home for my cronjobs
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> email notifications actually ðŸ˜„
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so not too far off from what I like personally. Maybe I should check why my emails are getting blocked
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what powers these emails? failed cronjobs? something else?
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but at my old job lots of prometheus + grafana, but I heard it's pretty heavy-weight
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Some python that sends smtp mails for example, run on certain jobs/times by jenkins
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> done
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> i think
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> lgtm
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ig depends of what you want to monitor, us we use checkmk
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> and grafana+prometheus too seems like
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the web where i read manga is rly open about its inner workings, a good blog post (where mention a lot of monitoring): https://mangadex.dev/mangadex-v5-infrastructure-overview/
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> @deen in FNG you could spawn over an enemy, if he is on the other team spawn point
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> fng doesn't use our source code, does it?
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if it does, then I was not aware, and can fix that
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Very interesting read
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> indeed
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it wasnt posted in hn because some ppl there think its borderly ilegal etc xd
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It probably is in some way illegal :D
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but the reality is that if it wasnt for this scanlation groups most mangas would be lost
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does it host mangas?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mangadex actually removes serialized mangas from the website
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it just happens that most mangas dont get serialized xd
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and for that reason they never see oficial english translations
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats where fansubs come
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so it hosts mangas, but it removes those that get their own series?
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 it removes the ones that get serialzied, aka the ones that get a publisher
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if they remove it immediately or on demand by the publish tho
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its all in the website the process
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if actually existed a website like crunchyroll but with the amoutn of mangas mangadex has i would pay for it
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its nonexistant
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they only have normie mangas
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the interesting ones are hidden gems
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they have 99% less cost than a naive aws estimate ^^
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's a lot ðŸ˜„
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye its impressive
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they also have some kind of decentralized image serving
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> called mangadex@home
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u share ur bandwidth
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they serve no ads and make no profit at all
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like the good guys ðŸ˜‰
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like lichess
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also scanlation groups go there themselves to put their translations
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> instead of the shady websites that steal from them
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as far as I can tell, they also "steal" according to this definition, but they're not shady at least ^^
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean steal from the scanlation groups
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since most groups publish to their own website, so they can make a bit of money to buy the raws
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mangadex allows u to publish a episode with x delay
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so users first go to the scanlators website and after x days they can read it in mangadex
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well this is too #off-topic now
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Impressive how they can serve that many requests at that budget
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are lucky that their traffic is web so they can rely on things like load balancers and cheap ddos protection :D
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> ||i had no idea there are so many s*ill words omg||
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> ||i had no idea there are so many S*ILL words omg||
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> We had a dutch show like this on tv. Except you receive the first letter of a 5 letter word. 2 guys figured out for each starting letter which 3 words to use to be sure what was the answer. Each word had a maximum of 5 guesses.
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> 
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> So they learned 26*3 words to beat the game. And a lot of words they used i didn't even know it existed xD
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should we maybe start shipping curl without schannel support? Whenever curl broke on windows it was because of schannel and that seems to be the issue for the person in #questions aswell
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> both chrome and firefox don't use schannel so when they visit the site on their browsers the error doesn't appear, but it does when they use internet explorer
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How could `schannel: failed to receive handshake, SSL/TLS connection failed` be the most verbose this stupid library can get without having to modify a registry key and restarting?
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> There is a similar board game. Sadly this is the best online version i could find: https://webgamesonline.com/mastermind/rules.php
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye but the viral one is wordle
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 we might get people with corporate proxies that fail due to custom certificates, if we don't use schannel
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 can ie display more interesting info?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/939938361374806016/unknown.png
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently translates to `"It is possible that the site uses outdated or unreliable TLS protocol security settings. If this happens again, contact the website owner."`
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cloudflare surely doesn't do any of thatâ€¦
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So I thought maybe his schannel settings were stuck with SSL3 for some reason
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But TLS 1.0 1.1 and 1.2 seem enabled and we support all those
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I wonder if he has a proxy set that he forgot
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah maybe that
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> would that apply to curl?
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think schannel uses ie settings
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and curl uses schannel
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though how is he connecting to master2 then? :/
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, schannel also manages the sockets?
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think so(tm). I'm not very familiar with it except for a debugfest 4 years back
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If only I could get this stupid thing to happen on my PC, it would be much easier for me to debug
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I don't quite get it but we are missing some debug output from curl somehow   `DEBUGF(infof(data, "schannel: sent initial handshake data: sent %zd bytes", written));` I never see this part
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 where is that source from? can't find it in curl or ddnet
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I found it in curl. `lib/vtls/schannel.c` though I did merge a two liner. Grep for `sent initial handshake`
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```c
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> /*
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>  * Macro used to include code only in debug builds.
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>  */
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> #ifdef DEBUGBUILD
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> #define DEBUGF(x) x
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> #else
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> #define DEBUGF(x) do { } while(0)
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> #endif
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we likely don't have the debug build
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could send a debug build of curl to that person ^^
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, that is a good idea
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen could you please build one? I doubt me compiling it with msvc would work
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for x86-64?
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though it'll spam stderr like there is no tomorrow, I'm not sure how I can demux the chatter when we do parallel requests :/
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what do I need to set?
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can count how often you see "sent initial handshake"
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> --enable-debug I guess
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> x86-64 windows is what it looks like, and yep --enable-debug is what it seems to be
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Ye actual installers are bloat! Idk how to call this thing but itâ€™s nice! So much better than an empty drive thingy with only the apps in.So you big on macOS now? When will we get native Mac rendering support in Vulcan hehe?
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@deen)
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No.
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/939944735672528916/libcurl.dll.zip
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> [chillerdragon](https://matrix.to/#/@chillerdragon:matrix.org)\: we already tried vulkan with moltenVK
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it works, but thats about it, macos is also weird, it doesnt allow building the window surface on a different thread and stuff like that(even tho it is not async)
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and for whatever reason on m1 it only reaches around 144 FPS
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on android vulkan works great btw \:D
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on windows it looks fine too, only tested a bit on
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gtx 760, gtx 1060 and my amd card
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Wait no it wasnâ€™t Vulkan I think Metal is the apple stuff right ?
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah moltenvk is the translation layer
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it can translate most of vulkan 1.1 to metal
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tho there are limitations and also some performance regressions, since vulkan is a bit more "low level"
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> btw @deen i made the surface creation single threaded now, maybe you can test if thats enough
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also i'd like to know what steps are required to find vulkan under macos, i added the pkg config in FindVulkan, but i dunno if i have to search for moltenVK instead or smth
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> [chillerdragon](https://matrix.to/#/@chillerdragon:matrix.org)\: why is ETextAlignment used like a flag? do you want left and right align at the same time or what xD
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also would be nicer if you could change the dolabel calls to only accept these enums
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> because you can have vertical and horizontal alignment at the same time, at least in vanilla
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/1ef3771bf641fe2d98ecba5596bb4dba5c2a9473/src/engine/textrender.h#L32-L50
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then make 2 parameters
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or a struct
