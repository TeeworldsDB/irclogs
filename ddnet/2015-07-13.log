00:27 < meow_> yo deen, u there?
00:27 <@deen> hi meow_ 
00:28 < meow_> since 1 week i got some really strange problems with ddnet client
00:28 < meow_> i cant connect to any server anymore
00:28 <@deen> have you tried using an older version of ddnet client or vanilla client?
00:29 < meow_> i've got the same problems with older ddnet client and recent vanilla client aswell
00:29 < meow_> every time the same
00:29 < meow_> http://puu.sh/iWSzG/ea3eb0faa9.png
00:30 <@deen> meow_: something seems to be really wrong with your router
00:30 < meow_> :/
00:31 <@deen> i tried pinging you from a few locations, and after a few seconds (10-60) the pings stop coming through
00:31 <@deen> never seen something like that before
00:32 < meow_> maybe because the os is not the recent on my fritzbox?
00:32 <@deen> maybe not your router, but something with your ISP, i don't know
00:32 <@deen> you could try updating the fritzbox and restarting it, yeah
00:33 < meow_> lets hope
00:33 <@deen> wow, this is so weird. you can only be pinged from one location at a time
00:34 <@deen> makes no sense, something strange going on
00:34 <@deen> does other stuff work well, like websites?
00:36 < KinG_> deen: i had same problem for 2 weeks and it got better by itself ^^
00:41 < KinG_> deen:  why ddnet rus goes on 100% cpu at once ad then come back to normal?
00:41 <@deen> all servers do that, they calculate new stats
00:41 <@deen> for the votes lists
00:41 < KinG_> oh
00:41 <@deen> RUS is the slowest because it has the least memory
00:41 <@deen> should be every 20 min
00:42 < KinG_> u should really think about upgrading website server's cpu it's always 96~100%
00:42 <@deen> and on Persian I don't do it, because it's connected to GER database, which would take too long
00:42 <@deen> that's no problem^^
00:43 <@deen> the server runs fine even if it's at 100% always
00:43 <@deen> people test on that server, it has totally stable ping
01:33 < KinG_> going to bed gn guys c ya later
01:33 < KinG_> bye deen <3
01:34 <@deen> good night KinG_ =)
02:39 <@deen> turns out they can still make players join the server from spoofed ips
02:39 <@deen> and are doing that right now on BLOCKER #2
03:19 < Sadale> deen, who're they? :o
04:20 <@deen> Sadale: don't want to name people. but his friend just followed me on DDNet USA and now we had 7 different ddos attacks in 5 min
04:21 < Sadale> wow
04:22 < Sadale> Thought that teeworlds was peaceful. Didn't know that ddos happen on tw servers
04:23 < Sadale> good luck on migrating the attack!
04:30 <@deen> peaceful? haha
04:30 <@deen> we get ddosed all day, since forever
04:31 <@deen> most projects in TW close because of too many attacks
04:31 <@deen> we also have trouble with attacks over 100 gbit/s
04:34 < Sadale> deen, wait what? :o
04:35 <@deen> some people rent botnets for money, some resale them in TW, others even have their own botnets
04:35 < Sadale> deen, Well, that's really a bad news for me. I've just launched my first 24/7 ctf teeworlds server :(
04:35 <@deen> oh^^
04:35 < Sadale> The attackers probably are not interested in ctf, tho :p
04:36 <@deen> what name does it have, where is it running?
04:36 <@deen> mainly the really popular servers get attacked
04:36 <@deen> and of course everything that tries to make money in TW
04:36 < Sadale> Well, I would rather have my server not being popular :p
04:37 < Sadale> Anyway, the server is mainly for testing purpose. I put it there to see whether my home server can handle a tw server, whether someone will attack it, etc.
04:37 < Sadale> deen, how they can make money from ddosing tw server? :o
04:37 < Sadale> Someone paid them for the attack? :o
04:37 <@deen> no, they don't make money from ddosing, they prevent others from making money
04:38 < Sadale> oh
04:38 < Sadale> WTF
04:38 <@deen> but yes, some do accept money for ddos attacks
04:38 < Sadale> That's stupid
04:39 < Sadale> deen, Anyway, I guess that ddnet earns almost no money :p
04:39 < Sadale> just like most other smaller scale opensource projects :p
04:39 <@deen> quite the opposite, ddnet costs me alot^^
04:39 <@deen> a lot*
04:40 < Sadale> lol. expected xD
04:40 < Sadale> cost time. cost money. cost everything :p
04:40 <@deen> lots of servers and ddos protection
04:40 < Sadale> There's indeed a donate button. But no one ever click it :p
04:40 <@deen> I actually made http://ddnet.tw/funding/ 2 weeks ago and since then some people are donating =)
04:41 < Sadale> deen, interesting. I thought that that page have been there for a long time
04:45 <@deen> anyway, good night
04:46 < Sadale> good night. It's morning here, tho :3
08:36 <@EastByte> deen: ddnet has no protection against ip spoofed sessions yet ;)
09:01 < eeeee> we have a prototype of protection, but it's not seamless (shows you a gray screen or dm1 briefly before sending the actual map)
09:01 < eeeee> waiting for spoofing to actually become an issue to move forward with that
09:08 <@EastByte> well with the dummy map you can just put a nice bluesky in the background :P
09:08 <@EastByte> but now I noticed another bug
09:09 <@EastByte> eeeee: do you know how to crosscompile ddnet 32bit?
09:44 <@EastByte> okay managed to do it

15:58 <@deen> laxadedi: i tried to reach you for a day or so about kicking someone with an insulting name from TS server
15:58 <@deen> so instead i just removed the TS server from status page and don't consider it official anymore
15:58 <@deen> then i don't have to worry about it :P
15:59 < laxadedi> As you want
15:59 < laxadedi> Since I have a gf, I am not on my PC that much anymore
16:00 < laxadedi> Well, I could give you admin rights, that's the only thing I could do to solve the issue you had.
16:01 <@deen> well, i don't to admin even more stuff^^
16:01 <@deen> and the TS server didn't look that popular anyway
16:02 <@deen> i only saw the same 4 people on it always

16:31 <@deen> ddnet.tw is now available on ipv6 as well
16:31 < Sadale> cool!
16:31 < Sadale> Too bad I got no ipv6 address :p
16:32 <@deen> also rus.ddnet.tw^^
16:32 <@deen> all our other servers are ipv4 only
16:33 < Sadale> Well, most part of the internet are ipv4 only :(
16:34 < Sadale> the unfortunate fact is that ipv4 address is exhausted :<
16:34 <@heinrich5991> the unfortunate fact is that ipv6 support is not more widespread :)
16:35 <@deen> heinrich5991: ipv6 is also problematic in TW
16:35 <@heinrich5991> yes
16:35 <@deen> you can't register a server with an ipv4 and ipv6 address
16:43 <@deen> and i don't know how the choice should even be made between ipv4 and ipv6
16:43 <@deen> maybe domains should just be transmitted instead of ips
16:48 <@heinrich5991> but then you have to do many many dns lookups
16:52 <@deen> yes =/

18:01 <@deen> Hi Blue_. You're the mapper Blue, right?: http://ddnet.tw/mappers/Blue/
18:02 < Blue_> Hey. :)
18:02 < Blue_> Nope, sorry. 
18:02 <@deen> ok, too many Blues around^^
18:02 < Blue_> :P
18:30 < Learath2> deen: did you actually get complaints about veto ?
18:33 <@heinrich5991> veto?
19:05 < Learath2> people with over 20 mins game time can veto map change votes

19:11 <@deen> Learath2: nope
19:13 <@heinrich5991> just make sure people don't know this mechanism :) otherwise people could be blocking servers
19:17 <@deen> heinrich5991: yeah, it's not really majorly announced and we always have empty servers around
19:18 <@deen> it can be abused, but before we had veto map changes were (accidentally) used to kill people right before the finish all the time
19:22 <@heinrich5991> that's obviously worse, good change in that regard :)

19:52 < Savander> o.O
19:56 < Savander> why above 15? https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/17b8a5219b7bc8bfe8298acc3d4240f1122976ea/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L1481
19:59 < KinG__> hey
20:19 <@deen> Savander: Baumalein botting client starts their version number at 15
20:19 <@deen> DDNet client started this versioning scheme where the client sends the version to the server and we started at 200 or something
20:20 <@deen> and i know that they will just change their versioning scheme now, but maybe a few players will read the warning
20:22 < Savander> hm
20:26 <@heinrich5991> deen: I don't know why you make their life so easy though. they just need to grep to find your detection scheme :)
20:27 <@deen> heinrich5991: what would you suggest? keeping the code closed source?
20:27 <@heinrich5991> keeping spam/bot/etc. detection closed source
20:28 <@heinrich5991> (e.g. reddit does this as well, I guess many people are doing that)
20:28 <@deen> well, the detection is totally trivial
20:28 <@deen> and i like the simplicity of having everything open source
20:28 <@deen> if anyone wants to build something more advanced, i guess we can run a private repo for the official servers
20:29 <@heinrich5991> yea I guess it's easier to only have one version
20:29 <@heinrich5991> that's definitely true
20:29 <@deen> no merging to do, no place to hide evil stuff in
20:31 <@EastByte> deen: baumalein recently had a peak of 30 users online
20:31 <@deen> EastByte: ouch
20:33 <@EastByte> atleast they have to deal with rage about 'non trivial' features

20:41 < Savander> huehhe
20:41 < Savander> xD
20:44 <@EastByte> keep going Savander! =)
20:45 < Savander> hm?
20:45 < Savander> xD
20:45 <@EastByte> making videos
20:45 < Savander> OMG!
20:45 < Savander> fuck
20:45 < Savander> i need to remove it
20:45 < Savander> fuck xDD
20:45 <@EastByte> on my disk already
20:45 < Savander>  desynchronize of
20:46 < Savander>  music
20:46 < Savander> gad damit
20:46 < Savander> xDD
20:46 <@EastByte> what do you mean?
20:47 < Savander> oh you'll see..
20:57 < Savander> ok now perfect
20:57 < Savander> yea
21:04 <@deen> cool, some people are actually on ddnet.tw via ipv6
21:07 <@deen> which i of course notice because i tried to get his ipv4 address^^
21:08 <@deen> his: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1790&p=18675#p18675
21:26 <@EastByte> deen: seems like hh currently has many downtimes
21:26 <@deen> EastByte: oh yes and they don't know why...
21:26 <@deen> i should switch to another hoster i guess
21:28 <@deen> cheap one in europe with good network and ddos protection
21:29 <@EastByte> kimsufi
21:29 < Savander> only for website?
21:29 <@deen> phew, was just in time with nfoservers, their spring program is over
21:30 <@deen> no more -20%
21:30 <@EastByte> nice^^
21:30 <@deen> I had the website on kimsufi and it was always ddosed and down
21:31 < Savander> hosteam.pl - cuz poland, but with good ddos proteciton
21:31 < Savander> and cheap
21:31 < Savander> https://hosteam.pl/en
21:32 <@deen> Savander: does not look cheap at all, 20 â‚¬ / month for the smallest KVM server
21:32 < Savander> you need KVM?
21:33 <@deen> not really, but i prefer it :P
21:33 < Savander> :p.
21:33 < Savander> OpenVZ is cheaper 
21:34 < Savander> 8€ or 15€
21:34 <@EastByte> sure it is
21:35 <@deen> I'd prefer to just run ddnet.tw on GER but more attack surface i guess =/
21:37 < Savander> ;)
21:38 <@deen> anyway, i think i paid HH until December, so I'll stay with them until then^^
21:38 < Savander> ou, thanks for post my video
21:38 < Savander> on main page
21:38 <@deen> i posted it before and then you removed it :P
21:38 < Savander> ahm hahah
21:39 < Savander> im not!
21:39 < Savander> just change it to private
21:39 < Savander> because it was bad version.
21:39 < Savander> changed*
21:40 <@deen> EastByte: with kimsufi i'm also a bit afraid that the Atom ones are really low performance
21:40 < Savander> VPS then?
21:41 < Savander> all my websites stay on VPS
21:41 < Savander> and work fine
21:41 < Savander> works
21:41 <@EastByte> deen: the cores might have a bit less performance than a vps vcore
21:42 <@EastByte> but therefor it's a phyisical always stable core
21:42 <@EastByte> I mean look at the cpu peaks
21:43 <@EastByte> (of ddnet.tw)
21:43 <@deen> yeah, but maybe website response times would suffer
21:43 <@deen> HH is actually pretty stable and performant when they're not down :P
21:43 <@deen> especially for an OpenVZ server
21:43 < Savander> what with Cloud ?
21:43 <@EastByte> well we both could run a benchmark and compare :P
21:43 < Savander> http://www.ovh.pl/vps/vps-cloud.xml
21:43 < Savander> like this?
21:43 < Savander> VMWare
21:44 <@deen> ah damn
21:44 < Savander> ohm, PL sorry
21:44 < Savander> haha
21:45 <@deen> a guy just donated, forgot to add his name and donated again and wrote his name. now paypal took fees from both
21:45 <@deen> their fees are way too high anyway
21:59 < o_be_one> supp' :)
22:00 < Savander> deen,  http://www.ovh.de/virtual_server/vps-cloud.xml
22:00 <@deen> Savander: way too expensive, but thanks
22:00 <@deen> let's just wait until December, I'll look then again
22:01 < Savander> ;)
22:03 <@deen> so, looks like our chilean hoster is getting huge ddos / connection problems
22:03 <@deen> i hope that's not our fault
22:08 < KinG__> why some one just come and start ddsoing ddnet ^^
22:09 <@deen> ah shit, it's our fault =/
22:09 <@deen> lots of incoming traffic
22:09 <@deen> i bet they'll throw me out now
22:09 < Savander> hoster?
22:10 <@deen> yeah, rackeo.cl
22:10 <@deen> they don't enjoy when their entire network is down because of us
22:11 <@deen> was also thrown out from the old (perfect) GER server for that
22:11 < KinG__> u mean the whole isp is down? :O
22:12 <@deen> yeah, the whole hoster was unreachable for a few minutes because of our attack, with all servers it hosts
22:12 < Savander> lol
22:12 < Savander> ;D
22:12 < Savander> fucking ddosers bitch
22:12 < Savander> without life
22:12 < Savander> lol
22:19 <@EastByte> I think the main problem with ddos attacks and ovh is that it's the main target of attacks
22:20 <@deen> EastByte: and the main attacker? :P
22:20 <@EastByte> stressing services even are advertising with being able to take whole ovh servers from the net
22:20 <@deen> there was some thing where they had hundreds of gbit/s incoming and outgoing as an attack went in and out of their network^^
22:21 <@EastByte> I guess methods to stress the ovh ddos protection are well studied
22:21 <@deen> EastByte: so maybe nfoservers is nicer because no one knows it
22:21 <@EastByte> indeed
22:22 < Savander> or hosteam <haha>
22:23 <@deen> ok, just a regular NTP amplification attack on Chile
22:24 <@deen> you learn some really interesting stuff from the ddos protection logs on nfoservers
22:24 <@deen> "Attack: a UDP-based DRDoS through TeamSpeak servers"
22:24 <@EastByte> amplification attacks are the worst for small providers
22:25 <@EastByte> interesting
22:26 <@deen> want to see the list of all attacks in the last few days?
22:26 <@EastByte> sure
22:26 <@EastByte> on chile?
22:26 <@EastByte> oh nfoservers
22:27 <@deen> nfoservers
22:27 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/ger.png http://ddnet.tw/usa.png
22:27 <@EastByte> iirc they are using normal linux systems to analyse/mitigate attacks?
22:28 <@deen> no idea
22:28 <@EastByte> wow that's detailed
22:30 < eeeee> can you ask them to permanently filter out packets with src port dns and ntp?
22:32 < eeeee> maybe also icmp
22:37 <@deen> maybe
22:39 <@EastByte> well if so, it would be really interesting to see whether you won't receive these reports anymore^^
22:40 <@EastByte> don't*
