00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cursed rust quiz
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I think I tried that one once, for me it was too much guessing and I gave up ^^
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> uh, did some physic change recently? https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/342003344476471296/1024440407351902269/tyronefretardopro.demo.mp4
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Never seen that before, I don't remember physics changes
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its possible if tyrone guy held A right before the 'bug'
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well would be easier to tell if it was a blockstuck if it has entities
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <APFFF> something like this happened to me on gores today
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Chairn that is in kog, no?
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <John Fred> Do you have a Bitcoin wallet or Coinbase wallet?

01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I also had a weird physics moment on kog today
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <APFFF> same
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ( @Avolicious )

01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <John Fred> https://t.me/+cOczZn1wgOkyMGI8
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh nevermind i guess kog is broken xd
02:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> kog is using new ddnet version maybe with sv_no_weak_hook_and_bounce which might be why it's broken
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> "listen, we made a new update to kog, but at the cost of you now having to be covered in glue... happy gores gameplay!"
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1024482445933953125/unknown.png
02:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <APFFF> wait, kog removed weak/strong?
02:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> kog has always removed weak/strong but they might be using a different method now
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gugla28> Who needs a telegram or a discord bot.  For only 40$.  Write to PM.
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @murpi
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> si
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Does it cause collision bugs? Would be bit surprising since it only changes velocity
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> idk did you see the videos?
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Yes
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> No, the initial sv_weak_hook_and_bounce did not break the collision as of now. But we applied https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5771 as updated replacement compared to  https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/2b084645276baa37b7a31aafa3fab0e3a323201b
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I already posted that bug in the PR, why did you take it anyways?
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1024658525277917205/RDT_20220928_1426427968165978321903418.jpg
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Me
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> someone enlighten me
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ø­Ù…Ø«Ù„Ø§Ø­> Guys
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> can I just read Rust as C code that looks weird
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ø­Ù…Ø«Ù„Ø§Ø­> My game still not working
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> now that I'm almost unemployed and kinda free, I can probably start learning rust as my language of choice for godot.
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Good
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ‘€ so. can I just read it as weird c code
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Doubt
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> rust's documentation feels hard to just read code snippets without reading the actual text in between :kek:
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Tbh depends which doc and how much time u spent on this language
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Sometimes it's ez, sometimes it feels like you're looking at some egyptian shit that un have to decrypt
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Sometimes it's ez, sometimes it feels like you're looking at some egyptian shit that u have to decrypt
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> "The Rust Programming Language" (i guess it's more of a "book"
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Dont come at rust with c mentality
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Treat it as a different lang
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It is a book
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Check the url
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Btw if you didnt know, https://lib.rs   is a opinionated crates.io alternative
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ReiTW
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Imho it has better discoverability
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Opinionated is a scary word
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ‘€
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> kinda want to give up already
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> what's wrong with crates tho
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Mostly anti cryptobros from what i see
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But it uses no js
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Unlike crates
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It categorizes stuff better
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And uses its own ranking system
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its cool
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> edgy might be a better word
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Also its only to discover crates, you always dowbload from crates
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Not rly, it is genuinely better
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And shows more info
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Lot of ppl prefer it
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> will check it out if i didn't give up
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> anyone doing ludum dare this weekend?
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> No
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I don't like game jams tbh I like developing things at my own pace and in my own theme.
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it's more of an activity when people are tired of making stuffs i think
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Game jams are nice it's that they're not my style (if I was missunderstood) :D
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I dont like making art
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Well i like making art in the form of  code
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Because it works ðŸ™‚
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Its not a game breaking bug
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, yes it is for hammerfly. And hammerfly is the only place where this patch is actually useful for xD
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> For normal bounces the merged PR is enough
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> We dont have hammerfly's like in ddnet
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Of course, some people do that in some gores parts. If I was you I wouldnt take the responsibility for people failing like that
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Its fine for now
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Anyways, if you dont have hammerflys like in ddnet, why do you need the bounce being fixed then? Because as I said, bounces like that are fixed from the other, merged PR
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just bounces that ALSO include hooks at the same time might still differ
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (aka hammerfly)
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You really dont need that buggy, testing approach from that PR
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> other patches dont work as expected, and re-porting the old way of kog isnt working either, because even in the old version only hooks on ground were patched
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5642
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5770
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Apply these together
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Done that before, hasnt worked as expected
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What didnt work @Avolicious ?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Avolicious but as my video showed, normal bumps are also sometimes broken, shouldn't that be fixed?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Avolicious Anyways, then I would suggest simply using this patch from 0.7, which I use on my server aswell. It's only for the hook strength, not for bouncing, but works reliably: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2478
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Gonna have a look, but seems reasonable
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (But would maybe be cool for DDNet/Jupeyy if you could report _what_ isnt working as intended)
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You would need to revert the PR I sent tho, makes most sense, then apply the Teeworlds fix on top
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (revert this in KoG: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5642)
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But then they have strong/weak again, right?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> .
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It seems like the way that DDNet has it right now isnt working correctly
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> As mentioned by Avo
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> As suggested by deen, we tried https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5642#issuecomment-1195814884
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> If you want, I re-up a server with this PR
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> And also one with the teeworlds PR fokko suggested
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Currently in office, so ETA is roughly around 10 or 11 PM CET
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is it that, what we saw on the server yesterday? With the super hook strength? xD
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Yeah I guess so
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Maybe you havent applied it correctly, I dont know which version your Gores mod is based on, and how you implemented things. But in generel I had tested this, and it seemed to work at least from what I could see. I didnt find any behaviour as on Gores server
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> There are two different conditions:
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> a) a super hook, hooking everythin.
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> b) no movement possible at all
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> There are two different conditions:
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> a) a super hook, hooking everything
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> b) no movement possible at all
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> There are two different conditions:

17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> b) no movement possible at all
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> To me it looked like only hooking tees caused that
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Well, I could give it another try ðŸ™‚ Gonna name the servers related to their PR on github
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How do I check whether two lines are crossing?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> For example a door and a laser shot
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Where I have the door start/end pos and the laser start/end
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think we have that in server right now, just some IntersectLine
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea thats what I thought, mh
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I wouldnt need to know where they meet, just if. I think I can do some simple maths here
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to figure out where they meet to know that they meet, you get that one for free I think
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 2 lines or 2 line segments ðŸ˜„
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With lines there is a way, but doors and lasers are line segments
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plower> When will the moderators be recruited?
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plower> i wait 2 month
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How is that a reply to that lol ðŸ˜„
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> line segments are easier in think, bcs u can abuse dot product
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They will be recruited when we need more of them
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plower> k
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lines are trivial, if the slopes aren't the same they will always intersect ðŸ˜„
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plower> i wait
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> true xd
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 2d math is too ez solve it in 4d
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, it generalizes pretty well above 3d
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just need to check if they are on the same (hyper-)plane and are not parallel
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or maybe even more general equivalently just put it all in a matrix ðŸ˜›

23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Uncle> micro rant: i hate the  new output in lcon and the fact that votes ping me when i am logged in
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Uncle> what the hell is this `2022-09-28 23:54:27 I chat: `
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Uncle> where is me brackets
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Uncle> and the highlighted votes, what the actual fuck, there isn't even an option to turn it off
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Uncle> i just get spammed with random votes
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Uncle> i get it, you want your mods to react to votes, because generally they are useless, lets put them into work huh
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Uncle> but it is a clientside change, its not serverside, you made it so every admin/mod/whatever on any server who is using latest ddnets suffer these pings
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ipoopi> ?
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> He is saying that the f1 console logging looks less readable
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> And if u logged into rcon u can pinned by a sound for every vote.. At first u actually thought it was a client bug too bcs it's kinda weird
