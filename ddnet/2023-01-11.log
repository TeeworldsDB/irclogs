00:01 <+bridge> <deen> For now I'll run with older version
03:31 <+bridge> <tobi> I got this problem when I updated, but I went to 16.6 and the game works fine

08:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Read what it says
09:15 <+bridge> <deen> @Jupeyy_Keks I added "run with OpenGL" option in Steam, hope that's ok: https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/eventcomments/3757724418287109034/
09:59 <+bridge> <uwu> I noticed topics from turkey are mostly getting 'bugged' views count, kinda interesting, looks like their ISPs literally ddosing pages instead of sending 1 request :troll:
09:59 <+bridge> <uwu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1062656881790812160/Screenshot_2023-01-11-10-56-07-286-edit_org.mozilla.firefox.jpg
10:25 <+bridge> <cankick> Yes, it was clan 44 that did it. they are doing this as an attack on me, i swear i have nothing to do with it. I reported the necessry screenshots to the admins.
10:26 <+bridge> <cankick> They are doing this on purpose because I am fighting with that  44 clan.
10:30 <+bridge> <uwu> I wasn't accusing someone, its just weird that only turkish topics have huge amount of views, maybe some ISPs not working correctly, maybe someone have broken router. Cuz just adding views to someone you don't like doesnt have any sense, that's basically ddosing the website xd
10:31 <+bridge> <deen> They are just running DoS attacks against our forum for fun, no need to give them attention
10:31 <+bridge> <cankick> view bot yea
10:32 <+bridge> <uwu> Ddosing certain topics kekw
10:32 <+bridge> <uwu> And mostly turkish
10:33 <+bridge> <cankick> all of them :kek:

18:33 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I'm having fun :YEP: 
18:33 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Why do I feel like Imma spend 500 lines of code only for the Inspector to look nice? :lol:

18:34 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> aaaaand on the character category, I'll also plan to make besides Platformer: Top-down and Isometric
18:34 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :Deadge:
18:36 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> aaaaand on the character category, I'll also plan to make besides Platformer: Top-down and Isometric
18:36 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> (oh I fucked up Cancel velocity)
18:36 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Very cool, what about bot?
18:36 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest: need to make a character class first for the bot to control
18:37 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Just gimme a role :feelsbadman:
18:37 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> and somehow make it work for all the character categories
18:38 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Check #help on the server
18:39 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Already :greenthing:
18:43 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Oh wait, you didn't talk about AI for the character class I'm doing lmao
19:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks do u think its worth making a own vram limiter
19:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> e.g just unload skins
19:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> with default
19:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, but ppl should still not load 4k skins
19:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> loading 100MB into ram can create laggs
19:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we need more threaded memory managment, ez
19:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> people will always be stupid, we just gotta save them from their own stupidity
19:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> #devwork
19:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> #lifestyle
19:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
19:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tru
19:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> as u have seen
19:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> they dont even read
19:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
19:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ur messages crafted with love
19:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> they hate u
19:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDDD
19:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :BASEDDEPT:
19:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if everyone would have a rtx 4090 we wouldn't have this problem.
19:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i blame sillicon valley
19:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> true
19:50 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
19:50 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> oops I guess?
19:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
20:50 <+bridge> <Chairn> you want my address so that you can send me one?
20:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it sadly doesnt fit into your case
20:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else ofc
20:52 <+bridge> <Chairn> i'll buy one 🙂
20:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok that makes 2000€ pls
20:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 🙂
20:52 <+bridge> <Chairn> no, you send one for free
20:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> im not sillicon valley sadly
21:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> close as wontfix
21:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> we donnt provide support for old clients
21:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :BASEDHALT:
21:11 <+bridge> <gerdoe> its minor tho
21:12 <+bridge> <gerdoe> xd i tried to interpret it in human way
21:12 <+bridge> <gerdoe> like if services ie netflix wouldnt provide support for old man
21:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
21:13 <+bridge> <Voxel> "bu-bu-but the run animations and the new ui 🤓"
21:13 <+bridge> <gerdoe> neuron protocol was broken on 16.372.8 patch, sorry
21:14 <+bridge> <gerdoe> i can make parallel repo that will be just the same ddnet but without animations and new ui 😋
21:14 <+bridge> <gerdoe> im too lazy for it tho
21:14 <+bridge> <Voxel> thats kinda stupid tho
21:14 <+bridge> <Voxel> no offence
21:15 <+bridge> <gerdoe> i think adding non optional changes in xd open source game is stupid
21:15 <+bridge> <gerdoe> and also we have optional funny things
21:15 <+bridge> <gerdoe> why animations should be forced
21:16 <+bridge> <gerdoe> no offence tho
21:16 <+bridge> <Voxel> because i was told it should be ~~(also boosts my self esteem)~~
21:16 <+bridge> <gerdoe> heinrich will not change his mind so theres no point talking about it
21:16 <+bridge> <Voxel> yea
21:16 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ic
21:17 <+bridge> <Voxel> if i were to make a paralelle client id completely change the graphical system
21:17 <+bridge> <Voxel> like the ui, the tee and skin format, etc
21:17 <+bridge> <gerdoe> you can do it
21:17 <+bridge> <gerdoe> also you can look at ninslash
21:17 <+bridge> <gerdoe> necropotame did a big thing
21:17 <+bridge> <gerdoe> nice work
21:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> his stancee is correct on long term
21:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> his stance is correct on long term
21:18 <+bridge> <gerdoe> about optional things?
21:18 <+bridge> <gerdoe> or wdym
21:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> options ye
21:18 <+bridge> <gerdoe> yeah its good in long term
21:19 <+bridge> <gerdoe> but ddnet isnt a core
21:19 <+bridge> <gerdoe> its literally customized whatever
21:19 <+bridge> <gerdoe> i believe ddnet someday will leave teeworlds
21:19 <+bridge> <gerdoe> and teeworlds could rest in peace
21:20 <+bridge> <gerdoe> i mean ddet will broke the protocol totally
21:20 <+bridge> <gerdoe> will change skin system and maybe someone will do full ui rework
21:20 <+bridge> <gerdoe> but its only dreams
21:20 <+bridge> <gerdoe> someday ryozoozki will publish rustee :troll:
21:20 <+bridge> <gerdoe> and it will become a new teecore
21:21 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ddnet*
21:21 <+bridge> <gerdoe> and teeworlds will rest in peace
21:25 <+bridge> <Sorah> than just update the ui change and afk sitting emote and i will update
21:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Sorah things dont work like that
21:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> we simply dont do that
21:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and you dont play
21:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
21:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ok i might be a bit rude
21:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but thats the way it works
21:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> why would someone care u cant play cuz u decide to not update?
21:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> unless ur lucky enough forr another dev to waste their time on this
21:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> which i doubt
21:26 <+bridge> <Sorah> i dont even want a change for the ui 
21:26 <+bridge> <Sorah> for once i wont a valild argument why no option gets added to have the old way back
21:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the argument is it adds code complexity and maintenance burden to devs
21:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this was told already lots of times
21:27 <+bridge> <Sorah> so did adding that stuff in the first place
21:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and we dont need to explain again xD
21:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/looney-tunes-head-bang-no-i-cant-gif-18958372
21:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> trust me
21:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> play with it
21:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> after a week u will forget
21:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the human mind is rly flexible
21:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> with these things
21:28 <+bridge> <Sorah> why is every argument you devs bring more against you than me
21:28 <+bridge> <Sorah> whatever
21:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> or u can just simply update!
21:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> such a easy solution
21:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and nobodies time is wasted
21:30 <+bridge> <Learath2> Our argument is that it's harder for us to maintain the code when there are more options
21:30 <+bridge> <Learath2> 
21:30 <+bridge> <Learath2> This specific one can be added and I would maintain it, but I literally don't have the time to add it and none of the other devs want to spend their time adding an option for the remaining holdouts that want the stars back
21:32 <+bridge> <Learath2> It's not that complex, it's not some convoluted reason. Nobody hates you for wanting to stay with the old ui.
21:32 <+bridge> <Learath2> 
21:32 <+bridge> <Learath2> It's a simple issue, I don't have time. We don't force anyone to work on anything because we don't pay anyone
21:34 <+bridge> <Sorah> funny that you say force
21:34 <+bridge> <Sorah> before today i wasnt force to update now i  am
21:35 <+bridge> <Sorah> i didnt mind not updating but since i need to  now or otherwise i just cant join ddnet servers i feel now its forced on me
21:35 <+bridge> <Sorah> well for the forture
21:36 <+bridge> <Sorah> if you accept some random updates from some random new devs  they should provide the requested options
21:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> A crash that will probably be fixed in max a week isn't forcing you to do anything. If you don't want to update, just wait.
21:36 <+bridge> <Sorah> ok that sounds good
21:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> dont promise stuff
21:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this might involve complex stuff
21:38 <+bridge> <Sorah> did someone test if vanilla clients crash ? didnt ddnet wanted to be compatible with them
21:38 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Is `UUID(NETMSG_CHECKSUM_REQUEST, "checksum-request@ddnet.tw")` send in antibot or is there something else different on official servers? Cause the crash is caused by this message and would be fixed on the client side by #5554.
21:38 <+bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5554
21:38 <+bridge> <Learath2> Heinrich loves backcompat. No way he would let it slide
21:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i would say he likes it when its not problematic
21:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but well better himself express his opinion
21:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> he iis afk
21:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what a lovely day it is
21:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 🏕️
21:42 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> isn't night?
21:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 what was the issue
21:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> DM me
22:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ok
22:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> is it fixed on empty servers now?
22:00 <+bridge> <Sorah> yes :O
22:01 <+bridge> <Sorah> thank you heinrich :) :heartw:
22:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u survived
22:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but there will be a day
22:02 <+bridge> <Sorah> ik
22:02 <+bridge> <Sorah> shut up
22:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> that it will be inveitable
22:02 <+bridge> <Sorah> :(
22:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 🙊
22:04 <+bridge> <Sorah> maybe its even the same day something useful is in the updates
22:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u diminish the work of devs cuz u dont know the value of these updates
22:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ungrateful
22:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> stale dev leads to what happened to tw btw
22:15 <+bridge> <I.K.U> why doesnt this get voted?
22:15 <+bridge> <I.K.U> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1062842230588575764/image.png
22:15 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> veto
22:15 <+bridge> <I.K.U> is it a bug or intended
22:15 <+bridge> <I.K.U> ugh
22:15 <+bridge> <I.K.U> ok
22:15 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> if someone has veto, then it won't go off until vetoer gets it off
22:16 <+bridge> <I.K.U> when veto strikes back
22:16 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> when afker is vetoing :troll:
23:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> http://www.radgametools.com/oodle.htm
23:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> apparently this is used in the game dev world
23:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ffxiv uses it
