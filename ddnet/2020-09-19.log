02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ravie Hey, i don't know if you want todo this, but we need a autumn map for
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> #2863
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> your Sunny Side Up map looks pretty nice and fitting, maybe you could create a small map for it 😄
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2863
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> @Jupstar ✪ when his autumn map is finished, it would be winter already
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then for next year autumn 😄
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but u can try too @Welf if u want
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> actually any mapper is welcome 😄
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> well
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> i am working on other maps 😛
03:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar ✪ btw, demo list has no hover effe t
03:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> effect*
03:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Jupstar ✪ it's a summer map >:[ it was even released in summer
03:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd
03:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but sunflowers fit for autumn too
03:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and orange indicates autumn for me
03:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and the map looks nice
03:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so 3:0 for autumn xd
03:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2682/files
03:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @fokkonaut ty
03:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I guess wait for the 0.7 autumn theme to be done and just yoink it like everything else xD
03:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
03:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the map doesnt look as good tho ;D
03:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> true
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yoink justice 2
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Traffic increased after enabling skin downloader
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756802692583653386/screenshot-20200919110307.png
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is that bad?
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not really
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But I guess something is wrong with the skin downloader and I can't find out what
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> lots of mysterious bug reports this release
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for example?
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> random overwritten memory
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> only a few skins loading
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> crash when enabling skin downloader
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> fps going lower and lower during gameplay
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mh
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> weird
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i didnt notice any bugs with it, i guess
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, most didn't
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but it's still bad if it causes problems for a few
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wow, you are fast
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it was easier than expected
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> what is skin downloader? o.O and rude hating on mi nice autumn map
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> who should i trust the mail from expiry@letsencypt.org or the cert info shown by firefox? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1600507429.png
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> skin downloader automatically downloads skins from the ddnet databse if you dont have it
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can also use another url
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: email from field can easily be manipulated, check the headers at least
11:28 <+ChillerDragon> how to check headers o.O
11:28 <+ChillerDragon> ik email is not all safe and stuff but why would one send me a fake letsencrypt mailk
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> open the email in vim for me 😄
11:28 <+ChillerDragon> hackerman
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon i for example use `https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/skins/blob/master/06/` for my skin downloader
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> o.O so good @fokkonaut
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> so u download tons of skins
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> and probably wrong ones huh? xd
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is only temporary
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> iirc
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> interesting
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why is the penistee not in the teeworldsdb :(
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> well ill just not touch my cert and hope ssl doesnt die
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> ts not?
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> sounds kinda basic to me
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> there is
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Why don't you auto-renew the cert with a cronjob?
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756809492628373595/unknown.png
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> idk maybe i did
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1600507790.png
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> press t @fokkonaut
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ahhhh
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there we go
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> OMG
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> hm
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> with the skin downloader people could be using our bush skins in survival xD
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxD
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if everyone would use the teeworldsdb as link
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> love it
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> go fix ddnet client
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you could also add it to ddnet skin db
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> to use the supirior db
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> lmao
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how @deen
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/skins/blob/master/06/chiller_bush.png
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> the bush skin is so bad
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/skins/blob/master/06/chiller_bush_jungle.png
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> best skins
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> i wasnt pro artist back then yet
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Remake it so it looks nice and then talk to @Soreu @Ravie @louis , our new skin db team
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> yea would be cool if an actual artist add doodads skins
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> love the ppl in the skin team btw
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen another question, when downloading skins with spaces, for example from the teeworldsdb here, does that work flawless?
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/skins/blob/master/06/Light%20Greensward.png
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> does the client convert the characters?
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> utf8++64 chars
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> we need checksums for skins
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> skinparts* imagine using old skin sys in 2020
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> chillerdragon is a troll
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> i see u werk on the 0.7 menu already
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> so hope to see 0.7 skins soon and a client update
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> :justatest:
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> so
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> whats about the ddnet db and skins now
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> did u never add them @fokkonaut? to TeeworldsDB
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> oh and @Soreu why is ur github name so crazy unrelated to ur tw name so hard to remember that
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut i don't think we do convert them to %20 but it still works (maybe curl does that internally, maybe server just supports space)
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> server supports spaces, yes
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but when the client searches for the skin name, it needs to convert it
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or does curl do it?
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not sure what you mean, it works fine currently
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ChillerDragon Ye, I know... I'm complicated dude who uses nickname Ekidoxx for whatever is related to coding and Soreu as a player, though, honestly, those two started to mix together at some point :justatest: 
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> That needs a cleanup at some point too xd
11:40 <+ChillerDragon> go create a gaming github
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> xd
11:40 <+ChillerDragon> i have a job github a minecraft github and a teeworlds github acc
11:41 <+ChillerDragon> or go name ur self Ekidoxx in tw
11:41 <+ChillerDragon> or atleast Soridoxx lmao
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ChillerDragon, ChillerDragonOfficial & ChillerDragonMC? :pepeH:
11:42 <+ChillerDragon> lmao
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> chillerbot.exe
11:42 <+ChillerDragon> oof
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> fourth one for spreading tw bots
11:42 <+ChillerDragon> u!
11:42 <+ChillerDragon> all private
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont spread
11:42 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1600508515.png
11:42 <+ChillerDragon> safe on m$ servers
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> wait, there's actually `chillerbot` in here xD
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756812643116908564/Screen_Shot_2020-09-19_at_4.43.09_AM.png
11:43 <+ChillerDragon> sure
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how do i have a copy then
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> xd
11:43 <+ChillerDragon> wtf
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i know u didnt send it to me
11:43 <+ChillerDragon> uhm
11:43 <+ChillerDragon> i blame worstwish
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
11:44 <+ChillerDragon> lmao u keep it
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ofc
11:44 <+ChillerDragon> imagine keeping 0.6 based hacks in 2020
11:44 <+ChillerDragon> i have a 0.7 replay bot if u want to buy it
11:44 <+ChillerDragon> eh
11:44 <+ChillerDragon> totally not sharing
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> most boring hack ever
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i have no use for it
11:44 <+ChillerDragon> pff
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> when fix fng btw
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> whats the problem?
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> hammer is weird
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> uh
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> it exists xd
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> U
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> in what way is it weird?
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> go pls add a vanilla hammer option
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ^
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> the vasten100 tune sucks
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why is it vasten100
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> for real tw players add a option to use real hammer
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think the hammer in fng has been this way since before i even knew what tw was
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> bcs vasten100 is the guy that uses tunes to destroy tw
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so idk if its right to change it
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and lol
11:46 <+ChillerDragon> not change
11:46 <+ChillerDragon> add a option
11:46 <+ChillerDragon> like /realhammer
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> to give u a weak hammer?
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i guess i could but whats the point lol
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756813463740743730/unknown.png
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> whats wrong with my entities
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> switches not showen, freeze not shown
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mh
11:46 <+ChillerDragon> the point is that people who want to keep their ddr hammer skills and train them in fng can do so
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @fokkonaut will sound weird, but try restarting client / rejoin server
11:47 <+ChillerDragon> i would discuss in #fng but u killed the bridge sorry for spaming in ddnet
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> both doesnt work
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> does it not transfer over well / are there no ddrace maps with modified hammer tuning
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i killed the bridge because u @ everyone again
11:47 <+ChillerDragon> oof it wasnt me
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> :troll:
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u
11:47 <+ChillerDragon> :justatest:
11:47 <+ChillerDragon> can i use emotes?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> nop lol
11:47 <+ChillerDragon> oof
11:47 <+ChillerDragon> @jao fix
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i like how
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen did you destroy entities?
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> [4:44 AM] BOT [quakenet] ChillerDragon: imagine keeping 0.6 based hacks in 2020
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the person who says imagine using _ in 2020 is still using irc lol
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Jupstar ✪ more likely somehow xd
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> don't think so
11:48 <+ChillerDragon> xxxD
11:48 <+ChillerDragon> touche
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen my mod name is F-DDrace, but my server sends the gameinfoex and should tell the ddnet client to use the ddnet entities
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it doesnt work since i updated, i dont know when it stopped working because i didnt try all versions
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Jupstar might have changed something about that iirc
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh man...
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar ✪ are you there?
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @fokkonaut were you using entities IDs that had no use in DDNet?
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> of course i do
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756814416535617566/unknown.png
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why does the To teleporter show up but not the From
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> that could by my only guess, because useless ones got removed from the bottom part (the blank ones)
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nah thats not it, freeze is not unused
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> that sounds even more weird
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> it looks like it just loads wrong entities, but its just in your mod, or everywhere?
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> my mod
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but it shouldnt load the wrong texture, i havent changed anything serverside
11:51 <+Ryozuki> chillernobo
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i am sending the gameinfoex and i am telling the client to use ddnet entities
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @noby wasn't there a problem on FNG earlier that entities didn't show for some reason? or that one was fixed easily already?
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes some ppl had this problem
11:53  * ChillerDragon u
11:53 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon do u use neovim
11:53 <+Ryozuki> or vim
11:53 <+ChillerDragon> uhm
11:53 <+ChillerDragon> forgot
11:53 <+ChillerDragon> i dont think neo
11:53 <+ChillerDragon> but also not vanilla
11:53 <+ChillerDragon> depends on the os im using i think
11:53 <+ChillerDragon> what ever ships with python support for my plugins
11:54 <+ChillerDragon> i think its nvim or sumsin lik that
11:54 <+Ryozuki> nvim is neovim nobo
11:54 <+ChillerDragon> oof
11:54 <+Ryozuki> get ur facts
11:54 <+Ryozuki> right
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @fokkonaut Maybe let's later create entities entirely for your mod, as it's with FNG, Race, blockworlds?
11:54 <+ChillerDragon> ah no
11:54 <+ChillerDragon> i use vim-nox on debian
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Soreu i do have entities for my mod
11:55 <+ChillerDragon> on arch i think the plain vim ships w python so i use that there
11:55 <+ChillerDragon> on mac probably also vim-nox
11:55 <+Ryozuki> thats just a plugin
11:55 <+ChillerDragon> nox is a plugin?
11:55 <+Ryozuki> yea
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Soreu but that doesnt matter, because my mod uses custom front layer entities too and a custom switch tile etc
11:55 <+ChillerDragon> nah but that pack ships vim built w python support
11:55 <+ChillerDragon> normal vim on debian or mac doesnt irrc
11:55 <+ChillerDragon> iirc
11:55 <+Ryozuki> neovim has python support
11:55 <+ChillerDragon> omg
11:56 <+Ryozuki> and more languages too
11:56 <+ChillerDragon> yea
11:56 <+ChillerDragon> never felt the need for it tho
11:56 <+ChillerDragon> why u use neo?
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> client uses custom entities_overlay only, which contains all layers
11:56 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon https://imgur.com/iFUe8aZ
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah true
11:56 <+Ryozuki> can u do this
11:56 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1600509362.png
11:56 <+ChillerDragon> cant see shit
11:57 <+ChillerDragon> not gonna give my privacy to imgur
11:57 <+ChillerDragon> go get a better image tool
11:57 <+Ryozuki> are u blind lol
11:57 <+Ryozuki> how much zoom
11:57 <+Ryozuki> do u have
11:57 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:57 <+Ryozuki> on ur browser
11:57 <+Ryozuki> lmao
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ah, my bad, there's also custom game layer when in editor, but that could probably be expanded to also contain other layers like front
11:57 <+ChillerDragon> messed up zooz all the time when mixing 4k and fullhd on linux 
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Soreu i found the bug
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/mapimages.cpp#L143
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its because entities are not masked for my server
11:58 <+ChillerDragon> go install crapshot Ryozuki its rly nice
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this has to be removed again twf
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> who added this
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont want my entities to be masked but it should use ddnet.png, because i use custom ddnet.png
11:58 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: its free and open https://github.com/ChillerDragon/crools/blob/master/crapshot
11:58 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut click on blame at the top and you get https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/b83d8735fe88c5ce261abb8d0079b97744a08603

12:01 <+ChillerDragon> and done
12:01 <+Ryozuki> without i3
12:01 <+Ryozuki> my workflow would be broken
12:01 <+ChillerDragon> no need for a long ass screenshot command
12:01 <+Ryozuki> im rly confy rn
12:01 <+ChillerDragon> go get a desktop nub
12:01 <+ChillerDragon> xd
12:01 <+Ryozuki> no u
12:01 <+Ryozuki> i got my desktop
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> sure^ 
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> windows is still best wm
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> it has it in the name
12:04 <+Ryozuki> https://ryozuki.xyz/pics/desktop.png
12:05 <+Ryozuki> lmao discord hides the link
12:05 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon see its a perfect desktop
12:05 <+Ryozuki> no icons = best
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> weeb
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> if there is nothing on ur desktop how is it a desktop
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :weebsout:
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> what is it useful for if u cant put or sort crap there
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I wonder what's that switch of `2 | 4` and if there would be mess if 2 was selected
12:32 <+Souly> imagine using irc
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> > Maybe Jupstar would be able to fix the rendering same way vanilla did it, so that dilate would only be needed in cases of using graphical programs like Inkscape, while the game itself wouldn't require nearly everything to be dilated?
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> @Soreu 
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> > If not, then I guess smarter & less confusing solution would be to just dilate every single png that goes into the game in both data & config_directory
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> @Soreu  Idk what's the better way to do it, but as long as it gets automated i'm happy
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @fokkonaut the actual problem is that the tile switch collides with another tile on ddnet.PNG please fix it the right way
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Just add for type unknown that the switch tile should be something else like I do with masking
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @fokkonaut please just fix as I say and don't start argumentation
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> !
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?*
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> OK
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Wait I go on pc
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You dont seem to understand what my problen is
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> heinrich added the mask flag just for me
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I know why and how i needed it
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the mask is working
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the reason ur swithc isnt working is bcs i forgot to change the tile index for unknown
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nothing else
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> switch?
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the switch tile in ur image
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that doesnt work
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no thats not the problem xD
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in ddnet.png there is a tile collision between 2 tiles
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ucknow
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i know*
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the problem is that i send unmask flag, which will then lead to the Race entities
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So client uses race.png
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bool EntitesAreMasked = !GameClient()->m_GameInfo.m_DontMaskEntities;
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> look closly
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u dont mask
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the value is true
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it gets false
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so entites are NOT maskes if that value is true
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i know i know
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so everything is right
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its not
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then ur mod is buggy
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no wtff
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what is that for an argumentation?
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as is said the switch tile is something else
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just forgot it for unknwon
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont talk about the switch tile dude
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Look
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i want a proof that that flag is true in ur mod
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else i cannot think of an actually reason
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So. I send these entities flags:
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ddnet, ddrace, race
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> That means the client uses the one it can find, preferable ddnet -> ddrace -> race.
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I also send dont mask entities flag, which means EntitiesAreMasked is false.
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then the client can not take the ddnet nor ddrace entities, so it uses the Race entities. This is the reason why it had no freeze and no teleporter/switch. The fix is simply to restore the old behavior, which is to allow unmasked entities also for ddrace and ddnez
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so you send race too?
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/blob/d8f0ba5450b17cf9d9e5528187542e65c715c061/src/game/server/gamecontroller.cpp#L548
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why not disable that or add the dont mask for race too
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes, i do. as ddnet does
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because thats not what is wanted
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> replace this:
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else if(GameClient()->m_GameInfo.m_EntitiesRace)
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else if(GameClient()->m_GameInfo.m_EntitiesRace && EntitesAreMasked)
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno the exact details
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why would you disallow unmasking ddnet/ddrace entities
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but ur fix makes it worse
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it doesnt
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> explain your Changes please
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why do you disallow unmasking them
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs then it defualts to unknown
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> whihc is plain ddnet.png
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> without any modifications
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think u have a thinking twist
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if entities are maskes tiles are removed
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ik
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so if unknown nothing is removed
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> pls just add it and test it
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> test if ur mod keeps "unknown"
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or check where it does not stay unknown
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if unknown it should be fine
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It shouldnt be unknown
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> unknown = default ddnet
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> whats wrong with it
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do u want race tiles unmasked on its own or what?
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Are you german? I really dont wanna type this right now xD
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this leads to nothing
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i amg erman yes
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can I call you in a few minutes?
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just explain per text
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sec
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just tell me if u want race tiles unmasked
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then we have solved this discussion
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like if u need ddrace.png and race.png on its own
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not hard to add these
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No, thats not the point
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then explain it i'll be here in 30min or smth
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can write german in pm if u want
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> Does anyone know some good debugger/disassembler for Linux? I do some reverse engineering on Windows sometimes with x64dbg and it's wonderful. On Linux, which is my primary platform, there's just GDB with its totally awful UI. The problem with GDB is that it's almost useless without debug symbols, and even though i like and use terminal a lot, doing anything advanced with GDB is so painful experience always. I like `objdump -d -M intel -C -
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> compile with -g and get debug symbols?
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> you can even install -dbgsym packages on Debian/Ubuntu, but proprietary software exists even on Linux... sadly 😄
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> so debug symbols are not available always
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what are u trying to debug
14:15 <+ChillerDragon> any gfx gurus wanna rant my first vector graphic? @Ravie @Soreu @louis https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/images/blob/master/realistic/transparent/doodads/bush_big.svg
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Sadly I'm still not working on vectors
14:15 <+ChillerDragon> oof no?
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> @onby right now it's really messy, because i'm trying to debug Windows application running under Wine which sometimes crashes inside Mesa (system library, so Wine can't catch that crash) 😄
14:16 <+ChillerDragon> vectors so good
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I know, but I hate the programs xd
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> GDB even doesn't allow me to attach to such thing 😄
14:16 <+ChillerDragon> inkscape is kinda nice
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ic
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I'd have to get used to Adobe AI, since that would be easiest switch forth & back with Photoshop
14:17 <+ChillerDragon> go buy gimp
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and man, some stuff is so much more complicated I'm raging fast
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> never
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> :justatest:
14:18 <+ChillerDragon> :/
14:18 <+ChillerDragon> i always try to use blender shortcuts in inkscape xd
14:19 <+ChillerDragon> not that i know blender at all but i somehow got very used to the shortcuts in the 10 mins i used it
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @mind maybe you'd want to redo his svg? xd
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @mind
14:19 <+ChillerDragon> ?
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> oh, wait, you meant to rank it, like... rate it
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> based on your other... drawings... I immediately though that there is full redo needed xD
14:21 <+ChillerDragon> i mean rant like critique 
14:22 <+ChillerDragon> maybe point out some obvious beginner flaws that cause problems or bad style
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMTg2sL5pD4>
14:22 <+ChillerDragon> oof
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> LOL
14:23 <+ChillerDragon> wait @Soreu you say my bush is so unusable bad that mind has to redo it? :/
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> nope, it looks good
14:25 <+ChillerDragon> well i guess i just continue creating more doodads using the same procedure
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> @onby right now it's really messy because i'm trying to debug Windows application running under Wine which sometimes crashes inside Mesa (system library, so Wine can't catch that crash) 😄
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> GDB doesn't even allow me to attach to such thing 😄
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont remove editor tab
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> oh common Ryozuki
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ???
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why do u want to remove it
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> dont make home page because geeks want to have fast navigation, dont remove editor tabs because geeks not so geeks?
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its perfect where it is
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> whats wrong with ctrl+shift+e ?
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> and with home page?
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is literally no reason to remove that tab
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> not enough?
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah not enough i dont use a bind i dont remember and i skip home page
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also u can access editor
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> while in a server
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> playing
14:34 <+ChillerDragon> well i actually managed to break ctrl+shift+e for some time
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that tab is useful
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no reason to remove itr
14:34 <+ChillerDragon> gnome was interfering with that shortcut 
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> that is a problem, its not a tab
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> its button
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not a problem
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its perfectly fine
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> for people who use it for years? Maybe
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for new ppl is useful too
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is literally no reason to remove it
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> useful != logical
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats nonsensical
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> bannazy is a troll
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> huge one
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> nah, you are just persist to any change. To anything that are not like "before"
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just close that pr
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no one wants that
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> remove it
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> stop calling yourself "all"
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> stop telling people to fork ddnet
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> mr main guy
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not against any change, ur change just happens to be horrible
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> its your opinion
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> your personal, not more
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its also ur opinion
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to remove this
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nothing more
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yes, let other people expose their opinion. Don't be so categorical
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im telliing ur change is bad
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I put some effort in it, so I makes ssense to me
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im free to do so
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some effort?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is no effort there
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> more then just type a message into chat
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can do that in 1 minute
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> if I know the code well
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is zero effort
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it doesnt matter
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> fine, but its not only about you
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah its also not only about you
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> ??
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u decided to make this pr unilaterally without making a issue first
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and then u come here talking about efforts
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> its an issue? I provide solution of problem I see, instead of problem itself?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the issues are made to discuss
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> so pr = always merge ?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the problem is made up by you
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no but then dont complain about
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "efforts"
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats bullshit
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I didnt
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u did
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> read the chat pls
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u used effort as an argument, but u didnt even make an issue to discuss it
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I dont want to spam this chat anymore, sorry. Everyone is up to make vote in PR. Go ahead, Ryozuki
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :))
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :rooEZSip:
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I put some effort in it, so it makes sense to me
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar ✪ i dont think you need all entities * 2, unmasking is done on the fly, when masked specific tiles are just not rendered. Why do you need an unmasked selection for all types?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as i said in pm
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs map is buffered
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u cannot change on fly anymore
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @fokkonaut pls just test if it works, then its fine isnt it? 😄
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen u still have the libcurl debug symbols for libcurl?
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don't think they were created, were they?
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can recreate a libcurl for you, what system?
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nvm, someone with windows can just test libcurl dev
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but libcurl is probably the most used library

15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> stop it bot
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but could also be caused by windows
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or false positive
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen read them later when u back ^
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just to be sure
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen read them later when u back ^
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just to be sure (Edit: nvm actually, probs just bcs they are syscalls)
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> Problem from 15.0.3 version when changing weapons with mousewheel, I have to roll 2 times up or down to change (then it works for that side normally)
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Known issue since forever, sometimes mousewheel is bugged in tw and you have to scroll some times to fix it
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> I cant fix it
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then this is another issue
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> Ik that its sometimes broken but this wont fix
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sorry, misunderstood
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> from 15.0 version
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> Its like I have to switch some button with first roll and second works
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A setting in the main menu, it's funny how lazy people can be
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think most ppl dont use settings, but yeah xD
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> too lazy to search for it
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but e.g. vscode has this too
16:36 <+ChillerDragon> what was otool -L again on linux?
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> ah remebered it it was ldd
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> `readelf -d` is usually better than `ldd` because it shows only direct dependencies, while `ldd` loads the executable and then dumps loaded libraries, so it shows both direct and indirect dependencies (subdependencies)
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> cool thanks
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> to this day we still get people asking how to change skins in china.... like quite a few
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> are settings so unintuitive? XD
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> idk. it is weird
17:25 <+ChillerDragon> u think its a china related issue? xd
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe.
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @ChillerDragon nice svg but the shadow on the right looks a little weird for me
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk im not a huge pro at graphics lol
17:34 <+ChillerDragon> what shadow?
17:34 <+ChillerDragon> and when contribute ur svgs?
17:34 <+ChillerDragon> what vector software u use btw?
17:34 <+ChillerDragon> @louis ^
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> inkscape
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk when im not lazy to put all the svgs in a single file lol
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i have to find them
17:35 <+ChillerDragon> inkscape so good o.O
17:36 <+ChillerDragon> thats why this db makes sense so we do not lose ur awesome work
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> Problem with mousewheel is not anymore
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> can tunezone provide `broadcast smth`
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> can tunezone provide `broadcast smth`?
18:43 <+ChillerDragon> yea pretty sure
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> so, tutorial map can be cooler xd
18:44 <+ChillerDragon> isnt it ``tune_zone <num> <command>`` and <command> could be "broadcast foo"
18:44 <+ChillerDragon> idk tho
18:45 <+ChillerDragon> tune_zone_enter can print chat messages for sure
18:45 <+ChillerDragon> broadcast might collide with timer tho
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> ah, for vanilla players?
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <熱 netsuii> Can somebody tell me how exactly i can toggle deepfly on and off
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=2537
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For just deepflying, you can just use dummy hammerfly
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> Hello @qshar, may you show us your developments in dynamic blocks on maps please?
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen btw there were texture problems before?

21:05 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3z> is cl_mouse_max_distance relative to the screen width?
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> "No more duplicate Search - Search - Search text" :(
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> triplicate*
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> @deen are translations' bones sorted by alphabet?
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> bones?
