19:20 <+killme_> hi , deen is there any tools for execute tune command from map files ?
19:31 <+killme_> i just want some tune command in a lock map can someone help me ?
19:52 <@deen> hi
19:53 <+killme_> hi
19:53 <@deen> killme_: yeah, there's a tool to retrieve and stgore them
19:53 <@deen> you can compile?
19:53 <@deen> config_retrieve and config_store are the binaries
19:53 <+killme_> yes
19:53 <@deen> you can compile with "bam tools_release"
19:53 <@deen> or just "bam release"
19:53 <+killme_> i just need compile ddnet source ? server_release ?
19:54 <+killme_> ah
19:54 <@deen> ddnet source, but tools_release
19:54 <@deen> not server_release
19:54 <+killme_> tools_release
19:54 <+killme_> hmm
19:54 <+killme_> deen
19:54 <@deen> that's me
19:54 <+killme_> the map is lock bye someone but i dont need map
19:54 <+killme_> i just cfg of the map 
19:54 <@deen> no idea what "lock" is
19:54 <+killme_> i mean cfg that saved inside map
19:54 <@deen> if it means destroying the map in some way that makes it unopenable, then no idea
19:55 <+killme_> lock i mean editor cant load it
19:55 <@deen> you can run it on your server and read the log
19:55 <@deen> the log file should tell you what settings are set
19:55 <@deen> and tell that guy that he/she's an idiot for locking the map
19:55 <+killme_> the map didnt open in editor ok ? so i used tw_anti_map_protection
19:56 <+killme_> to unlock it but in editor "server settings" didnt show any command
19:56 <+killme_> ah yes good idea
19:56 <+killme_> deen thank you rly
20:01 <@deen> np
20:06 <+killme_> deen it seems saved an a cfg file not inside the map 
20:06 <+killme_> i runed server by the offical map
20:06 <+killme_> the tune zones didnt work on server and in log didnet show any command
20:10 <+killme_> do you have any idea ? the map name is "zbSkyCraft" i just want tune zone commands of this map , i dont know why maper get lock the map rly idk
20:10 <@deen> ehm, that's not a regular ddnet map
20:10 <@deen> that's a special mod
20:10 <@deen> so maybe it doesn't even use tune zones
20:11 <@deen> and unfortunately the mod is not open source, sorry
20:13 <+killme_> i opend it in editor and i saw the tune zone tiles
20:14 <+killme_> ah , but i just want the tune zone commands for making map i didnt want mod or map or somthing more ...
20:14 <+killme_> #-o
