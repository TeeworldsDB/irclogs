04:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Just realised someone once added boost to teeworlds
04:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i was wondering why git was taking so much space
04:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> who dared?
04:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```
04:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> commit ef097cd77c36c1d5932fa37f49a26d5ed81aecd3
04:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Author: Allisone <qoo-ooq@gmx.de>
04:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Date:   Fri Nov 12 21:39:58 2010 +0100
04:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 
04:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn>     added MySQL support for Mac OS X 10.5 min 32bit and 64bit as team with GreYFoX
04:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```
04:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> lol, that's not the biggest commit we have, only 3rd one
04:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> `44.9MB ef097cd77c36c1d5932fa37f49a26d5ed81aecd3 7551`
04:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> I used this script: <https://confluence.atlassian.com/fishkb/determine-the-size-of-each-git-commit-292651328.html>
04:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> took around 8 minutes
06:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4619
06:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how do i use this on android?
06:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> try `scripts/android/cmake_android.sh`
06:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and this <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/scripts/android/README.md>
06:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait can i compile it while on android
06:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> probably not
06:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i guess i need to find someone to send me an apk
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> like the freeze stars?
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> So I make the PR finished for 16.2-rc4, and then we decide if we want to remove the freezebar completely again (to come up in the future with an better solution), or add an legacy option?
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I mean dropping complete freezebar can be done in one commit ^^ poor me wasting time. But that was kind of part of deal when working on some new visuals.

12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> admin go fuck yourself?
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> google translate agrees with my limited russian knowledge
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://kotaku.com/zachtronics-farewell-goodbye-closing-eliza-last-call-bb-1849096767
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> damn
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my favourite game studio is closing down
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not because of any reason but because they want to
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually a good article
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when people start calling other puzzle games "zach-like" you know their shit is good
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sad
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098840/ZACHLIKE/
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> great insight on game dev
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (authors of <https://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/TIS100/>)
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw this is the author of infiniminer, the game that inspired minecraft
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Rip zachtronics
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you know the most weird thing
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is that he is retiring to go work teaching high school kids
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (probs about programming)
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The article says he didnt like teaching as much as he expected and he definitely wants to do something to do with games
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i iread through 3 reddits about the teaching xD
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but they will release a last game
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that has several minigames inside
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did just wake up, I might have misread it that is also possible :D
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> of the size of atleast TIS-100
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> july 5th
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdU-ABucIjk
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would rather die than become a high school teacher if hs kids are anything like they are in turkey
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> same
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> High school kids are the most toxic creatures on earth
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are evil too
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they with ruthlessly bully teachers if they see a inch of weakness
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i saw that when i was in high school
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there was one teacher that seemed.. a bit stupid
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and oh god
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> depends on the school üòõ
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a public high school
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We had this physics teacher that put so much work into his classes. He was one of the only teachers that used the labs and stuff. They sucked the life out of the guy in one year, the man turned his lectures into just looking at a book
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think we had some healthy relationships with teachers
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> where everyone can go
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well same most of the time
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also had a good relationship with a teacher
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he got me into linux and python
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats sad
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had a decent relationship with most my teachers for I didn't act like a troglodyte
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i guess thats why most teachers end up like that
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as time goes
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you may not have but there was always a stupid annoying kid trying to be a clown
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's an essential type of student, I think every hs has a clown
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that was definitely not me for a long time
12:56 <+ChillerDragon> what exactly is your BlockWorlds branch even about? @Nouaa its not the official BW that runs on bombay servers is it? Is it you building up on the leaked version? Is it your open source rewrite? Are there any servers running it? Who is this for?
13:04 <+ChillerDragon> And i cant build it https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/m0
13:04 <+ChillerDragon> but if a pointer derefrence segfaults just add a if statement if the pointer is null beforehand
13:10 <+ChillerDragon> Any gnomies here? Who knows what changed with window tabbing? .-.
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> it's just a simple branch that should only contain cosmetics that could be added to BW's srvs, + it is in no way about leaking
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> weird, gonna check tonight
13:40 <+ChillerDragon> i see
13:40 <+ChillerDragon> so its open contribution fork to close src project :D 
13:41 <+ChillerDragon> omg im crying seems like a gnome update broke my hack client lmao
13:41 <+ChillerDragon> not that this is making any sense
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> my game just randomy crashed:
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/989866493284065390/unknown.png

14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> Someone already reported that issue
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> where?
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> In #bug i think
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> It was 1 or 2 weeks ago
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> In #bugs i think
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5475 this?
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I don't think that's related to my crash though
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (–ú–∞–∫—Å)> Forgot psw, I'll reply after xd
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (–ú–∞–∫—Å)> From moderation practice x)
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (–ú–∞–∫—Å)> From moderation practice x) This guy banned (for block, not for this). Close off-topic

14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> yes, again, I don't think it's related to my crash
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> (or leading to my crash)
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ham5terzilla (–ú–∞–∫—Å)> replyed
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what do u need the apk for
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it doesnt contain joystick or smth
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What's the exact version?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> nightly
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> actually, I haven't updated yet
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> so... the build from yesterday I guess üòÑ
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @murpi r u using opengl 1.x?
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> yes
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do u remember the map it happened on?
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Deadline 1
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also is there a reason to use opengl 1.x?
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> No, I probably forgot to change it
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok, weird that it crashes tho, might be completly unrelated to what the crashlog has shown üòÑ
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> It was quite sudden, nothing special happening ^^

16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> apparently it was a Data Execution Prevention violation
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this sounds rather creepy tbh
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that means it tried to run heap code, can ofc just be an incidence
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that means it tried to run heap code, can ofc just be an coincidence
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Learath2 your judgment? How likely does memory corruption cause DEP?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> To me this sounds like a real edge case.. maybe the vtable was broken somehow?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or an outside program like discord was faulty?
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dev7z | Mandalina> i cant believe i doscovered this just now
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, maybe stack corruption? you'd have to be very lucky to write a pointer properly aligned right on top of the return address though
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It could also be a vtable that got destroyed, do you have the address it tried to run in the heap?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> did u always read irclogs or what
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> stop add cheating for ddnet :_:  remove swap
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dev7z | Mandalina> yes
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> savage
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dev7z | Mandalina> i though i was pro dorker
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We added /timeout many years ago, since then swapping is possible
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2022/05/unpaid-social-media-moderators/
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 3.4 million only? i'd assume much higher values tbh
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–Ø—Å–Ω–æ –ü–æ–Ω—è—Ç–Ω–æ> who know, what i need choose to get more fps

19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> bottom to top
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Vulkan > OpenGL 3.3.0 > OpenGL 3.0.0 > OpenGL 1.4.0
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <APFFF> idk how connecting to a server is implemented but it would be a really cool if you would be put into a waiting queue to join a full server. FIFO
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We don't want that. We have enough empty servers around for everyone
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't want 50 people waiting to join a full 64 player server, just join a different server and others will come
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <APFFF> I can see that
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Better teach new players how to switch map
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> If I select vulkan, it falls back to custom OpenGL 2.0.0 :(
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> whats ur gpu
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> some intel
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but which
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u can see it in f1 in purple text before u search xd
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> OH.
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I'm using integrated gpu.
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> That's the reason it heat up and crash from time to time
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> @Not Keks
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Is there a way to reset video and keep racing?
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I usually join with another client and try to swap.
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Crashed client works correctly, but shows nothing on screen, inputs are correctly handled
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u can disconnect your internet, then close client
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then connect internet again
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I will try this way
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <crqch> literally me aswell, searched the fps phrase thats why im responding 9 hours after, did you found any fix to that issue?
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> When more slots? 0.0
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@deen)
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> fddrace ftw
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i never had to wait longer than a few minutes to connect to a full stronghold server
