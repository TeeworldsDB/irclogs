04:15 < bamcane> @deen Could you add my server 43.139.181.32 into the master whitelist? Thanks.
07:20 < bridge> <reitw> Why would there be a whitelist
09:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> does anyone know what they mean by "NFC patch."
09:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> > It looks like the Core.h changes are just reformatting, which should be done in its own NFC patch.

09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> forgejo is nice
09:41 < bamcane> Hello everyone
09:41 < bamcane> Now i meet a problem
09:42 < bamcane> I code a function SendChatLocalize and i use str_format to format the string
09:42 < bamcane> I tried use GNUC_ATTRIBUTE
09:43 < bamcane> but it was useless
09:43 < bamcane> What should I do?
09:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> what is you actual problem right now? are you having trouble using SendChatLocalize?, ,
09:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> what is you actual problem right now? are you having trouble using SendChatLocalize?
09:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> what is you actual problem right now? are you having trouble using the function?
09:45 < bamcane> No but the warning
09:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> send a screenshot please
09:49 < bamcane> https://github.com/Bamcane/issues-files/blob/main/Screenshot_20240309_164635.png
09:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> code looks fine ? - what is the error/warning
10:05 < bamcane> I think that's because the string: SendChatLocalize -> Localize -> str_format
10:06 < bamcane> and Localize read a variable so GCC couldn't know the format args.
10:15 < bridge> <zhn> pFormat being not string literal
10:16 < bridge> <zhn> we have the same rn üêà
10:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> <a:stepfunnslam:1031597809322962994>
10:19 < bamcane> zhn: so how should i fix it?
10:25 < bridge> <zhn> theres nothing to fix actually but if it annoys you, you can search for silencing this warning on all compilers you use
10:25 < bridge> <zhn> clang and msvc for example
10:27 < bridge> <zhn> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7159348/disable-single-warning-error
10:33 < bridge> <zhn> an answer has
10:33 < bridge> <zhn> for msvc
10:33 < bridge> <zhn> ```cpp
10:33 < bridge> <zhn> pragma warning( push )
10:33 < bridge> <zhn> #pragma warning( disable : 4774)
10:33 < bridge> <zhn> // Your function
10:33 < bridge> <zhn> #pragma warning( pop ) 
10:33 < bridge> <zhn> ```
10:33 < bridge> <zhn> for clang
10:33 < bridge> <zhn> ```cpp
10:33 < bridge> <zhn> #pragma clang diagnostic push
10:33 < bridge> <zhn> #pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wformat-nonliteral"
10:33 < bridge> <zhn> // your function
10:33 < bridge> <zhn> #pragma clang diagnostic pop```
10:34 < bridge> <zhn> forgot # for first one x)
10:37 < bamcane> Thanks, but i found a other way
10:38 < bamcane> the warning is because `void str_format(char *buffer, int buffer_size, const char *format, ...)
10:38 < bamcane> GNUC_ATTRIBUTE((format(printf, 3, 4)));`
10:38 < bamcane> so i code a str_format_nowarn without GNUC_ATTRIBUTE((format(printf, 3, 4)))
10:50 < bridge> <robyt3> You should add `GNUC_ATTRIBUTE((format(printf, X, Y)))` to your new functions instead of ignoring the warnings
10:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Also, I'd use regular varargs instead of templates for `SendBroadcastLocalize` and use `str_format_v` internally instead

11:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not rly a spoiler but anyway
13:26 < bridge> <Peakies> I'll never install arch again, it's rape my ass to fix EFI partition for dual boot :cammostripes:
13:35 < bridge> <peter44h> The problem is the dual boot, not arch
13:35 < bridge> <peter44h> For sure not worth the effort
13:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Just use arch and no windows
13:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Problem solved
13:38 < bridge> <Peakies> no that was my own fault that format my old efi partition then had to download windows iso file to able restore it
13:39 < bridge> <Peakies> I'm okay to have only linux but for some games and application really need windows
13:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Peakies I also recommend against dual boot. You can still keep windows just get two disks.
13:54 < bridge> <Peakies> you mean install linux on two different hard drive ?
13:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> every os with their own boot loader on one hard drive
13:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then you can use your bios to boot from a disk and this way chose a os
13:55 < bridge> <Peakies> oh and for switch using bios boot menu right ?
13:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then on os install you can just let it take the entire disk and its easy and smooth
13:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
13:56 < bridge> <Peakies> they already installed on different hard but for grub I added both entry on same efi partition
13:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if that annoys you dont bother :D just use the bios
13:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> set the boot order to match which os you boot into more often. And if you need another one spam f12 while booting your pc and select another one. 
13:57 < bridge> <Peakies> for now it's fine just had some issues with nvidia fucking driver to install then I fixed everything and it's ready to compile ddnet üòÑ
13:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_36yNWw_07g
13:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if nvidia wasn't better performance and feature wise i would love to switch to amd seems to be smoother
13:58 < bridge> <Peakies> yeah I did this method for months before but I thought should try something new like grub boot loader
13:58 < bridge> <Peakies> agree üòÑ
13:59 < bridge> <Peakies> on windows it's fine to use really easy to install it's driver and etc on linux it's trying to fuck everything and really hard to choice what driver version should install to after reboot be able see desktop manager once again üòÑ
14:03 < bridge> <Peakies> and have question is there any opensource client that have some kind of shaking screen effect or something, I want to add jump scare for my client and want to add shake effect when scary screen load to be more effective

23:17 < bridge> <nouaa> :kek:
23:17 < bridge> <nouaa> @archimede67 alright looks like you won
23:17 < bridge> <0xdeen> Paypal deducted a 2.86 ‚Ç¨ fee. I could try sending it back to you and you can try transferring it to "to a friend" instead of "for a product", then there is no fee (at least in some countries)
23:18 < bridge> <0xdeen> I'm afraid though that maybe the fee still stays at Paypal if I return the payment
23:18 < bridge> <nouaa> meh it's fine I guess
23:18 < bridge> <0xdeen> > If you refund a payment for goods or services, there are no fees to process the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller are not returned to you.
23:18 < bridge> <nouaa> :pepeFakeHappy:

23:29 < bridge> <0xdeen> yes, you can
23:30 < bridge> <0xdeen> I do that all the time because I don't trust Paypal, they are not a bank and they can just lock your money for whatever reason
23:30 < bridge> <0xdeen> but anyway, don't sweat the timing, just wait a few days, not in a rush
23:32 < bridge> <peter44h> Are there any options that don't involve paypal?
23:36 < bridge> <learath2> We took bitcoin for a while, and I think @0xdeen let some people do a bank transfer
23:46 < bridge> <zhn> is it real to forward format string (which are never user-provided) into constructor without getting -Wformat-no-literal?
23:46 < bridge> <zhn> just slapping attribute on top does nothing as i see
23:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> Damn you cooked
23:49 < bridge> <robyt3> I guess you need one location where you ignore the warning, if you unpack the format string from a netmessage or something like that. But you should add proper validation there to ensure it's a valid format string for the given arguments.
23:51 < bridge> <zhn> i added derived class from `CHttpRequest` and instead of putting here raw urls i did a little hack to pass just an arguments to build the url
23:52 < bridge> <zhn> so instead of doing another layer between derived and base class that just formats all the things (but it will require to pass format string into ctor anyway ig) i did some private struct that just does the same with proxy-ctor
23:53 < bridge> <robyt3> What problem are you trying to solve?
23:53 < bridge> <zhn> url building to pass into `CHttpRequest` ctor
23:54 < bridge> <robyt3> You don't need to add a derived class for that
23:55 < bridge> <zhn> derived class has another functionality, i just have this problem too
23:55 < bridge> <robyt3> See for example the `CEditor::ShowFileDialogError` function on how to pass varargs from one functions to `str_format_v`
23:57 < bridge> <zhn> nah the problem is not passing the arguments but passing the format string that comes straight into ctor
23:58 < bridge> <zhn> and ctor for some whatever reason don't get this attribute
23:58 < bridge> <zhn> doesn't*
23:58 < bridge> <zhn> like it just ignores it
