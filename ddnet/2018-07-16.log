02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I need some help:
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I cloned ddnet 11.0.3 and compiled it using CMake and Visual Studio.
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Now when I'm in the browser (ingame or not on any server) the entite game starts to lag if something is written in the search box and I refresh.
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> This is not the case in the official release 11.0.3, just in my (I didnt touch the code, just compiled)
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I need some help:

08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> better ask ddnet, its their source
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @qshar what do you think this channel is? ^^
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mh... does someone know a good profiler for windows? ðŸ™‚
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> ufff. I thought it was a PM message :feelsamazingman: . Sorry
10:03 <@deen> heinrich5991: VTune is the only one I used that's available on Windows. Some more here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67554/whats-the-best-free-c-profiler-for-windows
10:12 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #1203: %s -> '%s' (master...TwNameConvention) https://git.io/fNYqG
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can anyone help with my problem?
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. the idea would be to check where the code spends most of its time
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this can be done using a profiler
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's why I asked for a profiler for windows
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can you do the exact same thing that i did and then look if it laggs for you too if you refresh while something is written in the search bar?
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> These are my steps:
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```git clone https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cd ddnet
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> git checkout a00d4112a747de736cb618a4b54b92b91e01cff8
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> git submodule update --init --recursive```
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> execute these and then compile it using visual studio
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> x64-release
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't have access to a windows computer right now, unfortunately
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can someone else with a windows pc check that?
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know anyone using a windows PC
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (and also having the tools to compile)
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @onby @qshar does anyone of you have a windows system to test this?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> nope, I don't use windows for compiling
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> no sry
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> You just need to compile in release mode
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they claim to do that: "x64-release"
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Fokkonount claims allot
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Vs has a profiler, but probably that isn't free enough for u xd I compile fine with vs however
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> me too but i have these weird laggs when something is in the search bar and i refresh
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i compiled it in x64-release
19:20 <+Learath2> I'm so going to need glasses :(
19:25 <+Ryozuki> :o
19:50 <+Im__corneum> is it hard to add serverside tees as a mapper which dont take server slots, they would have to react to teleporters as well and everything. but i think this would make the dummy section a lot easier for starters if you can just pick up a simulated tee at the start and go with it. wold aslo be cool for mappers to have a tees physic in maybe only one part of a solo map. or add 4 tees on one part so you can boat solo. that would be prett
19:50 <+Im__corneum> -ty nice to have. i have seen such a thing before on other servers
19:51 <@deen> would also significantly reduce client hackiness, since dummy is ugly and should be removed ^
19:51 <@deen> so I'd support it if someone wants to make serverside dummies in ddnet
19:52 <+Im__corneum> if you want to see such a tee in action, i think thee are such ones in the lobby thing from that popular blocker server network
19:55 <@heinrich5991> I think client-side dummies have better controllability
19:57 <+Im__corneum> hm yeah thats right.. i was mainly think about placing multiple tees throughout a solo dummy mixed map so you have their hook and bounce behavior. maybe a few dummymaps can be updated with that feature, would be cool if its onbly the easy ones.
19:58 <+Konsti> i would really like the thing im corneum suggested but as additional thing NOT as an replacement for normal dummy
19:58 <@heinrich5991> yep
19:58 <+Im__corneum> ye i meant it as an addition. a new spawn tile 
19:59 <+Konsti> Teephysics like a tee "tile" would be amazing and give a lot things for mappers creating nice part
19:59 <+Konsti> s
20:00 <+Im__corneum> yeah. you could just put a tee into a 1x1 block and use that special physic. you could do that now with a dummy on last part but you would have to kill it anually
20:00 <+Im__corneum> manually*
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> adding on above, if there were a type of entity block that could be dragged around (same physics as tees) it could be used in maps
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> i.e. you have to collect 5 "keys" (which would be those blocks) to finish the map
20:13 <+Im__corneum> well thats just checkpoints in a sense. and its possible with switchen
20:13 <+Im__corneum> switches*
20:13 < Ttt_> Why use irc instead of discord?
20:14 <+Im__corneum> i have no permission
20:14 <+Ttt_> On discord?
20:14 <+Im__corneum> yes
20:14 <+Ttt_> Why
20:14 <+Im__corneum> many people dont have permission to reduce spam and trolls
20:15 <+Ttt_> Why do i have permission i have been banned many times xD
20:15 <@heinrich5991> "If you want to have write access, PM an Admin, e.g. @heinrich5991"
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> yes, but for example you could have more complex dummy maps by making the player drag 2 dummies
20:17 <+Im__corneum> yes, there are a lot of new possebilities.  i hope it gets added
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> you can simulate it by making a teeskin and pasting an entity block as the body xd.
20:21 <+Im__corneum> would be coll if you can choose the skin :D
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> What if the srvside dummy needs to press a d or space
20:21 <+Im__corneum> read again
20:21 <+Im__corneum> its not a replacement
20:22 <+Im__corneum> but some easy dummymaps may be updated for beginners
