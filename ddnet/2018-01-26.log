13:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ``[5a6b1e79][net]: failed to bind socket with domain 10 and type 1 (99 'Cannot assign requested address')
13:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> `` what?
17:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 you know what is the commit/patch that adds 64p support to ddnet?
17:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> i want it for a tw mod but don't want make it based on ddnet, i think it would be to bloated
17:36 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki it's not a single commit that adds it, unfortunately
17:36 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> :(
17:36 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> are they somewhat close to each other?
17:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> oh
17:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> i think there was a vanilla 64p mod of tw right?
17:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Matodor> @Ryozuki i have
17:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> isnt it on teeworlds.com?
17:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Matodor> https://github.com/eeeee/teeworlds/tree/tw32
18:00 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> for some reason ger servers arent appearing on serverlist for a lot of players
18:00 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> but i can connect to the servers
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> without seeing htem
19:30 <+Learath2> https://github.com/eeeee/teeworlds/tree/ddrace64 it should all still be based on this iirc
20:50 <+eeeee> Ryozuki: vanilla is not maintained, i think ddnet-based makes more sense at this point even if a bit bloated
20:52 <+eeeee> maybe you can invest some time into making it more modular (so that you can just "turn off" the ddnet features you don't want) instead of spending the same amount of time backporting the features (like 64p) from ddnet to vanilla
20:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> i guess that would be the best yeah
20:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ddpp has vanilla mode
20:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> i wont use ddpp
20:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> it can turn on normal pickps and damage
20:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> :p
