00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <blacktyper> i have one question
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> go ahead
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <blacktyper> how the f u guzs are hosting server
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <blacktyper> servers*
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we rent a vps and run our servers on them
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <blacktyper> ough
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> guess waking up at 6 isn't enough to beat @heinrich5991 ðŸ˜›
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ddnet.tw appears to be down
10:08 <@deen> thanks, fixed
10:10 <@deen> of course Debian ships an outdated certbot with bugs: https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/auto-renewal-started-failing-with-error-missing-command-line-flag-or-config-entry-for-this-setting/111211
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> today i thought i only had to count abc and xyz as yes
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im a bit retarded
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i finished <a:sadSnail:785072987815804929>
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u know about hashset and hashmap today was one of the easiest
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :justatest:
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepe_straight:
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You just need a set, part 1 was union, part 2 was intersection, that's it ðŸ˜›
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepe_straight:
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen which language are you doing today? ðŸ™‚
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD | allocaãƒ„> had fun writing this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3klHLJyhmjo
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD | allocaãƒ„> 
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD | allocaãƒ„> weird protip: use discord as a cloud by beeing to lazy to pay for nitro and secure your data into 8 megabyte chunks on a custom server :jaouis:
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Feels so early 2000s ðŸ˜„
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sounds like a fun project, but I think most any implementation of zip already has both encryption and splitting support, no?
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD | allocaãƒ„> true, but I use my own AES implementation which has different rounds. you should never do this btw, always use a library *cough*
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That and software AES is slooow
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD | allocaãƒ„> yeah i guess :happy:
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD | allocaãƒ„> but speed doesnt really matter, this was 170 megabyte so this was rougly 5-6 megabyte / second which I think is fine
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD | allocaãƒ„> as I am encrypting once every two weeks maybe
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 I was lazy, just python: https://github.com/def-/adventofcode-2020/blob/master/day06a.py
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh yeah, intersection would've been easier for part 2
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/edg-l/adventofcode-2020/blob/master/day6.rs>
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my day 6 :pepe_straight:

12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> abusing this for fun
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah wait
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i can improve it
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> now

17:01 <+ChillerDragon> cool that your ide shows the type at the end of the line
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> just noticed that too. what ide is this?
17:02 <+ChillerDragon> emacs :troll:
17:03 <+ChillerDragon> ah ReD you changed ur yt name? I wondered what that channel does in my subs
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> can skin downloader try to get soin from different sources same time?
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> bind a +left; skin_download_url 1.com
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> bind d +right; skin_download_url 2.com
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i wonder if that would work
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if one server responded that it doesn't have a skin, the client remembers and doesn't request that skin again
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> meh
18:51 <+ChillerDragon> bind a "+left; skin_download_url 1.com;quit"
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> What is the default `cl_skin_download_url` ? I changed it :justatest:
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://skins.ddnet.tw/skin/
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Oh I tried without the subdomain, ty
