15:20 < laxa> deen: I am trying to build ddnet amd64 for windows
15:20 < laxa> everything is supposed to be smooth
15:21 < laxa> but I can't find why the linker is trying to link with libopus.lib :(
15:21 < laxa> servers compiles and links well
15:22 < laxa> it's appending .lib instead of .dll
16:54 < o_be_one> hello ::)
17:22 <@deen> laxa: laxa with visual studio?
17:22 < laxa> yes
17:22 < laxa> but should change anything
17:22 < laxa> server linked perfectly well
17:22 <@deen> I think we're missing libopusfile-0.lib for win64
17:23 <@deen> and visual studio needs that, gcc not
17:23 <@deen> it's there for win32

17:23 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/423
17:23 < laxa> that's my bat script to build teeworlds
17:23 <@deen> so I guess you could build a new libopusfile for us with visual studio and we can then add that
17:24 < laxa> but the problem is not the lib
17:24 < laxa> there is the correct .dll associated
17:24 < laxa> windows doesn't use .lib
17:24 <@deen> sure it does
17:24 < laxa> wut ?
17:24 <@deen> visual studio needs .lib files to link libraries afaik
17:24 < laxa> it tries to link to libopus-file-0.lib or smt
17:24 < laxa> when there is the same file with .dll
17:24 <@deen> i know, look in other/opus/lib{32,64}
17:24 < laxa> .lib is dynamic library for linux
17:24 < laxa> windows extension is .dll
17:25 < laxa> not the same file format
17:25 < laxa> windows is PE
17:25 < laxa> linux is ELF
17:25 < laxa> .lib = ELF
17:25 < laxa> .dll = PE
17:25 <@deen> linux uses .so, not .lib
17:25 < laxa> ah right
17:25 < laxa> static linc
17:25 < laxa> I am stupid ^^
17:25 <@deen> just google for visual studio .lib files
17:26 <@deen> i just know that they're needed and we don't have one
17:26 < laxa> I'll do that later
17:26 <@deen> and i can't create one because installing visual studio takes hours
17:26 < laxa> you could make one with mingw I guess
17:26 < laxa> or from cross compilation
17:28 < laxa> but why have both static and dynamical library ?
17:29 <@deen> i don't know how it works
17:30 <@deen> if you can figure out how to build in visual studio without .lib file, tell me or change the build files directly
17:30 < laxa> Either you use dynamic libraries or static ones, but not both for me
17:30 < laxa> ok
17:30 < laxa> I'll try that
17:31 <@deen> here, i googled for you: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2375065/visual-studio-what-exactly-are-lib-files-used-for
17:31 <@deen> "There are also stub .lib which provide just the definitions of functions which are contained in a .dll file. The .lib file is used at compile time to tell the compiler what to expect from the function, but the code is loaded at run time from the dll."
17:31 < laxa> Right
17:31 < laxa> Makes sense, but .h are there for that normally ^^
17:39 < laxa> Well, curl.lib also missing
17:40 < laxa> Instead of using .lib, .h should be sufficient, but my knowledge is too poor to fix that quickly
