02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is it normal that there are almost daily ladybugs in my room?
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @fokkonaut be glad it arent boybugs
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut quite common, I had also had that a few years ago, they found a way in through the shades
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i only have bugs in my code
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> woot first SDL contributions now curl?
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> when fix linux kernel @Learath2 ?
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> when it causes a bug in ddnet or teeworlds I guess ðŸ˜›
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen I dont want a nest in my room xf
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd*
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 can you also merge the accompanying branch in ddnet-libs?
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @onby ^ crash
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I count 141 crashes on RUS in 1 week alone
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen in case there's a problem, you can `rm libantibot.so; ln -s libantibot-null.so libantibot.so` btw
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the `servers/` directory
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> as long as it only happens on shutdown I don't mind much
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but should be fixed in a few days
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, looking into it
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 just a null check before the fclose is needed i think
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually I see no way that's NULL :/
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `AntibotShutdown` gets called twice
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's the root problem
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, why would the destructor get called twice?
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `OnShutdown` calls the destructor and then calls constructor again (via `Clear`)
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and then the destructor gets called again because `CGameContext` is destroyed
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. `Antibot` needs to handle its shutdown from a function that is called in `OnShutdown` I guess?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or you could have the antibot have a initialized flag, if the flag isn't set the destructor is a no-op?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds more like a hack to me
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the destructor and the constructor are shortcomings of the OOP pattern as an incomplete object can be constructed
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ive never seen crash on shutdown on my servers :o
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @onby yes, glue code strikes again
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> oo
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> which file is even opened
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `/dev/null`
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> quality crash
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol why
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I agree that first one was meh, but I think the 2 acceptable solutions is to either check that the resources exist before deallocating them (to handle the incomplete object case) or as you said call antibot destroy onshutdown instead of the destructor
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> or remove opening dev null file
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and either output to a real file
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby double call to the destructor
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> or remove that code entirely
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> oh
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @fokkonaut ladybugs are actually pretty usefull animals
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen anything against merging https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2071?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 nope, good to go
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> something is wrong about ger2, i am getting very different pings between servers
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/691733085754228817/2020-03-23-223905-screenshot.png

20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> somehow packets delays constantly
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @nori yeah, that's a rather common problem. some ports get prioritized
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 does it make sense to maybe stop GER2?
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I don't think it's performing up to the expectations
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no point spending money on it
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, we can stop it

23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BÂµmM>> servers crash everytime i want to vote
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @<BÂµmM> which server? which port?
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Oblikumquat> all servers
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> tell me one where you tried
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Oblikumquat> ger and usa
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jawsh> ^
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> port
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ?
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Oblikumquat> server doesn't crash, just client gets disconnected
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BÂµmM>> ger2 8305
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BÂµmM>> ye
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BÂµmM>> ger 8328
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Oblikumquat> usa 8304
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looking into it, thanks
