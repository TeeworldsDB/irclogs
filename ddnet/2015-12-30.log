12:34 <@EastByte> WolfAlex: hard to find such a bug without a coredump
12:35 < WolfAlex> EastByte: yea ik, just want to tell you
18:53 < deen> many linux distros create a coredump by default (i think)
18:55 < deen> at least on gentoo I have dozens of core files lying around and on archlinux there's /var/lib/systemd/coredump
19:52 < deen> if anyone wants to fix a bug, this seems to be one: http://www.megazonet.in/teeworlds/uncategorized/new-teeworlds-bug/
