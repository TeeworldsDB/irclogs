10:37 <@deen> eeeee: websocket doesn't work with bindaddr?
10:37 <@deen> at least on Chile I see "ERR: ERROR on binding to port 8303 (-1 98)"
10:38 < eeeee> don't believe i tested that
10:38 <@deen> oh, maybe that's a problem with the server though
10:38 <@deen> Only seems to happen on a few ports
10:39 <@deen> but it filled up the logs, that's how I noticed
10:39 < eeeee> maybe you have something else on that tcp port?
10:43 < eeeee> code looks like it should be passing the addr correctly https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/243ed93fdf6d60cd37b566cac904dde5cf952642/src/base/system.c#L1150
10:43 <@deen> yeah yeah, it's a weird config system
10:43 <@deen> somehow the server starts the daemon scripts twice
10:43 <@deen> no idea why yet
10:44 < eeeee> hmm okay, good luck with that :)
10:44 <@deen> wrong alarm, sorry
10:44 < eeeee> np. also did we hear back from that guy who reported the map download problem?
10:44 < eeeee> is that resolved now?
10:44 <@deen> I don't even remember that :/
10:44 <@deen> but I changed the fastdl setting!
10:45 <@deen> so we have the same one as vanilla default now, should be better now
10:46 < eeeee> we can hope that that guy is doing well now and don't have the issue anymore since he didn't come back
10:47 <@deen> yeah
10:48 <@deen> we should replace CAN and GER with ICELAND
10:50 < eeeee> there's a disproportionate amount of internets hooked up to iceland for some reason
10:50 <@deen> because it's right between north america and europe, so when you run a cable between them, you can hook up iceland cheaply as well
10:55 < eeeee> according to http://cablemap.info/ it has a 40tb cable (although it's a 3-way cable as you said, not sure how does that work)
10:56 <@deen> with a switch under the sea
10:56 <@deen> router, dunno
10:57 < eeeee> well they must be getting only a part of that, because 40tbit would be like 124mbit per capita :D
10:57 <@deen> they need to amplify signals all the time anyway, so they have power as well
10:57 <@deen> haha, sure. but lots of server farms in iceland
10:58 <@deen> cheap energy, outside air is fine for cooling, ok ping to Europe and east coast
10:58 <@deen> even if they don't exist yet, they should :D
