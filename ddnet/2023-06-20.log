00:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> is there any mechanism for embedding resources into the game atm
00:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think it would be wise to bake the default skin into the game
00:29 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> what if you want to change what the default akin looks like
00:29 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> what if you want to change what the default skin looks like
00:29 <+bridge> <Ewan> then you provide default.png
00:29 <+bridge> <totar> std::embed in c++ 29 :)
00:29 <+bridge> <Ewan> embed is already in c23
00:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> just not cpp
00:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> and there are definitely ways to do it otherwise
00:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> linker tricks
00:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> and windows resources
00:30 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> we could embed the useless images no one mods like the f1 and f2 decor stuff
00:30 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> or blob
00:31 <+bridge> <totar> tell me if you figure out anything reasonable I also want to embed stuff
00:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> it's ez
00:31 <+bridge> <totar> ok how then
00:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://github.com/graphitemaster/incbin
00:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> u can also use bin2h
00:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> compile time step to turn data into a c array
00:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> i just wonder if there is an existing thing ddnet has for it
00:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> this works with msvc but i wouldn't recommend using it because the resources way is what's supported
00:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> i would abstract it
00:32 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> what type of stuff :o
00:33 <+bridge> <totar> just this image lol
00:33 <+bridge> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120481422252195930/212435433-55e4e969-64ed-4ab2-8652-91901d2314a9.png
00:33 <+bridge> <totar> tela made it :)
00:33 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ah
00:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> you shouldn't have to embed it
00:33 <+bridge> <totar> yeah but its easier that way
00:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> hmm
00:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> wow i didn't realize png loading was so deeply integrated into the graphics backend
00:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> wow i didn't realize png loading was so deeply integrated into the graphics implementation
00:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> that Sucks
00:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> i figured it'd just take a blob of data and decode like sane people would make it do
00:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> not a file path
00:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> i have to reconsider things
01:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> xd
01:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120490546880843846/image.png
01:18 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> https://github.com/emuzulu/isEven @ryozuki you know what to do
01:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> i'm glad we have a library like this
01:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> finally someone addresses the need to determine whether a number is even or not
01:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> and they have multiple langauge implementations wow
01:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> like if u agree
01:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120498758921228348/image.png
01:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think i might keep the load function on the other thread so you can offload things like png decoding as well
01:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> cuz atm it stutters quite a bit
01:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> the file contents are loaded on the other thread but their data is being used on the main thread and decompressed there
04:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120543294619922493/image.png

04:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> wuh
04:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> how fix
04:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> ok it fixed itself
04:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> idk what was making it do that
04:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> there was nothing cargo running
07:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You can do that
07:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The graphics what take raw pointers in an overload
07:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No. If we don't aim for .exe only, then there will be other resources and dlls anyway. The data dir should be seen as read only anyway
07:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You just increase exe file with that without any return
08:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120595526317002862/image.png
08:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> no, this is the only overload
08:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> i guess it's not an overload if it's the only one lol
08:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Bro then a different function
08:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Don't parse every conversation like a bot
08:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I bet the name is 90% the same
08:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> beep bop
08:48 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> :think_bot:
09:40 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
10:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hey, please be less insulting
10:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok seriously. Insult?
10:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Heinrich sometimes i have the feeling u abuse ur powers here.
10:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I kindly asked him to not parse every conversation like a computer
10:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> discuss moderation in DM
10:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not kindly though
10:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Bro
10:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar> I wrote "Bro" no need to time me out for this
10:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @Discord Mod i am not breaking any rules, help
10:12 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: you need to rejoin your ws-client btw
10:28 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> @mpft apparently the function you're looking for is called `LoadTextureRaw`
10:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> oh nice
10:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> sry i didn't mean to be so literal. i thought you meant there would be an actual overload of the function like there often is
10:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> a real overload is much easier to find than a similarly behaving function of a different name
10:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't like overloads, especially not for different functionality like here
10:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> with who?
10:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> everybody is afraid of u anyway
10:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> you have the power to remove others from staff
10:40 <+bridge> <deen> wtf are you talking about? You can talk to any admin in DM if you have complaints
10:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i already complained several times
10:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> for example to learath
10:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nothing is done anyway
10:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think Learath2 is afraid of me
10:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if nothing is done, another explanation is that it was deemed to be no issue
10:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its more like he rather not go against you i guess
10:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @deen i think you will always side with heinrich so i never seen u as an option to talk to
10:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i only considered learath but he kinda half ignores me
10:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> idk about murpi
10:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> he is newer  admin so i think he would also not go against heinrich, even if my complains are valid
10:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my complain is actually rly simple, just make heinrich be less stringent in this chat, i think he is too much and often kills good conversations, people use remarks, yeah you may not always be 100% the most polite, but humans interact this way, like jupstar case right now
10:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i also dont think we act on bad faith when we are like this
10:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and actually his really strict moderation brings bad vibes, and confrontation
10:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its a repeated issue if u have seen, idk
10:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> thanks for coming to my ted talk
10:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u can now ban me for breaking the rule of dicussing mod here
10:49 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I also don't think you act in bad faith. I still think that people should change their ways to become more accepting to newcomers and people who make mistakes. don't ridicule them, don't tell people they're stupid
10:52 <+bridge> <deen> I think it's just a cultural thing, and some people are used to a different kind of conversation culture. But since you don't know who you're talking to here, it's better to err on the side of caution. So just be nice to others, seems easy enough.
10:52 <+bridge> <ryozuki> thats the thing, to me, i never seen as not being that nice
10:52 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i guess its truly cultural then
10:53 <+bridge> <deen> yeah, but it can seem that way from the outside, or to people who don't know you well
10:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> too bad jupstar  is timeouted, from german culture, and cant give his points here
10:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> he was timed out for 5 minutes
10:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. he's not timed out anymore
10:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i still think its too strict anyway
10:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> does ddnet have a mail provider?
10:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> gandhi decided to not give mailboxes anyway
10:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and i use it for wiki
10:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think ddnet.org can receive mails
10:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > We also need to inform you of the end of the GandiMail service included with your domain (please note that the GandiMail service will end on November 30th, 2023). You can seamlessly convert to our new Mailbox service. In addition, we will introduce updates to our pricing policy effective July 13th 2023 for all our existing services and the new Mailbox service (EUR USD TWD ).
10:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i need to send em
10:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> well i need mail for myself so ill search some
11:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i wish i could just host it on my vps
11:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the thing that sucks tho is that cloudflare doesnt protect mail anyway so i need it on a separate vps, even if it worked
11:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> i wasn't trying to pick apart your sentence jupstar i just want u to know
11:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft isnt it 3 am there
11:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> Yea
11:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> I was playing halo
11:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> With a British buddy
11:28 <+bridge> <learath2> What did you expect? Last time you complained I found it reasonable, I came here, we had a chat about it. You not liking how he wants to moderate the discord isn't like abuse for example
11:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i cant expect anything since heinrich wants it like this
11:29 <+bridge> <learath2> We aren't going to pull out the guillotine because you want a more casual discord environment while he wants a more wholesom (and imo stiff) one
11:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 🇫🇷
11:38 <+bridge> <learath2> Fwiw it feels stiff (and a little fake) to me because in my native language, especially between friends swearing is extremely common and sterile language is extremely uncommon. I also grew up in the unhinged era of the internet, so even the nice communities I remember had almost no rules relating to conduct
11:39 <+bridge> <learath2> But it's not 2010 people don't come equipped with thick skin anymore, not every new person feels like they are our friends and not every language has people swearing like sailors
11:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> we are not swearing like sailors anyway
11:44 <+bridge> <learath2> Nah but you can be very mean, even unintentionally
11:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im passionate, and also i get frustrated, lack of change, things go the way one wants even if we discuss things
11:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im stupid for caring too much about a kirby game
11:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> it happens
12:06 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> btw: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6753 discusses asset handling, I think others also had an opinion on that
12:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> what, the embedded stuff?
12:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> Oh no the other stuff
12:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> Ok
14:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> waiting like a kid for the package to arrive
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> <a:monkeWait:1111870208945164330>
14:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 what is the bal thingy?
14:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120689118893056020/71JBznyYb4L.png
14:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i only see "balanced output" references
14:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think its for long cables
14:21 <+bridge> <learath2> Balanced output, each channel gets it's own ground
14:23 <+bridge> <learath2> and usually more power
14:24 <+bridge> <learath2> (the headphones you got don't have balanced input, so not important)
14:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i see
14:42 <+bridge> <louis.place> whats that bass knob do
14:43 <+bridge> <louis.place> nvm google is a good tool

14:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/anime-astralyang-nervous-anime-gif-20361849
14:44 <+bridge> <learath2> it's just a preset eq, I don't like the one on the e10k so I'd guess the one on the k3 isn't much better
14:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is software eq equivalent?
14:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> can i get the high khz on linux
14:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i guess yes
14:46 <+bridge> <learath2> yes, digital signal processing before the dac might even be more accurate
14:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nice
14:47 <+bridge> <learath2> no idea, but who cares, you'll probably never have sources that high quality
14:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> are there no subs doing that? xd
14:47 <+bridge> <learath2> you should be able to UAC2 is a standard
14:48 <+bridge> <learath2> subs?
14:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 in ddnet u can say the hz
14:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> anime subs
14:48 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> :justatest:
14:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> gotta hear the high quality oni chan
14:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
14:48 <+bridge> <louis.place> thought bro meant subwoofers for a sec
14:48 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i prefer 8kb
14:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 8bit
14:49 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> my waifu better sound like an xbox cod player
14:52 <+bridge> <learath2> lolno, 384 kBaud * 32 bit is 12kbps audio, the best bluray encode I can find for an actual movie is about 5kbps audio
14:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> f
14:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> good thing is its usb-c i can connect it to the mac and have actual aux ports
14:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the dac
14:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it powers itself with the usb-c?
14:55 <+bridge> <learath2> 384 kHz is actually way too high given the range of sounds humans hear
14:55 <+bridge> <learath2> y
14:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i wondewr if my phone can drive the headset xd
14:55 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ryoz is a dog
14:56 <+bridge> <learath2> easily
14:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rly?
14:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> Sound     Loudspeaker     Yes, with stereo speakers
14:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 3.5mm jack     Yes
14:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki>      24-bit/192kHz audio
14:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> redmi note 11 pro
14:57 <+bridge> <learath2> 384kHz is enough to reproduce up to 192kHz, the range is so wide it covers every living species
14:57 <+bridge> <learath2> An 60 ohm headphone is easily driven by any device nowadays, I find mine a little quiet on the phone but it still works just fine
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think the 599 is 50ohm
14:58 <+bridge> <learath2> less ohms, the easier to drive
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> Frequency response (speaker)
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 12 Hz to 38,500 Hz
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> Impedance
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 50 Ω
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> Sound pressure level (SPL)
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 106dB SPL (1kHz/1Vrms)
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> Total harmonic distortion (THD)
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> < 0.1% (1kHz, 100dBSPL)
14:59 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im afraid of carrying such expensive  thing on the street anyways
14:59 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:59 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i just use my jbl wireless
14:59 <+bridge> <learath2> Open backs are not enjoyable outside anyway
14:59 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
15:00 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i think you should build your own speaker like diy perks
15:01 <+bridge> <learath2> I guess 384kHz isn't quite enough if you need to generate bat calls
15:13 <+bridge> <louis.place> build ur own microphone
15:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/06/20/introducing-leadership-council.html

15:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://marabos.nl/atomics/
15:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i need to read this
15:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > Mara Bos has the best book of Concurrency (even better than the Concurrency in action with C++) https://marabos.nl/atomics/

15:50 <+bridge> <patiga> fancy comparison :), I wonder where twgpu spends the most time. I assume it runs on the vulkan backend?
15:51 <+bridge> <patiga> (however I try to ignore performance for now. its *hard* to make my brain not think about performance stuff all the time tho)
15:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno. But twgpu seems to load stuff before the window is created sadly. So I assume that's also the biggest bottleneck. Everything before the GPU is used
15:52 <+bridge> <patiga> and I think I know now how I can approach mipmaps for the atlases. mipmaps should come after the rest of the gameplay rendering stuff though. the last 1-2 weeks I actually had 0 time for twgpu, buuuuuut surely the next few weeks will be less stressful :)
15:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think I was already "too fair" removing a tiny framespan for twgpu since window creating takes around 100ms
15:53 <+bridge> <patiga> ah you are counting the time from window creation to a displayed image?
15:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well not for twgpu. But i tested a small map like ctf where it was instant
15:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So I assume whatever it does counts towards map loading
15:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ( the time spent before window creation)
15:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is ddnet-pg ur thing?
15:55 <+bridge> <patiga> yea window creation is the first thing it does, though that should be changed I guess. At adapter creation you can pass a `compatible_surface` parameter to ensure you can render on the window. I should instead pass `None` there and just quickly check manually later
15:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U sure about this?
15:56 <+bridge> <patiga> which part of it :p
15:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If the window is the very first thing created
15:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's mine
15:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Twgpu is his
15:56 <+bridge> <patiga> right after device creation I think
15:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But some part of the map is loaded before the window is created?
15:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That's what I experienced at least
15:57 <+bridge> <patiga> ah the map gets loaded on the cpu, and basically right after the window is created https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twgpu/-/blob/8bb9c111af10cf85da90ab04ea856530fc2fbf35/twgpu-tools/src/bin/twgpu-map-inspect.rs#L45
15:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah 👍
15:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That makes sense
15:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks it sounds like ddnet-postgresql
15:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And from that fact i removed like 200 Ms to compensate the loss while GPU is busy creating the surface
15:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Deen said same
15:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's simply a shortcut for playground
15:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> BCS i am 5 and play with learath who is 12 there
15:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The whole day
16:01 <+bridge> <patiga> aaah I enjoy the comparison and the implied performance questions, but I gotta go back to work xd
16:01 <+bridge> <patiga> I just gotta repeat
16:01 <+bridge> <patiga> Patiga, you shouldn't care about twgpu performance right now
16:01 <+bridge> <patiga> Patiga, you shouldn't care about twgpu performance right now
16:01 <+bridge> <patiga> Patiga, you shouldn't care about twgpu performance right now
16:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
16:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well i can tell you something before u leave
16:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Since I enabled benchmarks in my version
16:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Loading the internal images from the zlib compression is the slowest part for me
16:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Takes around 400ms
16:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If it would be png, it would probably be double as fast
16:03 <+bridge> <patiga> heh, yea I always hated that about map loading. its like >95% of the cpu time
16:03 <+bridge> <patiga> those are part of the 600ms in your comparison?
16:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes
16:03 <+bridge> <patiga> :o
16:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It also includes connecting to a local server
16:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Using quic
16:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> epic
16:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> quic
16:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> get it
16:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks when ready
16:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Almost xd
16:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i wanna play at 40k fps
16:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
16:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 😬
16:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well my goal is mainly to get to vanilla support. I'm not sure if I'm the best person to implement ddrace
16:05 <+bridge> <patiga> okay I leave now, and this time for real :p
16:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Build on vanilla, i want to create an fng mod
16:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Cya
16:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 😬
16:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> thanks for the link, let's see how that turns out
16:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> interesting bit from the rfc is, mod team or council team can decide to disband both at same time
16:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > As an absolute last resort, either the Council or the moderation team may choose to simultaneously dissolve both teams. Teams then select new representatives, and the contigent moderators become the interim moderation team and select successors.
16:50 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i got the packet, setup time
17:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's very interesting 😮
17:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> this would have helped that one other time
17:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> when "the core team is unaccoutable"
17:07 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> also interesting. not sure if I'll find the time to read it
17:07 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> wdym?
17:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i got it workin
17:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it rly sounds gooood
17:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i guess its normal the dac heats up a bit xd
17:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and these headphones are rly comfy
17:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the previous ones i had rly put pressure
17:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but they also passive closed sound
17:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> now i hear my keyboard lmao
17:34 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> the leadership council
17:34 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> empowering **everyone**
17:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > Empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software
17:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> refers to the rust lang itself
17:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its the motto
17:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.rust-lang.org/
17:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its not specific to the article
17:45 <+bridge> <BillionRay> yo my beautiful amigos, anyone know how setting CNetObj_PlayerInput works? It never seems to work properly for me and switches to some random weapon
17:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what are you doing?
17:46 <+bridge> <BillionRay> fooling around
17:46 <+bridge> <BillionRay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120741473932030052/image.png
17:46 <+bridge> <BillionRay> trying to get weapon selection working on demand
17:47 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Just getting this interface to work:
17:47 <+bridge> <BillionRay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120741675334119584/image.png
17:47 <+bridge> <BillionRay> fooling around
17:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> this kind of thing isn't allowed on ddnet servers ;?
17:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> this kind of thing isn't allowed on ddnet servers :/
17:47 <+bridge> <BillionRay> i dont play on ddnet servers
17:47 <+bridge> <BillionRay> for block
17:48 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i dont think its allowed on any server besides lan
17:48 <+bridge> <BillionRay> oh well then guess ill figure it out
17:48 <+bridge> <BillionRay> just a shame a lot of code isnt documented well so i have to go on a rabbit chase
17:48 <+bridge> <BillionRay> and find how it works by example
17:54 <+bridge> <BillionRay> oke figured it out i think, for some reason it doesnt use the weapons enums
17:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it would be a diferent story if u werent making a bot
17:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> if u were contributing a feature to ddnet u would get help
17:56 <+bridge> <BillionRay> i may contribute in the future
17:56 <+bridge> <BillionRay> but i dont really know the codebase well enough as of right now
17:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u started the wrong path
17:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's fine, as long as you don't publish your bot or use it where it's not allowed
17:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its kind of ironic to try to get help from here to do a bot, where we get the pains of defending against them
17:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but we don't really like helping to create bots
17:59 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i have some blog posts, they arent aimed at botting though, but u may learn something https://edgarluque.com/categories/ddracenetwork/
17:59 <+bridge> <BillionRay> fair enough, it is a shame though cause there is some stuff that isn't obvious in the source code without going down a rabbithole, like that array of size 200 with the predicted characters
18:00 <+bridge> <BillionRay> nice, thanks :D
18:00 <+bridge> <BillionRay> another botter helped !
18:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think it is obvious if u know more c++
18:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> do u know c++ at all?
18:00 <+bridge> <BillionRay> yes obviously
18:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> by answering that u dont know c++
18:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cuz nobody knows c++
18:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> in my opinion
18:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> trap question kek
18:01 <+bridge> <BillionRay> well sure, but I know it well enough to be productive
18:01 <+bridge> <BillionRay> i assume thats what you meant
18:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hmm idk about
18:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i remember u asking weird questions to learath
18:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> or maybe it was someone else
18:01 <+bridge> <BillionRay> hmm
18:01 <+bridge> <BillionRay> i did ask something a few months ago but im not sure what it was anymore
18:02 <+bridge> <BillionRay> this?
18:02 <+bridge> <BillionRay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120745454355886080/image.png
18:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> idk
18:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> dont bot xd
18:04 <+bridge> <BillionRay> no promises there 🦔
18:07 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i mean if you wanna not be able to play ddnet ever again thats on you
18:08 <+bridge> <BillionRay> ok, if you can prove that i actually use my client unfairly on ddnet servers or released that client to the public
18:33 <+bridge> <Chuky> türk varmı
18:36 <+bridge> <gerdoe> #off-topic
19:39 < furo> Hey @deen! I was messing around with the HTTP master server yesterday, and sending it "invalid" data. I set one of my clients name to the type null which I think broke your extract-master.py script as playtime for 2023-06-19 is 0 hours for everyone ;D sorry!
19:43 <@heinrich5991> furo: the http master server info field is free-form json
19:44 <@heinrich5991> I guess the extract-master.py script should be fixed
19:46 <+bridge> <steinchen99> Power saving day, wdym! Nobody played
19:48 <@heinrich5991> furo: what are you interested in? :)
19:49 <@heinrich5991> the client ignores what it considers malformed server info
19:50 < furo> yeah, I noticed that after some testing. I was mainly pointing out that it breaks that script and that it should be fixed.
19:51 <@heinrich5991> looking for security vulnerabilities?
19:55 < furo> I guess, just playing around wondering what would happen if I messed with the data. Conclusion? Just as you said, the client just ignores the server.
19:56 <@heinrich5991> the code for that is here, btw: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/e22e0c9777f1814e84fbe76cfdf3644676c6dc7f/src/engine/shared/serverinfo.cpp#L59-L178
20:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
20:08 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> :justatest:
20:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> would be awesome if u fix urself what u find
20:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> we should fuzz the script
20:11 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> what does that mean
20:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> a fuzzer?
20:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > A fuzzer is a program which injects automatically semi-random data into a program/stack and detect bugs. The data-generation part is made of generators, and vulnerability identification relies on debugging tools.
20:12 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh LOL
20:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing
20:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> >  An effective fuzzer generates semi-valid inputs that are "valid enough" in that they are not directly rejected by the parser, but do create unexpected behaviors deeper in the program and are "invalid enough" to expose corner cases that have not been properly dealt with.
20:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> key part
20:22 <+bridge> <deen> furo: He, thanks for reporting 😄
20:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i read its better t ofix mad out volume in software and then the hardware knob, cuz it compresses less
20:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is it true?
20:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i read its better to first max out volume in software and then the hardware knob, cuz it compresses less
20:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> god i cant type
20:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
20:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ok nice to know
20:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> at least 100%
20:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cuz before i used to have software at min
20:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> don't scale it up more than that
20:48 <+bridge> <robyt3> @ravie_ravie
21:21 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> @robyt3 perfect
21:23 <+ChillerDragon> #how to go to part n parctice
21:23 <+ChillerDragon> got it
21:23 <+ChillerDragon> t/tp in spec
21:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> shouldnt we aim for usability and not for design for an editor?
21:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sure it looks better inlined
21:41 <+bridge> <chairn> i've seen people with modded f1 console though
21:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but a html tag without extra click sounds useful
21:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or "more usable"
21:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> color tag
21:45 <+bridge> <robyt3> We could allow shift+left-clicking the color picker button to immediately paste a color in RGB or RGBA hex format from the clipboard. And use shift+right-click to copy the current color to the clipboard. So it basically works like recipes in Factorio.
21:47 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> Robyt's previous PR improved the usability of the color picker and made the RGBA kinda useless
21:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean that sounds useful too
21:47 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> you can now enter exact values as HSVA which is more user friendly
21:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but couldnt we inline the whole color picker
21:48 <+bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120802253687759018/image.png
21:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in the images it looks like we have plenty of space
21:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but color to button and use the full color picker
21:48 <+bridge> <robyt3> tile layers also have color properties
21:48 <+bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1120802430557376522/image.png
21:49 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> yeah that dialog is a mess but with this it's already an improvement
21:50 <+bridge> <ravie_ravie> maybe the layer shifting could actually go to the Tools tab? from my own experience it's pretty rarely used
21:51 <+bridge> <chairn> i kinda disagree, ddnet code base is kinda hard to get because some stuff are mixed
22:03 <+bridge> <BillionRay> not only that, some stuff just isnt obvious without "Find in files" and trying to figure out by example or by the definition, and often times that process is recursive so its easier to ask one of you fellas
22:04 <+bridge> <BillionRay> not only that, some stuff just isnt obvious without "Find in files" so you need to figure out by example or by the definition, and often times that process is recursive so its easier to ask one of you fellas
22:19 <+bridge> <chairn> I also don't get why some data is duplicated in different structs, especially for the network part
22:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> Ryo u can use a high sample rate but you probably won't want to because the average person can't hear anything higher than 20,000Hz
22:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> 44.1kHz and 48kHz are both already well above that
22:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> if u use 192 it will chew ur cpu
22:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> Sample depth is much more important than sample rate
22:21 <+bridge> <chairn> there are more artifacts in 48kHz then 192kHz due to aliasing
22:21 <+bridge> <chairn> there are more artifacts in 48kHz than 192kHz due to aliasing
22:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> Yea
22:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> Also consider that 99% of your input streams will be 44.1 or 48
22:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> so your cpu has to resample everything
22:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> which can introduce more artifacts in and of itself
22:22 <+bridge> <louis.place> hmm
22:22 <+bridge> <louis.place> adding more keyboard n text shortcuts makes it harder for new mappers
22:23 <+bridge> <louis.place> why not 2 small buttons below the colorpicker to paste/copy
22:23 <+bridge> <louis.place> adding more keyboard and mouse* shortcuts makes it harder for new mappers
22:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> Pulseaudio would constantly crash for me on 96kHz but it was fine on 48
22:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> maybe fixed in pipewire & with a better cpu but idk
22:26 <+bridge> <louis.place> to clean up more, maybe make Detail into a checkbox instead, and possibly hide Color TO unless Color Env is set to an envelope
22:27 <+bridge> <louis.place> and honestly the Game tiles tool promotes bad mapping xd
22:27 <+bridge> <louis.place> so maybe move it to tools as well
22:27 <+bridge> <louis.place> Name: should logically be at the top of the menu as well
23:13 <+bridge> <chairn> that's no problem as 192kHz is a multiple of 48kHz (not of 44.1 though)
23:14 <+bridge> <chairn> and it's not resampling, more like interpolation
23:16 <+bridge> <robyt3> The editor code for these properties is rather rigid, so we can't even hide individual controls right now. That's we for the game layer the label for the property "Detail" is shown but the Yes/No buttons are hidden.

23:19 <+bridge> <robyt3> I added the shift+rightclick/leftclick hotkeys as described. The tooltip should hopefully be enough so mappers figure out that these hotkeys exist if they need them.
