00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> Can someone explain me how antiping works?
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it predicts the position of objects in advance at the simplest level
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it predicts where they (might) be in your ping milliseconds
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> so if ur ping is 300, it predicts where they will be in 300 milliseconds
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> helps mostly with drag parts where the tee is stationary and prediction is easy
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> where the tee is frozen*
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> trying to phrase it differently:
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> your client takes over the physics that the server normally would, giving you feedback on your own input instantaneously.
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> this works super well for your own tee, since it knows your input, but not quite as well for other tees, since your client does not know their input. for other tees, it simply simulates the physics as if they keep pressing the same buttons they just did. if another tee suddenly changes direction, your client predicted them to still walk in the same direction and corrects that as soon as it hears that from the server.
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> 
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that way antiping tries to simulate 0 ping, it depends on a stable ping, not as much on small ping
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> I see
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> So when I use antiping on a server with high ping and play solo and fall in the freeze, it does not predict that. So the freeze is delayed. 
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> Is there any change in playing with or without antiping when playing solo?
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> > this works super well for your own tee, since it knows your input
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> it should be able to predict you perfectly
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> since nothing interfers, which your client wouldnt be able to predict
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> So you think playing with antiping is always better when playing solo?
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i would always suggest playing with antiping
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> what is your ingame name?
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> also Patiga :)
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> antiping also helps for example whenever you have to catch a frozen tee. since its just falling down, your client can predict that perfectly
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> Ok. You can try to go on chile gores server and fall in the freeze with antiping on and off. there is no difference. its both delayed. but if its the way you say, shouldnt antiping predict it and freeze you instantly? I mean make it visible
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> meaning you dont have to care about ping
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> in theory it should exactly do that, if the implementation was perfect
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> my guess is that the antiping correctly predicted your position, but didnt make your tee look frozen?
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> I always thought antiping is only "used on" the other players. and does not effect solo gameplay at all
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> @Patiga yes
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> :/
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ye then it sounds like it does well with the position, but doesnt predict you being frozen, but waits for the server response for that
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that sounds like it could be fixed at some point
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> but wouldnt that mean I could not play with 250 Ping gores at all? Or actually, I still dont understand how exactly the position prediction works.
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> > your client takes over the physics that the server normally would, giving you feedback on your own input instantaneously.
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> > this works super well for your own tee, since it knows your input, but not quite as well for other tees, since your client does not know their input. for other tees, it simply simulates the physics as if they keep pressing the same buttons they just did. if another tee suddenly changes direction, your client predicted them to still walk in the same direction and corrects that as soon as it hears that from the server.
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i thought this would cover it quite well
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> your client knows the map and it also knows your input, meaning it should be able to predict well
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (maybe not moving freeze tho)
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Purzedo> 130 ping and below antiping works almost perfectly
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Purzedo> anything above that and it is really annoying
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> Oh do you play league of legends? when i have 250 ping there, it actually is impossible to play. thats right. because its delayed. but in teeworlds idk, i can play on chile server 250ping witout antiping just as good
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Purzedo> i still dont get how smurfer can play with 200 ping tho
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> no delay at all
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Shyzo do u have antiping turned on
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also make sure antiping limit is 0 or whatever
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the slider
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> usually I play with antiping on, yes
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> yea its on 0
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and make sure u have all the boxes checked
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> below
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> i do :D
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i just tried out chile gores, and it worked well, apart from when my ping suddenly changed a lot
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (at ~250 ping)
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> yes. but with and without antiping, its the same
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> how?
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> aah
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> 1 sec
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> you are right, it works just as well
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> my guess is that antiping is in vanilla
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> so ddnet antiping is just extending it
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> ah
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> that could be it
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> lol,its funny. hook and a/d is fine
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> but gun fire
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> is deelayed xd
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> interesting, then normal antiping is probably movement only
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and ddnet antiping adds weapons and support for their blocks
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cl_predict affects client side calculations about your own tee
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> turn it off and u have server side
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> antiping for pure gores solo is useless, but if u use rockets etc its nice to have
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> oof I thought cl_predict and antiping is the same. oopsi daisy. i just tried it. now thats how it should be xD
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> and can someone explain me the difference between cl_refresh_rate and gfx_refresh_rate ? All I know is that, when I cap with cl, my entities blocks are a bit laggy
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah cl is affects all calculations, even the ones that aren't drawed frames(invisible updates basically) while gfx is really just your fps
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so with cl on 1000 u will never get 1000fps bcs ur GPU isnt inifinitly fast
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i also dont like this implementation, but best is probs to let cl be 0 and gfx and anything u want
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> to say it better, it may skip frames makes the updates less smooth
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> Ok. I am wondering why it is the case that cl_refresh_rate 480 is a default setting
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> Or used to be default. I am not sure. But some people have it like this
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> old client xd
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I spent so much time generating the protocol map from 7 to 6, bringing the entire safe unpacker, yet the code doesn't look any cleaner ðŸ˜¦
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> python really is a disappointing language
10:38 <@deen> Why? I like Python
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have never seen such a newfangled language come with such a horrible way to manage imports and modules
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just want to import from the current directory, is that too much to ask?
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I give up, if someone wants to take this up, they are free to continue
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/ddnet/commit/9ad0b700b31c40b8e3c2ffcf9f803c16e2468d06
10:48 <@deen> Oooh, this is for the 0.7 compatibility
10:48 <@deen> What's the problem exactly?
10:48 <@deen> i thought if you hav X.py in same dir and do import X, it just works
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it would work unless there is another X in the cwd
10:49 <@deen> can you import "./X"?
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> apparently not
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I might need to create a package or a module or something
10:50 <@deen> Too bad. Why not rename the file so that it has a unique name?
10:52 <@deen> import . X?
10:53 <@deen> hm, no
10:53 <@deen> ok, I also have no idea
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if there is some internal command that just avoids resolution alltogether
10:57 <@deen> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67631/how-to-import-a-module-given-the-full-path
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> look at how cute it is in python2
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm seriously baffled
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what kind of dimwit does it take to not notice the OBVIOUS flaw in this import mechanism?
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path."
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like who came up with this solution?
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "Guys I have a brilliant solution to directories overriding actual modules, let's introduce a weird new file called `__init__.py`"
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "Using slashes for path imports, and dots for global module imports would be just too intuitive. We should aspire to make it as inaccessible as possible to people doing actual work and make it more accessible for my grandmother, 3rd graders and math PhDs"
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 I dont think we need the MsgID -= 24, or how you handle it now with *= -1
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that was only the case before, because before it was in one byte, and that could only handle msg ids up to 31
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Guess you can drop that now and make it cleaner
12:26 <+ChillerDragun> bois stay save and update ur git https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats the error
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can do from .datatypes import *
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> apparently you can't
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can just make a __init__
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it works when I do it from the command line, it doesn't work if I run it from cmake
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> *whether I have an `__init__.py` or not
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has smth to do with cmake
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I doubt that, it's more likely that the cwd is an issue
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it works perfectly fine running from any directory, except in cmake
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe try to set
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> WORKING_DIRECTORY

15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> Hi, why when I turn on antiping it affects not only the rest but also on me
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> I noticed that my character moves more accurately when antiping is turned off
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> And when turned on, then others move more correctly (easier save, but others teleporting)
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> The main question is how to turn off antiping for your character and turn on for everything else?
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Soyler Scroll up to beginning of discussion today at 00:19 - Shyzo & Patiga were discussing about how the antiping works
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> And iirc there is currently no way to disable prediction for yourself only
