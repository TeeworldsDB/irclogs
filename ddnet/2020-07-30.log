00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> who zooms out that much tho
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Whis> well if you play fng...
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ban
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no, zooming out too far on fng makes it too hard to aim since the tees are so small. what you have to do is just zoom out maybe 1 or 2 more notches above dyn range (2-3 notches above default) and then play like that. it makes the zoozing not obvious because you could just be taken for a very good dyn player. this way u can use everything zooz has while still lying under the radar, making your zoozing very efficient.

04:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon i have my time on 500, pretty nice, 250 (default) is too slow
05:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> too fast*

10:46 <+ChillerDragon> you aim manually? lol
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> Hey there, I have a problem with the cl_same_clan_color command
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> I think it's broken since it goes all black even if I put a value that's supposed to have a color
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/738381270186328094/unknown.png
15:04 <+Learath2> What value did you try?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> player_color_body and cl_same_clan_color are both set at 2359040
15:04 <+Learath2> Ui colors are allowed to have any lightness, this color is too dark
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> I've been putting random values in order to find a color
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> Ohh okay
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> thank you
15:05 <+Learath2> You can try 2359168
15:05 <+Learath2> That's the exact same color with 50% real lightness
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> yeah that works thank you
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Hi, once break point hit, teeworlds stays on top of everything not allowing anything (including IDE) to show itself up. Does anyone have a solution for it ?
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yea I know about changing resolution, but maybe there is more convenient way?
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does it happen in borderless window mode?
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> hmm, both borderless and fullscreen checked
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then probably only windowed and smaller
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> removing fullscreen toggle helped, thank you
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought you had tried both, but both were checked ^^
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> it still stays on top but once I press alt+ctrl+delete it gives up so I am good
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> in non full screen mode
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> cant you set up map with "tune param 1828"
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wtf @ᶰ°Konͧsti
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> tune settings work for whole map
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Yea
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Just found our
