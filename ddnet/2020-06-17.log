09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Great I bugs I can't reproduce again
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm after a map change no netmsg ever makes it out of CNetServer
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, hm on a map load the server seems to forget that this is a sixup client
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That was a bitch to debug...
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I really don't have any access to linux to test it on there, it works for me on windows
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> on macOS*
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can try windows on a friends laptop
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> brew seems to have broken something about libogg
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm not brews fault for once
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 we seem to include things without their directory prefix, but opusfile itself seems to include it using the directory, <ogg/ogg.h>
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which is not in our include path
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> might need to add that to the include paths necessary for opusfile
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `PC_OGG_INCLUDEDIR` would need to be added
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not quite sure how to get that though
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I could probably figure that one out, I don't know where the include paths necessary for opusfile go
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm no, we already include `OGG_INCLUDE_DIRS`, `OPUSFILE_INCLUDE_DIRS` and `OPUS_INCLUDE_DIRS`
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or can I just add `PC_OGG_INCLUDEDIR` to `OGG_INCLUDE_DIRS`?
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> apparently `OGG_INCLUDE_DIRS` doesn't seem to work
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `OGG_INCLUDE_DIRS`Â is the ogg directory within the actual includedir
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps you need to change the file that is looked for to `ogg/ogg.h`
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if that's the correct include path for the ogg library
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh we don't use ogg ourselves?
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't think so
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah but it still seems to work on linux
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wouldn't `ogg/ogg.h` break linux then?
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where do you have the `#include <ogg/ogg.h>`?
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it is opusfile.h i think, i had same problem when compiling new ddnet on new osx
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ``` In file included from /Users/runner/runners/2.263.0/work/ddnet/ddnet/src/engine/client/sound.cpp:20:
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> /usr/local/Cellar/opusfile/0.11_1/include/opus/opusfile.h:109:11: fatal error: 'ogg/ogg.h' file not found
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> # include <ogg/ogg.h>```
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, ogg/ogg.h seems to be the correct include path
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it just happens to lie in the default path on linux
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so we didn't notice
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ogg/ogg.h works
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder why it used to work before
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps the include directory got there in some other way?
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> hey dev i need help with vanilla server dm me fast for help
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Dont help him he asked me too, he tries to scam iF city accounts
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> yes yes why u lie?
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just for the way he asks
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i know he is a 12y kid
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> xD
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @WhiteKitty then why did you delete the video you sent me where you can clearly see your server name is the same as if citys?
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> xDDD
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> also you wrote something like "hi help me i download 0.6.5 and change mod name now it dont start"
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> why u scam chillerdragon srv ðŸ˜® ? XD
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ? xD
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> He is a friend of mine
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> oh no and is reason for scam srv
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> did u add in ur srv (C) ? ðŸ˜®
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> no
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i asked him to use the map. Then I made a mod for 0.7, his is 0.6
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> He is okay with this
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Other players too
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Other accounta
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No scam here
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> im not sure
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ask him
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> then why u have my acc already if im not register?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because you wanted me to port it over
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WhiteKitty> xD
17:58 <+ChillerDragon> guys dont forget to tag your tw projects as teeworlds topic on github and make sure to star https://github.com/topics/teeworlds
17:58 <+ChillerDragon> lets go trending on github :D
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Was there some way now to tell ddnet clients that the server is a ddnet server apart from setting gametype?
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Can you point me at something?
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `GameInfoEx`, e.g.
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> e.g.? Is there more?
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's probably the correct thing for what you're asking
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @heinrich5991 Could you give a guess at which clear entities the client would load on conflicting gametype and GameInfoEx? i.e. when do those packages arrive relative to the client loading the clear entities image
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it always prefers the stuff from GameInfoEx
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> gametype is used as a fallback to GameInfoEx
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Is GameInfoEx sent when serverinfo is sent or just when you join?
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> GameInfoEx is sent in the snapshot
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so only after you connected
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I suppose the client loads clear entities before the first snapshot though
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know how it works exactly
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd guess it loads all entities
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Nope I checked that, it doesn't switch when this `Info.m_EntitiesXXX` variable updates
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Nope I checked that, it doesn't switch clear entities when this `Info.m_EntitiesXXX` variable updates
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Maybe I'll add this to the client, that it loads all entities and displays the right one according to the current game info. Would be useful for my servers
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are you sure about this?
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the code looks like it can change the image dynamically
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> some entities take precedence over other
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> DDNet > DDRace > Race > BW > FNG > Vanilla
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Hmm it does, doesn't match with my testing
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Nooo we have commits which don't build, annoying when doing bisects
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea :/
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro I just bisected the 0.7 comp
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and the build failed in fake_server only, so it was easy to fix by only building DDNet-Server DDNet targets
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> or `git bisect skip`
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's worse
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, but if the failing change doesn't build that won't help
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yeah i just tried DDNet and it didn't build
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that basically doesn't reduce the amount of commits, unfortunately
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `git bisect skip`
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what are you bisecting?
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> it's the thing you need when something doesn't build ^^
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, you could quickly fix the build, squash the fix
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and reapply it wheneverit fails again
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> This weird entities loading behaviour I mentioned above, very specific
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, my bisect showed your name too ðŸ˜„ https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2256#issuecomment-645485906
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Why am I "coauthor", were you actually able to cherry-pick a commit @Learath2 ?
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you actually wrote it, I just installed it ðŸ˜„
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thought you should get credit for it
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I wasn't even able to cherry-pick your rcon fix
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yey :)
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why is it always things that are impossible to reproduce for me?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I guess if it was reproducible for me it wouldn't be there to begin with ðŸ˜„
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen What does it say when you try to connect
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nothing
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it just stuck connecting?
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anything in the console?
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```

18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm absolutely lost
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I'll just have to figure out how to do x11 forwarding
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and how to get x11 even working on new macOS
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 you can just use twping to reproduce
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no need for x11
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ./twping ger.ddnet.tw to reproduce
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```(dd_pr_07)[learath2@l2mbp] ~/D/C/d/build $ ./twping ger.ddnet.tw
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 57730.5 ms```
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> from linux I m ean
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> GCC 10.1.0
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and nice ping btw
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It seems to have some precision issue, my ping is 57ms normally
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> How is 0.7 support gonna working
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 0.7 players can connect to regular 0.6 servers
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah yep, twping indeed doesn't work
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> should be a smaller binary to debug too
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> @deen when ddnet on steam :pepesweat:
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @deen :O
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> And the only problems might be Prediction problems like with hooktrough on vanilla?
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yesterday
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Isn't it possible to publish ddnet on steam?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We are still greenlit ðŸ˜›
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> greenlight doesnt exist anymore afaik
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> My client bisect just lead me to this commit

19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @snail but u can release
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cut it was accepted before
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @snail yeah but being greenlit I think we are still allowed to release
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Release it :(
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Trafalgar Law it'd be a waste without a tutorial
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Twping seems to send out it's request and get a response, but doesn't even recognize it
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> But tbh teeworlds(0.7) players are most from steam
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> ddnet would become more players then now
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the response even seems reasonable, I wonder why twping dies ðŸ˜„
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> a friend of mine saw teeworlds in "recent releases" or some shit on steam
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> the other day
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> it was highlighted to him
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Maybe its time to add a tutorial :D
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> DDNet probably can't retain the new players without a tutorial
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> teeworlds is simple enough
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Teeworlds is based on ddrace/zcatch
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What's most important about the tutorial is a good mapper willing to map it out
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> There is also no tutorial
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> 0.7 has non dm players xd
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm okay with making all the required code stuff
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> And I mean ddnet is also simple
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes i agree tutorial would be good
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Maybe you can't start with ddnet as your first gametype
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I didn't
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> And what would you suggest for your first gametype?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> And IMO ddnet is not a gametype :p
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> DDNet is a little too tough for a first introduction, you really need someone to teach you
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tested this on a couple friends, they all had absolutely no idea how we did most things
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I even think it gets harder to get into the game because the players are better now. I started with deathmatch on ctf5 and won a lot of games but today with that level of skill I'd loos every game
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> even when shown
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Yea true, tried also with friends :D
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> one of my friends actually picked up ddnet very quickly and it was the first thing i showed him
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen Ah, recvmmsg strikes again
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so we should rls on steam anyway
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How did this even work before?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but tutorial would help a lot because i had to show them how to do things. players who just come upon the game on steam would have no idea how to play
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like the throws are second nature to us, we don't even notice that having weak changes the throw quite a lot actually
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> I mean how would you start with a tutorial xd There are many gametypes.. 
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Atm you will thrown into the cold water :X
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I coded some tutorial stuff ages ago and I thought about the map. There are a ton of decisions that go into making a starter map, I guess you'd need a starter to help you in the design process because most of us already forgot where you are when you never played the game before
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Were we just getting lucky that compilers were noticing that pData could always point to the buffer of the recvunpacker?
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How though...
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> recvmmsg has it's completely separate buffer, nothing should ever be ending up in the recvunpackers buffer
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> I mean you can do a basic map where you get all informations how the game works
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen well twping should have been broken on linux since you first introduced recvmmsg
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not only twping but the client too
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it was some weird optimisation beyond my comprehension
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Tutorial= /map Basics
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nvm, I'm the dimwit that broke it
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> still no idea wtf kinda optimisation clang is doing that makes it work
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> again, stupid, no recvmmsg on macOS
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> god
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should have asked for brain cells for my birthday
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> xd
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Learath take a break :pepesweat:
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I think you can actually test now, sorry for wasting your time...
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no problem, you're spending way more time than I am
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess we could release on steam, but a rudimentary tutorial would help. otherwise we'll end up with most new players being confused
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the tutorial pull request is only missing a map iirc
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if anyone is up for that challenge that would be amazing :)
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Patiga do you mean that thing i wrote years ago?
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> uh probably
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> heh, probably more work fixing the conflicts than rewriting the thing
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> (please just leave it closed)
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> @deen Maybe do a announcement for a concept for a tutorial :D
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> I think not everyone looks into github or in this channel
20:53 <+ChillerDragon> everyone should tho
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> ChillerNoob
20:54 <+ChillerDragon> :D
20:54 <+ChillerDragon> github is such a nice hangout place
20:54 <+ChillerDragon> btw btw @law have you liked https://github.com/topics/teeworlds already? So we can get teeworlds trending on github :D
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Nope
20:55 <+ChillerDragon> like share subscribe
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, I forgot we even had credits ðŸ˜„
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i try to update them occasionally
