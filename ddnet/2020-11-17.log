10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <PochiTM ツ> can anybody tell me how to create a server in ddnet?
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @PochiTM ツ https://trashmap.ddnet.tw/ https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5095
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <PochiTM ツ> thanks
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ @Learath2 @heinrich5991 I'd like to release 15.2, which requires https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3300 to be reviewed first.
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> are kog just ddnet servers with gores maps?
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> no
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> yes
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> so they have their own fork?
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> modified ddnet servers
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> they have stuff like moving walls and moving freeze
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> right
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> qshar doesnt want a mainland server. so i'm thinking of a third party one through us.
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :tee_thinking:
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Kog is running a very old ddnet which is kinda disappointing. Doesn't have any of the prediction improvements we got in with the extended protocol
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> that's a fork for you
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Caffeine "waking" someone up must be like the biggest scam ever
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can feel I'm hopped up on caffeine, I feel jumpy, my hands are jittery. Yet I still feel sleepy
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 on Windows autoupdater is hanging after parsing update/update.json, but on Linux it works. Any idea?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let me take a quick look
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen anything interesting in the logs?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nope, nothing
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> [2020-11-17 13:45:42][http]: task done https://update6.ddnet.tw/update.json
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> [2020-11-17 13:45:42][updater]: parsing update.json
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And what does the UI look like?
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does it say downloading?
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> "Downloading update/update.json"
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the only path I can see which leads to this is a parsing failure
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would check that m_FileJobs is populated after the ParseUpdate() call
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, me not returning whether the parsing succeeded or not from ParseUpdate is so silly
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but there is nothing platform specific in ParseUpdate, is ther?
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I don't see anything else. Sorry I can't be of more help
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen well we open a file, windows has notoriously been susceptible to permission issues
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe an issue in the json library? We might be linking to another version on linux
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nope, we build it in-source
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are any of the fetch jobs getting queued properly? e.g. after update.json
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, probably it's my fault
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think we changed something in GetBinaryPath
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> > 1:48 PM] deen: "Downloading update/update.json"
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this implies OnProgress never gets called after update.json is downloaded so no other download task ever progressed. Either they are never getting queued, e.g. ParseUpdate failed or they are queued but are not running, e.g. we are stuck in a deadlock, we don't have any worker threads left, or curl issue
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, that makes sense
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I think update.json should go in TYPE_SAVE not "binary path"
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> binary path can be unwritable for example
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> though I guess if binary path was unwritable, we can't autoupdate anyway
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll go out now, will check back in a few hours. can't fix this release anyway since 15.1.3 had the broken updater already :/
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well is `m_FileJobs` getting filled?
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's the only thing I would check
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not sure how to check without editing source code
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, yep you can't without editing the source
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well you could with a debugger, but that takes a bit more time
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I fixed and cleaned up a lot of nasty behaviour in #2754 so I guess it'll be kinda broken until then
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2754
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778248976817586206/unknown.png
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778249007502983178/unknown.png
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> script detection is such a b**ch
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> confusing
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One day we will have good support for all languages everywhere. Probably in 2050 or so
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> most script detection just fails around SC TC and J if one of these aren't the system default
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if script detection actually is possible
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> personally i don't think so.
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> especially after the han unification
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, most text is probably ambiguous now
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> if they weren't unified or at least separated by language it would be easier. But then normalization would be a b**ch again.
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe it's time asia abandoned their very complex glyphs :P
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :d49Rip:
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Korea did away with them and they saw a huge surge in literacy AND they get decent support on every OS
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> chinese tried
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> pinyin is the attempt
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> pinyin wasn't a thing before.
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> we have special glyphs for sounds before as well
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> taiwan still using them
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not sure if romanizing is the best idea
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> pinyin is the \*failed\* attempt
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Unspaced text is the first thing that should be phased out. Without the pictograms and the ideograms it would become a huge pita to read anything
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :thonk:
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> just kill all asians
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> LOL that would solve things
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> it would
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tho a little unethical
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> irc never forgets btw
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i know
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's forever recorded in history
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> the deletion is for the comedic effect
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe romanization could work actually, just not quite sure how well the grammatical constructs would work
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Japanese reading atleast relies a lot on grammatical constructs being very easy to identify at a first glance
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> chinese do need the tone marks to make sense if a sentence is full pinyin
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> due to how we speak
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should ask some native speakers if they can read romaji well
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> if it is just plain a-z, if would be really hard to understand
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie can you read pinyin well with the marks?
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> if trained, probably
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Marks are easy to handle both from a computer and teaching sense
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i don't usually read those, and we don't really have a standard way to type them.
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> so it is actually less common
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> other than in dictionary and in class
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, that's silly given how much chinese is tone based
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> we've been dealing with plain pinyin a lot in the early teeworlds days
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> it was PITA to talk
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can imagine
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> lol, chinese community are discussing how hard to read chat with the new chat.
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As expected. No one likes new visual updates
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> it'll grow on them i believe
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's why we left the old setting
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's astonishing how sleepy I feel after 8 hours of solid sleep + 5 cups of coffee
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> 👀
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I'm just not set up for being awake at normal human hours
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> 5 cups sounds unhealthy
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's well within the established safe amount of caffeine
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> 😄 fair
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I will drop out of uni and become a night guard. I am perfectly awake at 2 am
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :megathink:
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778253965908901908/unknown.png
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> stuck here
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i can't use built-in update at all in china
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> restarted client - same
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut discussed it with deen a bit ago. If you want you can try debugging it
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> but that's just a china thing
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 no thanks, i once tried to work with the autoupdater but i couldnt come further
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a feeling it's ParseUpdate failing
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why would it fail this time tho and not in the previous updates?
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I now understood what deen ment
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is an old version, so we can't fix it anyway :(
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut Who knows, I don't have windows to check
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I do but not right now
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is there a plan/fix alreadY?
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is there a plan/fix already?
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well nothing to plan, no way to fix a client we already deployed. I'd guess #2754 would fix it but I just can't finish that up
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2754
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Oh, again a client thats broken?
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we want a fix for the meanwhile, someone needs to check what's actually broken
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm like a factory defect. Whenever I have something I have to do I am sleepy. Whenever I'm doing something that's useless I'm wide awake
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there like a website where we can apply for a replacement brain? Is there like a warranty on these things?
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778257984601194516/Screen_Shot_2020-11-17_at_7.55.49_AM.png
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> nice warning
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> ~~it is probably telling you sｕｃｋ~~
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778260011292819466/unknown.png
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i'm trying to make a hud popup for dummy state change. don't know if it'll make any sense.
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i feel like it'd only make sense if u had more than 1 dummy
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> probably. i accidentally trigger copying a lot. so i might came in handy for me
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> it*
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i can just don't PR and keep it to myself😄
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778261262006091836/unknown.png
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> oof
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is dummy copy realy used that often
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Username> hey, i had to format my pc and now when i play teeworlds i get a crazy 'motion blur', and the game is very sluggish! before it as a lot smoother when i moved
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Username> its like every entitie merges when i move
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Username> anyone with the same problem ?
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Username> already tried every setting, and version of ddnet! same thing
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> So for the first time my game png got deleted after update can someone tell me again where I should put it so it wouldnt get deleted after next updates?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what do you mean by merging
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> some icon symbolizing hammerfly/copy would be good
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Nooback open assets directory
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats why we added it
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Jupstar ✪ i think he means like an acid effect
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> \AppData\Roaming\Teeworlds\assets\game
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> this?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> where the previous frame renders arent deleted
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Username maybe GSync or Freesync?
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Nooback just press "Assets directory" button
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when selecting "Game"
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> I was right its that
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Username> > @Username maybe GSync or Freesync?
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Username> @Jupstar ✪ nah, already tried on and off
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Username well, its probably a problem outside of ddnet:
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> - GPU driver
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> - Use the right GPU, deticated, or integrated
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> - Try newest client always with a clean config, don't open older clients, else configs are overwritten
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> - The config of you screen(refresh rate etc.)
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Username> gpu driver was just installed freshly
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Username> im using dedicated gpu
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Username> already tried every version 11+
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Username> what a nightmare xD
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tried newest versions only with clean configs?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Username> omg im a potato
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Username> totally forgot that the refresh rate goes to 60hz after formating
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Username> changed back to 144 and installed the new ddnet version and its back to normal
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Username> @Jupstar ✪ thanks ❤️
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice 😄
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :watermeron:
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is the freeze patch not in the current version?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ no
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> was it a regression?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> My assumption was that it was always broken
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i thought it was related to the IME change
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh... then I need to take it in..
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but im not sure
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> :justatest:
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> i was planning on reworking the text input using some other design that can be reused across console editor editbox and chat. havent really get started
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> Learath2 gave me some idea on implementing text selection on not only text input but chat/console history as well.
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i have a suggestion for translations: make something like comment with max amount of characters
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> why is steam_api goes with non-steam ddnet client?
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> why does steam_api go with non-steam ddnet client?
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because it's a bit cleaner, then we don't need to ifdef in our code, but instead we build a steam_api.so/dll stub that does nothing
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and the code for non-steam and steam ddnet client are the same (minus autoupdater), just the steam_api.dll is different
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Hello! have anybody changed recently anything related assets loading logic (particles) or particle trajectory, lifespan or physics/timers?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Today I am and one of players have noticed that some particles are missing in the game. Those were consisted of gun (pistol) projectiles. But regular gun projectiles work. I've tried to revert server changes to a month ago but problem still persists. Reinstalling DDNet to ~latest git version and removing ~/.teeworlds directory didn't helped.
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Everything is working fine in teeworlds 0.6 and 0.7 though.
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Any ideas?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I feel like no one tests our release candidates
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Still there is a possibility that this is somehow my mod's issue, but it's 100% reproducible on DDNet client and not on teeworlds.
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Also some DDNet players with same versions didn't had that problem.
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck is it only in 15.2 and not 15.1? We had lots of changes in there, would be great if you could bisect it.
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've found that in 15.1.2 and updated to 15.2
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I could try installing older versions I think
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You could try reverting this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/98d4baabeda2382568da2c61424b7d3962ab1974
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's the only change in projectile.cpp
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> hm... nice tip
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will. Just will try older ddnet client version first. Should have started with that tbh
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> hm... this is somehow related to assets it seems
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> when I am starting a client from the folder of downloaded client everything works fine
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it's so weird, I haven't touched my system's DDNet package for a month
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wait do they have custom skins
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ask them for the resolution
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've just deleted my /usr/share/ddnet folder sorry
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I am trying to reinstall the package
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> could backup it though first
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it got weirder, now starting from the current directory of downloaded ddnet client doesn't help
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> wait why is the latest version 15.2.2
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> quick patches
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> its only 15.2.1 on github
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> should be at same code tho
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe @deen didn't commit the version bump yet
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or atleast didn't push
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> oh its on a different branch
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> hm... if I download a tarball and starting ./DDNet with storage containing $CURRENT_DIR only
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> should it get started in theory?
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it seems that deleting /usr/share/ddnet messed up things and that particle doesn't drawn no matter which version of ddnet client I run
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> or I am just encountering very weird random error that sounds like it has a system
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ok, I will suppress my noise for awhile and will try to experiment more to gather data
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> thanks
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> hmm... people with ddnet versions 15.1.2 and 15.1.3 don't have problems
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and when I start 15.1.3 from tarball everything works correctly
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 15.2.1 and 15.2.2 have this problem for me
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck if you can reproduce it, bisect?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will bisect

19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/8d6148b20b2cde94d8e1fbe0a0dcd0bd81e86acc
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> omg, it's so huge
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Jupstar ✪ any ideas?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> weirdest thing is that this problem occured just today. I haven't updated anything
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it just happened mid-day, I was playing and then one person asked me if I see that important particles are missing
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and as those were core elements of a mod I've instantly knew there is a problem
19:52 <+ChillerDragon> @deen do you want me to open an issue for the ping filter inf loop?
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it's still an issue, yes
19:52 <+ChillerDragon> ok deen
19:52 <+ChillerDragon> :D sorry
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Have you got your T-shirt ChillerDragon?
19:55 <+ChillerDragon> hacktoberfest?
19:56 <+ChillerDragon> nah i decided to go with a tree but then it wanted like my address i did not understood why and rage quitted :D
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I'd do the same
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> both for T-shirt and rq on neglecting my privacy 😄
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I gave a random address in new york
20:02 <+ChillerDragon> hm sounds like a good idea
20:02 <+ChillerDragon> i was scared they publish my data in some forest or send me a seed to my home
20:03 <+ChillerDragon> a random address sounds good but i wonder what they need it for
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Should I open an issue @deen ?
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you open an issue already?
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> one moment
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please also include your findings (bisect)
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Pure_luck with default game skins?
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Jupstar ✪ yes
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nice catch @Pure_luck, how did you even discover that behaviour for your mod? 😄
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Seems someone else did actually, given you didn't spot the issue immediately
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Trick is used currently on all  infClass servers too
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> so they're all affected too
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder who came up with ti
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/ti/it/
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> wdym? about WEAPON_HAMMER trace?
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yes, code was used in old infClass
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and on infClass this trick is broken for 5.2 too
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will update the issue
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So I guess necropotame was the one who found it?
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Pure_luck can u debug that with ddnet somehow
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Pure_luck in ur issue u say custom gameskins?
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> no, "custom entities"
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> that's the rather common term for new things build up from particles
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so what is broken
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> entities or particles
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> traces for particles that are not drawn
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so you mean particles are broken
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> for WEAPON_HAMMER for example
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not entities
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ok, traces are particles
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> send me your custom entities or what ever

20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's in the issue
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> do you see it?
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i don't get what you mean, if you just send net objects then its nothing custom
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778343387401027655/Screenshot_from_2020-11-17_22-38-33.png
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so are we speaking of default everything?
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> those are traces of a bullets
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but without bullets
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok but they work fine for me
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i join ddnet server
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and press fire with pistol
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> with bullets they would look like this
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778343651402448926/unknown.png
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but how is it related to rendering then?
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then some netcode changed
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So this technique uses WEAPON_HAMMER to hide actual projectile
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i see
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but in 0.6, 0.7 and 5.1.3 traces are still drawn
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> weapon has no particles
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yes
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that sounds right to me 😄
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it's logical in real world
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but alas it's not in infClass/infCroya/infNext
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can't you add a new netobj for that?
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> why would I?
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs hammer has no projectiles
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but it has in 0.6, 0.7 and 5.1.3, why change that?
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it has traces
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> even if it doesn't have projectile image
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I suppose you're not motivated to debug this and consider it extra minor.
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I could help you to debug but I have zero expertise in client and render debugging and code.
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont consider this a bug
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 😢
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'll look in the code first
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I don't push you with that ofc. Take your time. I hope info I've gathered will help narrow the issue.
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Thanks for your help
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah xd
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> `bezier.h/cpp` stay in game-shared, it's not right for me, because `bezier.h/cpp` are only used by client-side
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Pure_luck ^
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> newer clients crash too much for me zz
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what happens
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or do u mean ur intel driver?
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yea idk
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but did u see the warning?
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it should default to opengl 2.0 then
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> what warning
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when u at OpenGL 3.0 it should show a warning
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> at start
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i had opengl stuffs on ddnet 12.8 idk why it changed
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> first time start
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u downgrade it resets some configs
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Jupstar ✪ I will test it
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Jupstar ✪ omfg, it solved it!
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778350848027000882/unknown.png
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Though I am not sure why it detects as 15.1.2, but in game menu it was 15.2.2 so I guess it's just how it builds.
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Or how my server detects versions.
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but shouldnt it show it without the gun projectiles?
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or was that the issue xD
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> oh...
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> you're right
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but poison clouds are drawn correctly for some reason
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ah... I just didn't looked well
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it's not
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it should only show the balls
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but not the projectiles?
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yes
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd really call this a bug in the old code
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but ok
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's a feature for sure 😄
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u have deen on ur side anyway
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but I don't want to argue on terms with a person helping me 😄
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> please recreate that nasty bug
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 🙏
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Pure_luck try again
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> BTW couldnt u just use shotgun?
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> pObj->m_Type = WEAPON_NINJA;
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> pObj->m_Type = WEAPON_SHOTGUN;
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it flickers a lot
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok nvm
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but pls test the current code
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its force pushed
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do you know how to reset?
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yes, I've just deleted branch and fetched it again
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> hard resetting didn't helped for some reason
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u need to fetch first
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but nvm
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> now it works
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok nice xd
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> for both effects
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778353852076392498/Screenshot_from_2020-11-17_23-20-01.png
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Thanks a lot 🙏
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis did you try a beta driver btw?, or did u crash also on the new driver?
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk ill test them after school
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> zooz looks bad in 15.2.2 with default entities
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778363237740838942/screenshot_2020-11-17_12-57-02.png
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> ok maybe thats too much

21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @plsplsplslol what does `gfx_opengl_major` say?
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> 3
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh strange
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my zoom looks muhc better
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/778363992451711016/screenshot_2020-11-17_22-00-12.png
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> changed smth in ur driver settings or anything like that? 😄
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> looks like your GPU isnt creating "enough" mipmaps
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> oh opengl 3.3 fixed it
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok, strange tho 😄
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> graphics are like a black box
