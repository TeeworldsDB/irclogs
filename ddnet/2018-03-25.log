16:06 <+jxsl13> does anyone know, how to add the  -std=c++11 flag to bam, without getting the error, that C/ObjC cannot be compiled with this flag ?
16:06 <+jxsl13> (macosx)
16:53 <@deen> CXXFLAGS?
16:53 <+jxsl13> yes
16:54 <@deen> CXXFLAGS=-std=c++11 bam?
16:54 <@deen> or edit the bam.lua file
16:55 <+jxsl13> how to configure bam.lua in order to use c++11 standard on the cpp files and avoid getting that error that you cannot use that flag on either C or Obj-C?
16:56 <@deen> hm, actually not sure
16:56 <@deen> don't see anything c++ specific
16:57 <+jxsl13> is there some kind of way to remove previously set flags :?
16:57 <@deen> settings.cc.flags_cxx should work
16:57 <@deen> (after reading bam source code, but never used it)
17:00 <+jxsl13> it worked, thanks :D
17:00 <@deen> np
17:01 <+jxsl13> hm, now only somehow to add sdl ._.
17:01 <@deen> sdl?
17:01 <@deen> isn't that added already?
17:02 <+jxsl13> hm, maybe the bam.lue is broken, seems to build two versions
17:03 <@deen> on mac osx that's normal
17:03 <@deen> to make fat binaries for all platforms
17:03 <@deen> you could make debug_x86_64
17:03 <@deen> "bam debug_x86_64"
17:04 <@deen> if you just need one
17:04 <+jxsl13> first was the server biary, that's working...
17:04 <@deen> ah
17:05 <@deen> installing the sdl package from official website should work
17:05 <@deen> but depending on what you're building you'll need sdl 1.2
17:23 <+jxsl13> (Y)
17:32 < Paralix> hello? who know how use putty?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you just write stuff in it
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what do you want to do with putty?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> restart the teamspeak3 server, probably
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> jxsl13: for questions about bam, ask matricks
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> he coded it, he knows it pretty well
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Julian ☁> Wot p
22:41 <@deen> Well, or read the source code on bam, it's not that hard to understand
