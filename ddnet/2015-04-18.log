11:06 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 997470d def: Cleanup
12:16 <@deen> and ddmax map releases have started
12:16 <@deen> even if Nimda doesn't notice
12:17 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/releases/
12:19 < NooBxGockeL> what is ddmaX ?
12:21 <@deen> You know the old DDmaX server?
12:21 < NooBxGockeL> no. what where they all about ?
12:22 <@deen> ddrace maps, only 1 european server
12:22 <@deen> most played there before ddnet
12:22 <@deen> but now it's been down for a long time
12:22 <@deen> mappers send us their own maps from ddmax all the time, so we finally decided to just release them all
12:23 < NooBxGockeL> but how is it different from brutal/moderate/novice ? Its just ddrace after all is it ?
12:23 <@deen> right
12:23 <@deen> oldschool is also just ddrace
12:25 < NooBxGockeL> hmpf. well thanks for the info, im just not that hyped about getting another server option.
12:26 < NooBxGockeL> *that doesnt define difficulty
12:28 <@deen> yeah, me neither
12:28 <@deen> but let's run with it until we have all ddmax maps released at least
12:28 <@deen> maybe we can think of sth better then
12:30 <@deen> There was a discussion before: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1253
12:46 < NooBxGockeL> wow, the discussion really is quite hot xD
13:12 <@deen> Learath2: so, the autoupdater works realiably on Windows Vista+, right?
13:13 <@deen> but we don't have a way to detect windows version?
13:14 < NooBxGockeL> ? cant be that hard. Isnt there a environmental variable ?
13:15 < NooBxGockeL> (sorry im java dev, just saw c++ hasnt got such env var

13:43 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 b55bf7e def: Try to add back WinXP compatibility for autoupdater (untested)
13:43 <@deen> If anyone can test on WinXP, tell me please
13:47 < Learath2> deen: works on anything >XP yep
13:48 < Learath2> you'll just define winxp and give out a winxp build  ?
13:48 <@deen> nono, i need to figure out how to determine whether we're on WinXP
13:48 <@deen> or someone else can figure that out :P
13:49 <@deen> oh, i'm stupid, that shouldn't be CPP stuff of course
13:49 < Learath2> deen: WinAPI GetVersion 
13:50 <@deen> Learath2: i don't even have windows so i don't want to guess. could you do that?
13:50 < Learath2> ill do it in 10 mins 
13:50 < Learath2> eating food 
13:50 <@deen> thanks
13:50 <@deen> and good idea to eat sth
14:54 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #193: Add os_compare_version. Check for WinXP. (DDRace64...pr_IHATEWINXP) http://git.io/vvdrW
14:54 < Learath2> didnt test
14:55 < Learath2> and still dont quite get how that bat works as it does the exact same thing I do but does it from a cmd 
15:02 < fstd> different environment?

16:24 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 aead263 def: Fix os_compare_version a bit
16:25 <@deen> Still need someone with WinXP to test this
16:26 <@deen> just change version in version.h to a lower one and see if it updates and new version gets downloaded and restart works
16:26 <@deen> or maybe i'll just build it myself and ask someone with winxp
16:28 < fstd> i have an xp machine sitting around, but no ddnet build setup
16:28 <@deen> give me a few minutes to compile it on my slow win7 vm
16:38 <@deen> fstd: http://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-update-win32.zip It pretends to be 7.3, so it should update to 7.4, then restart to 7.4
16:39 <@deen> afk
16:53 < fstd> deen: that seems to have worked, although it didn't update itself automagically, in case that was the intended behaviour
16:53 < fstd> updated and restarted itself after i clicked 'update now' anyway
17:37 <@EastByte> deen: ddos?
17:38 <@EastByte> nah seems to be stable again
19:44 <@deen> fstd: sounds like the expected behaviour, thanks
19:45 <@deen> it's called "autoupdater", but actually you have to click a button now

21:43 <@deen> woah, clang recognizes a lot of bugs
21:47 <@deen> and even has suggestions for how to fix them
21:59 < heinrich5991> just think of all the bugs the compiler didn't catch :/
21:59 <@deen> well, not bugs, unused variables, bad style stuff and so on

22:29 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 a77cd03 def: Get rid of all Clang warnings
22:49 <@deen> the weird thing about clang is that it optimizes away CNetBan::CBanPool::Reset() with -O3
22:50 <@deen> any idea for how to fix this?
22:50 <@deen> src/mastersrv/mastersrv.cpp:(.text+0x927): undefined reference to `CNetBan::CBanPool<NETADDR, 1>::Reset()'

23:03 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 1f2d5d3 def: Fix masterserver compilation with clang and optimizations
23:04 <@deen> maybe it's a bug in clang, but I'm not going to try to understand the C++ standard's definition of templates about this
23:05 <@deen> and last time i wanted to report bugs to gcc it turned out the C standard allows weird stuff
23:32 < eeeee> lol just noticed a bug in js client
23:32 < eeeee> tee's feet are not animated when moving
23:32 < eeeee> only happens in chrome for some reason
23:33 <@deen> oh, weird
23:33 <@deen> didn't notice since i use firefox
23:33 < eeeee> might be a regression in chrome since i think it worked in chrome 41, but now i have chrome 42
23:34 <@deen> looks like they removed chrome 41 from my distro, so can't get that as well
23:36 < eeeee> works perfectly fine in canary (chrome 44)
23:36 < eeeee> chrome Y U BREAK MY STUFF DDD:
23:36 <@deen> so, just have to wait and it will work again
23:40 < eeeee> lol but pointer lock is broken in 44
23:40 < eeeee> or rather works too well, there's no way to unlock
23:40 <@deen> haha
23:40 <@deen> maybe it's not escape anymore?
23:40 <@deen> but something more cryptic and hidden
23:40 < eeeee> had to switch to a terminal and kill the process to unlock it
23:41 < eeeee> escape has an effect of breaking the pointer inside the window
23:41 < eeeee> so the tw mouse pointer stops following your mouse
23:42 < eeeee> but you still don't get the OS pointer back
23:42 < eeeee> definitely just another bug
