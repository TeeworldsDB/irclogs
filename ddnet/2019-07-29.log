08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @FallenKN people have been asking for a better mark for afk people since I started coding on ddrace 7-8 years ago
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think delivering sth is better then delivering nothing and asking people to git good
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> @Learath2 true, I can make a pr for the emote mark if needed
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Spamming zzz?
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's hardly better and it's server sided
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> not spamming
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> displaying the bubble permanently, using playerflag to render clientside
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dont you think that might get crowded on maps like bit2/s3 (t0 maps where this is most needed) where there could be a lot of tees afk?
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tbh best would be if we could mark the tee itself somehow, but I couldnt come up with anything that isnt terribly ugly
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> I guess I will have to look at these maps to see what you mean
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> I am not even saying that the mark as is right now is bad, the emote way was just a more noticeable way of displaying it
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, I also considered the emote but was thinking it could be way too crowded to see which tee is actually afk
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The mark also fails at that though I guess
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> exactly
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> But other ways like changing skins to display afk are ugly
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe a red "aura" around the tee?
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sounds ugly tho :(
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Coloring the tee outline red?
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what that'd look like
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tried colorint the eyes, looked very weird
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> Can't imagine it being that bad tbh
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> I'm going to try the emote way later and will test it in crowded areas
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Eyes were gud imo
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 eyes we had since the beginning, it's just not that obvious that people always wanted sth better
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but even worse is that you can override it with eye emotes
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tbh the eye emotes were not a good idea to implement when we were using the eyes to signify tee state
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> So maybe change it?
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> So that the tee state overrides the tee's eye emote
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that feature already lost it's trustw
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> trustability
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Ah?
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> people just dont trust the eye emote, as evidenced by the dozens of people failing a day trying to pick up an afk
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or they just can't read the tee state from it easily, either way it's just not that good
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Yea :/
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's very inconsistent tbh, an afk tee in freeze has different eye emotes then an afk tee out of freeze
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so now you need a mental map, blink in freeze is not afk, blink out of freeze is afk
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Yea
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Like not in freeze u have eyes open and in freeze eyes closed
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm pretty sure we'll add a consistent mark this release, so if anyone comes up with a better mark, do it before we release ðŸ˜›
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> For afks or for normal tee's aswell?
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> afks
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Ok
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why would we mark the non-afks, they are the minority
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that'd be bad ux ðŸ˜›
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> No i thought u wanted to change the ways its marking the non-freezed and freezed tees
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we'll keep the blink to keep the greybeards happy
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Ye also bcs i think a lot of ppl are used to this
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> I'll try to think about something for the afks but the main problem is to find something that renders well a lot of tees are close to each others
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> kinda why I want it to be on the tee, rather then above or next to it
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Yea
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> hmm
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/605312108317638666/screenshot_2019-07-29_10-13-51.png
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> that's the most crowded I could get rn
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm that doesnt look half bad
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should open an issue with screenshots from all solutions
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> did u keep the eyes?
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> i think this and the eyes could be something good?
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> yeah kept the eyes
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> as the eyes are closed
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> the eyes are just open in screenshot since I am not using playerflag to display them rn
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ah k
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> also these are just chatbubble position, if anyone has some suggestion on it
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Sleep bubble best
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> this is nice imo
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> how does the afk playerflag work? because for me it doesn't
12:09 <@deen> the server needs to support it
12:09 <@deen> current ddnet servers don't run that version yet
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @FallenKN the master branch has it now
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> yeah I tried it with the master branch, maybe I did something wrong
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you tried it on official servers or your own?
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> official servers are not up to date atm
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> I compiled master and tried it on my own
12:43 <@deen> ok, that should work
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> still, someone needs to fix up the AFK flag
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it doesnt belong to the player flags
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @FallenKN it cannot work, the DDNetPlayer doesnt have the AFK flag applied
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen you definitely merged too fast
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 inb4 master breaks ðŸ˜›
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut DDNetPlayer does have the afk flag applied
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> player.cpp L327
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 but the AFK flag doesnt belong to playerflags?
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Or does it?
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> I don't know what I am doing wrong then
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> the afk mark seems to just work fine that means that m_Afk is true and the flag should be applied
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No it definitely needs a new flag array
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But the flag is applied, its just unnecessarily in the middle of the flags int
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah, yes
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Whats the issue @FallenKN?
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is possible that m afk is forgotten uninitialized
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> no m_afk works
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 Could you look at my prs before the release? They are very small
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> but I am trying to display the "sleepbubble" the way you display the chatbubble via PLAYERFLAG_AFK
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> nothing happens
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut I'm having lunch, then ill head to a cafd tk get some studying done, i'll merge them there
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh okay
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @FallenKN ah thats simple
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wrong playerflags int
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The afk flag is in the extended player object
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @FallenKN i find it kinda meh to have something that vanilla client cant display
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> @fokkonaut wrong way to think about it
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1844 â€“ says that it creates an inconsistency between scoreboard and kill messages
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> if we were to approach this way 64 players shouldn't be a thing either
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> @Learath2 oh thank you
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well we did let vanilla clients see the 64 players
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 yes, because kill messages would need a fix that would require more changes
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> yeah that was just an example
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But back then people did care about vanilla compat
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> vanilla cant'dispaly hookline either
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tbh vanilla is irrelevant now
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> vanilla can't display hookline either
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I hope you guys have checked the data
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wat data
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki @Learath2
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can figure out how many people connect with non-ddnet clients
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well, deen and whoever has log access can
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can take a look if you want, we have all that teehistorian data
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki yes, and you can ask someone
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But id be surprised if more then 5% use it
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most use the latest ddnet
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think we have any way for newcomers to come into the game except vanilla
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ddnet is already declining judging from races finished graphs
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is there a way to know how many newcomers we have?
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tbh i dont think we got much anyway
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and we doing them a favour by not playing ddnet with vanilla
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I doubt we have many newcomers aswell, and its hard to quantify
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they can't find ddnet in the first place if we don't allow them to join with vanilla
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to fix that we could release on steam
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But we could take a look at new names in novice finishes
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> have our own proper visibility
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it was the plan
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> till
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki yea, but before that happened, I'd be a bit slower on dropping vanilla
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> something happened
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye we can slowly drop vanilla
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Most newcomers i hear of are referred by friends
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet still sends fake tunezones due to vanilla right?
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not only vanilla, also ddnet I think(?)
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I doubt anyone would let their friend use the pain thats vanilla on ddnet :D
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should fix that for ddnet
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think u cant still predict
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a tune zone
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when ur outside
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> vanilla players use ddnet client too
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki look at my pr
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i at least fixed the projectiles
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dont think we send tunezones or predict them at all
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut diffs can be small and the change can still be hard btw
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But it should be doable now that we have extended objects and have the tunezones in the map itself
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1840, this creates a new network message and kinda implies we want to go that way for syncing settings between client and server
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also, `show_all` has an impact on the amount of network traffic. so it's not easy to evaluate
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> We do the same for showothers
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/search?q=FAKETUNE&unscoped_q=FAKETUNE
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think most of it
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is coverd by ddnet network characer
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> now
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that doesn't mean it's good. `show_others` doesn't even use the new netmsg thing
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should probably get one netobject with all of the settings packed in
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That should better utilize the delta compression
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1832 â€“ it's unclear whether third-party ddnet servers enable it, and it's even on by default for these
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah i was going to close 1832
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1822 â€“ this greatly increases network traffic for projectiles, even for the ddnet client AFAIUI
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not so easy
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why should it?
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 that one I already told him I wont merge until proper support in ddnet client exists for it
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm just trying to explain to @fokkonaut that PRs aren't easy because they're small
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh yeah true
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I know that
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its not trivial tk evaluate these always
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 about the flag colors: is it important to have the kill messages correct too?
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I appreciate your honesty there btw, I probably wouldn't have remembered that it also shows for the kill messages
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The point is
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the scoremessages have a flag flag, right?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so it's not really clear which flag to show
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> For the kill messages to show up with flags is, that you would need to add flag support first, then enable the gamestate_flags and then even decide which tee has a flag
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> scoremessage?
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the kill messages
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What do you mean with a flag flag
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There is a FLAG
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which tells the client to render flags in scoreboard and spectator select menu
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I believe the `m_ModeSpecial` field contains the info whether there should be a flag on the killer and the victim
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in `Sv_KillMsg`
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It does, correct
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it's not clear whether it should be a red or a blue flag
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes, and that is because a KillMsg only has the Team of the tee providrd
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and based on that, it will render the opposite flag
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess it's fine then
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> In ddrace it would always be a blue flag
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> For example
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> We could fake it tho
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> If we go and add another var to the KillMsg struct so we know the flag
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Could you check for the flag the same way in killmessages?
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The kill message updates
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So it wouldnt work
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You could hack it in
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When first adding the kill message to the array
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/605366193255350312
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah exactly what I had in mind
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> I'm gonna create a pr for the sleepbubble now should I make it an option of ClAfkMark?
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @FallenKN yes pls
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Wait
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> and the mark should be default?
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We'll decide on that pr, then we can move around the setting to get the desired result
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @FallenKN How does it behave if one has opened the chat?
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Does it react and say, no more afk then?
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> good question I think chat overrides
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the chat bubble should override
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> I will test that
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But if one opens the chat he should be concidered not-afk again?
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> I think they are still considered afk?
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut the chat bubble is enough to show that they cant react
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the action of opening chat will reset the afk flag on the server
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which should propagate to the client and the zzz should also disappear with that
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 Do you want to make that KillMsg thing? I could do it on Thursday maybe
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut I'll knock out a couple in an hour or so
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Okay
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 could you merge the deci second fix,m
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> *?
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut did you check to make sure this doesnt break sth like the ghost or auto demo recording?
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the ddrace tick is local to the hud, but I'm not sure
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It is
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It shouldnt break anything, but no, I havent tested
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if it's local then it can't really break much of anything else
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> m_DDRaceTick is only used for the timer
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Also, it is private
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Cant really break anything
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 what is explayerflag?
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ExtendedPlayerFlag
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk I'm not that good with namind
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> naming*
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Belongs to DDNetPlayer
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should have maybe named DDNetPlayer more generally aswell ðŸ˜¦
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe ExtendedPlayer
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Also the Character :D
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> ummm
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/605368905111830548/screenshot_2019-07-29_13-59-25.png
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The character is pretty ddnet specific @fokkonaut
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 why?
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> checkpoints, freeze duration, jump count
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and it's interpreted in a ddnet specific way
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So whats wrong with DDNetPlayer then?
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. the freeze duration goes negative, that only has meaning in the context of ddnet
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the flags in ddnetplayer are concepts that aren't specific to ddnet
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> AFK has no special meaning in ddnet
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> neither does auth level
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I think it doesnt really matter
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 I think opening chat doesnt reset Afk
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It only checks for the Target, and movement
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> afair
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> i guess chat should reset afk
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> I just tested it by opening chat on dummy and moving to main and dummy still got afked
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> thats why in the screenshot it also shows both bubbles
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vim master race
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> please merge
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @FallenKN it should only ever show one bubble pls
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @FallenKN just go and disable the zzz emote if chat is opened
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> PLAYERFLAG_CHAT
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> yeah working on it already
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> was just testing if chat prevents afk
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki can you order it alphabetically into the gitignore?
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 i thought about doing so but i noticed gitignore is not ordered at all

14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like in ascii
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in vim, you can use `V` do mark the lines and then do `:sort`
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vim best
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> new vim power word acquired

14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the best part is that we shouldn't include `<stdio.h>` or `<string.h>` anywhere, we have `<base/system.h>` that replace all of that
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are we including them somewhere?

14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder which functions we needed, maybe some debugging leftovers
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found this in characters.cpp
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not the pred one
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:

14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always end up finding this
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That looks awful ;(
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lmao
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that's why stoppers are still broken
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not broken
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> one rotation is broken
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is it
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> as in doesn't work at all
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> at every place where we have velocity change we need to recheck for stoppers
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like, a hammer, a shotgun..
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hook
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Really??
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fixing stoppers means breaking them
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mena
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> breaking maps
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is that how we implemented those?
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> appearently
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> imo they should be fixed
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that one rotation
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why not centralize velocity changes so we only have checks in one place?
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao yeah create an issue for it pls?
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just look for it @Learath2, gamecore.cpp, laser.cpp, Character::FireWeapon, case Hammer, you will find it everyhwere
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ðŸ‘Œ
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt gameworld the class that checks all collisions and stuff
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut is hard to do on a bus
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gamecore
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> WHAT
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> stupid
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is that
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> We have this `CCharacterCore::LimitForce(vec2`
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why dont we use it
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> EVERYWHERE
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u cant just fix things in ddnet
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u will break maps
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki well you can clean up
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> LimitForce literally checks for the stopa collision
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> DRY
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> We can replace that everywhere
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut problem would be to make sure the huge if blocks match
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/29e691c2db402c652c836eb574b46cdf2821381a/src/game/gamecore.cpp#L668
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1254
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ouch, this code hurts
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> here's your starting point for fixing stoppers
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there was a bug
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but if it's fixed, you can have nicer code
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 any reason you didnt use limitforce as fokkonaut suggested?
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 tbh we got duplicate code
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/605377082427703306/unknown.png
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1254/files#diff-b558dc6d45261062ea4b41f227ba75f8R234 looks like I did
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki just bc we have it doesnt mean its good
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just renamed it to something more sensible
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never implied its good
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but what would be a good way to fix it
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao can you tell me in which directions stoppers are broken?
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dont even remember why we have charactercore and character separate tbh
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe I can fix up the code then
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> charactercore is shared between client and server
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i think ccharactercode is used in client
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> too
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ddnet wrote all the wrong code then, e.g. not doing freeze in core
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If only we did the rewrite when zeta was onboard
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> zeta has a working ddnet for 0.7
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> clean, even
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but changing physics of ddrace is not accepted
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we would lose all maps
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @heinrich5991 ^
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [2:33 PM] heinrich5991: @jao can you tell me in which directions stoppers are broken?
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> check the issue
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> has 0.7 more security than 0.6 rn?
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can we backport it
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Lets move to 0.7 :p
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> most of the issues will be gone with http masters
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> see
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no need to update then
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cleaning up ddnet code would be cool
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and docs for newcomers
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but that takes lot of time
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which nobody has
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would also modernize it to c++11 but some ppl here like to use 0 as nullpointers still
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> whats the difference
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I have a rule for those
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what does a nullptr do
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if I'm touching code in old files I use 0, if I'm creating a new file I use nullptr
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `nullptr` is a pointer-typed null pointer
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> atleast the new code would be modern that way
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> means what
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can't assign it to an integer, for starteres
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AFAIK
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> C++11 corrects this by introducing a new keyword to serve as a distinguished null pointer constant: nullptr. It is of type nullptr_t, which is implicitly convertible and comparable to any pointer type or pointer-to-member type. It is not implicitly convertible or comparable to integral types, except for bool.
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I don't think C++ went as far to remove the cast from pointer types to intptr_t
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> int X(void *foo);
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> int X(int foo);
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> X(0); // int
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> X(NULL); // int
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> X(nullptr); // void 
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> int X(void *foo);
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> int X(int foo);
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> X(0); // int
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> X(NULL); // int
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> X(nullptr); // void *
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ok, that's a shitty fix
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> one more reason to hate c++
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a.cpp:2:10: error: cannot convert â€˜std::nullptr_tâ€™ to â€˜intâ€™ in initialization
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     2 |  int i = nullptr;
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>       |          ^~~~~~~
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Love how they like breaking things just for the sake of correctness
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 how is ur hate for systemd today
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sure people converted pointers to ints while some of the c++ committee members were still in kindergarten
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u surte
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> arent comittee members supero ld ppl
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> old*
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always imagine old ppl with white long beard
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well if they are they are prolly the kinda people that give speeches on the merits of oop
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1861
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> new breed of pseudo-intellectual knowitalls
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 what do u think about having a button class and it accepting a lamdba function onclick
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always imagined this, rn its all logic in the same function in a loop i think
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for all buttons
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> depends on how you are structuring your program
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its something i wanted if i ever rewrote the ui
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ui is hard
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. I usually have lambda functions that trigger actions, which modifies state, which is fed back into the ui
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the flux pattern is very performant in react
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and works predictably
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u mean
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> react-redux
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://facebook.github.io/flux/
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> redux is an implementation of flux yeah
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it's usually overkill for small projects
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always end up using it
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its easy to manga login state
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> manage*
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> for projects on pc I prefer the imgui pattern
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mixing the logic with the ui creates very easy to follow code imho
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> imgui-style has a problem of "ui lags one frame behind" IIRC
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well it can't actually be perfectly sync either way
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's either a frame behind or one frame ahead
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw right now the menus calculate the position on each render call, this is due to it using functions like dolabel instead of what could be a label class holding info about its last calculated position
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 why was your stopper rewrite reverted?
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it had a bug
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/605381601114718218/unknown.png
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it let people through in some direction in some map
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 why can't it be in sync?
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki it's performant enough in this case, for cases where it matters we did optimize them
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like text containers
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 with the imgui pattern you render the current state, and when a change happens you only know about it the next frame
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> with the rmgui pattern you render the state you have in the ui code, and when a change happens the ui state changes before the application state
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 ever debugged the stopper thing?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it was just reverted, I didn't know which map it was and it was during a time where I couldn't spend time on it
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well deen reverted it but he didn't put which issue he closed in the commit description ðŸ˜¦
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there was no issue
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it was a hotfix, people started finishing maps really quickly
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah found the irclogs
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki you seem to have reported it, remember what it was?
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the screenshot links seem dead
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> report what?
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Some issue with the stopper fix that seems to have broken quite a lot of tile handling
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can usend the irclog
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont remember tbh xD
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `deen u saw that yesterday night server ignored front layer on a brutal map?` found it
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well then its that
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> apparently you killed the entire front layer @heinrich5991 not just stoppers ðŸ˜„
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh ok ðŸ˜„
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ˜„
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ™‚
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this slight smile is better
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its weird
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll try to find this just looking at the diff, if I can't in 10 minutes I'll go back to studying math
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ˜ƒ
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok it was this one
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks so dumb
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I find ðŸ˜„ appropriate for `:D` but not for `:)`
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah `:)` should def be ðŸ™‚
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yay time to fetch upstream
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bors is so slow
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @heinrich5991 don't you have a tool to check for specific tiles in maps? we could check all maps then
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deen agrees with bubble so bubble we have :troll:

15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> should we have it displayed on paused tees aswell?
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki it's not bors that is slow, it's our build process
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on windows
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so more like appveyor
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> in the original pr that was a topic but op said it's messy to do so
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hehe windows bad
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's the shitty excuse for make msvc has
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nmake or sth
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt there a faster thing than appveyor
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could host buildbots on a server
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 couldn't spot the bug ðŸ˜› I'm going back to math
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you happen to know a good resource to learn laplace transforms?
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well it only has fourier transform
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :frozen:
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what do you want to learn about laplace transforms?
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how to do them?
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Assume I know nothing
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd like to learn how to do them, what they are for, etc.
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you know the fourier transform?
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well I know as much as the video @Ryozuki sent says about them
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know of the concept, but never used one
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> are they a prerequisite?
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they're similar
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> " the Fourier transform of a function is a complex function of a real variable (frequency), the Laplace transform of a function is a complex function of a complex variable. "
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> according to wikipedia
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, so from a mathematical perspective, I only know one reason to do these transforms
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> namely to solve differential equations
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the idea is that they represent some sort of bijective mapping on functions
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. you want to solve f'(x) - f(x) = sin(x) (don't know if that works)
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. you want to solve f'(x) - f(x) - sin(x) = 0 (don't know if that works)
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and now you apply the laplace transform on both sides
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and if you get a solution for that, you get a solution for the original equation
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm guessing that's because the transform is bijective and you can apply the inverse to get the answer
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And we are just hoping the initial transform gets us an easier to solve equation?
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the good thing is that the laplace transform throws out differentials
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. L[f'(x)] doesn't contain f'(x)
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh that's convenient
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what about L[f''(x)]?
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so we might have reason to believe that the resulting equation might be easier to solve
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it only discards one degree or is the resulting equation not differential at all?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not differential at all
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> according to wikipedia, L{f'(t)} = sÂ·L{f(t)} - f(0)
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with this, you can derive a formula for L{f''(t)}
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, now that we have the why down, where can I learn the how? ðŸ˜›
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't remember my course on that too well
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it basically boiled down to memorizing the calculation rules of the laplace transform
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> IIRC
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and applying them, over and over again
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe you have some exercises from the class?
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 well jumping straight into exercises sound silly to me
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. do you have lecture notes?
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (i.e. I don't have any materials to show you)
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> All I know about laplace transforms are that they are the indefinite integral of the function multiplied by exp(-st) dt
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let me check if this guy posts notes
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you need to memorize some rules
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. the derivative rule
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> only have exercises :/
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I'll have to resort to Salman Khan once more
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why is the flag color in GameData ðŸ˜›
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> flag carrier*
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cl_friends_ignore_clan should default to false
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to true
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 if you have a moment can you help me with that?

17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk how to simplify that sum
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> :head_sideways:
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry, need to leave soon
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> will get internet back in 30-45min
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nvm forgot it was a definite integral
