10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we really need some mappers to make better default themes
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/964797733259083776/cloud.mp4
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <denkbar> It is depressed
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Sad cloud
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I remember I asked someone to fix the cloud movements back when we added it
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess my request still stands, they also shouldn‘t jump around
11:16 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar getting a headless gfx backend to compile was astonishingly easy. Its still opening a black window lets see how hard that will be to remove.
11:17 <+ChillerDragon> Any opinions on the name of the headless backend should it be backend_headless or backend_null ?
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> backend_null
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> :c
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> oke
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mate> aight, so didnt touched the ddnet source since 2021 june, im not a big developer but tryna do something, when i want to build, or any interaction with the source code i got this;
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mate> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/964835334485594143/unknown.png
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mate> any idea?
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> looks like just warnings
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just ignore
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mate> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/964838197270048788/unknown.png

12:43 <+ChillerDragon> how can something with 0 errors even fail?
12:43 <+ChillerDragon> Visual Studio is so scuffed
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mate> idk, i can build the ddnet-server.exe & others
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mate> i just cant build, or run the ddnet.exe
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> looks like vs is wrongly configured, just try a clean build
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> too much trouble finding out what went wrong xd
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mate> tried, same
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> use cmake directly
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cmake gui
13:00 <+ChillerDragon> G U I 
13:00 <+ChillerDragon> just do ``cmake ..``
13:01 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar teach me how to write renderers xd
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the smallest geometry is a triangle
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> build many triangles
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do some math
13:02 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1650106928.png
13:02 <+ChillerDragon> its soooo broken
13:02 <+ChillerDragon> that is multimap spawn haha
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> c'mon the gl 1.x way is ez af
13:03 <+ChillerDragon> ncursesw > opengl
13:03 <+ChillerDragon> change my mind
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> >opengl 1.x indeed xd
13:04 <+ChillerDragon> xd
13:04 <+ChillerDragon> it looks like some abstract art
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> chillerbot PNG
13:06 <+ChillerDragon> da
13:07 <+ChillerDragon> Who can guess which map that is? :p
13:07 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1650107213.png
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> chillerdragon 18
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> dafak
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> no it Copy Love Box
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> obviously
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> too bad kinda looked like a gores map
13:09 <+ChillerDragon> the unprintable characters are unhook :D
13:10 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1650107425.png
13:10 <+ChillerDragon> i see no difference

14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> someone know how to solve this_
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> someone know how to solve this?
14:23 <+ChillerDragon> Try running this

14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> clb
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ah you answered it
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> anyways xd
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> did you make console tw map renderer? lolz
14:48 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki i saw you starred HTTPie their loss of 54k stars makes me sad what a mood killer. Weekend ruined.
14:49 <+ChillerDragon> @gerdoe wait you guessed it? o.O pro
14:49 <+ChillerDragon> because console is the best platform!
14:49 <+ChillerDragon> ^ that statement sounds weird
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what happened that they lost 54k stars xD
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> went to paid version?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah they tell on the github page
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xD
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they made it private
14:59 <+ChillerDragon> yes its very dramatic
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but why should this ever happen xD
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> kinda sounds like they did it on purpose
15:00 <+ChillerDragon> read the blog
15:00 <+ChillerDragon> its very detailed drama
15:00 <+ChillerDragon> but be warned its a very sad story!
15:00 <+ChillerDragon> Tbh I can totally relate I also accidentally even deleted repos I didnt want to delete
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> like github doesnt say smth like "Do you really want to make ur repo private"
15:01 <+ChillerDragon> it does
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> see
15:01 <+ChillerDragon> and it makes you type in the repo path
15:01 <+ChillerDragon> doesnt help
15:01 <+ChillerDragon> i manually typed out every letter on my phone :D still was the wrong repo haha
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://httpie.io/_next/image?url=%2FBlog%2Fstardust%2Fconfirm-B3X7QRNG.jpg&w=1920&q=95
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> c'mon
15:02 <+ChillerDragon> its about the missing alter that those repos have different value
15:02 <+ChillerDragon> one is empty and one is fakin superstar famouse
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but even then
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not like you dont double read doing stuff like that
15:02 <+ChillerDragon> you dont if its about an unimportant repo :D
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes, on your private account
15:03 <+ChillerDragon> well its an unimportant repo on a org
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok i still find it kinda weird
15:03 <+ChillerDragon> wow shame on you
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lmao
15:04 <+ChillerDragon> Think about all the stargazers that died or acedentally deleted their internet permanently... those stars will never come back
15:04 <+ChillerDragon> 10fakin yrs
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i agree github should show what damage you cause
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> like 50k stars gonna be lost
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> oh ok, lets do it anyway
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its just a random repo
15:05 <+ChillerDragon> I can't anymore
15:05 <+ChillerDragon> thinking about it is downspilaling me
15:05 <+ChillerDragon> DOWNSPILALING
15:05 <+ChillerDragon> yes
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they already have 10k back
15:05 <+ChillerDragon> So it was all a marketing move?
15:06 <+ChillerDragon> To wipe out old zombie stargazers
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes sopon they have 70k
15:06 <+ChillerDragon> and get github to tweet from their official acc
15:06 <+ChillerDragon> and ryo the nob got baited axaxaxaxax
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez af
15:06 <+ChillerDragon> ryo stoopid sheep got scammed by the 1% repteloid masterminds running the world and working on httpie
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u dont need to scam ryo
15:07 <+ChillerDragon> cringe who stars a python project anyways
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just put random rust code into your repo
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so it shows in first place
15:07 <+ChillerDragon> xd
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> even if it doesnt use that code
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> he sees he clicks
15:08 <+ChillerDragon> Make the whole codebases filenames end in .rs and in the Makefile you have like ``mv foo.rs foo.py`` xd
15:08 <+ChillerDragon> and yes... python devs are big on Makefiles! they even use bam and autoconf!
15:10 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar now that ddnet has a vulkan renderer will you promote ddnet as one of the best game engines?
15:10 <+ChillerDragon> I see big potential in ddnet replacing unreal engine and godot
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah what the fuck is unreal engine
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> Its cross platform. Low level. High abstraction. Light weight. Network enabled. Multi renderer.
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this is REAL LIFE ENGINE
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> ddnet is op
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> and its free to use and modify
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> no fees
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ddnet engine, spearheaded by soapy sandwich
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> no ads
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> no backdoors
15:12 <+ChillerDragon> im half joking and half hyped xd
15:12 <+ChillerDragon> who needs 3d anyways
15:12 <+ChillerDragon> oh and it even compiles to android haha
15:12 <+ChillerDragon> and web
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and runs with 1k fps
15:12 <+ChillerDragon> holy shit
15:13 <+ChillerDragon> its literally better than blender
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
15:13 <+ChillerDragon> https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.79/game_engine/index.html
15:13 <+ChillerDragon> blender game engine is so nieche somehow
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> blender does 3d? big whoop, we got acq by louis
15:14 <+ChillerDragon> xd
15:14 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1650114879.png
15:14 <+ChillerDragon> had to look it up but thats exactly what i expected
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> next step is writing own GPU driver for teeworlds
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then own os
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean blender is a 3d tool
15:15 <+ChillerDragon> hi ryo
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then death star sized computer
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then 1trillion fps
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> roadmap
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually the best open source 3d computer graphics software
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 2023
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and trend setter
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES3_ChadShirtRip:756135949494386749>
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> dont get me wrong blender is op and also used. But not their video editor and their game engine
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the game engine got removed iirc
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> Seems like nobody uses those
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not the goal
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> oh wow it did
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the video editor is getting lots of improvements
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats the last version u used?
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> kdenlive > blender
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> change my mind
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> blender is at 3.1 right now
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they getting updates out like crazy
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> last time i used video editor was the old ui from 1998
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then dont say stuff
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i am still waiting for amd path tracing support
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> xd
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> opencl never worked
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> ok i quiet
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for me
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> y
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks u mean AMD own cuda thing?
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hope they make open source good stuff
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rocm
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its amd
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they always trend setter
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nvidia virgin follower
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> amd chad trend setter
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah ez
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYWzMvlj2RQ
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nvidia wants to move to opensource i read?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linus knows it
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NVIDIA-Ampere-Firmware-Blobs
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i hope they finally go open source, bcs then i can decide between 2 manifactures
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats luxus xd
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i will stay with amd for now
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nvidia is more shady
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they rly are greedy af
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> locking ur gpu not allowing u full freedom on what u can use
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> etc
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> amd also still uses closed source firmware
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> when do we finally get open hardware
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> good ones
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> high end
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-7-5800x3d
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> someone gift this to me
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ty
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its around intel 12000k level right?=
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> quite impressive
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> above
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they made this specifically cuz intel showed 12900
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> considering intel uses like 1 gigawatt/h and has 10000ghz clock
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it uses the 3d cache stuff
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i cannot believe intel sucks so hard
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think my keyboard is dieying
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i just wonder if they hold back
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it registers double keypresses sometimes
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sad
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they still at smth around as good as 7nm
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its not dieying
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it needs chemicals to remove oxidated copper
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://www.amazon.de/Kontaktreiniger-Universal-KONTAKT-oxidl%C3%B6sender-973977013314/dp/B07BL2SZN5/ref=sr_1_2?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=T6X0ZYK57LFO&keywords=kontakt+60+chemie&qid=1650115459&s=instant-video&sprefix=kontakt+60+chemie%2Cinstant-video%2C46&sr=1-2
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i tell ya
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i spray this shit into my mouse and it works again
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/964879009357897748/unknown.png
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i always had trouble with logitech mice
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/964879231345643540/unknown.png
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look the massive cache
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :GIGACHAD:
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> see, when u next revolt against spain, you also have good grenate
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah insane 😄
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i still want to see a soc from amd or intel tho
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> x86 vs arm
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> BATTLE
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but here again, what happens if intel just does it
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they should stop holding back
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i want minecraft modded 60fps finally
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol i play mc modded at 120 with shaders
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 144 without
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the key is to use fabricmc with sodium
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> instead of forge
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and minecraft 1.18
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which uses java 117
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 17
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which has a way better GC
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> parallel
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the mods i played didnt work on new versions last time i checked
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1.8 java rly is behind in perf
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i tell you
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in fact they had to use java 8
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i know
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well with modern mc u can play mods at high fps
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i did it
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i believe u
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but fact is i play with friends and everyone has the mod he likes
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i also didnt look last 3 years
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :fuckyousnail:
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe it changed xd
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i also want mc modded 240 fps
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lots of mods are updated and available for fabric too
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so im still fine with intel hurry up
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i think if u buy this cpu
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 5800x3d
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can do it
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its max like 10% faster than intel isnt it
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i've seen benchmarks, and it was around same level
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just at much lower energy
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/964880406065340476/unknown.png
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it might not be better
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> funny enough intel CPUs arent so overpriced anymore
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> still overpriced, but much less than before ryzen
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the ks is the best
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sadge
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but depends on the task
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the ks msrp is 739
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> amd one is 499€
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats a lot of value
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> per €
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well change both for $
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but the 129000 has 8 cores more doesnt it
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 8 energy saving cores
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 16 (8P+8E)
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah ye
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the 5800x3d has 8 real cores
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i am not really against these energy cores, but they'd need to put much more of them
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> like 24 or smth
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for compiling source code xd
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also the 5800x3d uses half power
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> than ks
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah thats nice
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://scr3.golem.de/screenshots/2204/5800X3D-Power-Games/thumb620/01-anno-1800,-island-v3-(ultra-preset,-d3d12,-far-cam,-720p)-chart.png

15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when 5950x3d
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i wonder if amds cpu can scale up
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> next gen could be really good
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> at like 200w xd
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> moores law
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> amd can
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but single threaded moores law is basically dead
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/964881843180675122/unknown.png
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> m1 has good perf single threaded, but sadly apple & you never know how good the chip really is xD
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apple does lot of stuff
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> specially with the ssd
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they disabled like flushing or smth
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah its in macos generally
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but yeah unfair comparission if u dont use the same OS
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> Chillerdragon: the blender game engine was removed on the blender 2.8 rls, they advised to move to other game engines and gave godot as an example https://www.blender.org/download/releases/2-80/
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Patiga yo found anything?
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks nothing more fun that a rust on linux thread on hackernews
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and c developers justifying null terminated strings
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> are strings not 0 terminated on rust?=
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a String keeps track of the length
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this allows for optimizations in some places btw
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes quite possible
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2022/04/11/provenance-exposed.html
16:53 <+ChillerDragon> wait :fuckyousnail: is a thing?
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i need to take some time to read this blog series
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its about this https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/ptr/index.html#provenance
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (but talks about c too ofc)
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'd like to see a pure safe rust impl of the vulkan backend, best is with similar behavior
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wanna see how well it would work out 😄
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks i mean sometimes u may need to use unsafe
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for addresses u know exist in a hardware
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and stuff
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the point of unsafe is to isolate those parts
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes but i wanna see the difference in safe vs unsafe for "normal" software
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk about implementations, i only know wrappers
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> e.g. pure safe software can maybe get the few % boost by alolwing directly reading from kernel space
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so maybe its worth it
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/964902290928595014/unknown.png
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> honestly it loosk cool
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but its just a wrapper
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Plans to prevent all invalid API usages, even the most obscure ones. The purpose of Vulkano is not to simply let you draw a teapot, but to cover all possible usages of Vulkan and detect all the possible problems in order to write robust programs. Invalid API usage is prevented thanks to both compile-time checks and runtime checks.
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but it tries to do this
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Can handle synchronization on the GPU side for you (unless you choose do that yourself), as this aspect of Vulkan is both annoying to handle and error-prone. Dependencies between submissions are automatically detected, and semaphores are managed automatically. The behavior of the library can be customized thanks to unsafe trait implementations.
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this sounds cool too
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah sounds interesting
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so its not just a wrapper
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc vulkano is used by most higher level libraries in rust
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that use vulkan
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but rather smth like opengl
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can go wrong with opengl
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> theorically its better than that
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> opengl is pretty robust
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but yeah it offers better features inbuild
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not required to use debug stuff from drivers or external tools
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just wait for first tripple A game in rust
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gonna be interesting
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Ryozuki when do you learn driver coding, so you can contribute to the new linux rust code
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when they add it finally
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for now t hey just testing stuff
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/rust-out-of-tree-module
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i may be able to use this
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets see if it really attracts more ppl
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i've often read that rust makes it easier to join coding
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i kinda doubt that tbh, logic errors in drivers sound harder since its very low level anyway 😄
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what do u think a ez module can do
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The kernel that the module is built against needs to be Rust-enabled
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah rip
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im 2 lazy to change my kernel
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks imagine if c had first class support for docs
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u could go to 1 web with all the docs for all libraries
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://docs.rs/
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u dont need docs for c
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://lib.rs/
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :hisnail:
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i am not a c fan if you think that xD
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> without templates any language sucks xd
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well rust has generics
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah rust is pretty i think
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> only OOP sucks with rust
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what would be the equivalent of a template?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> C is the supreme language of gods, stop insulting it
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is template more like a macro?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or just a fancy name for generics
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> c is small af, so i kinda understand it survived so long
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its very basic
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> c++ templates
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that would be HolyC sir
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes we talking about that
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i use templates for all kind of shit tbh xD
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think rust really has what C++ would call templates, generics are the closest I guess but no sfinae means very different sort of behaviour and capability
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs they are way too powerful and overloaded and it kinda feels like they is more to learn about them than to learn than c++ itself xD
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i feel like with rust ast macros u can do pretty much anything templates can
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs they are way too powerful and overloaded and it kinda feels like they is more to learn about them than to learn from c++ itself xD
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> + generics
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> templates are turing complete
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and so are rust macros
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki you can indeed, but macros in rust I feel are more cumbersome to work with
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> only thing i still miss is some logic to completly replace C preprocessor makros
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are definitly a language on their own u have to learn
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ppl want to make it easier
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i often come across still using them even if i try not to
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> exporting/importing macros is weird, their namespacing is weird, proc_macros even weirder
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But they are extremely powerful indeed, having the entire AST to work with is great
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah the limitation with proc macros is they need to be in a separate crate
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz some constraints
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they need to be parsed before or smth
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but honestly
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> proc macros are the most powerful
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sadly no, yesterday I tried to give up on webgl and just use webgpu and enable that testing-feature in my browser but without success, wasn't even able to load webgpu test sites :happy:
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont ask me why, but long time ago i made a macro to turn a struct into a form
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/964907898822070342/unknown.png
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> webgpu is defs cooler anyway
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> chrome and firefox might adopt it soon™️
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but safari and opera are always 5 years behind
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats the problem with webgl?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yeah, though I'm not sure if I will have to wait 1 year or 3 for adoption :d
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and webgl2?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> at least with wgpu it doesn't allow me to use the normal linear color space
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://get.webgl.org/webgl2/
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> only srgb
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Use a webkit 0day to achieve RCE and run the ddnet client directly
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> seems like chrome has lot of 0days lately
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u seen the news
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> webgl is fine, but his rust library acts weird xd
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The shortcoming, tracked CVE-2022-0609, is described as a use-after-free vulnerability in the Animation component that, if successfully exploited, could lead to corruption of valid data and the execution of arbitrary code on affected systems.
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use after free
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder what rust would have done here
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> panic
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chrome devs must be rly bad
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz good c devs cant get errrors
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tru xd
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/959560250103582840/959830151313641502/3x.gif
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bannana: "just dont write bugs"
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thanks sir
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u mean that russian dev?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah ye
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sadly i cannot find his quote anymore xD
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> our game code is trash
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but he was legend
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he said that a lot
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They use filthy C++, that's why it's broken all the time
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> upgrade to C
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Impure
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but tbf, i have more crashes with firefox than chrome xD
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what do u do
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tbh i never really had a crash in chrome since a long time
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my firefox doesnt crash
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno normally use it
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but firefox is better for debugging
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> get more ram
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 64gb should be enough
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 128gb per tab
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wish minecraft was made in rust
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would have so much fun modding it
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sadly there isnt games made in rust with rust modding
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they all use shit lua
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which is a pain in the ass
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to write
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lua really sucks even more than java
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its like javascript but instead it uses stupid looking tables
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ngl using a compiled language that's not C for modding sounds like an absolute PITA
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 😄
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> version breakings
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> every day
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dynamic loading issues, function signature mess
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> SAVE THE ABI!!!
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> can suck, but we all learned one thing
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> c is a protocol
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just use c as protocol
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yte
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> to communicate between ur rust game and lib xD
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c is the lingua franca
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it was put in place by the romans
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> inquisition
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all hail #[repr(C)]
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the holy C layout
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why arent there rust or c++ script languages
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> would be nice
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a rusty script lang
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and they work completly?
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i just want to start ddnet
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/rhaiscript/rhai
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no compile but bad performance
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if i made a game
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would use this
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> would be fine for debugging and coding
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/964910560841977966/unknown.png
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think my favourite language for modding would probably have to be typescript
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so its a script language?
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i want a compiler that acts like a interpreter
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its an embedded scripting lang
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can evend extend it
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mhh k
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but anyway i want an on fly c++ interpreter
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i am also ok with rust, but since rust has harder requirements i dunno if that can work out
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Might perform awfully for no apparent reason
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not a JIT?
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i only want it for fast debugging/rewrite of specific code
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This might be interesting actually
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> idc tbh, but i basically want it like javascript debugging in browsers
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just change one line of code to test simple stuff
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in java some operations can be done
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> while the program is running
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g if u dont add a function but modify it
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can apply that change
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the power of the VM
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> visual studio also has onfly recompiling but it was annoying when i tested it
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> like 5 years ago xd
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Objective-C can do that and is not interpreted, big magic
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> magick
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> magitech
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dark magick even
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I monkeypatched SDL while trying to figure out the crash we had on mac
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i learnt this modding mc btw
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i see how u can use rust for modding
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > quill, our work-in-progress plugin API. Quill plugins are written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly. Feather runs them in a sandboxed WebAssembly VM.
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> all closed source stuff should be done in java... ez to reverse engenering
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u compile it to webasm
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/feather-rs/feather
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this minecraft clone does it
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wasm is cute, maybe I'd take it over ts for modding
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean with wasm ur not bound to a language
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats the best feature
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but wasm still has many drawbacks
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its still not c
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no but like pthreads and dynamic memory allocations stuff like that doesnt really work as you'd expect from a language like c
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> truly not c indeed
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they often use javascript code then
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> (at least emscripten does that)
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from my understand u need js to manipulate the dom
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but thats it
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from my understanding u need js to manipulate the dom
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i think in the future that wont be the case
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ```
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Optionally, pass the linker flag -s PTHREAD_POOL_SIZE=<expression> to specify a predefined pool of web workers to populate at page preRun time before application main() is called. This is important because if the workers do not already exist then we may need to wait for the next browser event iteration for certain things, see below.
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ```
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >  WebAssembly cannot currently directly access the DOM; it can only call JavaScript, passing in integer and floating point primitive data types. Thus, to access any Web API, WebAssembly needs to call out to JavaScript, which then makes the Web API call.
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this is basically a dead lock everytime u wait for a thread
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sadge
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for pthreads
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this is a huge drawback imo
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no dynamic threads, or u cannot use threads on fly
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> have to make ur code run in a waiting state again
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also wasm is still 32bit iirc
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> "Memory Growth
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Building with -sALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH allows the total amount of memory used to change depending on the demands of the application. This is useful for apps that don’t know ahead of time how much they will need."
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this calls javascript code
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> else u need a pre defined memory pool
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is wasm64
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah ok its not really a wasm limitation
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> more like browsers supporting it
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as always
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD will be fun to merge with my changes https://github.com/C0D3D3V/ddnet/blob/New_HUD/src/game/client/components/menus_settings_assets.cpp
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But will not be hard... I just cleand it up and created some enums
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 0 speed
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks does ddnet do spatial sound?
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it only makes it go lower the further it is
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not in a 3d way if u mean that
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to use openal
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD why would we need surround sound
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i used openal, really ez to use
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and works great
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk it may be cool
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> one day we will have 3d maps for teeworlds
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can hear tee cries on ur right ear
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think u cannot hear if a tee comes from above or below u
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but last time i tested in ear headphones is long ago
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But our voices have coordinates isn't that converted to stereo ?
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> stereo is the problem xd
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh i haven't really looked into it yet, but 3d sound would be cool.
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you would only have to look at how to convert the coordinates into the 3d space. You don't necessarily want to hear something behind you.
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just use a fixed pos
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for the front back
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> hemisphere would also be cool
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> but yes a flat plane would be a start
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we need to use hrtf on openal then
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> pin this message
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and lets implement it
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft/blob/master/docs/hrtf.txt
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean it would be a cool enhancement
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just nobody uses in ear headphones probably xD
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dunno how well it can work on normal ones, but probs not that great
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I use in ear phones for foot steps on Kobra 4
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> behind u bro
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rush a
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Axaxxaxa
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes but pls add 3d sound and then voice chat
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> asmr ddnet
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I would work on the voice chat 😄
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> City servers will become full vr Chat
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Wait how is this weird 3d vr game called
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes VRChat
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> openal soft is lgpl btw, that kinda sucks
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> As long as it’s lib nobody cares
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Or do you wanna edit openal code
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no, but it increases APK size on android
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Why
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs its all code, but u never need all code
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u need to ship as shared object
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> instead of static linking
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok maybe we could ship it with MIT license
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> LICENSE.txt is 4gib in lgpl? Xd
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but openal-soft is huge
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bigger than ddnet itself probs
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the executable
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Wait so static linking is not fine on lgpl?
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think it is under some cercumstances
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not too much into all this license stuff
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Wetefek
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> e.g. since we fully open source it might be fine
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Lawyer jupstar
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> But then KRX client also has to go open source \:D
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they just also need to ship openal as shared lib
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its really just about adding 4MBytes to android apk xd
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its not ciritical
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its just me thinking, just ignore
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Who used android anyways
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats why u should ignore xd

18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> tldr legal is bae

18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sounds like its fine for open source xd
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> KRX is not open source
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think so too
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> And baumalein
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> stop posting these
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @heinrich pls not ban
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or murpi bans u away
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> SOS
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> chillerbot-zx is also closed source -.-
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> our licence is also very soft, I think we only have a  License and copyright notice condition, nothing else. I think we can import stuff with lgpl
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> F-DDRace is too. -.-
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah for me its about static linking, i dunno, can we static link GPL stuff?
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> probably yes
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but not sure
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Legal advice
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lmao humans in 200 years laugh about our weird license shit
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Sure
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i bet atleast 40% of all software that isnt open source does something illegal without even noticinig anyway xD
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Also opennsource
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not like i never just copied stackoverflow code
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> without credits xd
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Heck there are projects that have 2 licenses and let you pick one
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I like to credit stackoverflow ppl tbh
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Do it quite often
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it depends really
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if its a 2liner idc
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> except its really clever
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Wow there are some 2liners you can’t really claim copy right on
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i also couldnt even tell if its allowed to talk about rights with such small code
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its like naming ur company apple and sue ppl that say apple xd
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> If I look up how to get size of array in js I don’t email the dude on SO and ask for permissions
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xD
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but 2 lines or 3 lines
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or maybe 4
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or 5
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok lets say 6
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u know
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats the problem
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> If it’s unique
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im a code comunist, all code should be open
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I’d say most 6liners are unique unless its common boilerplate code
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> there is a complete guide for when its allowed and how to static link for I think all gnu licenses. 
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://copyleft.org/guide/
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But as far as I know, we do not want to modifie the lib so we can include it how we want and add the license note in our license, that the lib has that license...
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> there is a complete guide for when its allowed and how to static link for I think all gnu licenses.

18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> now convince deen to add more libs
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> hardest part
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Define open
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i also want boost
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs c++ standard is so slow
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> best copyright is no copyright
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cc0
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets add boost
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or is cc0 the "biggest" copyright
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Open as in free to do whatever you want with the code and also use it in closed project. Or open as in being forced to disclose edits
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> +100 mb
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs it gives you the right to copy 😄
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> static link ofc
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> there is no reason not to static link c++ libs either
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if there is a bug there, then u doomed anyway
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks dynamic links for security libs is good i think
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> openssl
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah generally its not bad, but i also dont see a huge gain in it
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> would u update openssl on an old ddnet client?
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks nice, so u agree with rust defaults
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or just use a new one
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust statically links by default
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats good
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES3_ChadShirtRip:756135949494386749>
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> open source stuff has wildcard to static link form me xd
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks but distro maintainers are in love with dynamic linking
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they would marry it
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i swear would love to see a static linked debian as much as possible
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ofc it wont work everywhere
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but alot
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> imagine static linking your GPU driver
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> would be amazing
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> static link the kernel
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> into the app
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> teeworlds os
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks there should be a easily tunable universal in minikernel
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> where u run ur only app
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks there should be a easily tunable universal minikernel
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> max perf
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> multitasking is for nobos
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> `/sbin/init -c "./DDNet"`
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux kernel is bloated
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> true
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> drop old hardware
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> keep old hardware
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nono we gotta support ur hobby hardware architecture from the 60s
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> where is the sweetspot is the real question
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> just stop making new hardware
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> drop x86
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> when does it make sense to drop old hardware, bcs more energy consumption, or more work on drivers etc
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> most ecological solution ^^
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> invent something more efficient
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with today knowledge
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and no limitations from the past bagage
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> here too, where is the sweet spot
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its so hard to think about it
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> which energy consumption?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u need to run your computer longer
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> to run the same task
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its more energy
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> doesn't matter
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lmao
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> cost of fabrication of a new one is way more important than running the computer
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes but its not just running
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its also about maintaining etc
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust and c are the most energy efficient
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tru xd
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> except u do a gentoo like rust distro
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then RIP
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but science advancement also depends A LOT by the resources used
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so its really hard to say what is the best way to handle this
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> probs to not waste energy for stuff like bitcoin xd
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or does buying GPUs result in more fabs and we need more fabs in 2 years and bitcoin had a sense after all
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> hard to say 😉
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> you have a custom hud? nice. i see how far i get with the soundpack asset
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> no its the new upcoming hud for ddnet, by me and Ravie
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> ahh, wow, didn't know that
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Not Keks just saw this and I suppose that should work for me https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/pull/6710
