18:45 <+Ryozuki> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/15860097181a1ecd1cfa2cb486c346f31fcbe502 when teeworlds makes more than ddnet for chirstmas
19:11 <+Ryozuki> ger ddos?
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Freezestyler> would be cool if you could decrease the save loading time to 55 seconds but freeze the players movements for 5 seconds after loading, so you cant die due to moves that happened before actually loading the savegame
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> thats like /stop
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> can you do centered multiline broadcast?
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I would suggest to let people instantload their saves but add a minute to their time...
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> adding a minute for that?
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> just for saving your actual progress for personal reasons?
22:43 <@heinrich5991> this is already the case today
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @jao nope
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the idea not to instantload is to prevent database load and to prevent people from artificially increasing their game time @ᶰ°Konͧsti
