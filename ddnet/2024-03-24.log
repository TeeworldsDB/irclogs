00:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am currently playing with the clang tidy config. It has a lot of features. It might be able to feed it the cursed ddnet code style
05:19 < bridge> <ladronexperto> someone can tell me how i can host my server to play with friends?
05:25 < bridge> <syrinok> An easier means to play solely with your friends is to join a /team before the starting line, then /lock the team
05:27 < bridge> <ladronexperto> bro ik but like i want to show them my map
05:28 < bridge> <ladronexperto> and i cant play it con public servers xd
06:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ladronexperto use dis https://trashmap.ddnet.org/
06:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> It is the second time i use the non standard setup to compile ddnet that i get this error on current ddnet master
06:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/7e8dc57194b542c425dd6a6158fe952702a96298/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L23
06:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> line 22 compiles
06:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> line 23 does not
06:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1711257260.png
06:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> somewhere src/game/generated/client_data.h is copied out of the build folder into the src folder. And client_data7.h is not. So all systems that depend on that will get compile errors. Does someone know where this move happens?
11:50 < bridge> <byfox> Can you fix that? 
11:50 < bridge> <byfox> or send it to the person who handles the bot.

11:54 < bridge> <0xdeen> @murpi ^?
12:18 < bridge> <pilonpl> There is this website
12:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> Status.tw
12:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> And why does it even exist
12:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> It seem like it just displays the info from https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json
12:21 < bridge> <pilonpl> And why is there a link to that website at http://master.ddnet.org/
13:17 < bridge> <murpi> I'll look into it.
14:09 < bridge> <0xdeen> status.tw existed already before the http master
14:10 < bridge> <0xdeen> That is the TW master, not the DDNet master at master1
14:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> so there is teeworlds master and ddnet master
14:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> and thats like two seperate things?
14:21 < bridge> <learath2> Yes
14:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ddnet master should really be call something like a "serverlist"
14:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
14:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> imo
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u know a tool like cheat engine for linux?
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> to do dynamic analysis
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh well it would be to work with a program under wine
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe i can make it work
15:15 < bridge> <0xdeen> It does have a master server behind though, to which DDNet servers connect
15:29 < bridge> <learath2> I have PINCE bookmarked incase I ever needed it, but never had to use it so idk if it's any good
17:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc it seems fun
18:02 < bridge> <learath2> I just noticed I know a couple of my fairly important passwords only by muscle memory
18:12 < bridge> <teero777> pince is good
18:13 < bridge> <teero777> https://github.com/korcankaraokcu/PINCE
22:58 < bridge> <teero777> i just accidently wiped my entire home partition :owo:
22:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> happens.. i guess :justatest:
22:59 < bridge> <teero777> 4 years worth of configs gone ☺️
22:59 < bridge> <bts._.> good thing backups exist!
22:59 < bridge> <teero777> also some smaller projects that i didnt push to the cloud
23:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's time to rewrite it
23:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and much better than before
23:00 < bridge> <teero777> yes!
23:00 < bridge> <teero777> all nighter today trying to reconfigure everything
23:01 < bridge> <furo321> How does one accidentally do that?
23:01 < bridge> <teero777> alacritty, neovim, vscode, i3, ddnet, firefox, zsh
23:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you can remove vscode from the list
23:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what config did you have for firefox 0_o
23:02 < bridge> <teero777> had to expand my root partition since it was full. (includes making my home partition smaller and moving it)
23:02 < bridge> <teero777> gparted crashed while doing so xd
23:02 < bridge> <teero777> prefab smth but it looked pretty nice
23:02 < bridge> <teero777> xDD
23:02 < bridge> <teero777> true
23:09 < bridge> <teero777> alacritty, neovim, vscode, i3, ddnet, firefox, zsh, rofi
