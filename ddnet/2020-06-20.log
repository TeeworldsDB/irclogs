00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or not
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://anaulin.org/blog/hugo-raw-html-shortcode/
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thanks
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> failed to extract shortcode: template for shortcode "rawhtml" not found
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Learath2 is playing tw :O
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's making my room nice and toasty
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the more i edit this wiki the more i hate it
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol, what did it ever do to you?
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no offense, but whoever decided to copy the .css from the theme submodule to the repo directly
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did not think this through
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also dislike this theme
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it lacks contrast
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the font is rly small
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im going to try to fix it after i fix the mess
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://learath2.info to observe my web design prowess
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tbh i would redo the wiki using only html and https://tailwindcss.com/ to make it beutiful, but i rly dont want to waste other ppl effort
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, a CMS is easier to maintain in the long run
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i thnk the best course of action would be to use https://www.gamepedia.com/
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its rly good tbh
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> really?
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> an example of why it is good @Learath2  https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Terraria_Wiki
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> using actual wiki software helps too ðŸ˜¼
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Seems it uses actual mediawiki
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a wiki should be really readable
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not fancy
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> is anyone elses ghost black
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it can be somewhat fancy
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> when you finish a map
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i tried requesting a wiki on there, but i didnt request it as the game author
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> probably why they ignored me
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Alexander screenshotpls
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> now i feel rly bad for saying this
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i jsut want the best for ddnet
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ryozuki we copied the css because the theme has one broken text color which we needed to fix
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if you think a different theme would be better, pls do propose it
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> we chose hugo + git since we wanted to have everything free, with version control and easily copyable
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hugo with its markdown makes it quite ez to change the theme
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hugo is limited when it comes to wiki stuff
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its meant for blogging
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wikis have a better contribution system, they are also open
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they have rly good translation systems too
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and templates
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> specially templates
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they also recently have a visual editor
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tbf we don't expect a lot of contribution, do we?
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u should expect
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also if they find the process this difficult
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no one will do it
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u expect ppl to git clone
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u are already in a bad path
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sadly (as far as im aware) those wikis are not free, contribution at this scale is easily managable with merge request
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what?
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mediawiki
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mediawiki is free
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is made by wikipedia
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> completly free
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and open
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> GPL-2
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> interesting, i will have a look
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> albeit mediawiki doesn't always look the prettiest
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we rly should remake the wiki using it
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i made the wiki long time ago
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i was dumb and deleted everything xD
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think this does look a fair bit more modern then mediawikis dated design
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deen would justn eed to install it, the only process that cannot be done via the website is installing plugins
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can choose them upfront
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then deen can forget
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and allow us to edit the wiki
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Installation_guide
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would gladly install it if im given access tho
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 mediawiki has themes
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's been a fair while since I last used mediawiki but back in 2010 it was really tough to theme
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723668555001888828/unknown.png
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like the actual structure of pages was pretty much set in stone
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this theme comes with the mediawiki
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its called timeless
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i'll get in touch with zwelf to talk with him about it
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you accept we can work together
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If not, @Ryozuki will make you an offer you can't refuse
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which one? :justatest:
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Extensions
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just leaving this here
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a good thing about the current wiki is that it won't be deleted when someone deletes some server
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if the mediawiki is installed on ddnet.tw we also dont have to worry
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> suddenly the ddnet admins would need to worry
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> about?
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> about hosting, backing up and securing a mediawiki instance
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why i suggested gamepedia.com
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not like its that complicated mediawiki tho
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's possible to mess it up, see previous instances of the wiki
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yours wasn't the first one that disappeared
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they were never hosted by ddnet themselves
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> themself
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> **
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyway. since we didn't create the content, I think it's not on us to decide how to host the ddnet wiki
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think you can talk to @Patiga for that
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well content can be recreated
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not saying anything tho
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sure, make your own wiki
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but why duplicate effort
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would if i were sure it would be hosted on ddnet or gamepedia
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well ill just wait on what patiga and welf has to say
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> zwelf
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> > 1:47 AM] heinrich5991: a good thing about the current wiki is that it won't be deleted when someone deletes some server
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is actually a nice point
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> gamepedia sux too many ads
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @louis who doesnt use a adblocker in 2020
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> me
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur stupid
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> there are so many sites which are like "plz disable adblocker!!"  so i just turn it off
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u know
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill tell u trick
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> add a dot
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> at the end of the domain
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also sites that ask u that are usually trash
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Has anyone looked into the horrendous map download speeds in 0.7? It seems our old fastdownload hack was better
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Up to 0.7.4 it's only twice as fast as 0.6 by default. 0.7.5 increased this to x8, but the whole thing still heavily depends on latency
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @redix can you point me towards the change?
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> There is `sv_map_download_speed`. In 0.7.5 it was just increased to 8 (https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/1b0e9abd41aaeb4ed8372f7fb6680984aaafa358)
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it set a configuration variable
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I couldn't figure out why cmake won't update git_revision.cpp on the actual servers btw
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜¦
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It does on my computer
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 from a quick glance, the problem seems to be that someone build an in-tree version
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wonder how this hasn't fallen apart yet
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess I'll add an hard error when cmake detects this
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 huh, you sure that's the problem? it'd be odd to have that happen on every server
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, no doesn't seem to be the problem
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, but deen might be scping the src folder over
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> still odd that we have two times the generated files
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `WARNING: The file has been changed since reading it!!!`
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you also on ger?
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ger2
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *ger2
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm done with it, just reverted back to `7d428676e296cf2f50aea9feb3bf435cc6490c46` until the times are also in
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 let's put GER2 on master again and try sixup?
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Done ðŸ˜„
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nice, seems to work
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Let's update the rest of the servers when you feel like it's tested enough
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay first bug, ninja seems to make you invisible ðŸ˜„
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ddnet 0.7 maps must have the 0.7 layer compression in them, no?
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Learath2 is it because armor/health==0?
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> had a similar problem when converting fng
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> 0.7 cant do call votes
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> after trying to call vote
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://i.imgur.com/XcjYmH7.png
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> oh, call votes crash the entire server
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> emotes dont appear on 0.7
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ok, just one of the emotes work idk why
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> if you type in chat /emote happy 1, then the ooop! emote works but the rest doesnt. the ooop emote applies to all emotes, doesnt matter which emote you pick, it always shows the ooop! emote
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay let me revert this once more ðŸ˜¦
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby when the ninja timer runs low the character becomes visible again
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so odd
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The client seems to think that the character died
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> had a bug on .6<->.7 fng where ur tee would disappear for u when u got shot
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> fixed it by setting the health/ammo to nonzero if sixup and frozen
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> near the very end of ccharacter::snap
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ```cpp
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby>     if (m_FreezeTime > 0 || m_FreezeTime == -1)
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby>     {
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby>         if (Server()->IsSixup(m_pPlayer->GetCID()))
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby>             pCharacter->m_Health = pCharacter->m_Armor = 1;
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby>     }```
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> probably shitty fix but hey it worked
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> maybe u can take this info and make a proper fix from it
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we send negative armor?
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wtf
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> that would probably cause invisible tee too lol
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why do we send negative armor even? some hack for encoding times?
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> where do u send negative armor i havent seen this actualy
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `m_Armor = 10 - (NinjaTime / 15);`
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> for sufficiently large ninjatime this is negative
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ohh wow
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> turns out i have this code too o.o
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but changing whats sent in snap works around it i guess
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep that fixes it
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ðŸ˜„
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> hehe
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ill be interested to see how yall properly fix it
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> need to find a better way to map Ninjatime to 10 armor
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just a little math
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> although honestly I wonder which clever 0.7boi thought he was the cleverest when making negative armor == death
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's just being validated I guess?
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 you dont need the armor indicator for freeze/ninja in 0.7
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 0.7 has its own ammo for ninja
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its a bar
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 4 q
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/723849265948131348/unknown.png

12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby `m_Armor = absolute((10 - (NinjaTime / 15)) % 10);` Is what I went with to keep things the same between 0.6 and 0.7
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> absolute doesn't really make sense, I think
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> clamp would be more useufl
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's like a countdown that keeps looping until the last round
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u tagged the fake noby
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's how it used to work anyway
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we are changing that I'd rather map it properly to 10 shields
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> whats wrong with just sending a different value if 0.6 vs 0.7
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hello?
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just use the bar for 0.7
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like `m_Armor = ((float)NinjaTime/NinjaDuration) * 10;`
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hello, 0.6 clients can still spec 0.7 clients and they need the duration aswell
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> cleverboi
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 are you sure we kept looping?
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, let me double check
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think 0.6 clamped it in the client
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/blob/master/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L1082
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol i am noby
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 yep you are right
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess a proper mapping to 10 shields is better
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I see what we were doing with clamping
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah that looks better
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can keep testing after those get merged
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 this also allows for the ninja bar in 0.7?
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes heinrich
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 about #2281 https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20061108-05/?p=29083
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess we can just cast the result to `intptr_t` and not rely on implementation defined behaviour
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "We want the general concept, judging from Discord. :)"
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what does this mean
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As in we want some sort of learn link
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that the idea of linking the wiki from ingame is wanted
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does this work `(int)(uintptr_t)` or do i have to wrap it with ()
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> should work like that, not sure if the double cast is absolutely necessary, you can probably just cast to an `(intptr_t)`Â and compare that against 32
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder who even has 16bit code
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the docs say you can only compare this as an `int`
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the docs are more authoritative, just cast it twice then
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the security warning is not stern enough for me
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> passing user input to this function gives you arbitrary code execution
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 can you just tell me a remark that will make u satisfied
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so we dont waste more time
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> from the comment: "this may not be called with untrusted input or it'll result in arbitrary code execution."
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i rebased

14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heh
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> uh
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> oh right it needs owner
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if its not from ddnet

16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 On Sunny Land I noticed that graphics are borked, just at the start already

16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :kek:
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 and the finish time shown is also wrong
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's supposed to be 60:46, not 00:03
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Imagine Sunny Land was released as Novice map <a:afacepalm:536111536834478082>
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen Well the map I load as is from servers7/maps, I'd guess it's broken there too
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh no
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> can i still glitch through kills on 0.7 :monkaS:
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> which converter tool is used?
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga the one in the repo iirc
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> afaik it only embeds images, doesn't do anything else
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> turns out images for tiles need specific sizes in 0.7, while 0.6 doesn't care
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I'll need to pad the images that are used for tiles, hm
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and I need to figure out how the times are actually supposed to be calculated
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually don't know how we store the times tbh
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> emotes still broken :feelsbadman:
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so actually it's not just pad, but you have to scale the image. I hope no other maps use this, don't want to adapt my script. I'll check if I can find other maps
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen `[5:31 PM] redix: in theory it should be enough if width and height are divisible by 16`
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> tthanks
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > [4:34 PM] redix: that would work but maybe something in the implementation requires 1024*1024
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> how do you join team in 0.7?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> cuz /team switches to teamchat

17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Happend when I try to start ddnet6 srv
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> (The server is crashing)
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> how do you join team on 0.7?
17:16 <+ChillerDragon> using /team
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> @murpi If you use vanilla client you have to write first /team then press esc and then type your team number
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> and then go for it :D
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> or /team <number> and then esc
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ah, ok. thanks
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> timeout protection for 0.7 doesnt work
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> shows unable to connect to the server after trying to rejoin the server
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> also trying to use /timeout (code) on regular 0.6 client causes connection problems
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh I should probably send a RemoveCommand for /team
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Trafalgar Law need a wordlist in data/ since a recent commit
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we should ship it though(?)
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> That means?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2247/files#diff-a9fdcdb86ce6db757bee21b305d723bd
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you need that data/wordlist.txt fiel
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> holy jesus, 0.7 timeout protection is really broken
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should probably just disable it for 0.7 clients
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> @heinrich5991 And where do I get this file? :O
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It should be there in the source
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep it's in data/wordlist.txt ðŸ˜„
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Let me look :X
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @Learath2 can you test timeout protection with me?
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> True its theire
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> But why the srv can't start then?
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have a rather large issue with the gametimer, we use the warmup timer since necropotame changed it but we can't really use the warmup timer for 0.7 nor can we go back to the gametimer as that'll break animations
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what do?
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @murpi
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sure
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 can we use the race time from 0.7?
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @Learath2 find me and join with 0.7.4 client
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 is there really a racetime? I see support for it in score but that's it
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @murpi can it be 0.7.5 instead?
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `datasrc/network.py:        NetTick("m_RaceStartTick"),`
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> uh, yeah try
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 ^
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Blind I am
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Well, @heinrich5991 do you knwo why he can't open then the file if its exist?
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is it in the data directory the server uses?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (watch the messages in the very beginning with $APPDIR and similar)
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The issue with timeout seems to be that the 0.7 client doesn't notice that the local client id has changed
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not quite sure how to convey that to it
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 only possible with fakeids
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, just found out
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but then then every 0.7 client always has to think itself is id 0
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Timeout protection, atleast the hacky way we do it is dead
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It now needs to happen very early in the connection
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (which is the correct place for it, but alas)
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, I'll disable it for 0.7 clients, but it's rather easy to fix for custom clients
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we can later add an extended message to let custom clients enable timeout protection
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why do we even change client ids?
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut I'm sure east and @deen had a reason to do it this way around when they implemented it
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Did east go to the west or where did he go?
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> east and hmh are both in tahiti
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> really?
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> probably not ðŸ˜›
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ...
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Haven't heard of either for months now
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they moved on from this kid game
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜¦
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm having trouble deciding what to do
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ertee :D> Why
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> $build_status
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> ðŸ”´
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 why is it red?
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> mac infrastructure problems in the github build i think
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> at least that's what I saw in my PRs
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet looks green to me
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> on github all checks are green
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ðŸ˜…
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Odd
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> are there docs for the github api?
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> with all possible values?
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://developer.github.com/v3/
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is what I referred to
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> $build_status #2297
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> ðŸ”´
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you remove the header maybe? the checks feature is marked experimental
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> $build_status #2296
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> ðŸ”´
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nah then it would say commit not found
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> oh i think i found the issue
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i reversed the check for failed ðŸ˜…
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> $build_status #2296
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> ðŸŸ¢
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> now it should be right xd
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> $build_status
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> ðŸŸ¢
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 dont send 10 stars to the client when shooting pistol
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> when it collides
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> teh client doesnt use the angle you send to it
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in 0,7
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> also, 0.7 clients dont need the broadcast timer, they have timer and finish netmsgs
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and you shouldnt send 3 single stars for freeze, instead 10 with one object
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The timer I'm going to pull request
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Merging the damage indicators together is hardly simple considering I see one at a time
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then pass a sixup amount of stars to the function
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and handle both seperated
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh? damageinds get translated to damage messages
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (that way you could also only send one single star for the pistol)
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a simple one to one mapping
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yeah, i mean dont "translate" them, just create one event for sixup clients and one for non-sixup
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can't, there is one array of events that's sent to every client
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> latest api uses graphql btw
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> of course you can
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in eventhandler::snap
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you can decide
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Please enlighten me than, I don't see it happening without some massive hacks
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or shoving everything in there and sorting it out later, which is wasteful of the space in the events array
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess an especially unelegant way would be to just double the size of the event storage
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> could do thAT
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> could do that
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> In the end we're just running 2 servers in one with a translation in between ðŸ˜„
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/723910935772659714
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, I'll try to replace in a few maps and see if required
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> about 50 maps affected btw
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't really see a good solution for the damage indicators tbh, they work like this is there really a reason to change them up?
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they look super ugly
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> shoot a wall
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then youll notice its a random side
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and the Freezer stars a basically too close to each other i believe
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'll always be a random side, no directions anymore
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well not really random, the bottom left third to begin wiht
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Freeze stars are indeed too close but is it really that important?
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess doubling MAX_EVENTS is only an 18kb per server increase in memory use
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sounds ok
