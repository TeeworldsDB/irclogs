10:57 < necropotame> Is the undo system of the map editor working, or still to complete? I've found that it's hidden by the cl_editorundo config variable
11:39 <@deen> not working properly
11:39 <@deen> threading issues, would need some locking I guess
11:50 <@heinrich5991> is there something multithreaded in the editor?
13:23 <@deen> yes, the undo function is running in the GUI thread
13:45 < Learath2> does the game client store an Is ddnet flag or sth somewhere?
13:45 <@deen> dunno
13:46 < Learath2> CServerInfo has it
15:08 < necropotame> I'm trying to move the "map details" dialog in the "file" menu. But the GUI of TeeWorlds is like hell for me.
15:09 < necropotame> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/acb1ada28c22919ee63b37c75675636cc2bd15e3/src/game/editor/popups.cpp#L61
15:10 < necropotame> According to this line, the number of popup is reduced when a popup is closed. For me, this mean that the second popup will not be handled because the loop will just stop since "g_UiNumPopups" is now equal to the iterator
15:11 < necropotame> Is it a bug, or it's the normal behavior?
15:11 < necropotame> ^ deen
15:52 <@deen> dunno, magic
