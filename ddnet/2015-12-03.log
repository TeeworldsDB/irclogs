23:34 < RafaelFF> Hello. Is there any DDNet admins online?
23:36 <@deen> hi RafaelFF 
23:36 <@deen> I'm not an admin anymore, but what's up?
23:38 < RafaelFF> Yeah, I read the news posted in the frontpage, and got afraid that DDNet would end, as well as happy that your projects were moving forward - which is awesome
23:38 < RafaelFF> Hope everything is going well
23:39 < RafaelFF> Anyway, DDNet Brazil was suspeded by the VPS host due to DDoS attacks, and they didn't allow to put it back online...
23:40 < RafaelFF> So I'm putting a VPS online again, but I don't remember the recomended hardware specs. Can you help me on that?
23:40 <@deen> ah, great, thanks
23:40 <@deen> 512-1024 MB RAM, 1 core, ideally Debian 7 or 8
23:41 <@deen> and I like KVM or XEN, but it depends on the provider, sometimes OpenVZ is fine too
23:43 <@deen> but yeah, ddos attacks are still a big problem, now also in south america =/
23:43 <@deen> chile gets ddosed multiple times every night
23:46 < RafaelFF> I'd like to set a server with a DDoS protection, but I have a lot to search about it. Do you have any suggestion on such implementation?
23:46 <@deen> not really, good ddos protections are expensive and cheap ones are pure luck
23:46 < RafaelFF> And chileans joing Brazilian servers a lot, probably bringing DDoSers ¬¬
23:47 < RafaelFF> ok, thanks anyway
