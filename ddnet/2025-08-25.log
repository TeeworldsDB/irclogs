03:58 < bridge> <totar> I think juppy added pred margin config pretty soon after that
03:59 < bridge> <totar> top 5 feature ever
04:01 < bridge> <totar> oh it was trml actually
04:01 < bridge> <totar> the goat
08:02 < bridge> <learath2> `CTextRender` is stateful, you set the color before calling `Text` with `TextColor`
08:05 < bridge> <Assa> gumo ^
08:16 < bridge> <Assa> I asked avo to update the maps this week, and told him that this is blocking me from implementing recorder tiles, which kog would even benefit more from
08:27 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Ohhh thx
08:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @essigautomat: the intense politics of the big powers in the Kirby game …
08:50 < bridge> <totar> I don't know what you're doing but I don't think you can just ask everyone to update the maps, that's not a sustainable strategy
08:51 < bridge> <totar> especially since every time you do that the players need to download them again
09:00 < bridge> <Assa> I am also not a noname
09:01 < bridge> <Assa> only kog maps are broken because they hacked moving freeze tiles in, am I supposed to feel bad now? Ofc it's not a sustainable to ask everyone to update their maps, but it's sustainable to update that one person to update their maps since they're the only breaking ones
09:02 < bridge> <Assa> oh no, downloads of up to 2 MB take tooo long in this game D:
09:02 < bridge> <totar> they do bro
09:03 < bridge> <totar> have you every tried downloading a map on 400 ping
09:03 < bridge> <totar> have you ever tried downloading a map on 400 ping
09:03 < bridge> <Assa> yes ofc, the assa client was smarter about that, teeworlds asks for a map packet, waits until it receives it, then asks for the next one
09:04 < bridge> <Assa> my client was asking for more packages at once
09:04 < bridge> <Assa> if you add for each package the RTT ofc it's slow
09:04 < bridge> <totar> so, when PR
09:05 < bridge> <Assa> I don't know if you can still do that, I already encountered servers later who banned me for high traffic
09:08 < bridge> <totar> idk I think you have to respect hyrums law in this case, maps should have a version system that lets you choose which behavior to use.
09:08 < bridge> <melon> Gumo <a:KannaSleep:742473892391551106>
09:08 < bridge> <totar> even if kog updates the maps I still think that the backcompat code is better than making players redownload them
09:09 < bridge> <totar> just imo
09:20 < bridge> <Assa> yeah then go comment on my issue about that. #10221
09:20 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10221
09:21 < bridge> <Assa> it's backcompat to everyone except _some_ kogmaps
09:21 < bridge> <Assa> where _some_ is a number beetween 1 and all -1
09:22 < bridge> <Assa> disabling this feature broke more maps than this rn.
09:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont think downloading maps is an issue
09:26 < bridge> <Assa> hyrums law is already broken, you broke reset on start line and have 6 issues about it
09:26 < bridge> <totar> reset on start line?
09:26 < bridge> <Assa> yes
09:26 < bridge> <totar> wdym
09:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** envelope reset
09:28 < bridge> <Assa> we are talking about envelope sync all the time, this isue the tooltip https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10678#issuecomment-3188023780
09:28 < bridge> <Assa> 
09:28 < bridge> <Assa> Envelopes should reset on startline if synced, they don't do that, they did that in the past, it was patched out in order to fix a map, which didn't fix the map at all.
09:28 < bridge> <Assa> we are talking about envelope sync all the time, look at the tooltip https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10678#issuecomment-3188023780
09:28 < bridge> <Assa> 
09:28 < bridge> <Assa> Envelopes should reset on startline if synced, they don't do that, they did that in the past, it was patched out in order to fix a map, which didn't fix the map at all.
09:29 < bridge> <Assa> oh and unsynced envelopes sync with server time anyway, so the button turns out to be useless now
09:30 < bridge> <Assa> why does my PR not break ddnet maps? Because envelope time was already independend of player joining/starting and a reset at the start line does not matter.
09:30 < bridge> <totar> I don't understand anything about envolopes so I'm gonna withdraw my opinions from this
09:30 < bridge> <totar> carry on
09:31 < bridge> <Assa> resetting on start line causes one kog feature to desync, because they rely on that. Setting the envelopes to unsync fixes this, because they sync with server time anyway
09:32 < bridge> <Assa> meaning some maps needs to be updated. I provided an updating script
09:34 < bridge> <Assa> you may ask, why do you even care? Good question, I want to implement recorder tiles. Beeing able to match animations to gameplay would be HUGE
09:36 < bridge> <Assa> why huge?
09:36 < bridge> <Assa> - you could make maps where obstacles fly in from all directions and they match with tiles when the player reaches them
09:36 < bridge> <Assa> - you could add speech bubbles to npcs
09:36 < bridge> <Assa> - you could add tips after 10 minutes that appear that show you a trick or something
09:36 < bridge> <Assa> - endless other possiblities
09:37 < bridge> <Assa> you may ask, why do you even care? Good question, I want to implement recorder tiles and this issue prevents it. Beeing able to match animations to gameplay would be HUGE
09:55 < bridge> <learath2> What was the other option anyway? Bump up map version and only allow new maps to have proper sync?
09:57 < bridge> <Assa> the other option is: I remove the sync button from editor, don't reset envelopes on start line, and sync every envelope removing this feature in the process.
09:57 < bridge> <Assa> letting this spaghetti be like that is no option
09:58 < bridge> <Assa> the other option is: I remove the sync button from editor, don't reset envelopes on start line, and sync every envelope to server time removing this feature in the process.
09:58 < bridge> <learath2> Versioning is always an option tbh
09:58 < bridge> <Assa> not in this case, there is actually a bug there
09:59 < bridge> <learath2> We've preserved bugs in the past, this wouldn't be the first
10:00 < bridge> <Assa> I don't think that matters here, since the envelope time is essentially random anyways, as I said we're not even breaking any ddnet maps
10:02 < bridge> <Assa> I believe a gameflag would be cleanest, because mods would be able to decide if they want this or not
10:02 < bridge> <learath2> That I actually would be against. I wouldn't want anyone to use the broken behaviour in the future intentionally
10:03 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, not that I care about this all that much. We are not breaking ddnet maps, we try our best not to break mods but it's their job to keep compatible not ours
10:04 < bridge> <Assa> this is also what I agree one, I provided them everything they need to upgrade even
10:04 < bridge> <Assa> this is also what I agree on, I provided them everything they need to upgrade even
10:04 < bridge> <learath2> The only alternative to flat out fixing this is perhaps codifying it as a bug of the version 2 maps. That's it
10:05 < bridge> <louis> if all kog maps use either toggle on or toggle off, could u just leave that one as server time and the opposite value as startline time
10:06 < bridge> <Assa> the bug in there is, that local time matches sync time, if the map contains and evaluates one synced envelope btw. As I said for the client server time is essentially random anyways, so there is not much of a bug to fix
10:07 < bridge> <Assa> I don't think they do that and this would create a rabbithole for other ddnet maps
10:08 < bridge> <Assa> I provided them a map update script, shouldn't be too hard. Avo asked me that the script excludes maps with no envelopes which I did
10:28 < bridge> <learath2> @essigautomat would a separate flag for racetime synced envelopes be an option instead? We can then just tie the sync box to that and just ignore the old sync flag
10:35 < bridge> <Assa> @learath2 didn't I tell you this already? xD
10:35 < bridge> <Assa> or do you want to expand the map format?
10:36 < bridge> <learath2> You said gameflag. I'm categorically against that one. I meant in the map
10:37 < bridge> <Assa> I answered heinrich, please read that comment: <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10679#issuecomment-3219330509>
10:37 < bridge> <Assa> I don't see why we should update the map format for kog here. This is even worse than a gameflag
10:38 < bridge> <learath2> Why is it worse than a gameflag? It would just be a new flag for a "new" feature. It's not really new tbh but we can treat it as new
10:38 < bridge> <Assa> and what is the point of the old one then?
10:39 < bridge> <learath2> Just a dead byte
10:42 < bridge> <learath2> @essigautomat actually I'm a bit confused about something. Are there any ddnet maps out there with envelopes that have sync checked?
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> im getting a dedi ip and stop paying hetzner for a 45€ server
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have my own home server
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> the ip is 10€ more xd but ill save 35
10:43 < bridge> <Assa> yes
10:43 < bridge> <learath2> Can I advise you against this?
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> why
10:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> all i host is behind cloudflare
10:44 < bridge> <Assa> yes, and none of them break by fixing the `sync` feature
10:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> (also i wont be hosting the wiki if thats ur concern, we will do a shared host)
10:44 < bridge> <learath2> I know you explained it a billion times but please bear with me. Won't these maps now have this weird thing where animations reset when you go thru start?
10:45 < bridge> <Assa> yes, as intended
10:45 < bridge> <learath2> Your home connection just doesn't have good peerings probably
10:45 < bridge> <learath2> Is it as intended in every case? I know there are a couple old maps where it was intended to sync with racetime, but is every instance like that?
10:46 < bridge> <learath2> This "feature" hasn't been working in 6-7 years. That's why I'm unsurre
10:46 < bridge> <learath2> This "feature" hasn't been working in 6-7 years. That's why I'm unsure
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> I can't tell if the mapper intended that to be fair, but envelope time is independend of the client so the mapper had no control where the envelope was anyways
10:47 < bridge> <learath2> They had no control, but it was guaranteed to have continuity
10:48 < bridge> <Assa> it's still continuous after the startline
10:48 < bridge> <Assa> tell me why a reset hurts the random animation?
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah that doesnt matter
10:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not hosting something like a game server
10:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> just webs
10:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> behind cloudflare
10:49 < bridge> <learath2> It looks bad, discontinuities don't look great
10:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> cloudflare has good peering
10:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> ig
10:50 < bridge> <Assa> it is what the tooltip said, as a mapper I'd expect this behavior. Also we are talking about a single jump back to the start
10:51 < bridge> <learath2> You'd quickly notice that it doesn't work as advertised though. And it's not always a single jump, people mess around the start in some maps like Stronghold e.g. it would keep resetting the animation even if it doesn't flicker it would keep resetting no?
10:52 < bridge> <Assa> yes and it just stops if you stay in the start line
10:52 < bridge> <Assa> no
10:53 < bridge> <Assa> does ddnet reset the start time if you hit the start again?
10:53 < bridge> <learath2> I find myself more and more aligned to making this a completely new flag as I think
10:53 < bridge> <learath2> In team 0 yes
10:54 < bridge> <Assa> I find myself more and more aligned to open a new PR where I patch this just out
10:54 < bridge> <Assa> all envelopes sync to server time, no reset on start, go home sync you're drunk
10:55 < bridge> <learath2> I'm not trying to annoy you here btw. Maybe that's best for now and we poll mappers later to see if anyone wants/has a use for sync to race time?
10:55 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe not even poll but we implement it so we can fix the older maps that did get broken by #602
10:55 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/602
10:55 < bridge> <Assa> all good, questions need to be asked 😄 the poll is a great idead

10:58 < bridge> <Assa> there are even a few maptesters in there
10:59 < bridge> <learath2> I meant as in whether they even want the racetime synced envelopes as a feature. But I'm thinking maybe we just implement it without even asking, since it's technically a regression that we never fixed
11:00 < bridge> <Assa> I am willing to take full responsibility for every ddnet-map I break with the sync feature. I am even willing to do a fix for a map if necessary
11:01 < bridge> <Assa> I am willing to take full responsibility for every ddnet-map I break with the sync feature. I am even willing to do a fix for a map if necessary. (This explicitly excludes kog maps)
11:02 < bridge> <learath2> If we have the option to just not risk breaking anything by just ignoring the old byte, why not do that instead?
11:05 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, plane time
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> good flight ✈️
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> because this is bound to cause other problems :justatest: script, tools, other things not getting the update
11:11 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, well you should ask heinrich but I bet he is thinking of some way that is fully backwards compatible
11:12 < bridge> <Assa> yeah heinrich currently writes in the issue
11:15 < bridge> <Assa> avo said he is updating the maps today
11:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 i have a use case for sync to race time. I use it to use the start tile as a trigger animation tile. Used in ChillerDragores7
11:19 < bridge> <Assa> yeah regression, ones bug is the others feature is the others bug
11:19 < bridge> <Assa> no matter what you do with it, it's broken for someone

12:16 < bridge> <pilonpl> I am waiting for an ARG then

13:21 < bridge> <.lepinpin> 1sec the game is recompiling
13:21 < bridge> <learath2> You could, but I think I want to fix the old maps that #602 broke either way. So maybe it's better if you just do the map flag while you already have the flicker and stuff figured out?

13:36 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Yeah same with other color  gonna try remove outline or maybe its just cuz i have a low resolution on ddnet
14:05 < bridge> <777qwe13> Guyss
14:05 < bridge> <777qwe13> How to autorule on user tiles
14:11 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon getting authing state `NUM_AUTHEDS` 🧠
14:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ez backdoor
14:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa spamming prs that cant be closed :/ are you trying to steal my rank 1 of pr pollution?
14:15 < bridge> <Assa> I guess all my PRs are to spicy right now for maintainers :/ they are afraid of the Harkonnen
14:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fr
14:15 < bridge> <Assa> I do that with purpose, I don't want to spam them, you could close 4 PRs here by mergin 2 chiller
14:16 < bridge> <Assa> and I have a good reason in both cases
14:16 < bridge> <Assa> watch me adress issues that others are afraid of
14:16 < bridge> <Assa> watch me address issues that others are afraid of
14:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yea i am aware of the domino effect
14:17 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Why my textoutlineborder doesn't work TextRender()->TextOutlineColor(vec4(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f)); i tried with vec4 and ColorRGBA
14:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** we have like 3 cases of those rn
14:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** at somepoint we can bigger nouis ah speedrun to 69
14:18 < bridge> <Assa> imagine skipping over it 😄
14:19 < bridge> <Assa> you'd even kill a lot of issues
14:20 < bridge> <Assa> it's invisible, the 4th argument of vec4 stands for alpha
14:20 < bridge> <Assa> so it should be `vec4(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f)` instead, 0.0f alpha means transparent, 1.0f means opaque
14:21 < bridge> <Assa> oh and use ColorRGBA instead 😄
14:21 < bridge> <Assa> maybe you see what R G B A stands for then
14:22 < bridge> <Assa> you could review #10728 which is not spicy, only a bit moved clipping logic
14:22 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10728
14:23 < bridge> <Assa> quad clipping is already implemented, this is just an optimization moving this into a class. Quad clipping needs the maximum and minimum of envelopes and instead of calculating this over and over again, this calculates it once for every envelope
14:23 < bridge> <Assa> people see envelope and are scared 🙁
14:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @robyt3 i cba to review the entire https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9965 can we just merge it and fix it when it breaks?
14:26 < bridge> <robyt3> I'll try to go over it a final time this week
14:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9965/files#diff-46250bc2cc74dae71a78466645fb0446a0aed3d5323a383ae8530cb76c5de7aaR71

14:29 < bridge> <Assa> is this better or worse than `// stupid old spaghetti code` which made it in? xD
14:30 < bridge> <Assa> is this better or worse than `// old buggy shitty spaghetti behavior` which made it in? xD
14:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ye we have a fair amount of crashout comments
14:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i think they are funny
14:31 < bridge> <Assa> I find heinrich reaction on this funniest xD 9999 was awesome
14:31 < bridge> <Assa> I find heinrich reaction on this funniest xD 9999 was awesome (heinrich I love you ❤️ )

14:36 < bridge> <Assa> he didn't understand that this was an april fools joke, I named the issue `Make the ddnet github a less toxic place` and it removed the comment, Heinrich wrote:

14:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if u knew how caught i am right now
14:36 < bridge> <Assa> idk I find it hilarious, I guess I fooled him a bit 🙈
14:37 < bridge> <Assa> 🤣
14:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i wrote a 9k character crashout issue yesterday about how maintainers are annoying. And in there i clearly stated that no nitpick is valid until its in contributing.md and thats the maintainers responsibility
14:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xxxD
14:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lucky me i didnt send it yet cuz it was too emotional
14:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** otherwise one could call me a hypocrit
14:38 < bridge> <Assa> no, we are hypocrits and that is okay
14:38 < bridge> <Assa> Only, because you call out when something is wrong, even if you're also doing it, doesn't make it less wrong
14:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so wise
14:39 < bridge> <Assa> I wish more people would understand this and we could have civilised discussions in public 🙂
14:39 < bridge> <Assa> but people tend to attack the person behind an argument sometimes
14:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** which aprils fool xd

16:21 < bridge> <.lepinpin> ye but like when u put it whatever i do nothing change nit the opacity or even the color
16:29 < bridge> <Assa> can you try something like this:
16:29 < bridge> <Assa> ```
16:29 < bridge> <Assa>         TextRender()->TextColor({.5f, .5f, .5f});
16:29 < bridge> <Assa>         TextRender()->TextOutlineColor(TextRender()->DefaultTextOutlineColor());
16:29 < bridge> <Assa>         ... <your code>
16:29 < bridge> <Assa>         TextRender()->TextColor(TextRender()->DefaultTextColor());
16:29 < bridge> <Assa>                 TextRender()->TextOutlineColor(TextRender()->DefaultTextOutlineColor());
16:29 < bridge> <Assa> ```
16:29 < bridge> <Assa> don't forget to reset the text color after this?
16:29 < bridge> <Assa> 
16:29 < bridge> <Assa> It might also be, that your component gets a text outline color. I have checked the usages, can you add some more of your code, like a box a button or something?
16:30 < bridge> <Assa> can you try something like this:
16:30 < bridge> <Assa> ```
16:30 < bridge> <Assa>         TextRender()->TextColor({.5f, .5f, .5f});
16:30 < bridge> <Assa>         TextRender()->TextOutlineColor(TextRender()->DefaultTextOutlineColor());
16:30 < bridge> <Assa>         ... <your code>
16:30 < bridge> <Assa>         TextRender()->TextColor(TextRender()->DefaultTextColor());
16:30 < bridge> <Assa>                 TextRender()->TextOutlineColor(TextRender()->DefaultTextOutlineColor());
16:30 < bridge> <Assa> ```
16:30 < bridge> <Assa> don't forget to reset the text color after this?
16:30 < bridge> <Assa> 
16:30 < bridge> <Assa> It might also be, that your component gets a text outline color. I have checked the usages, can you show us some more of your code, like a box a button or something?
16:30 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Ye sec pls

16:31 < bridge> <.lepinpin>     TextRender()->Text(baseX - 6.0f + space_between_ad, baseY - 6.0f, 12.0f, "A");
16:31 < bridge> <.lepinpin> }```
16:34 < bridge> <.lepinpin> But you use the DefaultTextOutlineColor and i want to remover it or  change the colors
16:36 < bridge> <Assa> uhm I don't know what DrawKeyQuad does, but do you want to change a color in that function?
16:36 < bridge> <Assa> uhm I don't know what DrawKeyQuad does, but do you want to change a color/text outline in that function?
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Oh ye sry that ti make the box i send u that
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin> ```void CHud::DrawKeyQuad(float x, float y, float w, float h, vec4 color)
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin> {
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin>     Graphics()->TextureClear();
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin>     Graphics()->QuadsBegin();
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin>     Graphics()->SetColor(color.r, color.g, color.b, color.a);
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin>     IGraphics::CQuadItem Quad(x, y, w, h);
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin>     Graphics()->QuadsDraw(&Quad, 1);
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin>     Graphics()->QuadsEnd();
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin> }
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin> ```void CHud::DrawKeyQuad(float x, float y, float w, float h, vec4 color)
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin> {
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin>     Graphics()->TextureClear();
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin>     Graphics()->QuadsBegin();
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin>     Graphics()->SetColor(color.r, color.g, color.b, color.a);
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin>     IGraphics::CQuadItem Quad(x, y, w, h);
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin>     Graphics()->QuadsDraw(&Quad, 1);
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin>     Graphics()->QuadsEnd();
16:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin> }```
16:42 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Is that good ?
16:42 < bridge> <Assa> I am currently reverse engineering the Text function, to me it looks like it uses default color and outline color anyway no matter what you do
16:42 < bridge> <Assa> so there must be an alternative (or this is hardcoded)
16:43 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Oki :\
16:44 < bridge> <Assa> ah man, you probably need RenderTextContainer, :/ I don't know how to explain that one
16:45 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Oh np i will see for that thxx
16:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> text rendering is hard af
16:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> i mean under the hood
16:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> the api is nice
16:50 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Anyway is my DrawKeyQuad is good ?
16:50 < bridge> <.lepinpin> I'm a beginner
16:53 < bridge> <Assa> I wouldn't use vec4 color, but ColorRGBA instead. For one quad this is okay, if you need multiple then you should give QuadsDraw a list directly
16:54 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Oh okey  i gonna see to do that thx for the help
17:12 < bridge> <learath2> Someone has to have changed this, that sounds insane as an API
17:15 < bridge> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks explain yourself https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/08881e8a6f547f07063af4bb684538e86ac858f4
17:15 < bridge> <kebscs> aka stop maintainer DDictatorship
17:19 < bridge> <robyt3> The colors of text containers are multiplied with the global text color I think, so you are only supposed to use one at the time and set the other to white (at only change the alpha for blending)
17:19 < bridge> <robyt3> The colors of text containers are multiplied with the global text color I think, so you are only supposed to use one at the time and set the other to white (or only change the alpha for blending)
17:20 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, that's an interesting choice, doesn't this always clobber m_Color when you call Text or TextEx?
17:22 < bridge> <robyt3> `Text` and `TextEx`  only read the global color, but they shouldn't modify it. They use a temporary text container and render it with white color so only the global color should be used.
17:24 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, I see. I was misreading it on the phone
17:25 < bridge> <learath2> What does that issue have to do with dictatorship? Just random unrelated snarky remark
17:26 < bridge> <kebscs> wrong interpretation of the guideline just to close a pr one does not like
17:27 < bridge> <kebscs> the guideline says open issue to not waste time, not open issue or we reject the pr
17:28 < bridge> <kebscs> closing the pr for the issue moves it into the endless discussion limbo
17:28 < bridge> <learath2> Should have been worded differently
17:29 < bridge> <kebscs> for me its pretty clear and i dont like one can misinterpret it to close any pr he wants
17:30 < bridge> <kebscs> so ideally my issue would clear it up so this wont happen and maintainers dont discourage future contributors, thats why my "snarky" remark
17:32 < bridge> <kebscs> which ofc was just a joke
17:32 < bridge> <kebscs> which "DDictatorship" ofc was just a joke
17:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> what drama did i miss
17:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah i c
17:41 < bridge> <kebscs> i dont want drama 😂
17:41 < bridge> <kebscs> just clearing up things so one maintainer doesnt close anything he wants
17:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: I'll check the builder pr again later
17:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanna upgrade my homeserver cpu and this seems like a rly good bet
17:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1409565869889294356/image.png?ex=68add803&is=68ac8683&hm=d07bc503a27974880eeb05144043e3cec41c4f1e9297c23ab2ae7ccf456ae61b&
17:52 < bridge> <Assa> so what is he supposed to do now? Text and TextEx are not it or are they?
17:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon get back here
17:57 < bridge> <learath2> They are it. It should work as I said. Set textcolor, do textex
17:57 < bridge> <learath2> Or text
17:57 < bridge> <learath2> What is not working?
17:58 < bridge> <robyt3> What happens and what do you expect to happen? Code?
18:02 < bridge> <louis> @kebscs ill prolly keep delay on the normal switches but not for the alternating
18:02 < bridge> <louis> idk it feels weird but u can def do some cool stuff w the delay ones
18:03 < bridge> <Assa> He claims the text outline is not working @robyt3 @learath2
18:03 < bridge> <kebscs> yea i guess
18:03 < bridge> <louis> Therres always been bad ui/ux for delay switches but idt that's in the scope of that pr so w/e
18:03 < bridge> <Assa> Oh and I talked about the wrong Alpha value already
18:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Uhm, looks like `m_OutlineColor` is unused? :thonk:
18:07 < bridge> <robyt3> The outline is rendered using the normal text color multiplied by the outline color of the text container
18:07 < bridge> <robyt3> So the global outline color is unused
18:08 < bridge> <robyt3> And it's only set its default value and transparent
18:08 < bridge> <robyt3> We apparently don't have a use case for changing only the outline color
18:13 < bridge> <.lepinpin> It zqs just cuz i had an issue with the text but i think its im playing on a low resolution
18:15 < bridge> <.lepinpin> It was just cuz i had an issue with the text but i think its im playing on a low resolution
18:15 < bridge> <.lepinpin> It was just cuz i had an issue with the text but i think it happened because im playing on a low resolution

19:02 < bridge> <kebscs> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10529#discussion_r2296078676
19:02 < bridge> <kebscs> who do i give the copyright to?
19:02 < bridge> <kebscs> since its new ddrace addition
19:03 < bridge> <kebscs> magnus bcs teeworlds, shareef bcs ddrace or deen bcs new ddnet feature?
19:04 < bridge> <Assa> you could give the copyright to @kebscs or just don't add any copyright and say MIT idgaf
19:05 < bridge> <Assa> you could give the copyright to @kebscs or just don't add any copyright and say MIT idgaf (nah last one probably doesn't work because of the license you're commiting to)
19:13 < bridge> <kebscs> That would be cool having your name in codebase 😆
19:13 < bridge> <kebscs> But this code belongs to Louis, I just help getting it ready
19:18 < bridge> <Assa> I literally can't install the apk, my fucking google pixel prevents it with everything it can
19:19 < bridge> <Assa> it doesn't allow me to download the file, it doesn't allow me to unzip an apk, I can download it as a txt, but it doesn't allow me to rename it to an apk
19:20 < bridge> <Assa> managed to trick it with a QR code
19:26 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Is there something for the quads outline/border ? i dont find anything
19:30 < bridge> <Assa> no normally this is done with UI elements which then get an outline

19:36 < bridge> <Assa> go, enter your name, you don't see what you enter, but go enter it!
19:38 < bridge> <.lepinpin> K I’ll try to make it
20:42 < bridge> <robyt3> I generally copy the existing license header when taking an existing file and copying/splitting it. If it's completely new then it's probably doesn't need any.
20:42 < bridge> <robyt3> I generally copy the existing license header when taking an existing file and copying/splitting it. If it's completely new then it probably doesn't need any.
20:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Depends on your keyboard I assume. For me the on-screen keyboard is shown on the right side so I can see most of the input.
20:45 < bridge> <Assa> yeah I believe so to, but the issue I opened actually is one
20:46 < bridge> <Assa> I made an android app for a semester and you have some control over which keyboard opens
20:46 < bridge> <Assa> But I have no idea how ddnet does it
20:46 < bridge> <Ewan> probably not in SDL
20:47 < bridge> <kebscs> thanks
20:52 < bridge> <robyt3> Only in SDL3
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> did DDNet migrate yet
20:53 < bridge> <kebscs> no
20:54 < bridge> <kebscs> there was a pr but its unfinished
20:54 < bridge> <Assa> I have no idea how you found that out, I was already researching 😄 but thanks for looking it up
21:13 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Guys i'm searching where i can find player position
21:14 < bridge> <.lepinpin> in my case its like that ```
21:14 < bridge> <.lepinpin>  GameClient()->m_Players.GetPlayerPosition(i);```
21:14 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Need full ?
21:27 < bridge> <kebscs> local player?
21:28 < bridge> <kebscs> probably best to use `GameClient()->m_aClients[ClientId].m_RenderPos;` or `GameClient()->m_aClients[ClientId].m_Predicted.m_Pos;`
21:29 < bridge> <kebscs> all depends on usecase
21:30 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Okey i just want to do some hitbox
21:30 < bridge> <.lepinpin> thx i try that
21:34 < bridge> <.lepinpin> OKey no error pray to make it work
21:36 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Uhmm
21:36 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Kinda work

21:39 < bridge> <.lepinpin> xD
21:39 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Gotta redo this thing
21:42 < bridge> <Assa> I believe your pos is not off, just know that y is down and x is right
21:43 < bridge> <.lepinpin> I'vd done sh*t thing but yeah i inverted top and bottom and ledt/right and other confusion
21:44 < bridge> <.lepinpin> I just don't understand how the hell its so big
21:45 < bridge> <.lepinpin> Oh yeah i found why im just stoopid
21:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 https://chao-tic.github.io/blog/2018/12/25/tls
21:46 < bridge> <Assa> can you explain why youre doing that?
21:50 < bridge> <.lepinpin> My self i don't know i only do that cuz i think its some cool stuff i've asked that as a suggestion on other client (Like sta client or cactus client but they don't care and i understand why)
21:52 < bridge> <.lepinpin> And i always wanted to mod ddnet cuz i never done c++ before
21:54 < bridge> <Assa> sure, I know whst red rectangles mean from counter strike :pepeW:

23:19 < bridge> <teero777> idk man
23:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sometimes I forget you are 12 but I feel like it’s even common to know it at that age
23:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> wass
23:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You know „grotesque“ @teero777 ?
23:21 < bridge> <teero777> natürlich
23:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Okay good
23:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Imo same level word
23:21 < bridge> <kollpotato> chiller i wonder if u say u are 12 years old on discord and someone reports u will u get banned
23:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Maybe even more rare
23:21 < bridge> <kollpotato> would the bridge be banned
23:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> cynicism is basically the little bit more fancy more rare brother of sarcasm
23:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @kollpotato: let’s not try it
23:22 < bridge> <kollpotato> hehe
23:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I forgot about the stupid age tos on discord
23:22 < bridge> <teero777> well i did now zynisch in german but i've never heard anyone use it in english
23:22 < bridge> <teero777> well i did know zynisch in german but i've never heard anyone use it in english
23:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah well okay that’s different story
23:23 < bridge> <teero777> there are so many terms i only know in english too
23:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I recently learned that every single German word exists in English in the same pronouncation
23:23 < bridge> <teero777> mostly technical terms tho
23:23 < bridge> <teero777> what
23:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I keep hear German words in English shows
23:23 < bridge> <teero777> oh
23:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Stuhl, kaputt and rucksack for example
23:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Same sound and same meaning
23:24 < bridge> <teero777> yea
23:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/essential-british-english/rucksack
23:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why did they teach us backpack in school
23:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> They trolled us good
23:25 < bridge> <teero777> bro did you know pirouette
23:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No
23:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But that sounds French
23:26 < bridge> <teero777> > The German word for "pirouette" is "Pirouette," which refers to a dancer's quick turning movement. It is used in ballet and other forms of dance.
23:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea I know it in German .\_.
23:26 < bridge> <teero777> ?? XD
23:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But would have never used it in English
23:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I do it irl btw
23:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am dancer like that
23:27 < bridge> <teero777> can i buy you
23:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> For example after I performed a nice aled
23:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes for the right price
23:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> fake maintainers dont play ddnet
23:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Only green ones don’t
23:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh right

23:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I see
23:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Go build
23:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> This is getting quite off topic
23:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Enuff trash talk for tonight
23:31 < bridge> <teero777> idk i'd have to study like neuro or smth
23:31 < bridge> <teero777> would love to though
23:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> irc off topic when
23:31 < bridge> <teero777> this is developer related though
23:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i cant sday backpack if im trying
23:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> bagpack packpack bagmack bagpack
23:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> but lerato was mad when i was testing my irc bot :d
23:32 < bridge> <teero777> was it talking about near future technology to directly inject adrenaline into your brain if you hit an aled?
23:33 < bridge> <teero777> was it talking about near future technology to directly inject endorphins into your brain if you hit an aled?
23:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes thats exactly what it did
23:33 < bridge> <teero777> damn okay ig we gotta put lerato up the stake
23:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> im gonna figure out how to make matrix chat bots
23:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> i hope i wont get banned
23:44 < bridge> <teero777> Chillerdragon: do i add a battery to my car simulation
23:44 < bridge> <teero777> just so you can run out.
23:44 < bridge> <teero777> idk
23:57 < bridge> <.lepinpin> I was wondering guys there are in Free open source ddnet client cool/usefull thing why you don’t add some of them ?
