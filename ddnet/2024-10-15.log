09:05 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> morning, is there anyone here that can recommend a good cloud storage platform?
09:05 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> I need around 150GB of space. I'd take any recommendations.
09:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> hetzner
12:06 < bridge> <learath2> Dropbox and google drive might be easier to use than a hetzner server, but it is more expensive
12:07 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Dropbox and google drive are both meh, especially cuz of their prices and that I pay for more than I need.
12:08 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> I basically just want some cloud storage so I can put all my files there so I can hard-reset my whole pc, re-install windows etc. and then get my files back yk
12:08 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, if you don't mind managing your own server there is no comparison
12:08 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> hetzner wants me to verify by putting 20‚Ç¨ on their website or by sending them my passport
12:08 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> I am not gonna put 20‚Ç¨ on their website if I just wanna buy a 3‚Ç¨ storage box ü§£
12:09 < bridge> <learath2> Heh
12:09 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> I am not gonna put 20‚Ç¨ on their website if I just wanna buy a 3‚Ç¨ "storage box" as they call it ü§£
12:09 < bridge> <learath2> I think most hosters want some proof of identity
12:09 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Dropbox etc. doesn't
12:09 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Basically all the easy accessible ones
12:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> upload files on github :lol:
12:10 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Dropbox etc. did not require that the last time I used it.
12:10 < bridge> <learath2> They are not hosters per se
12:10 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Yeah
12:11 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> idk what to do now, I might just buy a hard drive or a flash drive at this point
12:12 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, you can try less savory hosters
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> buy the cheapest vps and then
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://www.netcup.com/en/server/local-block-storage
12:13 < bridge> <learath2> There are seedbox hosters that ask for no id, and are cheap per gb
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> buy the cheapest vps and then
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://www.netcup.com/en/server/local-block-storage
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> (oh but looks like it only works on some vps see faq)
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> buy the cheapest vps and then
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>

12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> (oh but looks like it only works on some vps see faq)
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryumaaaa do you want to store private stuff?
12:18 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Yeah
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is data security important to you? xd
12:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Telegram has no size limit and you have a private chat xD
12:19 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> ü§£
12:19 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Its fine, I'll just buy cloud storage somewhere
12:21 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Didn't think it was that hard to get 150GB of storage for like 6 hours tho
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You only need it for 6hours?
12:23 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> yeah
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Lol, just buy a ssd for 15‚Ç¨ in your hardware shop
12:23 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Yeah, thats what I said above
12:24 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> I wanted to go for the easy way at first by just uploading my stuff and then download them later, but seems like that's too hard ü§£
12:24 < bridge> <learath2> You can also look at Scaleway or sth
12:25 < bridge> <learath2> Though idk how convenient it is to use an s3 like interface to backup stuff
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The time it takes to upload I installed 20 SSDs locally
12:27 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Its more of me having to go get them instead of just uploading my files really quick
12:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Often you can also install new OS without deleting files xd
12:28 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Yeah, but I wanna go for a hard-reset, defrag my hard drives etc.
12:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> keep in mind the 20‚Ç¨ dont disappear, they'll be linked to your account and it's actually pretty neat to be able to randomly host an ISP/cloud/storage service for a short amount of time really quick :cat_uwu:
12:30 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> I don't really use all that stuff tbh
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> As soon as GTA6 releases you need a new disk anyway üò¨
12:31 < bridge> <melo∆û> 2050 ain't that soon jupsti
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah true
12:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> pCloud for cloud storage, pay once, use until the company is bankrupt
12:36 < bridge> <jxsl13> I got 4 8tb drives flying around ü•≤

13:25 < bridge> <learath2> inb4 you lose all your data üòõ
13:26 < bridge> <learath2> I could never be convinced to take a backup on the cloud as my only backup
13:26 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Well, I'll be going for hard drive anyways. It lasts longer and its much faster.
13:28 < bridge> <jxsl13> get a 500gb nvme ssd and a usb-c enclosure for that
13:28 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's fast
13:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> or 1tb :'0
13:32 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> I am using a M.2 NVMe SSD for my OS + main games already
13:33 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> And I won't be stepping down from NVMe SSD's
13:33 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> That's like going back from 144hz to 60hz. Thats just something you can't do. ü§£
13:34 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> That's like going back from 144hz or higher to 60hz. Thats just something you can't do. ü§£
13:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i guess hetzner needs to know ur details in case ur a liability
13:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> ie u host some bad stuff
13:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> u should get a 1tb ssd
13:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> they are cheap these days
13:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got 2 2tb m2
13:41 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Ordered a 2TB rn
13:41 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Yeah most likely
13:42 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Ordered a 2TB SSD rn
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://llvm.org/docs/PointerAuth.html
14:34 < bridge> <learath2> That is a bizarre feature, is it runtime checked?
14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 its only supported by aarch64 hardware-wise
14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1295728431887290398/image_from_ios.png?ex=670fb4a3&is=670e6323&hm=1a866235cd3cdcfb9e22ac0873a46852ab16d1515239be7398a6131bf621dcb1&
14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> > The current implementation leverages the Armv8.3-A PAuth/Pointer Authentication Code instructions in the AArch64 backend. This support is used to implement the Darwin arm64e ABI, as well as the PAuth ABI Extension to ELF.
14:43 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, it would make more sense in something like aarch64. It would be very useful security wise in things like game consoles
14:43 < bridge> <learath2> Especially early boot
14:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> they added js to mysql 9
15:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> you like that emote too much
15:03 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> That's a KoG thing, we use those a lot over there <a:Aware:889021591776817172>

18:16 < bridge> <totar> It's not just ideas but entire queries as well
18:16 < bridge> <totar> It makes both
18:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not speeding up sounds like "not working" for an idea that's supposed to speed things up ^^

19:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> pub struct Slice<T> {

19:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
19:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
19:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I changed to this btw
19:35 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> You're kinda late, but thanks anyways :D
19:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why not use `&[T]` directly? ^^
19:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It's not ffi safe 
19:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> > `extern` fn uses type `[macros::macros::Token]`, which is not FFI-safe
19:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> >    consider using a raw pointer instead
19:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> >    slices have no C equivalent
19:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I checked how generated code puts values
19:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but if rust decide to change it in future I don't want to fix it xd
19:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, you use it for FFI
19:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but your type isn't FFI-safe either
19:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> needs `#[repr(C)]`
19:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it has this thingy :DD
20:09 < bridge> <baslcaly> what coding languange does ddnet use
20:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> c++
20:09 < bridge> <baslcaly> thanks
20:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> it's a programming language!
20:09 < bridge> <baslcaly> no way:poggers2:
20:10 < bridge> <jxsl13> this is professional stuff
20:10 < bridge> <jxsl13> \:D
20:10 < bridge> <jxsl13> there actually multiple languages
20:11 < bridge> <jxsl13> lil bit of rust, lil bit of python
20:12 < bridge> <baslcaly> why would you eber want to make multiple languanges in one game
20:12 < bridge> <baslcaly> why would you ever want to make multiple languanges in one game
20:13 < bridge> <baslcaly> but ig it works
20:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> Python generates C code. Rust- dunno, probably no benefit.

21:52 < bridge> <teero777> generally don't use `using namespace std`, mark stuff const that you won't modify afterwards, don't use `std::endl` unless you want to specifically flush the buffer. idk if there is a performance diff but i would pack the strings together and use `\n`. also no need to declare/define variables that are only used once.
