01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> update drivers
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tell him
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Jupstar âœª so you are telling me it is my fault I can't use the new client?
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what hardware i told you
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you are paying few hundered bucks for your pc, and they can't make working drivers.. i would blame your manifactures
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Lol I can hardware really be the problem with this game. Almost every pc runs teeworlds
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes it can, because almost every pc runs ðŸ˜‰
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so what GPU do you use?
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Hmm, i guess that is the problem then. But I can play games with way more graphics.
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> processing unit: AMD A4 4000 Apu with Radeon HD graphics 3.0 ghz
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah most game u play probably have a directX backend, opengl didnt got huge acknowledge under windows always.
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and sadly older AMD hardware has alot of trouble under windows with opengl, it's not the first AMD only bug i see.
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> You can ofc try updating your GPU driver:
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/desktop-apu-drivers.aspx
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but the drivers are from 2016.. so 2 years without any support from AMD
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Hmm
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Shouldn't there be a warning sign for people with bad gpu's at the download page and when you automatically update?
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can we know every single GPU, that isn't working ? :/
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> under linux it very probably works
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> as long as the software renderer keeps working for everyone, we should be fine
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª why do we have the Win10/8.1 stuff in manifest?
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Shouldn't vista/7 be enough?
19:48 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vp981
19:48 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 36e1ace def: Windows manifest: try Vista/7 instead of 10/8.1
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no more the opposite
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar âœª the problem is that one can't fix hardware
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> one can only fix software
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the linux kernel also has lots of workarounds for hardware bugs
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://community.roonlabs.com/t/opengl-error-after-upgrade-to-1-1/3266/4
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But they said they turned off Win10 in manifest and the problem disappeared
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but that doesnt fix the dpi awereness in win10 then
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So if you run an executable that was written before win10 existed, you have to recompile with correct manifest?
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sounds a bit weird, i thought win 10 would fallback to the older ones then
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> since the old versions also supported dpi awareness
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well the wiki said, you have to declare all version you support
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but just try and see
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyone got a win10 to confirm?
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i do
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nightly now available, please try: https://ddnet.tw/news/nightly-builds/
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> was 10.8.6 with manifest?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont think i worked back then on the client
20:05 <@deen> yes, with
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> because for some reason, that version already works without scaling dpi, does SDL2 has this DPI awereness already?
20:05 <@deen> dunno
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh what was the first verison without manifest?
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> old version
20:06 <@deen> 10.6 or something before
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok then it seems to work
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> does that fix the intel bug or what?
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> im too lazy to read your forum
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the thread i posted in forum just says manifest
20:08 <@deen> thanks for checking.
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not specific to any DPI awareness
20:08 <@deen> I'm too lazy to answer you
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> np xd
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> deen you ahve to ask ravie, if his client breaks
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs thats the problem now
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and as far as i understand the problem is a manifest itself
20:22 <@deen> Well, I'd link you to the forum, but you're to lazy to read
20:22 <@deen> too*
20:23 <@deen> but that's exactly what I did
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I read the forum thing
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he said "ok then we cant use win10 specific features"
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but not "ok then we dont use manifest anymore"
20:27 <@deen> exactly, which is why I asked if we're using any win 10 specific features
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or better, it implied, that he does
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> doesnt use it anymore
20:27 <@deen> i guess we shouldn't since we want to keep supporting win vista and higher
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no he doesnt use manifest anymore
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> since they just drop any new features
20:27 <@deen> oh...
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the problem is the manifest
20:28 <@deen> i thought it was the win10 version in manifest
20:28 <@deen> too bad
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Jupstar âœª  "can we know every single GPU, that isn't working ? :/
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> under linux it very probably works".
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> 
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b>  No I meant more like, a warning sign like. If version 11.7 didn't work well try the solid 10.8.6 with less problems on weaker pc's
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah ok
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just spam AMD support to fix it xd
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Haha
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> They won't
