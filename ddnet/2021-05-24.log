00:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on windows?
00:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno its a bit strange on windows but i think borderless with desktop resolution is like a special case on windows, as the taskbar is not visible. Maybe internally its like fullscreen
01:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> millions if not thousands then
01:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> millions if not thousands are weirdos then
01:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> imagine paying to listen to music
09:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Just wanted to make sure, ddnet is coded in C++, right?
09:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
10:28 <+Ryozuki> Zwelf if you are there somwhere, I updated the wiki, tell me if there are any errors, which i hope not cuz they are not easy to solve..
10:29 <+Ryozuki> i also changed the embedvideo extension to the one you linked
10:29 <+Ryozuki> and now im trying to add the thanks extension you mentioned
11:15 <+Ryozuki> Zwelf https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-echo
11:55 < bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf[m]> thanks. Looks good so far :)
12:15 < bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf[m]> The Email notification is working as good. Umm, could you also add my Email adress to `$wgModerationEmail`, please? To get notifications about pending moderations.
12:15 <+Ryozuki> ok
12:19 <+Ryozuki> this wgModerationEmail lacks docs tbh
12:19 <+Ryozuki> i want to know if it can be an array
12:19 <+Ryozuki> https://github.com/edwardspec/mediawiki-moderation/issues/10
12:19 <+Ryozuki> lol
12:20 <+Ryozuki> "I don't plan to implement this, because this feature is needed for like 0.01% of wikis. (unless hired to do so)
12:20 <+Ryozuki> Right now sending these emails is not queued (they are sent immediately when user clicks Save), so if you just add foreach() and specify 10 emails, Save would become ridiculously slow."
12:21 <+Ryozuki> talk about closed minded devs
12:25 < bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf[m]> one workaround would be to set up a mailing list for this... but it would also be additional infrastructure to maintain
12:32 <+Ryozuki> Zwelf i think i can setup a rly simple maillist with aliases
12:32 <+Ryozuki> btw idk how to get a hold of your email
12:32 <+Ryozuki> i dont know it
12:33 < bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf[m]> You can use the one from https://github.com/Zwelf
12:34 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> wow flex

12:41 <+Ryozuki> look
12:41 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> u cant finish the good maps often enough like Stronghold
12:41 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> or kobra
12:41 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> and multimap
12:42 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> just quality stuff can be played all day :)
12:42 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ryo take some inspiration from pvp communitys such as block,vanilla,zcatch etc they barley know more than 1 map
12:44 <+Ryozuki> i dont like mapping
12:44 <+Ryozuki> since they will prob be bad maps anyway
12:44 <+Ryozuki> i prefer to spend my time coding in rust or playing doto
12:45 <+Ryozuki> it triggers me that ur name is not in ChillerDragon but chillerdragon
12:45 <+Ryozuki> feels weird
12:46 < ChillerDragon> ah ye matrix does not know uppercase yet
12:46 < ChillerDragon> nobo matrix xd
12:47 <+Ryozuki> oh welcome back
12:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Twelve> Hey, I would like to dev a mode for personnal use (new gametype)

12:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Twelve> Hey, I would like to dev a mode for personnal use (new gametype)
12:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Twelve> Is there any github or ressources I can start on to see how it's done to make new modes on teeworld? 😄

12:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Twelve> just wants to know if there are mods ressources

12:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Twelve> Oh I didn't knew it already existed 😮 
12:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Twelve> tyvm
21:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://drewdevault.com/2021/03/19/A-new-systems-language.html @Learath2
21:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ooh, very intriguing
22:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Is there a way to find unfinished maps by multiple persons
22:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ? as in maps unfinished by any of them or all of them
22:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> like "unfinished by all in team"
22:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> because we currently look for a map we both havent finish yet
22:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> we just spam the vote
22:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Oh
22:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> you can use the compare function on the website
22:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> that works
22:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> can i get a large `margin-right` to go pls
22:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/846488484683972628/unknown.png
22:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is the person doing this famous or something?
23:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki I think the person did some known stuff, e.g. create https://sr.ht/ and sway
23:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh i see
23:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @lynn URL?
23:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the compare page
23:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> any player page, search a comparison
23:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> check the subheadings for names in each table
23:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> missing margin
23:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> something between 16px and 32px is fine. i tested 32px on my end with inspector and looks fine
23:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or it could be made into a table column
23:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe that is cleaner
23:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ah i see the issue. `.block h3` has `padding-right: 0.5em;` but not `h2`
23:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this css rule should be extended to include h2 as well
23:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/blob/e7df20917b679c15fa9206f419a332797ebbd08d/www/css.css
23:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it's this file? you can PR it 🙂
23:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> do i get a dev role if i do 🥺
23:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ill do it xD
23:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think you get a dev role if you ask for it, idk
23:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but a PR probably qualifies you 😛
23:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
23:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> heh, in that case
23:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> one moment
23:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> :D
23:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it seems the block class is used in other places though
23:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i could specify further to include the `ladder` class
23:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but i dont know the semantics of the theme enough to know what ladder means
23:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @heinrich5991 can u provide any background on this?
23:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is ladder just something for the compare page?
23:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if you don't know it's fine, i dont think the extra padding affects the page heading, not even at mobile sizes
23:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know
23:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but it should only affect that single type
23:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> alright, i think i will include ladder
23:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> updated
23:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh my god i have a typo
23:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i am definitely deserving of this role btw
23:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ok there xd
23:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> \o/
23:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @Sorah how dare you "no" me... you see what i have accomplished today??
23:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i will take a "yes" reaction as an apology
23:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> thank u.
23:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> block2 ladder is not the bets class
23:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> but I guess it works
23:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh that was heinrich xdd
23:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> block2 ladder is not the best class
23:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no it's not. there's really no other component classes
23:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i didnt want to touch the markup for something so simple
23:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but it could be done
23:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> .block2 > h2
23:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> You now push the global ranking points 0.5em to the right too
23:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> unnecessary specificity imo, the order could change in the markup in later edits and lose the style
23:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> but its whatever
23:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> nope, i added .ladder
23:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> look again
23:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> unless im mistaking what you're talking about
23:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> all these use block2 ladder
23:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/846503933757227048/unknown.png
23:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> in all cases where block2 ladder is on profile pages, there are no h2s except the compare page
23:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> those are h3
23:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im still looking for cases where there is h2
23:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> havent seen any
23:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I thought you just edited block2.ladder
23:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> .block2.ladder h2
23:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> read the mr lol
23:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> L0oL
23:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> :nouis:
23:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> now i have no excuses for not learning cpp (but ahem i will continue to not learn it anyway)
23:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> you need a role to start learning a new language?
23:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yes. i am a classically conditioned human being who needs their hand held
23:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 🤝
23:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ty,,
23:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but i do want to contribute anyway so
23:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> just so many projects lately
