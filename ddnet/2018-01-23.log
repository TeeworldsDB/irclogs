15:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I used to use hetzner. I had good experience
15:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> they dont show a lot data in the preview
15:49 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> how is up and download? and the other stuff ore is there any bigegr spec list?
16:04 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vNwQd
16:04 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master dd7281e def: Limit m_NumTimelineMarkers (reported by GG Kid)
16:32 <+Learath2> @ChillerDragon it's a cloud server, I doubt the uplink is bad
16:33 <+Learath2> they give gbit links with their dedis
16:34 <+Learath2> it's 3 euros anyway, just get one and test it :P
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> I'm setting up GER2 on one right now
16:35 <+Learath2> oh nice
16:35 <+Learath2> @deen do you have a script you use to set up servers?
16:35 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> ddnet-scripts/ddnet-setup
16:38 <+Learath2> that's a text file not a script :P
16:40 <+Learath2> i wanted to write one of those fancy deployment scripts they use in the Web 7.0 nowadays
16:41 <@heinrich5991> firefox is at 57.0 already
16:41 <@heinrich5991> you still stuck in those single-digit versions?
16:41 <+Learath2> :)
18:57 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> docker?
18:57 <+Learath2> :(
18:58 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> ?
18:58 <+Learath2> ofc, not docker can't provision a server, I meant sth like ansible
18:59 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> well idk what even docker does tbh xD
19:00 <+Learath2> docker aims to create a consistent environment for your app inside the "containers"
19:01 <+Learath2> you create a docker image, and it runs in an isolated docker environment
19:02 <+Learath2> s/environment/container/
19:02 <+Learath2> I'm still not certain whether I like docker, it just might be too isolated for me, will get back to you when I use it enough to form an opinion
19:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> i bet u will dislike it
19:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> as pretty much everything x)
19:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> like*
19:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> damn
19:03 <+Learath2> well isn't it normal? I mean there is more crap then good
19:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> you have too high standards
19:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> yes
19:04 <+Learath2> it's a good bet to make is my point, statistically much more possible that it's bad
19:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> huh
19:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I tried to use docker, but at the moment
19:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I don't need it
19:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> so i got rid of it.
20:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> I can see it being good as a build environment
23:12 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] ChillerDragon opened pull request #1003: fixed styling in src/game/server ('if (' -> 'if(') (master...master) https://git.io/vNryl
23:35 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> @Learath2  how with your auto-styling? ðŸ˜„
23:36 <+Learath2> wanted to use clang-format but it just can't do preprocessor statements correctly
23:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> there's no another soluton?
23:40 <+Learath2> there are some other tools that require so much customization I'd need to have more free time on hand
23:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> @Savander taking some time and doing it manually also works... and in the future we all care about the convention
