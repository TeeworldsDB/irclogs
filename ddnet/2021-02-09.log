00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Akari> my ddnet config just got reseted :justatest:
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Akari> is there a way to retrieve my ddnet_settings.cfg?
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Akari> i remember i did it once but i don't find it now
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> there might be a settings_ddnet.cfg.old in config_dir.bat
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> otherwise backup
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> Hey guys, just thought I'd mention something I guess might not be clear to everyone but I think could be considered a bug which is the hook when tees are falling. If you're falling fast and hook horizontal it's very pronounced in that the hook will go up instead of horizontal, like wayyy up even to off screen.
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> I don't think the same thing happens with vertical hooks when the tee is moving fast horizontal.
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> the hook goes to the same place even if the tee moves after
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> it happens moving horizontal too
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> u sure?
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yes
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> I was testing the horizontal one yesterday, if two tees are horizontal and hook each other the hook happens instant, meaning we don't have to wait for the hook to 'travel', but if they are both falling together they need to aim down to hook each other and if they fall fast enough they can't even hook each other at all anymore even though they're within hook range.
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yes
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> Wouldn't it make more sense if the hook would work regardless of falling speed?
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hook isnt instant
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it travels a few blocks per tick
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but u just dont notice it at small distances since its so fast
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i dont think the hook end position changes relative to player so like acqwerty said if ur moving really fast it can look distorted
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> It's instant when you hook a tee louis, but not instant when you hook map. and yeah the hook end position changes drastically when falling fast.
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> It's instant when you hook a tee louis, but not instant when you hook map. and yeah the hook end position changes drastically relative to player when falling fast.
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> hook speed is not instant by default, no matter if you hook a tile or tee
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> there's a tune for that
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> I used to think so too Souly, but if you test it you'll see.
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i did test it lmao
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> what test did you do?
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @ShaneR
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> if you stand 9 blocks away from hookable and click shorter duration than hook travel time it will not hook
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> if you stand max range away from hookable and click shorter duration than hook travel time it will not hook
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> if you stand the same distance from a tee it's impossible
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> that may seem like it because tee has a big hitbox
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> try to enable hookcoll and you will see that hook doesn't need to aim directly at tee to hook it
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> if you like i'll show you tomorrow, i'm in bed now :p
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll try it right now 🙂
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> yeah ik hitbox is a bigger circle
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ddnet or vanilla?
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> ddnet
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i even checked with macro and you cant hook a tee at full distance when you dont hold for long enough
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/808501361389469706/test_Gold_Mine_2021-02-09_01-53-50.demo.mp4
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the hook always goes where you started it
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ShaneR I can hook without attaching
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> in my test it didnt seem instant
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (see video above)
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes its around 3 ticks before max when standing
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my dummy is 8 tees away from me
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> hm, now i'm doubting myself
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> this is incorrect
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how would the game know if you are going to hook a tee or not
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the hook stops as soon as it hits the max range, so if u are falling and hook down it could theoretically go infinite, if ur fallseped is exactly the hook speed
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it could check @louis 😉
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well theres the case of you hooking towards a hookable and a tee falling into your hook while it's traveling
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> I set up a test yesterday with cloudly so we both fell horizontal at the same time, once we fell fast enough we couldn't hook each other at all anymore.
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> idk if that's on purpose but it feels broken.
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as said it goes there where u triggered it
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so if u at the same y level, it will stay above it, bcs its not instant
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so you need to hook down to hook him
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> yeah, but shouldn't it go horizontal relative to the tee? what I mean is if when the tip of the grappling hook exits your tee when you have fall speed, shouldn't it also have fall speed?
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in order to hit him as soon he hits that coordinate
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the hook is independent of the tee tho, it has its own direction and current position
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that the tee "has" the hoook is only a visual thing
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it only stops as soon as the tee pos - hook pos is max hook length
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> true, in the real world, going at a high speed and throwing an object will have the object flying relative to your position (ignoring some side effects)
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the hook in teeworlds however doesn't go relative to you, but relative to the world
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> whhaaaat teeworlds is real world
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also u cant change physics in teeworlds
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> why? because players are used to the current physics?
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
02:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> exactly, all maps are made with the current physics and all players are used to it, meaning it won't change
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> Is there any map part that could be broken if hooks moved relative to tees?
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> all
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why would u want this XD
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> teeworlds is not meant to be realistic
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the hook is one of the most essential parts of ddnet, so it will probably break many many maps
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or have u ever used a double jump in real life?
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> Because it's useful to be able to hook tees even if you're falling or moving fast.
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Jupstar ✪ intuitive physics are prob good though, and tbh that might be a bit more intuitive if you arent used to the current state ^^
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the hook always goes how to trigger it
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> Depends, if you're falling fast enough it's actually impossible, the tip of the hook goes way off screen
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so if u want to hook somebody in "future" while falling, hook down
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but if u fall so fast, u might just be fail
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how often does this even happen on ddrace
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> That's an extreme example, but the effect is noticeable even when falling slow where instead of aiming at the tee you have to hook under them when falling to hook them.
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in reallife its realted to air friction tho, so if the hook is just a piece of paper, it would loose alot of velocity
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it would look similar to now
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol that hook relative to tee woudl break so many maps
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> by that same logic, the tee would have air friction too.
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> how could it break any part?
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tho it would make teeworlds physics harder in fact
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs its harder to predict more physics in ur brain
02:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u know hook is not related to any kind of gravity its really just knowing hook speed
02:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk if ur trolling or not
02:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/808504832029360218/screenshot_2021-02-08_19-09-20.png
02:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> look at this common move
02:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> impossible with relative movement
02:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> since ur player is going fast ur hook would land to the right of the tee unless u specifically hook before the hookthrough
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> which is why ddnet physics never change, cuz it would break something else thats more harmful than whatever new thing is implemented
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> It would make that harder yeah.
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> good point
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its hard to say if it actually breaks something to a point of unplayable, but it would break all ranks for sure
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> e.g. dummy drag would feel different, so dummy map ranks wouldnt be comparable to old state anymore
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> I guess it would feel really strange to play with. Initially I thought it would be an improvement because it's more realistic but your example highlights a drawback louis. Some things would be harder and others easier. The argument that it would change the game so much that ranks aren't equal anymore is a strong one too but the same could be said about being able to hammer while frozen.
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> Anyway, just thought I'd mention it. I'm going to sleep. Night dudes ^^
02:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> gn
02:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah the not being able to hook while falling is pretty annoying sometimes but idk if theres a good solution that doesn't mess up anything else either :tear:
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> just ask matricks why he made the hook this way
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the grenade was done as absolute because it's easier to predict
02:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> isnt that good, or else you couldn't do a double on a wall :o
02:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait you could but itd be so different
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the effects of the hook being absolute get more and more obvious as your velocity increases. My guess would be even though the feeling of the game would change, it wouldn't make many parts impossible because you are rarely moving fast while trying to hook someone
03:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> not like you would double on a wall in vanilla
03:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But it would change the feeling for gores, bcs it would also affect the hook when moving left and right, doing 1 tilers would be different, and insane gores is about learning to move in a 1tiler - 2 tiler style
03:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would be a funny experiement tho, i wonder if the game is really easier, i'd say it adds more complexity ^^
03:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but maybe the human intuition likes it more, who knows ^^
03:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i would also want to try how it plays
04:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Patiga did u make the map reverser script? is it possible to do it upside down too
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @louis both mirroring and rotating right is supported. for upside down for example, rotate twice and mirror once.
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> so if using the command line is not problem, do
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `edit_map --DDNet -m -rr input_file output_file`
11:49 <+ChillerDragon> rotate twice and mirror once = upside down
11:49 <+ChillerDragon> :brain:
11:50 <+ChillerDragon> u so pro @Patiga maybe you have the motivation to finalize a protocol dissector for 0.6 and 0.7
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> Chillerdragon: I think I'm fine :d, still got other stuff to do
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> meh
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 could you add a README to your dissector? :/ i can not get it running
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Chiller it doesnt dissect much anyway
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But if you want to try, just clone wireshark. Add this folder to the plugin directory. Add teeworlds to the cmakelists
13:11 <+ChillerDragon> plugin/epan ?
13:11 <+ChillerDragon> and rebuild wireshark?
13:11 <+ChillerDragon> oh teeworlds to cmakelists i think i missed that step
13:11 <+ChillerDragon> lemme see
13:13 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait its also still 0.6 right?
13:14 <+ChillerDragon> 0.7 has longer packet header as far as i understood
13:17 <+ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/7J ``packet-teeworlds.c:237:24: error: request for implicit conversion from ‘void *’ to ‘unsigned char *’ not permitted in C++ [-Werror=c++-compat]``
13:17 <+ChillerDragon> meh
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> why not -9999?
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 9k
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/808677397125529640/unknown.png
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> there is a score display limit in scoreboard
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so add number  for the limit
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> cl_ddrace_scoreboard
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon I had it working with 0.7 too but I broke something, then I thought I broke something else, then I raged and removed all of the stateful processing, then I noticed that wasn’t what was broken but it was too late
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it clamps to -999 to +99999 i think
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 👍
14:51 <+ChillerDragon> oof
14:51 <+ChillerDragon> yea i see you detecting the different protocol types
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> chillernobo
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> ChillerDragay:
16:01 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 do you run wireshark built from src as root? I always did that when working with fstd's dissector but I wondder if there is a smarter way
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No why would I?
16:01 <+ChillerDragon> yay 
16:01 <+ChillerDragon> how do u do it?
16:02 <+ChillerDragon> oh u dont capture live i guess
16:02 <+ChillerDragon> true thats an option
16:02 <+ChillerDragon> but i like live captures :)
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> ima yeet out some crazy pr soon btw
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> be rdy
16:03 <+ChillerDragon> its gonna be HUGHE
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1359048125403590660/photo/2
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kek
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> notepad
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> = windows
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they deserve it for using windows
16:34 <+fstd> ChillerDragon: wireshark has a suid root capture helper
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Finally kernel lock bug has been fixed for Intel GPUs: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/intel/-/issues/2905
16:34 <+fstd> although i usually don't even capture with wireshark, i capture with tcpdump -w /tmp/file and then wireshark /tmp/file
16:35 <+fstd> kernel lock bug sounds nasty
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, froze randomly about once a day for me
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @deen could you please apply the "NUT_harcore_bestof" fix https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/798942116213817364
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Patiga thanks, doing so now
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> awesome, thanks :)
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can also give the binary the capability as root once, tho that doesnt help when you are rebuilding all the time
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wait doesnt wireshark use dumpcap anyway?
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> it uses dumpcap  i think
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> yea i should record some pcaps its probably convient anyways
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> zZz
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> should be `1 of 627 servers` imo

18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> open an issue or a PR 😉
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> is that worth doing for a little typo?
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it won't be forgotten that way ^^ doesn't really matter I guess
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3449
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 https://discourse.libsdl.org/t/sdl-moving-to-github/28700 maybe better chance of getting a PR approved? 🙂
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hopefully 🙂
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do we have the SVG of the entities? did @Soreu share them ever?
