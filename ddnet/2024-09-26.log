00:29 < bridge> <diariesvexar> well it's just set volume to zero
00:30 < bridge> <teero777> I was responding to Ewan saying that that functionality doesn't exist. mb if it sounded like a question
00:31 < bridge> <diariesvexar> oh ops I just saw your text and screenshot didn't read anything else 😄

04:36 < bridge> <kdaniel> yea i know its proxied over cloudflare.. and i whitelisted all the cf ips too
04:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> is your server intend to be able to connected by anyone?
04:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> normally you would open your servers port for every source ip
04:38 < bridge> <kdaniel> Im just testing something...
04:38 < bridge> <kdaniel> I block everything except of my ip and the masterservers firstly...
04:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye, that won't work
04:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the connect back is from another server which is not cloudflare related
04:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the connection report is from another server which is not cloudflare related
04:41 < bridge> <Ewan> listen on 0.0.0.0 on ur server port
04:41 < bridge> <Ewan> if ur port is bad then nothing u can do
04:42 < bridge> <Ewan> ISP and NAT stuff
04:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> sounds like he doesn't want to
04:42 < bridge> <Ewan> change port.
04:42 < bridge> <kdaniel> mhh damn. I want to write you my idea per dm can you maybe accept my friends request (you can delete me after the messages if its okay)
04:42 < bridge> <Ewan> i didnt read

04:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest: i don't think i care about it enough either, sorry. i'm still doing some other works.
04:42 < bridge> <Ewan> i would be surprised if cloudflare proxying works
04:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i've only seen that work for http traffic
04:43 < bridge> <Ewan> need to expose ur IP or use a vpn sadge
04:43 < bridge> <kdaniel> I can understand that myself.
04:43 < bridge> <Ewan> he means well
04:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i think i have a job now
04:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> awesome

09:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you put random stuff in a query before it starts working as you want it to
09:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i cant read this 
09:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see two time columns but 3 values for it
09:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``"	Map, Name, Timestamp, Time, Server, "`` here we say we want to set the colums Timestamp and Time
09:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then we provide two values ``pSqlServer->InsertTimestampAsUtc(), pData->m_Time,``
09:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and we also bind this???? ``pSqlServer->BindString(3, pData->m_aTimestamp);``
09:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf this is amazing 😄
09:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epyc email template moment
09:31 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> nice teeish email i love it
09:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: `InsertTimestampAsUtc` doesn't print timestamp, it returns `DATETIME(?, 'utc')` and `pSqlServer->BindString(3, pData->m_aTimestamp);` code binds to the `?`

09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> all hail c
09:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> @teero777 just be good tm ^
09:42 < bridge> <Ewan> jeez
09:42 < bridge> <totar> That buffer overflow is almost 10 years older than him xd
09:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xD
09:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> ??
09:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> my point stands
09:43 < bridge> <Ewan> such grammars
09:43 < bridge> <Ewan> in this article
09:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> wdym
09:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> is it too british or smth?
09:44 < bridge> <Ewan> A few months ago, I stumbled upon a 24 years old buffer overflow in the glibc, the base library for linux programs
09:44 < bridge> <Ewan> 24 year old
09:44 < bridge> <Ewan> a buffer overflow in glibc
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Wouldn't have happened on Windows
09:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont understand
09:44 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s a bit broken xD
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Windows^-1 > Linux
09:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> year-old as adjective
09:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway glibc should be among the most audited libraries
09:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> if not idk what the world is doing
09:45 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
09:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> and it has buffer overflows
09:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> that was my point
09:45 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s on a bounty basis prob
09:45 < bridge> <Ewan> but all that research behind closed doors
09:45 < bridge> <Ewan> cuz security
10:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> seems like the new hex is few chars too long XDD
10:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1288772375747498026/image.png?ex=66f6664e&is=66f514ce&hm=a5c839d3c1bd56e702d4fa730bd577a51e759d18ad4431b9e622d882bcd48ad8&
10:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> lmao
10:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can i just decrease the font size?
10:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean, ye, but it would probably be too small
10:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> even if you decrease the padding and shink the size
10:02 < bridge> <Ewan> use rem
10:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> there are mail clients that displayes in 480px width
10:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I can still decrease the token size
10:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> which is still gonna be short
10:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so no worries
10:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the tokens are only valid for a few minutes anyway
10:03 < bridge> <Ewan> assume 16px = 1em and then translate and u have scalable css
10:03 < bridge> <Ewan> for free
10:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the template adapts from 320px to 540px
10:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:amogus:876956004674338848> i mean mail html are built different. probably need to test everything again
10:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://www.caniemail.com/features/css-unit-rem/
10:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> lmao windows mail
10:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nah bro
10:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'll just decrease the token length
10:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> probably a good idea
10:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> how many bits was that currently
10:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 32bytes
10:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as secure as a private key xdd
10:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:steam:1233877507896381490>
10:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 8 bytes are probs more than enough already
10:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or 16 bytes to be safe
10:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> half length is probably short enough to fit
10:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> half of thatis probably short enough to fit
10:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean google etc. use like 5 digits or smth
10:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> half of that is probably short enough to fit
10:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927> 6 digits usually i think
10:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @tsfreddie ok works now, thanks.

10:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when dark design?
10:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
10:32 < bridge> <learath2> Not even health insurance?
10:33 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> whats this for
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> accounts if you use email as login
10:33 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> accounts in ddnet real?
10:33 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s a contractor position so they purely give me the money. whether it’s 1099 or W2 work we’re not sure yet but the only difference is W2 takes out taxes beforehand
10:33 < bridge> <Ewan> no benefits for either
10:33 < bridge> <Ewan> also part time
10:34 < bridge> <robyt3> 1. How does it look in an email client that only accepts text?
10:34 < bridge> <robyt3> 2. `Please` --> `please`, the sentence begins with `Hello`.
10:34 < bridge> <robyt3> 3. Not sure about the term `token`, I feel like `code` would be easier to understand for the average user.
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> u never ever get benefits with part time work in the USA
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how much time is part time for you?
10:35 < bridge> <Ewan> I need to sleep but I cannot get enough of this solo
10:35 < bridge> <Ewan> unsure atm
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it's a half time job thats hot
10:35 < bridge> <Ewan> basically yea
10:36 < bridge> <Ewan> I’d be doing $21/hr at IT place w benefits full time, $27-30 w/o any extras part time works out to about the same pay I believe
10:36 < bridge> <learath2> I would experiment with slightly darker colors for the top section
10:36 < bridge> <learath2> It might be too close to white
10:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't have terminal email client
10:36 < bridge> <Ewan> depends on hrs obviously
10:37 < bridge> <Ewan> what if u made the rectangles some subtle mapres xd
10:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that also isn't your job to find out. the ppl that use terminal clients can report back if it works or not
10:37 < bridge> <robyt3> Can you send the email to my gmail (see github)? I'll try with my Thunderbird
10:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> gmail blocks so many css properties i doubt we could make mapres
10:38 < bridge> <Ewan> sad
10:38 < bridge> <Ewan> thunderbird blocks images too
10:38 < bridge> <Ewan> but nowadays I use simple html view
10:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> @jupeyy_keks
10:38 < bridge> <learath2> So out of pocket you need to pay for your own insurance?
10:38 < bridge> <Ewan> unless I end up below the household limit for government insurance, yes
10:38 < bridge> <Ewan> which is unlikely
10:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> k-9 does not support css backgroundimage even if i allowed images
10:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1288781917793292308/Screenshot_20240926_163834.jpg?ex=66f66f31&is=66f51db1&hm=b1a4756ca2c3ff3025e41023d269645dde91d776222724ea403aea5c6236c27b&
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Just create an account 😏
10:40 < bridge> <Ewan> ya but he needs the email contents xd
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how can i forward a email without leaking the source?
10:40 < bridge> <Ewan> hm
10:40 < bridge> <Ewan> u mean the original sender
10:40 < bridge> <Ewan> not sure actually
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 give me ur email
10:40 < bridge> <Ewan> github
10:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am too lazy
10:41 < bridge> <robyt3> https://github.com/Robyt3 😛
10:41 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> is an auto updater possible on android
10:42 < bridge> <robyt3> When we publish on F-Droid, I guess
10:42 < bridge> <robyt3> Not within the client
10:42 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> what is f droid
10:42 < bridge> <robyt3> https://f-droid.org/
10:42 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> oh
10:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 did u get the mail
10:43 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> is it gonna be on google playstore tho? xd
10:43 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, thanks
10:44 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ik it costs like money or smth to upload it but maybe donations for it
10:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> maintaining relationship with google play is actually pretty tedious
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> there are more requirements
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
10:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> biggernouis got taken down cuz they keep changing stuff
10:48 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> oh
10:48 < bridge> <robyt3> The issue with Google Play is that it costs more nerves, yeah
10:48 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> that sucks
10:48 < bridge> <Ewan> they intentionally make most online marketplaces uninhabitable for smaller projects
10:49 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i feel like it would get a bit more players, considering all the tiktoks going on
10:49 < bridge> <Ewan> app stores
10:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> steam also cost money but valve's developer experience is like so good
10:49 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
10:50 < bridge> <robyt3> Images don't show in Thunderbird either
10:50 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1288784689410084927/image.png?ex=66f671c6&is=66f52046&hm=2df0b9823d605257e6cb2df475c51237d7f38312f5224e2b39c2d00c3a80574f&
10:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's expected really
10:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can DM me
10:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i allowed it on my thunderbird tho
10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah sounds fine to me
10:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also i thought you meant clients that doesn't take html
10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's only cosmetic
10:51 < bridge> <Ewan> this is more coherent than the majority of automated emails I get without their embedded media
10:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's why there is also an ugly title
10:51 < bridge> <Ewan> this is a win

10:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> did not cost money for ddnet
10:54 < bridge> <robyt3> The token having pipes around is should probably be avoid in the plain text version
10:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> just make sure to strip the pipes in the input field
10:55 < bridge> <robyt3> The token having pipes around is should probably be avoided in the plain text version
10:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or rather, after the input field is submitted

10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh it says "lose"
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> forgot to f5
10:55 < bridge> <robyt3> `email` (in English), `lose`
10:56 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe the DDNet title could be on the left side aligned with the other text? Then it would also look better if images cannot be loaded
10:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Save that on your todo 😉

11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> I love the terse emoji names
11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> 💠
11:17 < bridge> <murpi> Is the maximum skin name length exactly 23 characters? Does anyone know?
11:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
11:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/89474ae2b075e9ed08d47d7e3c38461b1228d441/datasrc/network.py#L226-L228
11:18 < bridge> <murpi> What about the minimum character length?
11:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> subtract one for null termination
11:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (it's 23 UTF-8 bytes, not 23 "characters" btw)
11:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> either 1 or 0, let's check
11:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> should be 0
11:19 < bridge> <murpi> Just need to know the range, so I can restrict the name field in #📬submit-skins
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which doesn't mean you should support 0 if u do it for some discord bot
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess you should use 2 or 3 as minimum then
11:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what jupstar says
11:26 < bridge> <murpi> Oh, I already have a check for this... oops.
11:26 < bridge> <murpi> ```py
11:26 < bridge> <murpi> len(re_match["skin_name"]) < 24```
11:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's an incorrect check
11:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> due to this
11:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you need `len(re_match["skin_name"].encode("utf8")) < 24`
11:27 < bridge> <murpi> Ok
11:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 2024 the year of the ddnet accounts?
11:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That email better look good in mutt email client :p
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah i added ascii art support now
11:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No you didn’t
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well i dunno if the cpp will get it this year
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just thinking about the ffi already demotivates me xdd
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but good thing for you, dd-pg will release this year and it has account support
11:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, you wrote the client support in rust? nice!
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what client support xd
11:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> does the client not need a way to log in?
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you mean dd-pg or what client?
11:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah dd-pg is 100% rust
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> (except for some external libs)
11:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> true. I guess it was obvious that the client impl of accounts is in rust
11:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it was still nice to hear ^^
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I guess I'll soon release the account impl on github and crates.io
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then i can remove it from my monorepo
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and ddnet maintainers can start to check the code/idea etc.
11:59 < bridge> <Dreamless> Accounts happening soon?
12:00 < bridge> <urg_> finally BEGONE BLOCKERS
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Hello toast. the account impl is idependent of ddnet getting accounts.
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So when accounts come is a different question and I cannot answer it
12:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But this is the implementation for the account server
12:01 < bridge> <Dreamless> It's good to hear that we have a starting point regardless
12:02 < bridge> <urg_> yeah an account system would be a MASSIVE step imo
12:02 < bridge> <urg_> gonna be sick to see whats gonna be made of it
12:28 < bridge> <teero777> xD
13:04 < bridge> <lukron55> when accounts come, what happens to records that are just attached to names?
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> This probably has been discussed many times already here:

15:01 < bridge> <devinci24> Hello guys,
15:01 < bridge> <devinci24> I've been trying to make a button via CMenu. But when I press it nothing happends.
15:01 < bridge> <devinci24> I've been testing a bit and think my button is not considered active.
15:01 < bridge> <devinci24> Does anyone have any idea, even is vague, if I need to do something specific for my button to be active?
15:08 < bridge> <robyt3> Can you show a snippet of your code?
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24> A snippet might not be enough.. but here you go:
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24> 
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24> ```
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24>     vec2 leaderboardSize = pRect->Size();
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24>     static CButtonContainer DemoButtons[AMOUNT_DISPLAYED];
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24>     static CButtonContainer GhostButtons[AMOUNT_DISPLAYED];
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24> 
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24>     for (int i = 0; i < AMOUNT_DISPLAYED; i++)
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24>     {
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24>         CUIRect Row, Demo, Ghost;
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24>         
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24>         pRect->HSplitTop(20.0f, &Row, pRect);
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24>         Row.VSplitRight(leaderboardSize.x / 8.0f, &Row, &Demo);
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24>         Row.VSplitRight(leaderboardSize.x / 8.0f, &Row, &Ghost);
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24>         Row.VSplitRight(leaderboardSize.x / 20.0f, &Row, nullptr);
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24>         Demo.Margin(1.0f, &Demo);
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24>         Ghost.Margin(1.0f, &Ghost);
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24> 
15:17 < bridge> <devinci24>         char aBuf[256];
15:18 < bridge> <devinci24>         str_format(aBuf, sizeof(aBuf), "%d. Player %d", i+1, i);
15:18 < bridge> <devinci24>         Ui()->DoLabel(&Row, aBuf, 10.0f, TEXTALIGN_ML);
15:18 < bridge> <devinci24> 
15:18 < bridge> <devinci24>         str_format(aBuf, sizeof(aBuf), "%d.76", i);
15:18 < bridge> <devinci24>         Ui()->DoLabel(&Row, aBuf, 10.0f, TEXTALIGN_MR);
15:18 < bridge> <devinci24> 
15:18 < bridge> <devinci24>         if(m_pClient->m_Menus.DoButton_Menu(&DemoButtons[i], Localize("D"), 0, &Demo))
15:18 < bridge> <devinci24>             printf("%s", "DEMO!");
15:18 < bridge> <devinci24>         if(m_pClient->m_Menus.DoButton_Menu(&GhostButtons[i], Localize("G"), 0, &Ghost))
15:18 < bridge> <devinci24>             printf("%s", "GHOST!");
15:18 < bridge> <devinci24>     }
15:18 < bridge> <devinci24> ```
15:19 < bridge> <pon04349> Give cool texture packs
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> default is a banger
15:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks i accepted the invite to ddnet-accounts
15:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice xd
15:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> it will be for the account server?
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
15:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> <a:nekospin:1039804721378111548>
15:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Use `dbg_msg` instead of `printf` if you want the messages to appear in the local console. Is this code in `CMenus`? If not the UI functions might not work correctly/fully
15:38 < bridge> <devinci24> Yeah I know about dbg, was just lazy when I wrote that and for now I like using my terminal ^^'. Thanks
15:38 < bridge> <devinci24> 
15:38 < bridge> <devinci24> But no it's not. That's why I use m_pClient and wondered if there was a way to set my buttons as active :/
15:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `dbg_msg` ends up in the terminal and in the local console
15:41 < bridge> <devinci24> Yy i know. This is code I will end up removing.
15:41 < bridge> <devinci24> But I'll try to use it more from now on
15:44 < bridge> <robyt3> I mean how did you confirm that the buttons are not getting activated? If you expect the output in the local console then not using `dbg_msg` is the issue
15:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Otherwise, if the button becomes the hot item it should also activate when you click it
15:45 < bridge> <robyt3> But is this code in `CMenus`? If so, you don't need `m_pClient->m_Menus`. If not, this will probably not work because the UI mouse is not being updated outside of the menus and editor
15:46 < bridge> <devinci24> No, I looked at my terminal output where my local server is running.
15:46 < bridge> <devinci24> I also just put a || true so my print could always get printed.
15:46 < bridge> <devinci24> And even pribted the value returned by buttonLogic or somethinf (it was 0).
15:47 < bridge> <devinci24> 
15:47 < bridge> <devinci24> And I used Ui()->Update()... wouldn't that work.. ^^'
15:47 < bridge> <devinci24> But you are right. Talking to you I've realised that maybe I should just put everything on CMenu, thanks
15:47 < bridge> <avolicious> I really like the HTML e-mail template. Are you going with alt plain-text as well?
15:48 < bridge> <devinci24> But you are right. Talking to you I've realised that maybe I should just put everything on CMenu (or somewhere with ui) thanks
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think robyte tested it with some terminal client and it worked _ok_ enough 😄
15:49 < bridge> <avolicious> Ah okay, because my Thunderbird doesnt use the html version
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rip
15:49 < bridge> <avolicious> I like my e-mails in text, like letters. If I want html I use browsers 😄
15:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Where can I sign up?
15:50 < bridge> <learath2> @devinci24 have you checked what the active item is?
15:50 < bridge> <robyt3> You need to delegate inputs to the UI with `OnInput` and `OnCursorMove` while the UI is activate in your component. The UI isn't designed to work outside of menus and editor, so I don't know if that's the only issue
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sign up for what?
15:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> dd-pg account
15:50 < bridge> <devinci24> ª, I have indeed not.
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u need the latest client and i need to start the acc server and whitelist you xd
15:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Will the account stay then?
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on my vps database?
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe
15:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also woah register in the client? Not web?
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
15:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> pog
15:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Go whitelist zillyhuhn.com I register with vpn tomorrow
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> currently the client only builds with steam support bcs i tested that yesterday, so i guess it's not chiller friendly rn
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe in a week
15:53 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, you are not in the menu component, you are probably failing the `Inside` check because `OnCursorMove` isn't routed there
15:53 < bridge> <devinci24> I am inside
15:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> .-.
15:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Spyware keks
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok ok
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i make steam as feature today
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i need to do it anyway
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can only whitelist ips, i assume u mean the ip that the domain relates to?
15:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
15:55 < bridge> <devinci24> But honestly, with only that snippet might be too hard to pin point the issue. I wil ltry to give more details after looking ibto it a bit more.
15:55 < bridge> <devinci24> Thx anyways
15:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I fakin lost my og ip so I don’t know my new one
15:55 < bridge> <devinci24> I wanted to get inspiration from emoticon. Which afaik is Ui outside of menus and editor
15:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you print anything in the server console? that sounds like a different program entirely
15:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I depend on dns now like a idiot
15:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> an* idiot
15:56 < bridge> <learath2> hm, but you did say colors change, on hover/click. So the Inside check isn't it
15:56 < bridge> <robyt3> Emoticon is not really using `CUi` for most things though
15:56 < bridge> <avolicious> But whats wrong with DNS?
15:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this sounds highly suspect
15:56 < bridge> <devinci24> I haven't checked but I'm fairly sure I can.
15:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I prefer ips
15:56 < bridge> <robyt3> Emoticon and spectator menus us different, simpler UI implementations
15:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Emoticon and spectator menus use different, simpler UI implementations
15:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> check your assumptions. something isn't working like you expect, to something you assume must be wrong
15:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Imagine having to say your domain because you can’t remember your ip. It’s pathetic.
15:57 < bridge> <avolicious> But you cant sign IPs, in DNS you can sign your DNS entries 😄
15:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also DNS breaks all the time.
15:57 < bridge> <learath2> find the new owner of your old domain, blackmail them
15:57 < bridge> <learath2> find the new owner of your old ip, blackmail them
15:57 < bridge> <avolicious> Huh? I never experience that
15:57 < bridge> <avolicious> Where did DNS break?
15:57 < bridge> <learath2> ditto, never seen dns randomly break
15:58 < bridge> <learath2> Probably one of the highest uptime things on planet earth
15:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2: my provider moved provider nothing I can do. It would cause lags to keep the old ip.
15:58 < bridge> <devinci24> Feels unrelated though... i just prefer looking at server output via terminal... but I will try whenever I get the chance to.
15:58 < bridge> <avolicious> IMHO DNS is pretty stable
15:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> In Indonesia on a daily basis. But in general once a month xd
15:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> wait, are you on linux or windows?
15:58 < bridge> <avolicious> But thats a provider issue then 😄
15:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @devinci24
15:58 < bridge> <devinci24> Linux
15:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, then I agree that the output should probably work to the terminal
15:58 < bridge> <avolicious> Use 1.1.1.1 or alt dns servers. But in general they dont break
15:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but if you only see the server output there, then it's suspect again
15:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The amount of times I had to use my hosts file or switch dns server is insane
15:59 < bridge> <learath2> Well it might not be one of your assumptions. This probably breaks on one of the assumptions the code he calls makes that is not explicit or obvious
15:59 < bridge> <learath2> By all means `DoButton_Menu` sounds like it should work in any render context 😄
16:00 < bridge> <avolicious> I mean, that sounds like an chiller arch linux problem. But if the finance sector is using DNS even internally, then I would assume that its safe to use 😄
16:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you want to do something, and do everything you think is needed and it doesn't work — then I guess your assumptions are wrong. e.g. some random function might be buggy where you assumed it'd work
16:00 < bridge> <learath2> Perhaps these things should be private/protected or perhaps `CUi` should have some statefullness to it to immediately assert out of this case
16:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No I mean sure dns is stable. And the average normie depends on it for all its internet usage. But I think you know exactly what I mean by dns can have issue s @avolicious you do devops stuff …
16:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Things break
16:01 < bridge> <learath2> I guess that's fair. You still made the assumption that the function would work in any context
16:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ip never broke on me
16:01 < bridge> <avolicious> I never managed to break my dns
16:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it sounds like you optimize for the wrong thing, chillerdragon
16:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don’t believe you
16:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> X broke once for me, get rid of X entirely
16:02 < bridge> <avolicious> I was the problem, not dns 😄
16:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes I was the problem too
16:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Mostly
16:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Drill
16:02 < bridge> <devinci24> Honestly I just asked hoping someone could have an idea.
16:02 < bridge> <devinci24> Maybe the error is unrelated and ends up being the dumbest thing ever. Thanks for everyone's input.
16:02 < bridge> <avolicious> But then dont blame dns, blame yourself
16:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Still
16:02 < bridge> <avolicious> dns did a good job, you failed 😄
16:02 < bridge> <learath2> idk what you are doing with your dns but I don't even remember where to set dns
16:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I never managed to break ip so I blame dns
16:03 < bridge> <learath2> I literally set it to 1.1.1.1 many months ago and never really had to touch it ever again
16:03 < bridge> <avolicious> Same here
16:03 < bridge> <avolicious> Sometimes I switch to 8.8.4.4
16:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 1.1 is also a DNS server :p
16:03 < bridge> <learath2> I also host my own nameservers, didn't manage to break those either in a loong looong time
16:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wtf
16:04 < bridge> <avolicious> 😮 is it the same as 1.1.1.1?
16:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That’s not even an ip
16:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
16:04 < bridge> <avolicious> depends on the netmask 😆
16:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 1.1 is a weird way to write 1.0.0.1 that most systems accept
16:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try `ping 1.1`
16:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What’s 2.2 then?
16:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 2.0.0.2
16:05 < bridge> <learath2> 2.0.0.2
16:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Neat
16:05 < bridge> <learath2> What's 1.1.1 then?
16:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 1.1.0.1
16:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Reminds me of ninjaturtle html
16:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just fill it up with zeros xd
16:06 < bridge> <avolicious> And if you use 1.1.1.1.1 then you're next gen 😏
16:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and 1.65793 is 1.1.1.1
16:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Now you are making stuff up
16:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (65793 = 256² + 256 + 1)
16:06 < bridge> <teero777> xD
16:07 < bridge> <learath2> 😄
16:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try `ping 16843009` 😉
16:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Phone
16:07 < bridge> <avolicious> No ICMP on phone? sadge
16:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok good night was fun trash talking with yall as always
16:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No I do nothing on my phone
16:08 < bridge> <teero777> What brand?
16:08 < bridge> <avolicious> fairphone I guess
16:08 < bridge> <avolicious> Something were you can install arch linux on
16:09 < bridge> <avolicious> In my head I cant think about chiller without thinking about arch linux... thats manifested
16:10 < bridge> <teero777> I can imagine chiller having the newest iPhone ngl.
16:10 < bridge> <avolicious> No, he is not even using discord
16:11 < bridge> <avolicious> He doesnt like vendor lock in, only teeworlds accounts
16:13 < bridge> <teero777> Sometimes people do contradicting things
16:13 < bridge> <avolicious> Not chiller, if the thing cant run arch, he doesnt want it
16:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I do own an iPhone. I dont like it. And I only use it for matrix. I don’t feel vendor locked in. But I could not switch to the pinephone because it felt so sluggish.
16:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok now I leave Fr xd
16:14 < bridge> <teero777> Is fairphone x86?
16:14 < bridge> <teero777> Arch doesn't run on arm
16:14 < bridge> <avolicious> Maybe he switched to NixOs
16:14 < bridge> <avolicious> Maybe he switched to NixOS
16:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's https://archlinuxarm.org/
16:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but I don't see an entry for the pinephone
16:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv8/allwinner/pine64
16:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Devices
16:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> seems like you want to use postmarketos on the pinephone
16:18 < bridge> <avolicious> PINE64 PinePhone     pine64-pinephone     aarch64     2020     Allwinner A64     4x 1152 MHz Cortex-A53     Mali-400 MP2     Y     P     Y     Y     Y     Y     Y     -
16:18 < bridge> <teero777> Hmm last time I checked Arch arm support was discontinued. weird
16:19 < bridge> <avolicious> I never heard about pinephone tho
16:19 < bridge> <avolicious> Is it something like fairphone?=
16:19 < bridge> <avolicious> Is it something like fairphone?
16:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's not an official arch linux project. but it also never was, I think
16:19 < bridge> <avolicious> I guess the main problem is that most Apps dont run on there
16:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> x86 (32 bit intel was discontinued)
16:21 < bridge> <avolicious> One problem I had with my OnePlus in the past was that I cant run https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/ueber-oesterreichgvat/faq/app_digitales_amt.html "Digitales Amt", which is the digital entrance to manage your official stuff besides of going to magistrate.
16:21 < bridge> <avolicious> 
16:21 < bridge> <avolicious> I asked why I cant run it & they said that they need devices that are signed by official vendors like Samsung or Apple 😄
16:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but why
16:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that sounds easily discriminatory
16:22 < bridge> <avolicious> They only support a few devices, where they can guarantee that your ID cant be tampered
16:22 < bridge> <avolicious> "Digitales Amt" and "eAusweise" can be used to sign digitally
16:22 < bridge> <teero777> Idk how you can ever guarantee that
16:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they can't
16:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they just want to tick some consultant's boxes
16:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's the AusweisApp in germany which can be used to sign in to services. it uses your ID card as a signer AFAIK
16:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no stupid exclusion of devices there
16:25 < bridge> <avolicious> Only sign in or can you sign official documents with it too?
16:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> well, I can hand in my tax declaration with it
16:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is that "signing of official documents"?
16:25 < bridge> <avolicious> I can sign my working contracts digitally
16:26 < bridge> <avolicious> I can literally sign anything with it
16:26 < bridge> <avolicious> and its legally correct
16:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> anything that supports it?
16:26 < bridge> <avolicious> No, I can sign a PDF and there is a visual on it to verify it
16:27 < bridge> <avolicious> You can scan in the signature & verify it 😄
16:27 < bridge> <avolicious> Its eIDAS compliant
16:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm interested in the technical workings of that
16:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what binds the signature to the document you signed?
16:28 < bridge> <avolicious> Elaborate "bind"
16:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what prevents me from screenshotting the signature, putting it on a different PDF where it still verifies
16:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what prevents me from screenshotting the signature, putting it on a different PDF where it still verifies?
16:30 < bridge> <avolicious> What prevents you to fake a handwritten signature?
16:30 < bridge> <learath2> Nothing but we expect a higher degree of confidence for digital signatures. I wouldn't really doubt a GPG signed document e.g.
16:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why do you do the dance of a non-rooted smartphone if I can break it with a screenshot?
16:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that would sound super silly
16:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so I guess it's more elaborate than that and that there is something that binds the signature to the document
16:31 < bridge> <01000111g> Literally this, handwritten signature literally is just a symbol. In Norway I signed my housing agreement just by clicking a tickbox, thats it
16:32 < bridge> <avolicious> Well, I would assume that the verification is done via hash or something, so you need to upload your PDF & then you can check if he signed your PDF
16:32 < bridge> <learath2> Did you know that legally any scribble YOU make is a valid signature for you. Doesn't have to match your old scribbles e.g.
16:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that sounds country-dependent
16:33 < bridge> <01000111g> nop
16:33 < bridge> <learath2> At the very least in Turkey as long as you can prove that I made the scribble, it's a legal signature
16:34 < bridge> <01000111g> In Norway everyone who is staying longer has to get a norwegian bank account/id, verified with ur passport and then gets an n pronciple a governmental provided e-mail box, everything else is then done digitally
16:34 < bridge> <learath2> Does it actually add a visual into the pdf when you sign it? Because that would change the pdf too, hm, quite an interesting issue, I wonder how they solved it
16:34 < bridge> <avolicious> Yes, it adds a visual to the PDF
16:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that sounds completely worthless ^^
16:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> without the PDF
16:35 < bridge> <learath2> Can you sign documents offline?
16:35 < bridge> <avolicious> Yes, I can sign them offline
16:35 < bridge> <avolicious> Well
16:35 < bridge> <avolicious> Its a bit complicated
16:35 < bridge> <avolicious> It doesnt work 100% offline
16:35 < bridge> <avolicious> You need atleast your phone to "allow" the signature
16:36 < bridge> <avolicious> But after I logged into my account with my phone, I can sign documents offline
16:36 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, then idk how one would actually verify it. If it was online it can be recovered. Upload the original pdf to a trusted "notary", they issue the visual to attach onto the pdf. Now you can scan the visual to check on the notaries site the original pdf and visually match it
16:37 < bridge> <learath2> Perhaps there is a way to strip the visual back out when recalculating the hash?
16:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's probably appended to the PDF in a reversible way or so
16:37 < bridge> <learath2> (idk the pdf format, so idk if that's possible)
16:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but without the original PDF, you can't verify that the signature has anything to do with the contents of the document
16:38 < bridge> <avolicious> https://unternehmensrecht.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/i_unternehmensrecht/Lehre/SS_2020/Kurse/Kustor/2020_Elektronische_Signatur_-_Wahlfachkorb_Computer_und_Recht.pdf
16:38 < bridge> <learath2> but you @heinrich5991 can't generate a signature for any pdf and make it appear to be signed by @avolicious
16:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can take one signature of @avolicious and put it into my PDF
16:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can take one actual signature of @avolicious and put it into my PDF
16:39 < bridge> <learath2> but that signature won't validate, because it's a different PDF
16:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then print it and anyone can verify that @avolicious signed my contract
16:39 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, but if you print it that information is lost
16:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
16:39 < bridge> <avolicious> But thats illegal 😄
16:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why would you do a visual otherwise?
16:39 < bridge> <avolicious> You can also get my handsignature
16:39 < bridge> <avolicious> and do the same
16:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
16:39 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder if a printed e-signature is even legal
16:40 < bridge> <avolicious> But its still illegal
16:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but what does your process add?
16:40 < bridge> <avolicious> In austria it is
16:40 < bridge> <avolicious> Its mostly used for digital signings
16:40 < bridge> <learath2> Ease of use for underpaid overworked government employees?
16:40 < bridge> <avolicious> but its also accepted if you print it
16:40 < bridge> <avolicious> Underpaid?????
16:40 < bridge> <avolicious> Nonono
16:40 < bridge> <avolicious> This is not how the government works
16:40 < bridge> <avolicious> They are overpaid for their work
16:41 < bridge> <learath2> s\/underpaid/underqualified/ there you go
16:41 < bridge> <avolicious> You dont need any qualification for this type of job 😄
16:42 < bridge> <avolicious> The only one you need is to be as slow as possible
16:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ease of use for… verifying signatures in a flawed way?
16:42 < bridge> <avolicious> I guess the original pdf hash is in the signature
16:42 < bridge> <avolicious> So they can proof it
16:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> only if they have the original PDF
16:43 < bridge> <learath2> I'm like 70% sure it's us that is missing something and not the people that were probably paid millions to figure it out and more millions to audit it 😛
16:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
16:43 < bridge> <avolicious> I dont know in detail how it works
16:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but then again, these people also try to exclude people from running signatures on devices they control
16:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sooo. maybe there's also stupidity
16:44 < bridge> <learath2> `urn:pdfsigfilter:bka.gv.at:binaer` this looked interesting to me, so maybe there is some filter applied before the hash, which means maybe there is a way to calculate it by hand arduously?
16:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (ausweisapp in germany is open-source btw: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.governikus.ausweisapp2/)
16:45 < bridge> <learath2> https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2012-05/PDF-AS-Spezifikation-2.2.pdf this looks promising but idk german/austrian idk which one this is even
16:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the official language in austria is german
16:46 < bridge> <avolicious> Oh, nice
16:47 < bridge> <avolicious> I really enjoy if things like public/official stuff is open source
16:47 < bridge> <avolicious> Our swiss friends are also going for open source now
16:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i enjoy if all is open free software
16:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, looks like the signature is appended to the PDF in a reversible way
16:47 < bridge> <avolicious> https://www.zdnet.com/article/switzerland-now-requires-all-government-software-to-be-open-source/
16:47 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah it does strip out a lot it seems, which seems concerning, you can probably create pdfs with advanced features that have invisible text
16:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> public schools should use linux
16:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> and non propietary software
16:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ouch
16:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they use sha1
16:48 < bridge> <avolicious> AFAIK its SHA256
16:48 < bridge> <avolicious> This document is nearly a decade old
16:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
16:48 < bridge> <learath2> But I guess it's safe. A clerk can top left to bottom right write down all the text into a prompt and generate the hash
16:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i remember dealing with the pdf format
16:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> and signatures
16:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> the bytes used in the signature are like all but the signature itself or smth
16:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot and dont want to return there
16:49 < bridge> <learath2> If it doesn't match because weird pdf stuff it fails safely
16:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> where did you see that it gets all the text?
16:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/nompdf
16:50 < bridge> <learath2> 4.2.2 seems to describe it
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> are pdfs still a thing
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sry i live under a stone
16:51 < bridge> <learath2> Since you do know german maybe you can also take a look into the document and see if they have advice about verifying these when printed
16:51 < bridge> <learath2> Well yes, do you not do anything official? 😄
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> thanks to adobe lobby probs
16:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> interesting. without looking at it a lot, it's probably vulnerable to confusing PDF readers about text direction or including images instead of texts
16:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> pdf/a is theoretically a standard IIRC
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno most things i use have their own fancy android app nowadays
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that doesnt allow rooted phones
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and so i fallback to sending per post
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
16:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> actually — you can probably simply send a PDF which says something but signs something different
16:52 < bridge> <learath2> It's definitely a huge hassle and vulnerable, but it seems to fail in a safe manner. As in if there is weird hidden stuff in the pdf it won't verify
16:53 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah probably, pdf has lots of very advanced features
16:53 < bridge> <learath2> I'm sure there are readers out there that mis-render some of them
16:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is the text extraction done using OCR or using the text embedded into the PDF. lemme check
16:54 < bridge> <learath2> Looks kinda like text embedded into the PDF
16:54 < bridge> <learath2> I guess the verification could be done using OCR though, much cheaper than clerks
16:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then you can have a pdf which looks like one contract, but the embedded text says something different
16:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is the signed text shown to the signer?
16:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then you have a signature that verifies on a document that the signer didn't see
16:55 < bridge> <learath2> Ah there is a verification process suggested in the document here btw, 4.2.5
16:56 < bridge> <learath2> Probably a question for @avolicious, idk
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> but for a legal matter, if a judge sees the paper, he will see the visible text signed and not the invisible? is it binding or smth?
16:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I send you a document which you sign. you sign something invisible. I make the invisible text visible and print it, the judge can verify that you signed my contract
16:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i.e, if it decieves humans, and a human reviews it, does it matter?
16:57 < bridge> <learath2> Seems this one is for digitally verifying it. Idk weird that these digital signatures are even legal when printed out
16:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can make the invisible text visible and the sign doesnt break?
16:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc u should verify documents digitally signed, in a digital manner
16:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> not by view
16:58 < bridge> <learath2> In Italy we do have digital signing available but you have to send it digitally always, and usually the mail has to be signed too
16:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it was said above that the signature is also valid when printed
16:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and the signed thing is the embedded text in the PDF
16:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so I can make you sign stuff you can't see
16:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and then have a valid signature for stuff you didn't see
16:59 < bridge> <learath2> Actually, you can only make me sign both the stuff I see and I don't see. It might appear as if I signed either by using different renderers, but neither will verify if you type in just one of the texts
17:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why not? if the text you see isn't embedded in the PDF
17:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why not? if the text you see isn't embedded into the PDF
17:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but just as an image or so
17:00 < bridge> <learath2> Like an image?
17:01 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, yeah that does sound unsalvageable unless there is an OCR procedure in place when verifying
17:02 < bridge> <learath2> If I were the one implementing this I definitely would have used a digital notary structure, just upload your document and get your signature qr code
17:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> imho the problem comes from embeddimg the sig with the pdf
17:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> signature should be external
17:11 < bridge> <learath2> It's no issue but it's also no use. An e-signature can only reliably be verified by a computer, with access to the original document
17:11 < bridge> <learath2> So I'm guessing the printed acceptance of these in Austria, really does rely on the fact that it's just illegal to forge one like a handwritten signature
18:05 < bridge> <kebscs> why did build action fail? ```/home/runner/work/ddnet/ddnet/src/engine/external/glew/GL/glew.h:1205:14: fatal error: GL/glu.h: No such file or directory
18:05 < bridge> <kebscs>  1205 | #    include <GL/glu.h>```
18:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Try retrying the CI runs, this looks unrelated to your change
18:06 < bridge> <kebscs> how do i retry it when its not my repo
18:07 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe you have to wait until all runs have finished
18:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that doesn't look like an intermittent failure though
18:08 < bridge> <robyt3> Is it everything that builds on ubuntu-latest?
18:09 < bridge> <kebscs> ill just update the commit
18:14 < bridge> <kebscs> yours failed too
18:14 < bridge> <kebscs> some repo problem, works fine on my fork
18:14 < bridge> <kebscs> at least it did 5min ago it failed on work aswell now
18:14 < bridge> <robyt3> GitHub changes the runners to newer versions over slowly, so not all repos are affected at once
18:14 < bridge> <kebscs> at least it did 5min ago it failed on fork aswell now
18:15 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems like something changed and glew is not installed by default anymore
18:16 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't see us installing glew explicity in `build.yml` so I guess we only got it implicitly from another dependency
21:38 < bridge> <matodor> omg chiller why i can't use 06 skins on 07 server?
21:39 < bridge> <matodor> :troll:
22:11 < bridge> <learath2> Chiller please force 0.7 to support the skins from the major fork of this wonderful game

22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as his boss
22:42 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, that is allowed
22:45 < bridge> <kebscs> @furo how to see diff ddnet bombtag to ddnet repo
22:45 < bridge> <kebscs> or commits since forked
22:45 < bridge> <Ewan> so true
22:46 < bridge> <Ewan> having something to do will be monumental tho
22:46 < bridge> <Ewan> ewan winning arc
22:48 < bridge> <furo> You can add a git upstream to the official DDNet repo and then do `git diff upstream/master`
22:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> congrats @mpft
22:48 < bridge> <Ewan> ty
22:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> cant wait to see u complain about coworkers code in 3 months
22:48 < bridge> <Ewan> now be my rust tutor :justatest:
22:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> or smth like that
22:48 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
22:48 < bridge> <Ewan> XD
22:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> :brownbear:
22:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> is it rust related?

22:48 < bridge> <Ewan> junior rust dev
22:49 < bridge> <Ewan> im in a little over my head
22:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can teach u, it will be 30€/hour
22:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> kekw
22:49 < bridge> <Ewan> but i learn fast
22:49 < bridge> <Ewan> XD
22:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i think under contract i can't contribute to OSS tho
22:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol sucks
22:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> just use diferent name

22:52 < bridge> <k1berkap1bara> hi guys, I have a problem, when I used to play I had 1000 fps and now 100-150 fps, what should I do please tell me
22:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Firstly, we will take a look at the Non-Compete Agreement during employment in Spain, which is used to protect business activity when there is a possibility of an employee engaging in unfair competition during the term of the employment. It is not heavily regulated and must be set by mutual agreement between the parties in accordance with the minimum criteria provided for in article 21.3 of the Workers’ Statute.
22:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
22:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> > This type of agreement is incorporated into the employment contract and in exchange, the employee must receive appropriate financial compensation for such commitment. This compensation must be clearly established and remunerated. If there is no compensation for the non-compete agreement, relevant case law has established that the agreement will be deemed null and void.
22:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
22:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> > The employee may terminate the agreement whenever he or she wishes, on condition that written notice is provided to the company at least 30 days in advance. Upon termination of the agreement, the employee ceases to receive financial compensation and forfeits the rights associated with absolute commitment.
