01:57 < Farfalla> behehe so many ppl here?
02:17 < eeeee> deen: is that about leaving/joining repeatedly? weren't you working on hacking the bans to fix this?
05:43 < eeeee> heinrich5991: just seen 0.6.4 announcement, you know what's that about?
05:47 <@deen> eeeee: interesting
05:48 <@deen> eeeee: yes, i think that's the leaving/joining repeatedly thing. and i was working on it, but didn't really end up with a good solution
05:52 < eeeee> i was gonna finish the patch against server filling, but now i'm kinda curious about 0.6.4
05:52 <@deen> nice
05:52 <@deen> yeah, me too
05:52 < eeeee> for whatever reason they didnt mention exactly
05:52 < eeeee> would suck hugely if it's the same thing
05:53 <@deen> oh, that's possible. i think someone came into #teeworlds talking about this problem
05:53 <@deen> and the disconnecting-people one, which is related
07:20 < eeeee> speaking of things that suck
07:20 < eeeee> i've just realized we're kind of not supposed to run DM or CTF with websockets
07:21 < eeeee> i wonder can i get some standard gametypes in js client :/
07:22 < eeeee>         ^how
07:24 < eeeee> maybe i should pm kottizen asking how unethical are websockets on a scale from 1 to 10
10:03 < fstd> gonna-have-to-tell-matricks-about-it/10
10:26 <@deen> hm
10:33 < Spyker> hi all, deen you online?
10:35 <@deen> hi
12:18 < Spyker> deen, you there?
12:19 < Spyker> all rank on my map cheated, because no lock in team, and ppl go in 4
12:19 < Spyker> map wasnt the right map
12:19 < Spyker> so, easy cheat all parts
12:19 < Spyker> you should wait the last version before upload xD
12:19 < Spyker> now the version is correct i think, just lock max player for team 3
12:19 < Spyker> and delete cheated ranks, like all
12:20 <@deen> Spyker: sure there was a lock for 3 players
12:20 < Spyker> deen: but they cheated, impossible 36 min on this map, they finished in 4!
12:20 <@deen> did you see them cheat?
12:20 <@deen> or should i just delete the rank becuase you think 36 min is too good?
12:21 < Spyker> no man, its just impossible this time for the map
12:21 <@deen> then they found another cheat
12:21 <@deen> no one played with 4 player team
12:21 < Spyker> yes there were a lot of cheats
12:21 < Spyker> in the old version
12:21 < Spyker> easy kimpara fly cheat
12:21 <@deen> so, have to delete all ranks?
12:21 < Spyker> and a lot of bugs
12:22 <@deen> ranks deleted
12:22 < Spyker> now i think no bugs
12:22 < Spyker> because switcher at end make possible finish dummy too
12:23 < Spyker> and bug n2
12:23 < Spyker> of they finished without bot or cheat, they ll do another rank
12:23 < Spyker> if
12:25 < Spyker> see ya deen, thanks :D i go eat
12:26 <@deen> bye

14:48 < o_be_one> hellow :)
15:42 < Spyker> deen, i dont want to be boring, but all people know paineless use bots
15:42 < Spyker> and if they didnt use bugs why they finished in 3?
15:42 < Spyker> and noved finish alone, without team, if team is forced??
15:43 <@deen> Spyker: ...
15:43 <@deen> Spyker: just watch the demos
15:43 <@deen> both teams have demos
15:43 < Spyker> and in new version there is an harder part than in older! i dont know why you listen nealson, who didnt let me play now spamming noob
15:43 <@deen> and you're not "boring" but you made me hours of work with this shit
15:44 <@deen> Spyker: you absolutely can't make a map harder after release
15:44 <@deen> only easier
15:44 < Spyker> deen, rly you dont know paineless use bot?
15:44 <@deen> if you did so, then revert the change
15:44 < Spyker> and deen in new version the map have an harder part!
15:44 <@deen> can you read?
15:45 < Spyker> deen, you relased old ddnet version
15:45 < Spyker> if you watch my trailer you can see some parts changed
15:45 < Spyker> only 1
15:45 <@deen> i released the version that was on test server at the planned time of release
15:45 < Spyker> and they skipped the part ofc...
15:46 < Spyker> the version you relased this morning was the final version
15:46 <@deen> too late
15:46 < Spyker> the version we used 1 week ago for trailer
15:46 < Spyker> thats why testers was crying and didnt test the map
15:46 < Spyker> it was full of bugs...
15:46 <@deen> I'll remove the map
15:47 <@deen> really not interested in talking about this every day
15:47 <@deen> i have 200 min of demos to watch because of this map
15:47 < Spyker> now tell me how the fuck is possible only noved finished?
15:47 < Spyker> and rico dont
15:47 <@deen> Spyker: i told you not to talk to me
15:48 < Spyker> ok, if you want to delete is ok... no problem, just not my fail or your fail, its testers fail, because they didnt test the map
15:49 < Spyker> im sry for all the problems, if you want you can delete the map, and i ll make another one like this, mb better
15:49 <@deen> Spyker: i told you i won't release your maps anymore
15:49 <@deen> the shit you pulled is incredible
15:49 < Spyker> no man
15:49 < Spyker> i just uploaded new original map
15:50 < Spyker> and tester cry for this
15:50 < Spyker> thats it!
15:50 < Spyker> if they test map, say but and when map ready, relase... it will be a new map without bugs and bugged ranks
15:50 <@deen> YOU CAN NOT CHANGE THE MAP AFTER IT IS RELEASED
15:50 < Spyker> yes but i just fixed bugs man!
15:51 < Spyker> ofc need to change entities if map have bugs!
15:51 < Spyker> and people can let finish dummy too
15:52 < Spyker> or just go in 2
15:53 < Spyker> i have to go now, i must study, we can talk this evening if there are others problems, but for make all simple, just delete map, so bots cant cry and cheaters too

22:04 <@deen> since middle ~20. february
22:05 < Micro> And why you thought that?
22:05 <@deen> I've never seen it and I can't judge that. I'm just trusting the judgement of the people who tell me
22:07 < Micro> YOU TRUST NEALSON?
22:07 <@deen> and aaa, Rico, Sui and some others I forgot again
22:07 < Micro> Anyway that shit next to my name is shitti

22:58 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/puMj
22:58 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 05970cc def: Add BONUS tile, opposite of PENALTY (for Saavik's new map)
22:58 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 91756cc def: Merge branch 'DDRace64' of github.com:def-/ddnet into DDRace64
23:01 <@heinrich5991> deen: BONUS?
23:01 < eeeee> y u no negative penalty
23:02 <@deen> because no negative numbers
23:02 <@deen> and penalty already used both available numbers
23:03 <@deen> it's just a hack for a new novelty map :P
23:03 <@deen> but I'm not allowed to talk about it
23:03 <@deen> sort of like the Flappy Bird one, but more complicated
23:03 <@heinrich5991> can you tell me what the bonus tile does?
23:03 <@heinrich5991> it removes time?
23:03 <@deen> yes
23:03 <@heinrich5991> (imagine my face right now)
23:03 <@deen> why?
23:03 <@heinrich5991> :D
23:04 <@deen> i promise they have a good reason for needing it :P
23:04 <@heinrich5991> I was totally opposed to adding the penalty tile, but yea.. I hope you'll continue to mostly-refuse maps using that feature
23:04 <@deen> we haven't added a single one using that feature
23:04 <@heinrich5991> I don't like playing with the only reliable thing you have in ddrace, time :)
23:04 <@deen> and no one is using it
23:04 <@heinrich5991> that's great to hear
23:04 <@deen> those are not really ddrace maps anyway
23:04 <@deen> they are just fun maps built on top of ddrace
23:05 <@deen> and I'm annoyed too that I have to exclude these maps from my time statistics :P
