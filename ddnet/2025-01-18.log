09:53 < bridge> <_qey> @0xdeen what would constitute a master-server ban?
11:00 < bridge> <learath2> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=rules/server_rules anything here
11:00 < bridge> <learath2> + Faking another server
11:00 < bridge> <learath2> + Hosting illegal content
11:00 < bridge> <learath2> + Advertising bots
11:00 < bridge> <learath2> + Our discretion (e.g. just because I forgot to list something here doesn't mean you can't be ever banned for it, new rules are applied to all servers immediately)
11:01 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly, if you even have to think about the rules for the master server, you probably are doing something wrong
11:04 < bridge> <_qey> I’m not thinking about it because I break rules, there’s a guy stealing my maps and claiming he made them without proper credit, so I’m investigating what I can do about it.
11:04 < bridge> <_qey> I’m thinking he’s doing it to everyone in order to replicate the success.
11:05 < bridge> <_qey> He does indeed break a single rule outlined in the Wiki. He hosts a large amount of servers, many of which has little to no players.
11:06 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, we don't really get involved in copyright disputes, especially since a lot of maps are very very derivative
11:07 < bridge> <_qey> I get that, but that’s not the concern I’m addressing, I’m looking at the network from rule-breaking standpoint. Two birds with one stone, you know.
11:08 < bridge> <_qey> I myself modify the existing maps, but I do not claim I made them.
11:09 < bridge> <learath2> Well you can create an admin mail ticket if you think they are breaking a rule and we can take a look
11:10 < bridge> <_qey> Yeah, thanks. I will create a formal complaint in case I fail to establish a direct communication line with the network owner.
11:22 < bridge> <_qey> I myself modify the existing maps, but I do not claim I made them. (Unless heavily modified)
16:00 < ChillerDragon> the new assets menu is only for ddrace?
16:01 < ChillerDragon> or can users pick custom fng assets?
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wat? xd
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> new?
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u mean the assets tab and specifically mean entities that we have since like 6 years, then yes it can include fng entities too
16:05 < ChillerDragon> to me it feels new
16:05 < ChillerDragon> but ye its been there for a while
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyway, create a dir, instead of a png with your asset name, inside the dir, put ddnet.png fng.png etc.
16:07 < ChillerDragon> ah i see
16:07 < ChillerDragon> nice
16:09 < ChillerDragon> thanks 
16:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> we are so back
16:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1330201932102500395/image.png?ex=678d1e96&is=678bcd16&hm=4b22c044c856d6376a489fd43f3e88a84ced8ec8c1795c8f7973ab7db82ae3f7&
16:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> my very own snapshot code is working
16:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> hell yeah
17:29 < ChillerDragon> snapchat developer
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> hello darkness my old friend
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> depression kick
18:31 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i'm thinking of just nuking the auto spec cam and just render the cursor screenspace with spectating dyncam but no zoom.
18:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> that would probably annoy less people. i made auto spec cam specifically to make cursor visible on screen by default. since that doesn't work, maybe changing the spec cursor itself to be more visible is better.
18:36 < bridge> <zhn> nonono pls
18:37 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:
18:37 < bridge> <zhn> finally i can see how ppl play without any external tools i.e stream service
18:38 < bridge> <TsPiggy> how about i don't nuke auto spec cam but make spec cursor behave differently with auto spec cam on or off. since it seems like people want it off by default
18:39 < bridge> <TsPiggy> screenspace without auto. worldspace with auto.
18:40 < bridge> <TsPiggy> probably not fully screenspace too. just when your zoom is closer than the player you are spectating.
18:40 < bridge> <TsPiggy> so cursor can be visible by default even without auto
18:41 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i really want the spec cursor experience to be as obvious as possible so as soon as you see it, you can decide whether to turn it off. instead of be annoyed when it show up for a player but not (it's just offscreen) for another.
18:42 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> it's stupid to be annoyed at something that you can disable in 1 click and everyone else enjoys
18:43 < bridge> <TsPiggy> should we poll for whether people are enjoying auto spec cam too
18:43 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :kek:
18:43 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> i think that poll was for both?
18:45 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it should be but murpi made is seem like it was for spec cursor only, to me at least. the disscussions are leaning towards spec cursor on, auto off. which is just defeat the original purpose of auto existing at all.
18:46 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it should be but murpi made is seem like it was for spec cursor only, to me at least. the disscussions are leaning towards spec cursor on, auto off. which defeat the original purpose of auto spec cam. so i'm thinking alternative ways to keep auto off but still make spec cursor do what i originally intended to do.
18:47 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i do think if auto is so easy to turn off it shouldn't really be a problem to leave it as default but i don't think juppey would let that pass
18:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> master server working fine? i only get 440 servers
18:49 < bridge> <avolicious> No, they seem broken
18:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i see
18:51 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> you probably could just leave that already made setting to off by default, i think that's fair
18:51 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> it looks pretty decent off as is right now
18:52 < bridge> <TsPiggy> <a:catJAM:1292008215172747345> maybe
18:52 < bridge> <zhn> it's not :<
18:52 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> why
18:52 < bridge> <cinavarkeles> +++
18:52 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> you still can see where cursor is directed
18:52 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i mean it would look ok if most people uses zoom 10 or 9
18:53 < bridge> <zhn> i want to see how player plays :P
18:53 < bridge> <TsPiggy> the clamp to screen edge thing is not really that obvious with further zoom
18:53 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> you will be able to click this setting back on
18:53 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> in 1 click
18:53 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> leave off by defalut to those who complain
18:53 < bridge> <zhn> it's off by default anyway, isn't it
18:53 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ye it is currently
18:53 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> leave off by default to those who complain
18:54 < bridge> <TsPiggy> which is actually unintended lol
18:54 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i PRed it wrong
18:54 < bridge> <TsPiggy> either way there should be other solutions to pull cursor back so your screen without auto. i think would be worth it to explore
18:54 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> idk dudes going to complain at anything now, even really neat features
18:55 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> who didn't dream to see cursors of other players
18:55 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> like fr
18:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ~~or i could also just pr auto to default on and just quit so i don't hear the complains~~
18:56 < bridge> <cinavarkeles> It's not a good thing to have a single in-game list, it's better to have alternative lists.
18:56 < bridge> <zhn> we have 4 masters, wdym
18:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i think they mean there should be a way for client to modify what master to check. like a third party one.
18:57 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> add read-a-mind feature so that game reads mind of players and sets setting as they want
18:57 < bridge> <cinavarkeles> not that shape I'm talking about things like gametracker
18:57 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> cuz it seems to hard
18:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ok im lost too
18:58 < bridge> <zhn> what
18:58 < bridge> <zhn> i don't get it
18:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i don't think people get what auto is actually for. it wasn't really just to let you see cameras for fun. it really was just to make cursor more visible when i made it.
18:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> 
18:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> but i do think that feature is way pass my intention tho, people use it for different reasons and people hate it for different reasons too.
19:00 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i just would prefer to achieve my goal without auto if auto is off by default.
19:01 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i just would prefer to achieve my goal of making spec cursor more visible without auto if auto is off by default.
19:03 < bridge> <zhn> @heinrich5991 do you know what happened to masters? they handle only 439 servers for whatever reason
19:03 < bridge> <swarfey> i get the following error:
19:03 < bridge> <swarfey> ```
19:03 < bridge> <swarfey> 2025-01-18 19:02:58 I register/6/ipv4: registering...

19:03 < bridge> <swarfey> sounds to me like the server that validates a server is getting attacked or is down
19:03 < bridge> <zhn> 440*, 439 is id of last one xd
19:04 < bridge> <zhn> masters should ACK themselves afair
19:04 < bridge> <swarfey> iirc there was another server that would ping it itself to make sure it exists
19:04 < bridge> <swarfey> well maybe that changed since http masterservers
19:04 < bridge> <swarfey> but it would explain why only ddnet servers are being shown
19:04 < bridge> <swarfey> but it would explain why only ddnet & kog servers are being shown
19:05 < bridge> <swarfey> since they are probably whitelisted already id assume. maybe im wrong
19:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> seems like it
19:05 < bridge> <swarfey> * to make sure a port is actually forwarded
19:05 < bridge> <swarfey> *to make sure a port is actually forwarded
19:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> http master still ping it iirc.
19:06 < bridge> <zhn> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/mastersrv/src/main.rs#L744-L768 this probably
19:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> that challenge also doesn't work in china a lot of the time i think. the old master worked fine before
19:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> a lot of chn servers need to ask to be whitelisted
19:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i wish im not in bed so i can witness this master issue unfold
19:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :deen_star:
19:09 < bridge> <zhn> seems only ddnet and china can register xd
19:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> seems really interesting that it just died
19:10 < bridge> <zhn> it didn't, just last update broke it
19:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> oh
19:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i should've checked i guess
19:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ~~meanwhile i'm here thinking: it's not even 2038 yet~~
19:17 < bridge> <learath2> I leave the house. It breaks...

20:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> xd
20:16 < bridge> <zhn> masters fixed, thanks to whoever who did this :*
20:27 < bridge> <jxsl13> it's getting better, dunno if fully fixed
20:27 < bridge> <jxsl13> do you roughly get 1k+ servers?
20:27 < bridge> <avolicious> 1.7k
20:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> hm, some Simply servers are not visible online
20:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> even restarting di dnot help
20:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> even restarting did not help
20:39 < bridge> <jxsl13> weirdly w servers are visible, a third that is base don the sam emod i snot visible and three 0.7 servers are also not visible.
20:39 < bridge> <jxsl13> weirdly 2 servers are visible, a third that is base don the sam emod i snot visible and three 0.7 servers are also not visible.
20:39 < bridge> <jxsl13> weirdly 2 servers are visible, a third that is based on the same mod is not visible and three 0.7 servers are also not visible.
20:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> Only 0.7 servers are not visible
21:18 < bridge> <learath2> I restarted the masters a couple times, while messing around with it, is it still not working for 0.7 servers?
21:20 < bridge> <robyt3> I only see few 0.7 servers when filtering for address `tw`, somehow some DDNet servers have 0.7 addresses now?
21:21 < bridge> <robyt3> Weird, the latter issue is gone. I only see 4 0.7 servers now
21:27 < bridge> <learath2> I re-enabled the port forwarding ping
21:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> can't see them, yet:

21:30 < bridge> <DDNet> 185.254.97.173:8303 is not a DDraceNetwork or Community server.
21:30 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder if the legacy collector broke too
21:30 < bridge> <learath2> These probably register with the old master
21:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> hm, might be the case

21:52 < bridge> <fokkonaut> any ideas how to fix this pipeline?
21:54 < bridge> <robyt3> Adjust googletest downloading like on DDNet and thereby update to more recent version of googletest, search for lines `if(NOT(GTEST_FOUND) AND DOWNLOAD_GTEST)` in both `CMakeLists.txt` files
21:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thank you
21:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it worked
21:58 < bridge> <alw5> where is the screenshot directory stored in the code
21:59 < bridge> <robyt3> You can search the code using a regex like `".*?screenshots.*?"` to find strings containing the name
22:00 < bridge> <alw5> using what
22:01 < bridge> <robyt3> For example `grep` or Sublime Text
22:01 < bridge> <robyt3> Notepad++ can also do it
22:01 < bridge> <alw5> on visual studio?
22:02 < bridge> <alw5> think thats correct
22:02 < bridge> <alw5> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1330281129374126100/devenv_9Egmm9bl5x.png?ex=678d6858&is=678c16d8&hm=d082051ae17ef743a7335c9746000e047b1055a27d4b208695d40dee6a3ae3d6&
22:02 < bridge> <robyt3> There's probably a way, yeah
22:02 < bridge> <alw5> it is so slow
22:02 < bridge> <alw5> and there is no wway to exclude
22:03 < bridge> <alw5> and its just going through translations
22:03 < bridge> <alw5> :nouis:
22:03 < bridge> <alw5> hate this
22:03 < bridge> <zhn> you can exclude directories also afair
22:03 < bridge> <zhn> don't know how it's done in visual studio tho
22:04 < bridge> <alw5> the only options
22:04 < bridge> <alw5> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1330281661241364500/devenv_H7o2ujLnqj.png?ex=678d68d7&is=678c1757&hm=4e8b037334f6f59b7a28f7984dc913591627c0f3fae64b5a53d65e1d761c7d9c&
22:04 < bridge> <alw5> where are all the console commands located
22:04 < bridge> <alw5> or wwell the code that handles them
22:05 < bridge> <robyt3> Only search the `src` folder ideally
22:05 < bridge> <robyt3> Also, the `""` are part of the regex
22:05 < bridge> <robyt3> It should only match the text inside quotes
22:07 < bridge> <robyt3> Console commands are registered in a lot of files, usually where the command behavior is implemented
22:08 < bridge> <alw5> i found auto screenshot
22:08 < bridge> <alw5> its in `client.cpp` if anyone needs in the future
22:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @robyt3 is this valid to suppress a warning about pointer addition comparison to null?
22:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1330283975289077850/image.png?ex=678d6aff&is=678c197f&hm=f82b447c563b6d51523c38eaef6309cdcd89c119fbeaded3ffc4b5198dac902e&
22:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> following this approach: https://github.com/photoneo/opencv/commit/7ade0c7eb1778885343b594b4fd6f05e5d37ec7b
22:15 < bridge> <robyt3> This doesn't make sense to me
22:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> the warning disappeared, i am just afraid i broke somthing because i have no idea what im doing xD
22:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> pPort is a const char*
22:15 < bridge> <robyt3> This check is always true if you cast the pointer to an integer zero and add 2
22:16 < bridge> <robyt3> Also makes no sense to me, should just check `off == 0` instead of `src + off == 0`
22:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yea true
22:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> anyways, how do i make sense of this
22:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> just remove the pport + 2 check? idk.
22:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i felt it was useful back then
22:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/commit/3c3c349cc55dfcff8b22e1c0f585aedff9246738
22:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it's basically parsing the config variable for a specific number in this format: `1:8303,2:8304,3....`
22:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> pls dont hate me for the way i made that thing
22:20 < bridge> <robyt3> The condition should always evaluate to true, so you can remove the other branch
22:21 < bridge> <robyt3> Also, this `+ 2` probably breaks if the switch number is greater than 9
22:21 < bridge> <robyt3> You should use `str_length(aBuf)` instead
22:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I think it was a check for when someone types 1:8303,2:3:8304
22:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yeah thought so
22:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> no wait, for when it ends with 2:_
22:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> no wait, for when it ends with 2:
22:22 < bridge> <robyt3> Ah, I see, yeah, the `str_find` already returns a pointer to the match position anyway
22:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hmm
22:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> what would you suggest
22:25 < bridge> <robyt3> `int Port = pPort ? atoi(pPort + 2) : 0;`
22:25 < bridge> <robyt3> I'd keep the existing `+ 2` since I don't know how it works and remove the unreachable branch
22:25 < bridge> <robyt3> `int Port = pPort ? atoi(pPort + 2) : 0;`
22:25 < bridge> <robyt3> I'd keep the existing `+ 2` since I don't know how it works and remove the redundant condition
22:26 < bridge> <robyt3> `pPort` can still be `nullptr` if the string doesn't begin with the prefix
22:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> oke ty
22:35 < bridge> <learath2> I think the intention was `int Port = pPort && *(pPort + 2) != '\0' ? atoi(pPort + 2) : 0;`
22:36 < bridge> <learath2> I don't quite remember if it is UB, but I guess whoever wrote it was concerned whether `atoi("")` is UB or not
22:38 < bridge> <learath2> (I don't think it is UB from what I remember, though cba to look at the standard rn)
22:40 < bridge> <learath2> I couldn't resist checking, it's not UB. 0 is guaranteed to be returned
22:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i see xd yeah i must have had some issue with atoi or smth
22:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yep
22:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i think something had crashed
22:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> back then
22:48 < bridge> <learath2> This kinda breaks with double digits as Robyt suggested. I would probably use `str_token_get` for this
22:48 < bridge> <learath2> 
22:48 < bridge> <learath2> ```c
22:48 < bridge> <learath2> const char *tok;
22:48 < bridge> <learath2> int port = 0, len = 0;
22:48 < bridge> <learath2> while((tok = str_token_get(tok, ",", &len)))
22:48 < bridge> <learath2> {
22:48 < bridge> <learath2>   if(str_startswith(tok, aBuf)) {
22:48 < bridge> <learath2>     port = atoi(tok + str_length(aBuf));
22:48 < bridge> <learath2>     break;
22:48 < bridge> <learath2>   }
22:48 < bridge> <learath2> }
22:48 < bridge> <learath2> ```
22:49 < bridge> <learath2> I just typed it out in discord, might not be correct, but you get the gist of it
22:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> lul, i just gave a shit about dd
22:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thank you
22:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thats looking good xd
22:51 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder what sort of crack I was smoking while I made `str_token_get` what a nasty way of tokenizing a string
22:52 < bridge> <learath2> Who let me commit this? 😄
22:54 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, str_token_get is the internal interface
22:54 < bridge> <learath2> You want `str_next_token` which copies it into a buffer like any sane tokenizer
23:03 < bridge> <nameless_me> chiller dragon, I would like to ask, is there a listing anywhere, of the settings available in ddnet-insta, I have the files, I have the server running, but I can't find out how to costimize, I was just wondering if there is a way I can see all the commands
23:11 < bridge> <chairn> has anyone had serious flickering on linux ?
23:12 < bridge> <chairn> weirdly enough, it only starts after i click within the menu
23:13 < bridge> <meloƞ> wayland?
23:13 < bridge> <chairn> works fine with opengl3 though
23:14 < bridge> <chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1330299200587563068/image.png?ex=678d792d&is=678c27ad&hm=acbdb528a65987bb20556fb6a4ce59a5537985f3402c2ac0747490f5a6ea0753&
23:17 < bridge> <chairn> okay, seems to be more random than just backend
23:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> hm, never had any flickering with x11
23:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> maybe update your gpu driver? - maybe it's just vulkan being badly supported by your iGPU
23:17 < bridge> <chairn> looks like it uses the intel gpu rather than the nvidia one
23:17 < bridge> <chairn> wasn't there a menu option to change that ?
23:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> in the graphics tab ingame
23:21 < bridge> <chairn> doesn't show
23:21 < bridge> <chairn> only the one for opengl and vulkan
23:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it only shows for vk
23:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> opengl does not support that in their api
23:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> new laptop? xd
23:23 < bridge> <chairn> work laptop
23:23 < bridge> <chairn> yeah, now it shows because i switched to vk
23:23 < bridge> <chairn> and it crashed
23:23 < bridge> <chairn> so probably driver issue
23:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you install vk validation layers you can start the client with
23:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ./DDNet "dbg_gfx 4"
23:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
23:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to see if there is any problem in our code
23:26 < bridge> <chairn> for gpu drivers, are they installed thriugh apt ?
23:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes

23:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The good old device lost
23:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> Best error euw fr
23:37 < bridge> <chairn> any idea how to track it down ?
23:37 < bridge> <chairn> it worked fine with the intel gpu though*
23:38 < bridge> <chairn> so i can still fallback to that
23:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> absolutely no idea sadly.
23:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
23:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nvidia has some tool on windows to track crashes on the gpu
23:38 < bridge> <chairn> it works fine for let's say 2 seconds then crashes
23:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-graphics
23:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> Afair device lost means your gpu said fuck u without any proper information because it failed something it wasn't supposed to allow to fail
23:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
23:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> Anything custom in your data directory ?
23:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> Assets or smth
23:40 < bridge> <chairn> i just cloned and build
23:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> > Typical reasons for device loss will include things like execution timing out (to prevent denial of service), power management events, platform resource management, implementation errors.
