00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Onbgy ban ath Learath !!! I always knew it he even has ATH in his name.
04:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> but the new client may suck for him ;)
04:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> version 9.3.1 was the last SDL1 version. I've seen pcs out in the wild where SDL1 was faster than SDL2. and its the latest version with an android release
05:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what does faster mean on cpu side?
05:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 100 nanoseconds faster?
05:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno if sdl2 changed smth about the pollrate from the input, but i honestly doubt that if someone really has laggs with newer clients that he didnt had before, that sdl is the reason
05:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its most likely some network code, some specific gpu command or some windows internal thing that forces the CPU core to switch or smth like that
09:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I thought Konsti uses Linux
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> wtf no
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm?
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Nevee
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Never
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Reject this
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
15:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> :f3:
15:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> make 0.7 change it
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is wrong w u guys :/
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its a laser not a rilfe
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Looks like a pretty pointless change to me, but whatever floats your boat ðŸ˜›
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> the weapon itself is a rifle indeed, but what it shoots is laser :saddo:
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> im used to typing rifle in rcon now
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> why would you randomly change it
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> especially for that reason
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao because 0.7 changed it
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 i did copy a lot of code between the two versions and thats one of the few annoyences
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> duh
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> 0.7 doesnt matter for us..
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know 0.7 can do no wrong
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> cuz its basic af
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like pointlessly moving player information out of the snap, they would never do such a stupid thing
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :/
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> im sure its less of an annoyance to fix it in your copy pasting then to always mistype it in commands from now on
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> make alias
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh wait aliases is a 0.7 only thing
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :troll:
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> double code in one meaning? > just for chiller
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> They have console aliases?
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nah
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im just trollin
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ðŸ˜„
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> how often do you really copy paste laser related code from 0.7 to 0.6
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh cmn laser is the future
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> nope
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you have to get used to it at some point
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should finish up my 0.7 port sometime
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lets do it step by step
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and not all at once
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> we can choose to keep rifle in 0.7
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nah that would be annoying
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> chiller, moving tiles >>>> laser
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't like working with others while prototyping
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what r u prototyping?
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The new teams with separate gameworlds
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> for 0.6 or 0.7 ?
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I make sure all of my commits are clean. You can apply it wherever you want
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but I'd never implement it on 0.6 too many things could break and then @jao will have my head
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ðŸ™‚
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i still dont get ddnet7
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> :greenthing:
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> whats about d7 vs master
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> master is fokkonauts direct port
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> which one should be used?
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> d7 is the complete rewrite I'm working on
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea ik
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so what is planned
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not done, so obv you can't use it
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Code that is a lot cleaner is what is planned ðŸ˜›
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so d7 is planned to replace master?
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ok
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> d7 will probably be what we release for ddnet if we migrate to 0.7
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so contributing to master isnt too helpful?
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Depends on your immediate goal
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> not that my contibutions help at all xd
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :troll:
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> i dont think foko is still maintaining that?
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want ddnet to migrate to 0.7 you can help me with d7 after I finish laying out the groundwork
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want to fix something about ddrace that is currently on 0.7 you should help with master
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea i see if i want to fix my currently runnign 0.7 srv i might commit to master but if i want to save ddnet longterm its wiser ot contribute to d7
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh so you actually do not want to disturbed during the groundwork in d7?
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> k im a not spam u with typo prs then ðŸ˜„
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon you can try, but I won't just be accepting copy pastes from ddnet. If there is cleanup to be done, it'll be done before anything gets merged
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is d7 server and client?
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> d7 is just server work for now
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is it using 0.7 style?
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> In the long run if I feel like it, I'll strip all of the new ui out of d7 and release a client aswell slowly adding in ddnet client features
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> btw i am working on a client that slowly gets added ddnet features
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0.7 style is not different from 0.6 style, it's all the same code style
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it has some basics ðŸ™‚ and i focused on keeping the original commit authors
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well some things are more 0.7 way than 0.6/ddnet
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk about server too much tho
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm also doing my best not to modify too much of the vanilla code so I can easily merge in changes from vanilla
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea thats what i mean
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ðŸ™‚
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh btw what do you think about using rcon for timeout instead of chat?
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think next thing I'm doing is finishing up teams
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then I'll add layers to maps
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> just send a unauthenticated rcon command with timeout code
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't remember why that wasn't done to begin with. We do use rcon commands for other things
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Timeout I really want to get into vanilla with some proper session resumption, but that's just so much work
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I barely have motivation to eat breakfast nowadays ðŸ˜›
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> timeout in vanilla?
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Proper timeout in the network code
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there is no need for timeout in vanilla :/
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> See this is why I absolutely hate contributing with vanilla ðŸ™‚
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a network feature with very small overhead, just set the timeout to 0s, but no
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Most of you just complain about anything that doesn't have direct use
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd also help roaming clients
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well vanilla is planning to add ddrace support
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so its not too bad
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh that's horrible news
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Imagine vanilla release cycle for ddrace
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wait 10 years for new features
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or ddrace without teams because those dont really fit in the code nicely
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well it could also be nice if the vanilla client just adds a freeze texture instead of ninja and a bit of freeze prediction maybe hookthrough support a few client side things that are a nice base and not blocking any modifications on top of it
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We had a freeze texture instead of ninja
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It was an ice cube iirc
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> never saw that o:o
17:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> @ChillerDragon https://ddnet.tw/skins/index.php?search=frozen iirc
17:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> though it'd be awesome if just that "ice cube" would be an overlay to real skin instead of different like like this or the ninja
17:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> though it'd be awesome if just that "ice cube" would be an overlay on actual player skin skin instead of replacement like this one or the ninja
17:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> though it'd be awesome if just that "ice cube" would be an overlay on actual player skin instead of replacement, like this one or the ninja
17:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @Soreu damm that is actually pretty funny
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea a overlay would be great ðŸ™‚
18:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 contributing to vanilla is a pain in the arse
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I added 5 options for chat sounds, so u can mute the annoying chat
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Dune said its bloat
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol: :lol: :lol: :lol:
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rifle is faster to type than laser
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> So we keep rifle
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty: :bluekitty:

21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "GitHub will capture a snapshot of every active public repository on 02/02/2020 and preserve that data in the Arctic Code Vault! Upload all natively-stored code soon!"
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet in the artic
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
22:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> Could someone remind me how to permanently have entities overlay set to 100%?
22:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> @Soreu `cl_overlay_entities 100` in settings_ddnet.cfg
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> @jao That resets on game restart
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> i dont think there is another way then
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> Sure there was, because... few years ago... I had it, without resetting and without making DDNet settings read-only. But I couldn't find the way on forum :/
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> previously you could do it through abusing timeout code setting
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> but thatâ€™s gone now
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> nah
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> it was some simple thing
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> I just created `force_entities.cfg` in DDNet directory, and in shortcut settings added `-f "force_entities.cfg"` to launch game with additional config file
23:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> Would be nice if there would be "game shortcut settings" or so in https://ddnet.tw/settingscommands/
23:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> especially if there are any more than the `-f`
23:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=client_commands has "Startup commands" but with info only about debug console
