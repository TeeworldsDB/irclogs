01:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> QUIC is now an RFC
06:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it's over 9000
06:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> in 15.5 I can spam refresh and create tons of tasks. and sometime trigger some io error.

12:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> That is a bit spammy on startup, no?
12:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It's a bit spammy on IRC
12:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it seems ok for me
15:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Http requests should get an id so we can associate results to requests

16:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ```
16:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> CMake Error (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:236 (message):
16:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu>   DATA does not contain every file from directory data
16:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ```
16:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :pepeH:
17:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> oh ok i got it
17:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 could we add something to the protocol to let the server signal that it's experiencing connectivity issues?
17:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 atomic integer counter?
17:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One thing I've been missing with the new serverlist is the ability to see that a server is under ddos
17:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, that's what I was thinking too for the ID
17:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> add a field to the server info once we have the true http master?
17:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doesn't the underlying collection server have some idea of the ping?
17:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe also improve the client connecting dialog
17:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 does the ping increase for servers under attack? I'd guess at most the packet loss rate increases
17:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I've seen GER2 spike to double the ping before during an attack, but not all attacks do that yeah
17:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should have used a template parameter for the alignment...
17:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should stop committing quickly
18:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, I didn't because I didn't want to move the implementation  of Allocate and AllocateFromChunk into the header file
18:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When are they going to get rid of that silly requirement anyway? ðŸ˜¦
18:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or of header files in general. are C++ modules a step into that direction?
18:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not really afaik
18:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜¦
18:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, I guess I'll have to leave it like this, a shame since aligning to 16 optimizes extremely well
18:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/16/powers of two/
18:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if I could somehow convey that Alignment > 0 it would also help make it branchless
18:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://godbolt.org/z/36aKeT87v look how much prettier the 16 version is ðŸ˜¦
18:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd say that thinking about this applies optimization at the wrong place. e.g. handling of bans or finding client ID from IP address are things that happen a couple of orders of magnitude more often
18:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and they use a very basic hashmap and linear lookup
18:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ofc it's not worth it, it's just annoying that I can't do it correctly to begin with without making it ugly
18:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not that the correct way is inherently more complex
18:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see
18:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://godbolt.org/z/rzqTKf8En
18:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if my function is correct, I even removed the conditional ^^
18:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> uhm I considered this one too but then I wasn't quite sure of negating an unsigned ðŸ˜„
18:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think(tm) the standard says that wraps around
18:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the standard says it wraps around
18:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't know if integer promotion rules will mess with me
18:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmhm, is 2^32 - n % 16 perhaps equivalent to the result we are looking for?
18:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
18:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, some mathematrickery
18:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> pf, this is about at the bounds of my C++ knowledge, I think it's fine
18:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ##C says is fine, I'd guess C++ also uses the same rules
18:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Matrix is probably the greatest example of computerppl overcomplicating things, I have not seen a system this convoluted in quite some time
19:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I would like to see matrix and xmpp communicating
19:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but e2ee across different platforms probably needs to wait until mls is finished, so maybe inâ€¦ 10 years?

19:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <FreZZ7> jo guys i got an question and would be happy if someone can help me.
19:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <FreZZ7> So i wanna try to use my 144hz with 60 hz on Teeworlds. But if i set this it gets completly buggy. Anyone have an idea/time to help me?
20:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does "completely buggy" mean?
20:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you see? what would you like to see instead?
21:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> how to add gui_cursor.png to assets?

22:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <pult1133> Omg
23:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> someone can explain me that? when i put "unfreeze" tile from blockworlds entities that put unfreeze + hooktrough
