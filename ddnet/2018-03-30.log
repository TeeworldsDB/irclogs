00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skyrx> in which file is the anti-ping?
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skyrx> @here
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk did u try ``grep -r "ping" .`` `
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> guess its somewhere src/game/client/ ^^
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/cc6449bcd6537507f5f5a599895fb6ab0b275a90/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L1789
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i found this with github websearch but idk what ur looking for exactly
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skyrx> ty
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skyrx> @ChillerDragon i wanna cut off antiping and paste it into another cleint
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skyrx> what why?
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skyrx> who can help me with that?
02:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> this server has tees standing around without them being shown in the scoreboeard,  are they taking slots or could they just spawn 300 of those? would be cool to have dummymaps set up more easy where you just pick a dummy out of a pit at the start of a map or so

02:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Hm maybe ask vali?
02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> ask vali
02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> or captain teemo
02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> @FluffiexD
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skyrx> Me?
02:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> who are you?
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> that's vali
13:12 <+Learath2> Skyrx is vali?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skyrx> vali?
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im vali
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Skyrx Rewriting your client over ddnet code is probably easier then extracting the anti ping from the ddnet client
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> @Im 'corneum that's actually a nice idea; maybe there can be even auto-spawning and auto-deleting of dummies (either at start or with special entities); that way there might be even dummies added to non-dummy maps, just for a stage or two, and dummy maps would become solo maps actually (assuming the dummy is spawned per team, and that solo is actually just a separate team per player underneath)
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ye. i'd like to do solos with some dummies placed here and there so you have their physics.   no need of killing the dummy at the end. no need to carry them around for the map
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> there might be a "dummy on" switch entity, which would spawn/reposition the team's dummy to a given position, as well as a "dummy kill" or "dummy only" game/front entity, which would either kill or let only dummies through
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> WDYT?
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> Some months ago i asked to add a texture change option like in allthehaxx client (https://github.com/AllTheHaxx/AllTheHaxx). I got an ok from deen so i thought it will be added. Just wanted to ask if it still will be added
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman> ok
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> when @deen?
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> when what?
