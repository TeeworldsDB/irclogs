00:21 <+bridge> <deen> Huh, someone implemented points in scoreboard using a Python script rewriting the memory of running DDNet process, pretty cool: https://github.com/MageDelfador/DDNet-show-points-in-game
00:22 <+bridge> <uwu> hacky :justatest:
02:02 <+bridge> <DefaultO> Pretty basic hack. Good.
02:02 <+bridge> <DefaultO> But I looked it at it. And it will break whenever you update the game/push new binaries.
02:03 <+bridge> <DefaultO> They hardcoded the addresses instead of going for methods to dynamically aquire the address each time.
02:04 <+bridge> <DefaultO> But I looked it at it. And it will break whenever you update the game/push new binaries. If it's not outdated already.
02:05 <+bridge> <DefaultO> But I looked at it. And it will break whenever you update the game/push new binaries. If it's not outdated already.
02:06 <+bridge> <DefaultO> Such methods could be Array of Bytes/Sig-Scanning, RTTI, Pointers, etc.
02:12 <+bridge> <DefaultO> Depending on how the scoreboard works. Instead of writing to the scoreboard. They could have wrote an hook for a function that gets information for a netid/player, such as name, clan, ping, etc.
02:13 <+bridge> <DefaultO> Or even better. Writing an hook for the scoreboard window. Then you could add your own tab. Instead of having to replace existing information or making that information false.
02:14 <+bridge> <DefaultO> Or even better. Writing an hook for the scoreboard window. Then you could add your own "Points" tab. Instead of having to replace existing information or making that information false.
02:14 <+bridge> <DefaultO> Pretty basic hack. Good. I like it.
02:16 <+bridge> <DefaultO> Hacking stuff can get pretty beautiful. And that's why I love doing it. ðŸ¤Œ
02:20 <+bridge> <DefaultO> Pretty basic hack. Good. I like it. Qustionable choice of language.
09:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this was mentioned long time ago here

10:38 <+bridge> <deen> First time someone fuzzing found an issue in my code, not the other way around ðŸ˜„ https://github.com/nim-lang/bigints/issues/123
11:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Who can create a concept for our current scoreboard with total player scores in mind that doesn't look too bad and is well readable even with long names ^^
11:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Ravie @louis any idea?
11:16 <+bridge> <deen> Yes, I'm not sure if number makes more sense, or some visual representation of the points
11:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Friend list places name and clan vertically  to each another. But dunno if that can look good. Ping and player flag can be smaller
11:21 <+bridge> <Matin> Can someone take a look to this please?
11:21 <+bridge> <Matin> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/745926398140612678/1063401705665986581
11:56 <+ChillerDragon> we need ddnet-foss in the aur! 
11:57 <+ChillerDragon> without the discord spyware flag on
12:48 <+bridge> <deen> Isn't there a way to remember some config flags in AUR? Gentoo has this, you can set different flags for each package you compile, that was the most fun, picking the right options for each
12:49 <+bridge> <deen> I guess I never noticed because I only set special flags for packages which get updated about once every 5 years ðŸ˜„
13:09 <+ChillerDragon> time to switch to gentoo then
13:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: you can edit the PKGBUILD when building
13:44 <+bridge> <deen> But you have to reedit that for each new version?
13:45 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
13:45 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but it should be comparatively easy, remove `-DDISCORD=ON`
13:45 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> alternatively, you could create a stub discord library and install that

14:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
14:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> dark
14:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u have a successor
14:04 <+bridge> <Learath2> Nope
14:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
14:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> when learaths dies the world is over, because we are all just illusions in his head
14:52 <+bridge> <deen> @Jupeyy_Keks I changed it to this already

14:52 <+bridge> <deen> Oops, got lost in old chat ðŸ˜„
14:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xD
14:55 <+bridge> <deen> Should we have that for Linux too btw?
14:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, the only problems i have seen yet was out of VRAM
14:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or were there others?
14:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> is "Always use this option" in non beta steam already?
14:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
14:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> else these options are probably annoying anyway
14:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and if it exists, and someone already did, and its not resettet if you add a third option, its useless anyway xD
14:58 <+bridge> <deen> I don't have Windows, so can't test
14:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if we get more complains we can still do it i guess
14:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno how the situtation is for the chinese community. they are probably the biggest community now
14:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and they not really in discord
15:11 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> i have those options
15:12 <+bridge> <murpi> It's only annoying if you start the game 10 times a day for whatever reason
15:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> every non optionl extra step sucks
15:13 <+bridge> <murpi> We lose players if people can't start the game and don't want to join discord
15:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> on a fresh install this shouldn't happen tho
15:30 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> can i skip this menu?
15:30 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1063465033734029362/image.png
15:34 <+bridge> <murpi> yes by creating a shortcut
15:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> by using steam beta
15:35 <+bridge> <murpi> or that ^^
15:44 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> But i dont want untested features
15:44 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> How do i create a shortcut?
15:45 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> But i dont want ~~untested features~~ to update very often
15:46 <+bridge> <murpi> Steam Library > DDraceNetwork > Rightclick > Manage > Add desktop shortcut
15:48 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> @murpi and how do i open it?
15:48 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1063469601414971432/image.png
15:50 <+bridge> <murpi> No idea what that is ðŸ‘€
15:51 <+bridge> <Alexander> With steam?
15:51 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> I guess bug then, this appears if i create a shortcut
15:51 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> yes with steam
15:51 <+bridge> <Alexander> Did you try to open it with steam
15:51 <+bridge> <Alexander> Is what i meant
15:52 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> no if i open it with steam, the start page of steam appears
15:53 <+bridge> <Alexander> Okay lemme see if google says anything
15:53 <+bridge> <murpi> Looks like you borked the default file association for .url files somehow
15:53 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> i have to open it with "Internet Browser"
15:53 <+bridge> <Alexander> https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/2592234299538779319/
15:53 <+bridge> <Alexander> Check this
15:54 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> I have set it as default and now it looks good and the extension is not shown anymore
15:54 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> solved already
15:55 <+bridge> <Vy0x2> solved already (thx for the help)
16:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://blog.elevenlabs.io/enter-the-new-year-with-a-bang/
16:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> voice actors are the next target
16:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> > Video game developers can now voice a plethora of otherwise mute NPCs with all the necessary tools available at their fingertips. Not only can they be more cost-effective without compromising on quality but they can now also design voices that will be entirely unique to the virtual worlds they create.
16:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> actually cool applications
16:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> images, code, text and now voice
16:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> whats next
16:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34361651
16:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> really cool samples, i want a lotr audio book now with a very speaker that has a badass soul voice xd
16:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i want one with the voice of glados
16:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm
16:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and the voice of that game
16:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1ybSl2c_J8
16:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> listen to this
16:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i want this voice AI
16:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> chad voice
16:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xd#
16:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> <https://youtu.be/c1ybSl2c_J8?t=1753>
16:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:15 <+bridge> <Ravie> wdym, a new window or changing the current scoreboard?
16:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> change the current to add total player points
16:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> we run out of space so we might need to redesign it a bit, i guess we could grow in height a very bit if that helps
16:16 <+bridge> <Ravie> then the only way is to make it wide
16:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> smth like the team strings looks too bad?
16:17 <+bridge> <Ravie> well maybe some tiny text could work ye
16:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> oh they arent below the team anymore xd
16:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or we have to accept generally smaller font sizes for all sizes
16:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1063477135253188658/image.png
16:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> imo this is still well readable
16:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and gives much more space
16:19 <+bridge> <Ravie> I wouldn't make it smaller
16:19 <+bridge> <Ravie> it's kinda the tw GUI style to have really big text and fat buttons
16:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but e.g. here its like that on tw already
16:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> just for 64players
16:22 <+bridge> <Ravie> I'll have to try something when I'm on pc
16:22 <+bridge> <louis> i liked the points in chat ðŸ˜…
16:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> its not like we have to add this, here is the discussion #6140
16:40 <+bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6140
16:40 <+bridge> <louis> i meant i like the public /points announcement
16:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes, that is the discussion about it
16:41 <+bridge> <louis> ah ye
17:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://security.googleblog.com/2023/01/supporting-use-of-rust-in-chromium.html
17:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> old news
17:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i am disappointed, normally u faster xd
17:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> f
17:46 <+bridge> <Ravie> @Jupeyy_Keks  something like that or are you thinking about a bigger redesign?
17:46 <+bridge> <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1063499206125428736/image.png
18:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> looks fine to me
18:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> maybe bit hard for 64p scoreboard
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> bloated ui
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> remove clan/skin/country
18:07 <+bridge> <Ravie> the 64p one is impossible to add anything xD
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com%2Ff%2F7a17cecf-47df-4745-9e4d-0e59bec307aa%2Fd5mwne6-3d6b58f2-1509-4f4b-b05b-98f727d4a530.jpg%3Ftoken%3DeyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOiIsImlzcyI6InVybjphcHA6Iiwib2JqIjpbW3sicGF0aCI6IlwvZlwvN2ExN2NlY2YtNDdkZi00NzQ1LTllNGQtMGU1OWJlYzMwN2FhXC9kNW13bmU2LTNkNmI1OGYyLTE1MD

18:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> thanks chillerdragon
18:07 <+bridge> <Ravie> I had the idea to maybe make the scoreboard scrollable, would be good for potential future 128p support
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> wot did it split the link to 2 messages? xd
18:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> gg irc
18:08 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1673629522.png
18:08 <+ChillerDragon> this is a hot scoreboard
18:08 <+ChillerDragon> note the missing score because of minimalism
18:09 <+ChillerDragon> please also add a graph of points history for every player and the weather based on the players country flag 
18:11 <+ChillerDragon> what about a top5000 top1000 top500 top100 badge on the tee instead? :)
18:31 <+bridge> <Ravie> @Jupeyy_Keks here's an idea with a scrollbar, we could also do something about the spectator box below to have more space for players
18:31 <+bridge> <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1063510709884944566/image.png
18:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah scrollbar would fix lot of issues, could maybe activate mouse like CS:GO does by using `alt + mouse_right` or smth like that
18:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but ofc has the disadvantage of not seeing eveyrthing at once
18:33 <+bridge> <Ravie> yeah that's why I'm thinking about how to fit more players vertically
18:34 <+bridge> <Ravie> if you could see like 24 players at a time then you will never have to scroll too much
18:35 <+bridge> <Ravie> also with a scrollbar we could get rid of the big 64p scoreboard and make this one wider instead so names and clans will always fit
18:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> tbh do we need spectator box at all for ddrace?
18:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> even if, there are rarely more than 2-3 players in spec
18:36 <+bridge> <Ravie> it's nice to see who is in the server but as spectator, but that can always go at the bottom of the scroll area
18:36 <+bridge> <Ravie> or list spectators as players but put them in some team
18:42 <+bridge> <deen> I think the word "points" every time, will be too redundant
18:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> lets create a symbol for points
18:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> like our currency
18:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> $
18:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
18:43 <+bridge> <Ravie> yeah maybe, I just couldn't think of a better way to show what that number means
18:44 <+bridge> <deen> â„™
18:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> sounds mathy
18:44 <+bridge> <Ravie> it could be points, could be rank, could be points rank if there is no info
18:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i got 8000â„™
18:45 <+bridge> <deen> I think I'd be fine with not fitting all 64 on a single screen. We could also try to merge 128 player support
18:45 <+bridge> <deen> much easier then
18:45 <+bridge> <deen> Maybe at the top just put Name / Points
18:46 <+bridge> <deen> if we have 2 lines per player, we could also display more stuff, maybe the time when the rank was made under time? Jitter of the connection under ping?
18:47 <+bridge> <deen> or rank/teamrank numbers of the player too
18:47 <+bridge> <deen> Might make sense to rethink everything that is useful to put in scoreboard if we are doing a redesign anywaay
18:48 <+bridge> <deen> Best rank, best teamrank, mapper name?
18:48 <+bridge> <Ravie> could put `Rank x` under the time
18:49 <+bridge> <gerdoe> is it even necessary tho
18:49 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I wouldn't stuff too much stuff into the scoreboard
18:49 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's nice to quickly check who's online rn
18:49 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ^ yeah same
18:49 <+bridge> <deen> Yeah, I guess that's a danger
18:49 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what info do you usually check when looking at the scoreboard?
18:50 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I probably check who's online, my ping, and rarely other people's ping
18:50 <+bridge> <Ravie> yeah it should stay minimal but maybe some additional info related to rank or points could be nice
18:50 <+bridge> <deen> I look for players I should ban, but I'm not playing much ðŸ˜„
18:50 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, and the skin is also useful inf
18:50 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> o
18:51 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because I know what to look out for when matching skin to name
18:51 <+bridge> <Ravie> yeah I always find my friends in tab by skins
18:52 <+bridge> <gerdoe> goes straight into server info
18:52 <+bridge> <gerdoe> very unused page in menu
18:52 <+bridge> <gerdoe> motd server info and player amount with mod type
18:52 <+bridge> <gerdoe> not much yey
18:52 <+bridge> <gerdoe> yet
18:52 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> oh, top5 would be nice in server info ^^
18:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> an actual UI for it
18:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but I guess I'm getting too much into wish list territory
19:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i even look at pings of others, bcs i want to see if they lag, when they play bad xd
19:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i generally look at everything tbh, time maybe the least, but score for example a lot for pvp mods
19:12 <+bridge> <deen> I never look at clan ðŸ˜„
19:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps the score/rank/points could be cycled instead of being shown at the same time?
19:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe Jupstar even said that, some button to press to cycle it
19:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if we'd implement mouse/cursor support we could also do hover information
20:01 <+ChillerDragon> aaa i do get core dumps since i updated ma client but also might be chillerbot buggos
20:27 <+bridge> <gerdoe> im checking other players ping to make sure they will have same ping next time
20:27 <+bridge> <gerdoe> if theyll not ill ask like "did you change your flat or something"
20:28 <+bridge> <gerdoe> or make sure player isn't fake
21:01 <+bridge> <ReiTW> the bar showing the delay before unfreeze seem to stutter
21:01 <+bridge> <ReiTW> like not smooth, but hard to notice it
21:02 <+bridge> <ReiTW> ah well the zoom gives that effect
21:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> hello head
21:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the head of ddnet
21:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> 't was a mistake ^^
21:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> heinrich doing a coup
21:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜…
22:20 <+bridge> <Chairn> git push -d upstream head
22:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> git checkout <first commit>
22:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
22:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> git push --force
22:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
22:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> rq of death
22:21 <+bridge> <Chairn> you cant force push master
22:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> do we protect our master branch finally?
22:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> protect against what?
22:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> force pushing
22:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> doesn't seem to be an issue so far
22:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> btw, I recommend using `+` instead of `--force` for git push
22:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> `git push origin +branchname`
22:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> `git push origin +branchname master`
22:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> force pushes only branchname
22:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> looks lot to type
22:28 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, don't know how you usually push
22:28 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> for me it's just the extra +
22:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> git push -f
22:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> onn the branch
22:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i never push master tho
22:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I always push with `git push <branchname>`
22:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I always push with `git push origin <branchname>`
22:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and anyway i donnt work with ddnet directly
22:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i use my fork
23:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> rust in chromium btw
23:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> or at least preparations for rust in chromium
23:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://security.googleblog.com/2023/01/supporting-use-of-rust-in-chromium.html
23:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> inb4 ryo "old"
23:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i sent it
23:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but someone sent it before me
23:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> according to @Jupeyy_Keks
23:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so its not just old
