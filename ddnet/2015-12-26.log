22:04 < vali> hi
22:13 <@EastByte> hello
23:44 <@deen> savandef: i've seen it before. it happens when you connect to a server while the server is changing map. it still sends you the old map, but you end up on the new one, so it looks all wrong
23:45 < savandef> okay, it was a bit funny
23:45 < savandef> ^^>
