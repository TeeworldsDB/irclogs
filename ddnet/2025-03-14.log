00:01 < bridge> <Ewan> u dont consider things like federally subsidized housing and food
00:01 < bridge> <Ewan> and consequent ineligibility for those things
00:02 < bridge> <kebscs> <https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Warsaw> i would say this is accurate
00:03 < bridge> <kebscs> idk why it says "costs are 3,278.2zł without rent" bcs i pay like 1800 for food per month devilered to door
00:05 < bridge> <kebscs> and avg salary is probably higher than it actually is, because most people work on minimum wage
00:08 < bridge> <kebscs> and avg salary on the website is probably higher than it actually is, because most people work on minimum wage
00:10 < bridge> <Ewan> hmm
00:10 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1349882439899549726/image.png?ex=67d4b77d&is=67d365fd&hm=debd289a4d27a2d13c466a83ebe44d32054d71b50d21e8f7f2adf1664509dcfb&
00:11 < bridge> <Ewan> seems affordable
00:11 < bridge> <Ewan> i know some poles
00:11 < bridge> <Ewan> worth considering
00:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I know some poles.
00:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Never again.
00:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ||just kidding||
00:12 < bridge> <kebscs> if you arent on polish salary/have a good income then yea
00:13 < bridge> <Ewan> yuea i mean i work fully remote and i know they have european employees
00:14 < bridge> <Ewan> tho i need to be sure of that
00:15 < bridge> <kebscs> the working remote laws differ from country to country
00:17 < bridge> <teero777> I only know like 2 poles
00:21 < bridge> <louis> not in some big us cities tbf
00:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Living *in* cities is a bit crazy anywhere, but yeah parts of the US are mind boggling
00:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Living *in* cities instead of just near them is a bit crazy anywhere, but yeah parts of the US are mind boggling
00:28 < bridge> <learath2> Ah another thing this is good for is when you want to automate something but it's too js heavy to do through curl
00:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Unaffordable
00:32 < bridge> <learath2> What is a good metric for this? Rent is about 700 for a single bedroom in the city here
00:32 < bridge> <Ewan> woah..... u have opened my eyes to huge potential
00:32 < bridge> <Ewan> 700 USD? i was looking for 1 bedrooms (which include living room, kitchen, bathroom, balcony) in the cities near me and it'd be minimum $2000
00:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> As chiller said. Unaffordable
00:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
00:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> But we both do live close to the most expensive places in Germany :feelsbadman:
00:33 < bridge> <learath2> EUR, and that's the average, I pay about 600 for mine
00:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> Eh I meant u do, chiller is ofc in Ibiza hahaha
00:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> Eh I meant I do, chiller is ofc in Ibiza hahaha
00:33 < bridge> <learath2> Salaries are also accordingly low though, so it's hard to make much sense of "how expensive it is to live"
00:33 < bridge> <Ewan> around the cities that minimum turns to ~$1650
00:34 < bridge> <Ewan> past that it's pretty consistent here
00:34 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of fast horizontal expansion means all the real estate has similar value bcs it's within highway commuting distance of the city
00:34 < bridge> <learath2> The average salary is 1700 a month here in italy e.g.
00:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> That would be an average 2 room apartment with balcony then.. ~1800€ depending on size, 2000€ would be around 120m²
00:35 < bridge> <learath2> So the rent is a little more than one third
00:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> That would be an average 2-3 room apartment with balcony then.. ~1800€ depending on size, 2000€ would be around 120m²
00:35 < bridge> <Ewan> interesting. im not sure what the conversion rate is rn. all the numbers i said are usd so there's some bias
00:35 < bridge> <learath2> Also depends heavily on the city. In Amsterdam 1800 euros would be barely better than a shed
00:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> Almost 1 to 1 iirc actually
00:35 < bridge> <Ewan> historically but i wouldn't be surprised if it's diluted now
00:36 < bridge> <learath2> almost always around 1.1
00:36 < bridge> <Ewan> 1.09:1 USD:euro
00:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> Note that I live close to Munich
00:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> Which is.. horrible
00:36 < bridge> <learath2> Inside Berlin 1800 would also probably be a shed
00:36 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds right
00:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> 1800 in Berlin? You're allowed to sleep on the balcony.
00:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> Maybe even use wifi
00:37 < bridge> <learath2> (but also the wages are higher in bigger cities, so there is that)
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> the apt complexes with the public wifi are the #1 red flag
00:37 < bridge> <learath2> Overall, you'll earn much less than you'd earn in the US but last I calculated you should be having a better living with all the amenities the govts here give you and still relatively cheaper other stuffs
00:39 < bridge> <learath2> the average salary for a Software Engineer is 6 figures in the US, very much not 6 figures in the EU
00:39 < bridge> <learath2> but also a lot of software engineers live in san fransico where 6 figures gets you a shed and horse manure to eat, so ymmv
00:39 < bridge> <learath2> but also a lot of US software engineers live in san fransico where 6 figures gets you a shed and horse manure to eat, so ymmv
00:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> I make around ~60K€ brutto (without taxes) which is a LOT from what I heard
00:41 < bridge> <alw5> burrito?
00:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> I still live paycheck to paycheck tho, don't do adult stuff
00:41 < bridge> <alw5> melon u fat
00:42 < bridge> <learath2> If I made 60k without taxes in italy that'd be about 3k a month after taxes, I'd live like a king 😛
00:43 < bridge> <learath2> In Germany I imagine that 3k would be much meh'er 😄
00:44 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah, boulder CO is basically that at this point
00:44 < bridge> <Ewan> everything costs a kidney
00:44 < bridge> <learath2> move to Nashville TN
00:45 < bridge> <Ewan> if i can keep get pay raise at my job & still be able to move then i will have no issues
00:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> Yeah I do make around 2.8K per month, -1200 rent and  -600 other stuff that I need to exist and boom money gone :(
00:45 < bridge> <Ewan> can't. been there, too humid
00:45 < bridge> <Ewan> also. trashy
00:45 < bridge> <Ewan> we make about the same amount. and have about the same cost of living
00:45 < bridge> <Ewan> that's funny
00:45 < bridge> <Ewan> my rent will be higher as soon as i move out of this room
00:46 < bridge> <learath2> there is 1k missing, where does that 1k go? 😄
00:46 < bridge> <Ewan> cocaine
00:46 < bridge> <learath2> good choice
00:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> Expenses towards walking younglings and wife + food and some other monthly costs like cocaine and hookers
00:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> But yeah mostly cocaine...
00:47 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @meloƞ dox
00:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> When drink helles together in Wintergarten?st
00:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> Still waiting for you to come home chiller
00:47 < bridge> <learath2> Pro-tip: Divorce the wife, give away the kids and it's an amazing salary
00:48 < bridge> <learath2> I should become a financial advisor
00:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> That true
00:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> Can I swing by you for a few months, my mom is gonna kill me if she finds out
00:48 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @meloƞ omg we rly gotta do
00:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Better yet, sell the kids!
00:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> No shit, I've been waiting a year for your butt to return
00:49 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> oops
00:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> :VAngy:
00:49 < bridge> <Ewan> lol i dont have those issues
00:49 < bridge> <learath2> You should join me in my financial consultancy business
00:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i am a drug addict but i have hardly ever paid a dime
00:49 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> sus
00:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> :pog:
00:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i hope the former changes as soon as i have more expenses but u know
00:49 < bridge> <Ewan> not the latter
00:50 < bridge> <learath2> I'm fairly wasteful but my monthly expenses come out to like 1.5k on the average
00:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> That's not to bad tho
00:50 < bridge> <learath2> So Italy seems to be far cheaper
00:50 < bridge> <Ewan> i am as well. i bought $30 worth of protein drinks i hated and then just gave them to my sister instead of returning all but 1 of them (can you even do that at that store? probably not)
00:50 < bridge> <Ewan> and then bought $50 worth of similar but better ones
00:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> my biggest investment this month was monster Hunter wilds :justatest:
00:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> 70€... Madlads
00:51 < bridge> <learath2> I'm also wasting someone elses money, so I could probably fit in a smaller budget if it was my money 😄
00:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> :brownbear: :kek:
00:51 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
00:51 < bridge> <Ewan> i'll give MHW a little time...
00:51 < bridge> <Ewan> go on sale a few times
00:52 < bridge> <Ewan> get some DLC
00:52 < bridge> <learath2> I was going to get MHW but there is no way on earth this ancient PC runs it well
00:52 < bridge> <learath2> I need to find a secondhand x570 motherboard somewhere
00:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> Bro is discord on phone leaking memory or what 
00:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
00:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> My phone is getting slower and slowe
00:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> How do I debug my phone
00:53 < bridge> <towarish_> Salut)
00:53 < bridge> <towarish_> :hey:
00:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i intend on buying a better gpu soon. i bought another 3060 and am considering either trading 2 for a better one/selling thme both, or running a windows VM with 1/2 my cores allocated at boot on a tuned KVM host, with 1 GPU each
00:53 < bridge> <Ewan> it was a really good deal bcs someone i knew was selling it
00:53 < bridge> <Ewan> then my pc will be unstoppable
00:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i just bought 3 noctua nf a12x25 fans for my computer
00:54 < bridge> <Ewan> so i can use it in peace
00:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> Sounds hot, why not just GPU passthrough via visualization?
00:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
00:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> I intended to do that but back then I sucked at nix xD
00:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
00:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> Maybe I should try it again.. just unload everything and give it to the next person
00:54 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym?
00:55 < bridge> <Ewan> inherent performance loss in any middle layer
00:55 < bridge> <Ewan> no way to do native passthrough without still disabling the device in some way, iommu not mandatory nowadays but i'd never utilize it otherwise
00:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> All this just to run a game where you hammer little balls
00:56 < bridge> <Ewan> all this while my PC use is trending way downward
00:57 < bridge> <learath2> I have my eye on intels new gpu, b580
00:57 < bridge> <learath2> looks to be at an insane price/performance point and they seem to have figured out drivers mostly
00:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://looking-glass.io/
01:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no way actual gpu virtualization?
01:10 < bridge> <Ewan> if it's actually good, yea
01:10 < bridge> <Ewan> this was shown to me when it came out & while cool is unnecessary for my setup
01:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ~~no way actual gpu virtualization?~~ sadge
01:13 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> how does looking glass work? is it a vm it self?
01:15 < bridge> <Ewan> it's a KVM host but it outsources all of the work
01:16 < bridge> <Ewan> this is what i was talking about though
01:16 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1349898889641201834/image.png?ex=67d4c6cf&is=67d3754f&hm=7e874be481a07580b05e4347f6a196733412fb9df02fbf79cea1a69a361512f6&
01:16 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not a native output buffer or even based on DRM
01:16 < bridge> <Ewan> that shit will be too slow for anyone with high refresh rate/low latency setups to really tolerate
01:16 < bridge> <Ewan> especially considering the potential for optimization when you have a finely tuned libvirt machine
01:18 < bridge> <Ewan> and the various frontends that you can use if you don't want to attach a discrete GPU, keyboard and mouse to it (which i almost prefer, both bcs my monitor is a kvm switch but also because my kb/m are both wireless with 3 device slots)
01:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> just tried vsync off for the first time in forever
01:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> my brother in christ it is so smooth
01:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (cuz vsync on was more laggy than usual so i was like lets try it)
01:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but now i cnat hammerfly
01:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and everythings off
01:30 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
01:30 < bridge> <Ewan> i got tearing on in my compositor, direct rendering management, 75hz overclocked on my monitor
01:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also no vsync = tearing and wack
01:30 < bridge> <Ewan> it's like the pc is an extension of my obdy
01:30 < bridge> <Ewan> it's like the pc is an extension of my body
01:31 < bridge> <Ewan> especially on a certain kog server i get <10 ping to normally
01:31 < bridge> <louis> new ryzen gpu is supposedly nice
01:31 < bridge> <Ewan> radeon?
01:31 < bridge> <Ewan> or igpu
01:31 < bridge> <louis> teah
01:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its smooth like peanut butter but chunky and horrible like chunky peanut butter
01:31 < bridge> <louis> radeon
01:31 < bridge> <louis> i wanna try the amd strix halo apu xd
01:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also i think the timing which i get back is enough to turn what i think is hf into pseudo fly x-x
01:31 < bridge> <louis> i actually have a tendency to spend too much money on tech its insane
01:32 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
01:32 < bridge> <Ewan> with fast input on
01:33 < bridge> <Ewan> i am terrible at fng but get most of the shots
01:33 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
01:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why does vsync cause delay
01:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the difference between 60fps vsync on and off is crazy
01:34 < bridge> <Ewan> because it waits for all vertical pixels to be ready before flipping them to display
01:34 < bridge> <Ewan> whereas with vsync off they are all flipped immediately as they are ready (on the interval that your monitor polls)
01:34 < bridge> <Ewan> all rows of pixels i should say
01:34 < bridge> <Ewan> the vblank is sent after the last line & that's what it waits for
01:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so each frame is old?
01:34 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
01:34 < bridge> <Ewan> by several game frames
01:34 < bridge> <Ewan> under many circumstances
01:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but i can run at 3k  fps so each frame is 0.3ms
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> that is the amount of frames that it's processing, but not the amount being displayed
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> when vsync is on it's just the latest frame available every 1/60th interval (on 60hz)
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> when vsync is on it's just the latest frame available every 1/60th second interval (on 60hz)
01:36 < bridge> <Ewan> but that frame can also take longer
01:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but 0.3ms is reaaaaaly small
01:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it does generate those frames
01:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but the buffer just isnt flipped
01:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that only happens 60fps when the last one is finished
01:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> seeing as screen tearing is a thing it doesnt take 16ms to display a frame
01:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or no thats wrong
01:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i want my cake and eat .. cake
01:38 < bridge> <Ewan> mine's about as tuned as it gets for my monitor's capabilities
01:38 < bridge> <Ewan> it has good frame turnaround just low refresh rate
01:38 < bridge> <Ewan> somewhat shitty colors but good res etc
01:39 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess those are the sacrifices u make when u buy a 4k 32" monitor with $600 msrp
01:39 < bridge> <Ewan> no i didnt pay that much for it
01:41 < bridge> <Ewan> considering just getting a decent 27" 1440p monitor. can't be that much worse DPI wise but budget wise that probably opens me up to way better colors & refresh rate
01:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why is hammerin broken
01:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im clearly hitting on my screen but its just not
01:50 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
01:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and then when i do the playher jerks
01:51 < bridge> <Ewan> ur settings are off
01:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but i can see very clearly the hammer swings when im next to tee
01:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and its not hitting
01:53 < bridge> <Ewan> strange
01:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> rat bastard predict weapons was off for whatever reason

16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 ppl post stupid images of c size vs rust
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> so i present u the rust version of the bait

16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can tell most ppl critizising rust dont know rust at all
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> because they compare rust size vs a gcc, they forget the --release, etc
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> its like using gcc -g
16:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> also rust adds a shitton more debug info
16:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i will give it to u that with c its easier to make smol sized programs tho
16:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> but tis unfair to compare because rust is mostly statically linked
16:05 < bridge> <louis> u got ragebaited
16:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> i do xd
16:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk why i use x still
16:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> its all bait
16:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> the C community (like X community) is mostly about bashing rust than showcasing C
16:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> its hilarious
16:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> this is fake right?
16:19 < bridge> <learath2> I guess fmt being massive and panics requiring fmt and the possibility of a panic being usually present in Rust code contributes a lot to it's codesize. Combine that with everything being statically linked, and combine that with version mismatches of crates pulling in multiple copies of a crate and you get a language notorious for massive binaries
16:20 < bridge> <learath2> Now the modern coder would just say that oh, who cares about binary size, just get more ram, more storage 4hed. Which is sensible-ish, unless you are on embedded
16:22 < bridge> <learath2> It looks about right. It's rust code optimized for binary size on a specific version of rust vs just normal C code compiled with whatever default flags whatever version of gcc that is uses
16:22 < bridge> <learath2> It looks about right. It's rust code optimized for binary size on a specific version of rust not showing the flags used vs just normal C code compiled with whatever default flags whatever version of gcc that is uses

16:34 < bridge> <learath2> Here is the same test repeated with giving both languages the same amount of care and messing about with flags a little
16:34 < bridge> <learath2> I guess the biggest takeaway is that the flags don't matter all that much when both languages suffer from the exact same issue in this case that the flags can do nothing about, static linking
16:36 < bridge> <learath2> ```
16:36 < bridge> <learath2> learath2@l2gentoo ~/test $ rustc -C debuginfo=0 -C opt-level=3 -C lto=true test.rs
16:36 < bridge> <learath2> learath2@l2gentoo ~/test $ wc -c test
16:36 < bridge> <learath2> 1755128 test
16:36 < bridge> <learath2> ```
16:36 < bridge> <learath2> Here is rust with lto just to give it the same chance, I hadn't found the flag. So I guess rust benefits from lto much more since the std is massive

16:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> that said u can avoid all that if ur willing and just write to stdout manually
16:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> u also forgot strip
16:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> -C strip
16:44 < bridge> <learath2> I pretty much emulated exactly what they did in that picture for C for both Rust and C
16:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah ok
16:44 < bridge> <learath2> I can indeed get it muuch smaller for both
16:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is also a opt level for size
16:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> opt-level=s i think
16:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust
16:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> opt-level = "z"
16:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> codegen-units = 1 also help

16:53 < bridge> <learath2> anyway, this is a pointless competition, we can keep whittling this down all day and it'd prove nothing was my point
16:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> what was the page that showed the size to $ historical data
16:53 < bridge> <learath2> The binary size is something you have to consciously pay attention to or it'll be large, and if you don't pay any attention by default rust will give you larger binaries
16:54 < bridge> <learath2> If you do care about your binary size and optimize for it, Rust and C should give you about the same binary size proportional to the work you put in to optimizing it
17:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i tried everything from that
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> panic = abort is the only thing that helps a bit, if you combine it with stripping all text
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> panic text
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rest is only micro optimizations
17:04 < bridge> <chairn> can you try with statically linked c code ?

17:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> bruh 😭
17:31 < bridge> <learath2> rust bad frfr, brainfuck is the best language
17:31 < bridge> <hectavoxel> me when i need to make a program that adds 1 and 2 together (it ends up being 100 lines)
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```rust
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fn main() { println!("Hello World!"); }
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
17:32 < bridge> <hectavoxel> it panics
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd i hope not
17:34 < bridge> <learath2> x86 assembly even better, can make hello world in 40 bytes or sth
17:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1350145221345808475/image.png?ex=67d5ac39&is=67d45ab9&hm=86303fa341360976fa927cae992a38d609d1c680bb7f0c5e54be080ecc36ddf9&
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's not fair anyway. the os already provides you a console.
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> write own os first
17:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> programming lingo out of context
17:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> can be brutal
17:35 < bridge> <learath2> Actually in real mode you can probably stil print out to the bios provided console without any OS being there 😄
17:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> print with vga
17:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> or smth
17:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> with uefi its extra hard
17:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> but uefi is like a os itself
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the BIOS of my motherboard is 13MB
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
17:36 < bridge> <learath2> with uefi wouldn't it be extra easy to even have images? the efi framebuffer is much more powerful than whatever the bios provides
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> unfair advantage
17:37 < bridge> <learath2> Real programmers first make their own cpu
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well it's even 32MB
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ig that's simply the size of the flash storage
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> exactly
17:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it compresses to 13mb, so ig the real size is around that size too
17:38 < bridge> <learath2> yeah, many chunks of nothingness in those images
17:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i guess i meant understanding how ot use uefi
17:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> i havent looked into it but all OS dev tuts say use bios cuz uefi complex
17:40 < bridge> <learath2> oic

17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> when is it too many abbreviations?
17:47 < bridge> <hectavoxel> can we port ddnet into x86
17:52 < bridge> <learath2> Are we allowed to use libraries? 😄
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 wanna play ddnet
17:52 < bridge> <learath2> I'm about to have a call with a fren, then I'll make food, so not now, but I might play later if you still want to
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> oka
17:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> is this fren a girl
17:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> good luck
17:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
18:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> real developrs build their own pcs and compilers
18:02 < bridge> <hectavoxel> if you know enough x86 you wouldnt even need libraries
18:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> carry me on linear
18:02 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh yea
18:02 < bridge> <chairn> anyone know how i can build an image from a dockerfile ?
18:02 < bridge> <hectavoxel> @essigautomat when u get on remind me if i need to do anything else for slides
18:03 < bridge> <learath2> I only put my code on this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_rope_memory
18:03 < bridge> <learath2> no such luck
18:03 < bridge> <hectavoxel> cope memory
18:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> this is more efficient https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-core_memory
18:07 < bridge> <Assa> strong hook might be an issue for them, I might need to work on them again
18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki this also doesn't compile

18:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
18:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> something something dumping core
18:23 < bridge> <kollpotato> @ryozuki what version does irvm target?
18:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> @ryozuki what version of llvm does irvm target?
18:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> wdym
18:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i want to make multiple backends
18:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> rn the llvm backend is llvm 19
18:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> wait really
18:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> i thought just llvm
18:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> alr thanks
18:53 < bridge> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks I have an insane idea
18:54 < bridge> <learath2> We can get like 8k fps natively, let's do a version of ddnet where we render it at 480p internally, enable ai upscaling and modern frame generation
18:54 < bridge> <learath2> Insert 3 ai generated frames, to get a whopping 32k fps
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but sadly the upscaling ais have quite a bit of overhead
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> probably they cannot output more than ~500fps
18:55 < bridge> <learath2> sadge, then lets only generate extra frames
18:55 < bridge> <learath2> I guess even for that we already render too quickly
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i bought ryzen 9950x3d
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'll have 20k fps soon
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if my gpu doesnt bottleneck
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we can friendly ask amd support to give every teeworlds player a 9950x3d for free
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @kollpotato hello, do you still work on your project?
19:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: u here?
19:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: stop ignore bro, i know u readin
19:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> sadly no
19:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> it got in my list of unfinished projects
19:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> which is like 100+ projects
19:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> might get back when i have more rust knowledge
19:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> and development knowledge overall
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 🫠
19:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> AH YOU FUCKIN
19:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> THATS WHAT YOU MEANT WHEN YOU SAID SOON BETTER CPU
19:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> niceu
19:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> >:c
19:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> iwant it too
19:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> +1
19:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i guess no worth
19:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> rn
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not worth for both of u
19:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> going up from mine aint worth yet
19:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my cpu is from 2019
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's outdated 😏
19:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> from a 7900x3d
19:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Nothing really matters
19:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> anyone can see
19:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust matters to me
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> apparently it's around 100% faster than my current cpu
19:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just ate
19:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gonna be epyc
19:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> im turning german
19:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> i'd be going up from a 7950X
19:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> so yeah not worth sadge
19:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, u even have 7950x3d or not?
19:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> u need to wait till next socket
19:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> no 3d iirc
19:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> the gain is probs just 10% max
19:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> on phone tho, wife still occupies seat
19:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let me find your latest neofetch
19:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
19:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If you can run DDNet at 500 fps it's a good enough CPU
19:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks wilkommen to ddr5 ram and slow boot times
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u have slow boot times?
19:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> slow boot times? :o
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can disable it in bios
19:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk why i have slow reboot times
19:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> blame your ssd, i boot up in like ~4 seconds
19:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> boot time is ok

19:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got this enabled
19:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> do you use EXPO?
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> weird
19:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use expo
19:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> expo caused my motherboard to hate my RAM
19:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2x32gb @ 6000mt/s
19:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> which then made it take like 4 minutes <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
19:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
19:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> i have 32gb @ 6000 aswel
19:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> expo means long boot time
19:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> i have 32gb @ 6000 aswell
19:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> my ram is theorically amd compliant with the tech they use
19:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> i have 2x32gb @ 6000 aswell
19:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot the name
19:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> a-xmp ?
19:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> but my motherboard hates reboots
19:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> they take forever

19:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs it was the cheapest of the upper class
19:36 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> need open source firmware

19:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> debugging boot is a mistery to me
19:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> ask milkeey to help you
19:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> :Pepega:
19:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think if i dont OC my ram with expo its probs fine
19:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i want my oc ram
19:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> :p
19:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> i tried and didnt got to a point where i felt a difference in overclocking

19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf xD
19:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> me when `Unknown`
19:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> sudo dmidecode --type 17
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what latency does it have

19:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> its this
19:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> 200€ ram
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice
19:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> CL30 AMD EXPO & Intel XMP Memory Kit
19:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> i'm confused at speed: 4800 MT/s while configured is 6000 MT/s
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i have same latency and same speed
19:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> is your motherboard bottlenecking you?
19:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i doubt
19:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> My firmware now takes multiple seconds longer to boot than it did when I first got this device... :pepeW:
19:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> the chipset is the highest of the gen
19:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> odd
19:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think the chipset from jupstar is next gen
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there is also x870e tho
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the highest class
19:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I managed to optimize my boot time to under 5 seconds (according to systemd-analyze)
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 400€+
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pff
19:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> now just my firmware takes longer than 5 seconds
19:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i dont think there was x870e back then
19:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> when 7000 released
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> back then mb were like 40€ xdd
19:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> back in the good days
19:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> [  +0.268431] elogind-daemon[1970]: New seat seat0.
19:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> gentoo takes 0.26s to boot
19:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok idk how to see this
19:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> with openrc xd
19:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> how to show total time in dmesg
19:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> wtaf, loading the kernel into memory takes almost 10x as long as it used to
19:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok i think its 4s
19:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> like genuinely, it used to take like 20-30ms
19:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> because bootloaders are bloat and efi my beloved
19:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> last boot it took over 200ms??
19:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> well
19:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> u use systemd
19:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> come to gentoo
19:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> This is well before systemd!
19:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> This is before the kernel boots!
19:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> 👴
19:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's this laptop's doodoo-ass firmware
19:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> or sth
19:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> or maybe it is just my SSD not being that fast on that particular boot
19:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> since my best times were obviously recorded right after a reboot
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bg3 runs superb.. a game i'll probs play. let's see how much it will actually do on my hardware and linux xd

19:45 < bridge> <kebscs> rgb ram :justatest:
19:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If I really wanted to compare I'd just reboot a few times and look at the times after that
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tru gamer 😂
19:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but even then, the firmware is genuinely over 2s slower than it was when I got this damn thing
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/teeworlds-ddrace-teeworld-gif-24816713
19:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I generally dislike proprietary software for its lack of transparency
19:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and then proprietary firmware is that but turned up to eleven
19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> me too, but sadly i also love 20k fps
19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i have to decide
19:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> Could not find platform independent libraries <prefix>
19:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
19:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> any idea what that error is? - it builds fine :angy:
19:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> idk

19:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm malding because sub-1 second boot times are technically possible (ok realistically even best case I'd be looking for 2 seconds for an actual proper OS with proper hardware)
19:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I shouldn't even care that much
19:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> my uptime is 15 days rn
19:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but I optimized my boot times for sport and then this waste, this refuse, this GARBAGE software has the AUDACITY to slow them down to
19:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> *checks notes*
19:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 8 seconds
19:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 8-9 seconds
19:55 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ i am here
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Chiilller
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how about dis
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You make a bash wrapper called `bam`
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and it has same interface as bam but uses cmake internally
19:57 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> crapshot in progress
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> trick 17
19:57 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1741978633.png
19:57 < bridge> <meloƞ> god damn it.
19:57 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> did you send some important emoji in there?
19:57 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> looks like space
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no, it was simply 1 msg with 3 lines
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and 1 line empty
19:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i sometimes do that bcs my neighbour in primary school always did that
19:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes that is really the reason xD
19:58 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i dont think bam is great because of its cli interface
19:58 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i think bam is great because it can be built in seconds from source on a raspberry pi zero
19:59 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> the more build systems a project supports the more likely someone new knows one of the build system and manages to get it to compile
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oke
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how about meson then?
19:59 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> yes gimme all
19:59 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> its just your project already supports bam fully
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it's in pyson
19:59 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> my two prs would made a bit smoother
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and i hate pysorn
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but dont want to support it xD
20:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> you dont have to
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else u spam me with bam prs
20:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> unlikely but i understand it
20:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> your project your call
20:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> so lets leave it as is
20:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i have bam4 in my PATH at all times anyways
20:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> eventho ppl use bam 5 since forever
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xD
20:01 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i have it my own package manager
20:01 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ``crackman install bam4``
20:01 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ez
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :deen_star:
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do u see that emote chiller?

20:14 < bridge> <oxyzo.> <a:shiggy:1024751291504791654>

20:49 < bridge> <TsPiggy> nice
20:51 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> I have the cpu under
20:51 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> oui oui
20:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is it possible to have a memory leak which can't be detected by asan/valgrind? :\
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> Yes
21:01 < bridge> <Ewan> idk the circumstances but iirc there’s no claim of completeness in their checks
21:01 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s just way better than nothing
21:02 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, are you sure? ASan can miss leaks because it's shadow memory is not 1:1 but valgrind shouldn't be missing stuff
21:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i have only read the asan docs lol
21:03 < bridge> <Ewan> :brownbear:
21:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> can anyone find something related to automapper here -.-

21:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I give up, it's not a bug but a feature
21:17 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> yo bash enjoyers help me out here
21:17 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ``[[ "foo'" =~ foo"'" ]] && echo match1`` prints match1
21:17 < bridge> <hectavoxel> wtf is that
21:17 < bridge> <hectavoxel> it doesnt have a filetype
21:17 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ``[[ "foo'" =~ foo"'?" ]] && echo match2`` does not print anything?
21:18 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> isnt ? for optional in regex
21:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's just a text file
21:18 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh is that a crash log?
21:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> valgrind output
21:19 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ``[[ fooy =~ foox? ]] && echo fox`` i mean this prints fox ...
21:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 38k lines of nothing
21:21 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> got it 
21:21 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> thanks for nothing guys
21:21 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> ``[[ "foo'" =~ foo"'"? ]] && echo match3``
21:22 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> if you quote the ? it is no longer a regex but literal
21:22 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> you cant put it a single quote without opening a string unless its wrapped in a double quote
21:22 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> you can concat a regex with a quoted string without any operator into one big regex
21:22 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> obviously
21:24 < bridge> <hectavoxel> yeah i wish i knew how to read any of that
21:24 < bridge> <hectavoxel> if i did i would want to help
21:24 < bridge> <hectavoxel> because i wanna be the automap guy
21:25 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> its so cool we have a guy for everything
