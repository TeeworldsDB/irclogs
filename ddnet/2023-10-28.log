02:22 < bridge> <patiga> remember kids, `ivec2(env_indices.y)` is not the same as `ivec2(env_indices.y, 0)`

09:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
09:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> good morning
10:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> some random html ads platform filler game that happened to blow up.
10:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> pro
12:23 < bridge> <patiga> I swear its Godot
12:23 < bridge> <patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1167770535766269992/2023-10-28-122235_1920x1080_scrot.png?ex=654f560f&is=653ce10f&hm=d9e7f53856db2f5598a1116ac80a5205180846fb51b0a51a114f7c1bf4dd3b1a&
12:23 < bridge> <patiga> yea :)
12:39 < bridge> <cellegenrih> when map editor in godot
12:41 < bridge> <patiga> I considered implementing compatibility with the "Tiled" map editor https://www.mapeditor.org/, but envelopes would not be supported last time I checked
12:42 < bridge> <cellegenrih> envelopes are a different kind of difficult task
12:43 < bridge> <cellegenrih> we have animation trees and stuff to make anything we want (color, position, conditions, etc)
12:43 < bridge> <cellegenrih> but then it's very unsafe due to it running anything you give, even running different code
12:43 < bridge> <cellegenrih> but then it's very unsafe due to it running anything you give, even running different code (so nono on AnimationTree nodes)
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nais looks good already
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> any limitations in this format?
12:52 < bridge> <patiga> the tilemap borders, still ^^
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i c
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> btw do u plan to do something with this renderer? like do u plan to use godot physics or smth
12:53 < bridge> <patiga> I plan to integrate it with Zwelf's TwGame, which provides gamestate
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> which map is this btw?
12:54 < bridge> <patiga> dm1
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah lol true
12:54 < bridge> <patiga> very niche map xd
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the platform confused me
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it's actually in tha tmap xd
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it's actually in that map xd
12:56 < bridge> <patiga> TwGame can already process teehistorian and demos (I think). I hope that Zwelf will support a server connection somehow in the future
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but why godot is still the question
12:57 < bridge> <patiga> to get something running I think ^^
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like controls and stuff?
12:58 < bridge> <patiga> It's kinda hard for me to make progress in twgpu, maybe if I come back to it now, I'd make progress more quickly
12:59 < bridge> <patiga> it kinda just seemed like a fun project to do maybe
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does the engine perform well?
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> got any benches?
13:01 < bridge> <patiga> hm not yet, I'll take a look
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd also be interested in startup time
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when i hear godot i think of a monster engine u know xd
13:02 < bridge> <patiga> big maps are horrible in terms of load times, because the tilemap format is drastically different
13:03 < bridge> <patiga> the engine itself
13:03 < bridge> <patiga> I'd have to try out a release build I guess
13:03 < bridge> <patiga> hm, right
13:03 < bridge> <patiga> only in release godot will the rust code run in release mode
13:03 < bridge> <patiga> so it might not be that bad after all
13:05 < bridge> <patiga> I'll do parallax zoom, and do the other stuff after
13:42 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> @ryozuki can i build linux-6.1.57-gentoo without changing it on eselect kernel?
13:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> why
13:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> changing eselect kernel doesnt do anything important
13:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can do it without care
13:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> what r u scared of
13:43 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> breaking everything :cluess:
13:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> u cant
13:43 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> im very talanted at it
13:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> because u dont boot from /usr/src/linux
13:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> its just the source
13:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> it is installed somewhere else
13:45 < bridge> <blade67> @patiga public project?
13:45 < bridge> <patiga> not yet, will make it public tho
13:45 < bridge> <patiga> maybe simply today
13:46 < bridge> <patiga> it might just have given me enough motivation to continue with twgpu ^^
13:46 < bridge> <blade67> Is it just the map loader so far or more?
13:47 < bridge> <patiga> just map
13:47 < bridge> <patiga> you are welcome to extend it ^^
13:47 < bridge> <blade67> I just might do that
13:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> good morning
13:48 < bridge> <patiga> good morning!
13:48 < bridge> <patiga> slept well?
13:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> üåÖ
13:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> no
13:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @mr.gh0s7 didnt u do like tw in 3d?
13:48 < bridge> <patiga> :twintri:
13:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and i wasted a whole day
13:49 < bridge> <blade67> Ping or DM me when you've set up a repo, please
13:49 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah xD but it's not a public project cause it sucked. I hooked up to a normal client with fifos so it was really slow
13:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and i'm downloading that five nights of freddy's movie
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but was it also in godot?
13:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah
13:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> non public project gang
13:50 < bridge> <blade67> :gdamogus:
13:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I'm waiting for Patiga's implementetion so I can borrow the networking :)
13:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
13:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it sounds like patiga continues with twgpu
13:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> instead of godot
13:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> why would a map viewer need networking
13:51 < bridge> <patiga> I realized that I could do UI there as well using egui or smth
13:51 < bridge> <blade67> To make it a server/client
13:51 < bridge> <patiga> and I do like twgpu more still ^^
13:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
13:51 < bridge> <patiga> but I also kinda wanna learn some Godot, maybe participate in some game jam sometime
13:52 < bridge> <patiga> to make it a client :p
13:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh
13:52 < bridge> <blade67> Godot is great. Use it daily on my job, highly recommended
13:52 < bridge> <patiga> oi exciting, where do you work?
13:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean it's c++, just embed ddnet in engine
13:53 < bridge> <blade67> Small game studio, remote work
13:53 < bridge> <reitw> I'm so damn bad for getting game ideas, but Godot is really interesting. Have a friend who used to work with Unity & for what he does he was attracted by Godot also
13:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i honestly does not really like godot everytime i use it
13:53 < bridge> <patiga> is the project public or can't you tell?
13:53 < bridge> <blade67> Skill issue
13:53 < bridge> <blade67> Not yet
13:54 < bridge> <blade67> I did work on things like the Godot Modloader
13:55 < bridge> <blade67> And a collaboration addon that'll release later this year
13:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> unity sucks and cooperation and proprietary and all that. but it's so much work to extend the editor in godot for team use compared to unity. although unreal isn't really good on the editor part as well but at least they have a whole suite of in-house ready-to-go solutions
13:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> godot still got a long way to go :justatest:
13:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> at least the engine modules aren't too difficult to work with
13:56 < bridge> <blade67> I understand that extending some parts is hard, but the editor itself isn't one of them
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah lol
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is a different blade than the one i was thinking of
13:56 < bridge> <blade67> Ah, you talking core engine
13:56 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ikr
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> was like, wtf since when is he dev
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
13:56 < bridge> <blade67> Happens all the time
13:57 < bridge> <blade67> That's why on the official teeworlds server I renamed myself to "Blade."
13:57 < bridge> <blade67> Much more unique
13:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the other blade is still rocking stolen avatar of mine
13:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the other blade is still rocking the stolen avatar of mine
13:58 < bridge> <blade67> Checks out
13:58 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> oh lol blade isn't actually blade
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @DR.3AM hi, sry for ping
13:58 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I use irc mode so couldn't tell
13:58 < bridge> <blade67> Fine, I'll add the dot here too üò≠
13:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> imagine discord taking away the identifier numbers to make this more confusing
13:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> imagine 2 blades are typing
13:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh wait they did
13:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> confusion level > 9000
13:59 < bridge> <blade67> I can't even nickname myself
13:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> somehow i can
14:00 < bridge> <blade67> You may have permission since you're moderator
14:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh right
14:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> forgot about the moderator part
14:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i wasn't really moderating anything as you could imagine
14:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
14:01 < bridge> <blade67> Relatable
14:03 < bridge> <blade67> By the way @patiga did you do the implementation as a GDExtension?
14:04 < bridge> <patiga> yes, the map code is Rust
14:04 < bridge> <blade67> üò≠
14:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not again
14:04 < bridge> <patiga> the camera is Godot code though
14:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> everyone is using the fancy code that I can't understand
14:04 < bridge> <blade67> I swear to god
14:04 < bridge> <blade67> C++ is already hard enough
14:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i hate that I still can't learn rust
14:05 < bridge> <patiga> @blade67 you don't need to use Rust yourself though ^^
14:05 < bridge> <patiga> I just find it easiest
14:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> isn't rust binding still experimental
14:05 < bridge> <patiga> its community-maintained
14:05 < bridge> <blade67> I'd rather just port the code from C++
14:05 < bridge> <patiga> https://godot-rust.github.io/
14:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh cool
14:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> still have that yellow part of the readme
14:07 < bridge> <patiga> ah
14:07 < bridge> <patiga> > The public API introduces breaking changes from time to time. Most of these are motivated by new features and improved ergonomics for existing ones. See also API stability in the book.
14:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also a huge issue of rust for me is just how slow it is to use cargo in china
14:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not that npm is any better but i already know a few mirrors
14:08 < bridge> <blade67> Looks like I'll stick to my TS server implemetation for now
14:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> hi. my name is TS-Freddie
14:09 < bridge> <blade67> TypeScript, Freddie, TypeScript.
14:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo: i do love typescript as well
14:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i would take length to make sure everyone on my team at work knows typescript
14:11 < bridge> <blade67> That's fair. I mean, it gives code safety at least. Not on runtime but eh
14:11 < bridge> <blade67> Can always use zod for that
14:11 < bridge> <blade67> (Or similar)
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @patiga is it ez to compile?
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ur project i mean
14:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'd imagine it would just compile like any other cargo packages
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but with godot deps
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and godot has 200000 deps
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and the deps have 20000 deps
14:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think binding doesn't really need deps to compile
14:12 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Safety :kek:
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but how do i get godot? xd
14:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> download it?
14:13 < bridge> <patiga> yup
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i didnt invent linux to use my browser
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
14:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> use
14:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> sure
14:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> `scons .` and wait for 10 minutes
14:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> done
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
14:14 < bridge> <blade67> People actually have to wait that long for Godot to compile?
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @patiga so you challenge me to my tw version
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice
14:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean it wasn't that fast on my laptop
14:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for the first compile
14:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for the release build
14:15 < bridge> <blade67> Compiles in less than 2 minutes for me... then again I have a 16 core cpu...
14:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok i have 16 cores
14:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> should be fast af
14:15 < bridge> <blade67> Ya
14:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I have 8c16t
14:15 < bridge> <patiga> I'm on it üòé

14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 learn rust, we need to beat @patiga and zwelf
14:17 < bridge> <blade67> I still have to learn C++ properly, why do people go with rust now D:
14:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @jupeyy_keks are you not in the rust gang yet
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am quite good in rust already i think
14:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i have no idea how you would learn C++ properly either

14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> robyte and me vs patiga and zwelf
14:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
14:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and robyte when afk right after you tagged them
14:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and robyte went afk right after you tagged them
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he was like: shit here we go again
14:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> speaking of c++
14:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> asked our new hires and interns about what they use as textbook for cs
14:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> apparently the chinese c++ textbook that teaches you UBs as facts and quiz you on those is still in use
14:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
14:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xDD
14:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> never been in a chinese college but it's just funny that the old ass textbook is still around
14:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe it's only because no one bothered to write a new one
14:22 < bridge> <blade67> Anyone here has a minimal server implementation in any language that isn't rust? lol
14:22 < bridge> <blade67> I know there's a C# one
14:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ddnet's protocol code is technically in python
14:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
14:23 < bridge> <blade67> But that's only ddnet, right?
14:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it was like that since teeworlds
14:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and it was just a code gen so i guess it is still c++
14:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 when first team meeting üò¨
14:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i prefer to be in the winning team
14:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://github.com/search
14:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> since when did they had this search engine looking page
14:25 < bridge> <blade67> I really just need a barebones implementation üò≠

14:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> epic
14:45 < bridge> <chairn> wtf is that swap size?
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> believe it or not with 32 threads u can easily get over 32gb RAM usage while compiling üòÑ
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and yeah i tried some ML
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> next pc has to have 256GB RAM to be future ready üò¨
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> right i remember. i compiled the vulkan-validation-layers-git on arch and that actually went over 32GB RAM xd
15:04 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> when was last update release
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 2023-09-23
15:09 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Yay :poggers2:

15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> gentoo can do
15:10 < bridge> <robyt3> @deen We should update the credits for the next release, we got quite a few new contributors
15:10 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Can do what
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> panic apparently
15:12 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Thanks God there is old version otherwise it would ve joeover
15:12 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> gentoo can panic?
15:12 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> no wonder why ryozuki uses it
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wowo didnt want to start the 3rd world war xdd
15:15 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> theres only 1 place where i could do something wrong :thonk:
15:20 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> nop, its the same commands
15:20 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> whoopsie daisy
16:37 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> @ryozuki u never had a similar problem? :owo:
16:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i had kernel panics in the past
16:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> not now tho
16:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> when i used arch
16:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat r u using grub?
16:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u run the grub command after compiling and installing kernel
16:57 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> yep
16:58 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i ran grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
16:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> is ur fstab correct
16:58 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> eeehm
16:59 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> other kernels work
16:59 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> is it possible that its wrong?
16:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u configure it wrong
16:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> when u configure the kernel urself u need to know to enable some things
16:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> for example did you enable ext4 support
16:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> if ur partition uses ext4
17:00 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i just yoinked .config i had in dist kernel
17:00 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i though if it worked i can use that
17:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok ur on ur own
17:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> u shouldnt use gentoo if u dont understand and do research by urself tbh
17:02 < bridge> <robyt3> @patiga wth is wrong with this map you created for me at some point? it crashes the client when going ingame even on old client versions, somehow it tries to load way more sounds than exist in the map file
17:02 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1167840704161132654/testing_many_sounds.map?ex=654f9769&is=653d2269&hm=6ab46131eb117e19c0500cef3df82187b87f6a4b16ad2d33ca75cc0840a69996&
17:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> 1 google away literally https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Knowledge_Base:Unable_to_mount_root_fs
17:02 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i though maybe u had something similar and there's an easy way but sure ill be researching it myself
17:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> no i havent had this because i know how to configure my kernel
17:02 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> ok, thanks
17:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
17:03 < bridge> <robyt3> Somehow it works completely fine in the editor though
17:03 < bridge> <patiga> what was that map again? just a lot of embedded sounds?
17:03 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, in the editor I see 100 sounds
17:03 < bridge> <patiga> I'll take a look
17:03 < bridge> <robyt3> In the console when going ingame I see
17:03 < bridge> <robyt3> ```

17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat do u have a initramfs
17:04 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like it tries to find more sound items in random regions of memory
17:04 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> forget it, ill fix it myself üôÇ
17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok
17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats the chad gentoo way
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat btw i recommend u keep a usb with a live gentoo, so u can fix ur install in case u cant boot, u do the same when installing, u mount the filesystem and arch-chroot
17:09 < bridge> <patiga> the map itself seems totally fine to me, so I'm not sure
17:09 < bridge> <robyt3> The crash log is random each time, look like memory corruption :monkaS:
17:10 < bridge> <patiga> have you checked if there is some hardcoded limit for sounds somewhere? the client also only allows 64 images before it shows random textures last time I tried it
17:10 < bridge> <robyt3> oh
17:10 < bridge> <robyt3> :kek:
17:10 < bridge> <robyt3> `int m_aSounds[64];`
17:11 < bridge> <patiga> :hey:
17:11 < bridge> <patiga> welp, time to add another check in twmap I suppose ^^
17:11 < bridge> <robyt3> that explains why `std::vector<CSourceQueueEntry> m_vSourceQueue;` was getting corrupted
18:33 < bridge> <blade67> Can anyone help me understand the data part of map files?
18:34 < bridge> <robyt3> https://dontasktoask.com/ üôÇ
18:36 < bridge> <blade67> ..? I didn't ask to ask, I asked...
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you asked to help for your following questions to be answered
18:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Do you have a specific question? A good starting point would be reading https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/doc/map.md and then ask about things that are not clear
18:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Do you have a specific question? A good starting point would be reading https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/doc/map.md and https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/doc/datafile.md and then ask about things that are not clear
18:42 < bridge> <blade67> I'm just not sure how the data is split up
18:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> chinese chatters have a old habbit of asking others "are you online?" before saying anything else
18:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I hate those
18:43 < bridge> <robyt3> What do you mean with "split up"? Do you mean how it's layed out in the file?
18:44 < bridge> <blade67> Yes
18:44 < bridge> <robyt3> All data elements are written to the file on after the after
18:44 < bridge> <robyt3> And the file positions are stored in the datafile header
18:44 < bridge> <blade67> I have the item offsets and the data offsets but I'm not sure how they get me each data element
18:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> If I ever forget about that link I am gonna write: "Hey I need help". :kek:
18:45 < bridge> <blade67> I assume the data elements are from data_offset[n] to data_offset[n + 1] ?
18:47 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, but map version 4 also stores the item sizes in the header
18:48 < bridge> <robyt3> I can't really give you the details immediately either, I just read the reference implementation (i.e. `datafile.cpp`)
18:49 < bridge> <robyt3> The indices are set up in `CDataFileReader::Open`
18:49 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, but map version 4 also stores the data sizes in the header
18:50 < bridge> <blade67> So this should be correct
18:50 < bridge> <blade67> ```py
18:50 < bridge> <blade67> buffer = data_buffer.slice(data_offsets[x], (data_offsets[x + 1] if x + 1 < data_offsets.size() - 1 else header.data_size))
18:50 < bridge> <blade67> ```
18:50 < bridge> <blade67> Note that I'm implementing this in Godot
18:53 < bridge> <blade67> But when I try to compare the data element's size to the data_sizes I just get
18:53 < bridge> <blade67> ```
18:53 < bridge> <blade67> data_elements: [[216, 224, 223, 75, 106, 0, 0, 0, 15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [], [216, 224, 223, 75, 106, 0, 0, 0, 12, 0, 0, 0], [], [216, 224, 223, 75, 106, 0, 0, 0, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0], [], [216, 224, 223, 75, 106], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]
18:53 < bridge> <blade67> data_sizes: [15, 4194304, 12, 4194304, 13, 5767168, 5, 152, 152, 2432, 152, 304, 36000, 40000, 40000, 40000, 40000, 40000]
18:53 < bridge> <blade67> ```
18:53 < bridge> <patiga> xd
18:53 < bridge> <patiga> wait
18:53 < bridge> <blade67> So something's wrong somewhere
18:54 < bridge> <patiga> you are reimplementing the map parsing in Godot now? :wtf:
18:54 < bridge> <patiga> is data_buffer the entire file, or the segment which contains the data items?
18:54 < bridge> <patiga> the data offsets are not absolute in the map file, they are relative to the start of their segment
18:54 < bridge> <blade67> Segment, or at least it should be
18:54 < bridge> <patiga> so the first data offset is always 0 iirc
18:55 < bridge> <patiga> ah right
18:55 < bridge> <patiga> zlib compression
18:55 < bridge> <patiga> data size is the uncompressed size
18:55 < bridge> <patiga> *decompressed
18:56 < bridge> <blade67> I mean, should be `data_element.append(buffer.decompress(data_sizes[x], 0))`
18:57 < bridge> <patiga> I don't know what all those variables and function parameters are, but it looks about right
18:59 < bridge> <patiga> usually slice functions are exclude the last element, so maybe `[x]` instead of `[x + 1]`, might ofc be different in godot
18:59 < bridge> <patiga> so now you are implementing the import process of maps in godot? ^^
19:00 < bridge> <blade67> ya
19:00 < bridge> <patiga> well firstly: gl, cool project
19:01 < bridge> <patiga> secondly: why? there happens to already be a relatively new implementation of that :p
19:04 < bridge> <blade67> Yeah buts its in Rust
19:04 < bridge> <blade67> I want complete access to it
19:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :HammyShock:
19:05 < bridge> <blade67> I effectively transfered this project to Godot but getting stuck at roughly line 100
19:05 < bridge> <blade67> https://github.com/edg-l/teelib/blob/master/teelib/map/loader.py
19:05 < bridge> <blade67> Specifically the check at line 114
19:07 < bridge> <patiga> what kind of access are you looking for? pretty much everything should be possible with it
19:07 < bridge> <blade67> Doesn't really matter if it does, I always prefer native implementations
19:08 < bridge> <blade67> In my TS implementation I have exactly the same issue btw
19:08 < bridge> <patiga> could you show your code?
19:08 < bridge> <blade67> Which part?
19:09 < bridge> <patiga> the whole code, or the part where you think that the error is
19:09 < bridge> <blade67> ```
19:09 < bridge> <blade67>         var map_data : Array = []

19:10 < bridge> <blade67> ```
19:12 < bridge> <blade67> Let me push it to github real quick
19:14 < bridge> <patiga> what is this for?
19:14 < bridge> <patiga> ```
19:14 < bridge> <patiga> if data_offsets.size() < x:
19:14 < bridge> <patiga>     buffer = data_buffer.slice(data_offsets[x])
19:14 < bridge> <patiga> ```
19:15 < bridge> <blade67> Honestly, didn't think about it, just converted the python code :KEKW:
19:15 < bridge> <patiga> the code until the assertion would be helpful
19:20 < bridge> <blade67> Here https://github.com/Blade67/TeeworldsGD
19:21 < bridge> <blade67> The file in question is in lib/map/Loader.gd
19:22 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> why blade 67 :feelsbadman: could you add add at least 2
19:22 < bridge> <patiga> hm, have you somehow verified that the code up until that point is working correctly?
19:22 < bridge> <blade67> Postal code of the region I grew up
19:23 < bridge> <blade67> Given that that is the only point where it fails, I would say so, yes
19:25 < bridge> <blade67> Ima have to take a break here tho. Been at this since this morning and haven't eating yet \:)
20:19 < bridge> <blade67> Note that all the results I get up to that point are identical to my TS implementation, however, the TS implementation doesn't handle data yet
21:06 < bridge> <patiga> @blade67 at which index is the assertion failing?
21:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> first time u didnt post your cat
21:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
21:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @patiga r u finished already with ur project?
21:09 < bridge> <patiga> ah true
21:09 < bridge> <patiga> I did parallax zoom before dinner
21:10 < bridge> <patiga> now on to trying to export the project and testing performance
21:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> epic
21:10 < bridge> <patiga> if you want to already take a look I can push first
21:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tomorrow vanila gameplay? then ddnet 2.0 the day after tomorrow
21:10 < bridge> <blade67> 1
21:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no it's better if you test it first xd
21:32 < bridge> <blade67> If you could validate with your implementation that the values are correct or even remotely similar, that'd be cool @patiga
21:34 < bridge> <patiga> You could try out https://ide.kaitai.io/# with https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/690e8ea95880aaaf2329bd33fc5131e8d6e6cbd5/doc/datafile_v4.ksy, its basically a binary viewer, however with struct support. With the second file you can parse datafiles and view the entire data
21:34 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ddnet 2.0 sounds more like a buzzword now
21:38 < bridge> <patiga> I haven't spotted anything with the code, the decompressor seems correct too
21:39 < bridge> <blade67> That is super cool, thanks!
21:46 < bridge> <patiga> @jupeyy_keks it performs really bad zoomed out and it can't handle big maps with my implementation, I would guess that it doesn't like big tilemaps
21:48 < bridge> <patiga> on normal sized maps it performs well, you gotta judge yourself there (I'll upload in a sec)
21:48 < bridge> <patiga> apparently I did the tileflags not quite right, they are sometimes rotated wrong, but no big deal
21:48 < bridge> <ar1gin> hallo devs üëã
21:48 < bridge> <patiga> I tested on dm1 and Tutorial, both of which don't have rotated tiles xd
21:48 < bridge> <patiga> heyo :)
21:50 < bridge> <ar1gin> yet again i am here seeking for a little help üëâüëà, could anyone familiar with `wgpu` help me find the problem with textures please? :owo:
21:51 < bridge> <patiga> I have some experience with wgpu
21:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Don‚Äôt ask to ask
21:53 < bridge> <patiga> @jupeyy_keks https://gitlab.com/Patiga/ddnet-godot
21:53 < bridge> <ar1gin> anyways, my `Surface` supports only `Bgra8Unorm`/`Bgra8UnormSrgb` formats but all my code is designed to work with `Rgba8UnormRgba`, the code worked perfectly yesterday and i am losing my mind over this :pepeH:
21:54 < bridge> <ar1gin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1167914329820123146/image.png?ex=654fdbfb&is=653d66fb&hm=85fbe25266a4bb8fccaf5296bccfe67b72cd3095938eae0eff5b8a7699c7af8e&
21:57 < bridge> <patiga> ah, can you just pass `Some(Rgba8UnormSrgb)` to the `RenderPassDescriptor`?
21:59 < bridge> <ar1gin> render pass uses the format i specify in my `SurfaceConfiguration`?
21:59 < bridge> <ar1gin> i don't provide any format to the pass
21:59 < bridge> <ar1gin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1167915677160591431/image.png?ex=654fdd3c&is=653d683c&hm=d9524d621abf375cdde33265386777bb5c246dddedfc70f5df02a6e3969293bc&
22:00 < bridge> <patiga> I'll take a look at how twgpu does it
22:01 < bridge> <blade67> btw @patiga I found my issue. Now it's just the last entry that is 1 byte short for whatever reason
22:02 < bridge> <ar1gin> but again, this code worked perfectly yesterday, and now my gpu doesn't support the format anymore????? also when i force the backend to opengl everything works as usual, except that opengl sux
22:02 < bridge> <ar1gin> anyways, thanks for listening :heartw:
22:03 < bridge> <patiga> https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/struct.FragmentState.html#structfield.targets
22:05 < bridge> <patiga> in the twgpu code, I let the user pass the target format of the surface/texture which it should render to. it needs to be set in the `FragmentState` and also in the render pass creation by the looks of it https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/struct.ColorTargetState.html#structfield.format
22:05 < bridge> <patiga> do you do that?
22:06 < bridge> <ar1gin> nope
22:06 < bridge> <ar1gin> my code is basically a modified version of tutorial, with support of multiple passes with different materials
22:06 < bridge> <patiga> ah true, not in the render pass creation
22:07 < bridge> <patiga> but I think whenever you create a render pipeline with FragmentState, you need to pass the TextureFormat of the target surface
22:07 < bridge> <patiga> and depending on the backend, the format of the surface might be different I guess
22:09 < bridge> <patiga> you didn't update dependencies since yesterday? the inconsistency is still weird
22:09 < bridge> <ar1gin> how the hell does this work, do i have to convert every single image to bgra now?
22:09 < bridge> <ar1gin> uhh
22:09 < bridge> <patiga> no
22:10 < bridge> <ar1gin> the vulkan driver package broke 2 days ago and i rolled back
22:10 < bridge> <patiga> you only need to set the correct target textureformat
22:10 < bridge> <ar1gin> weird, the introduction didn't account for that...
22:11 < bridge> <ar1gin> the code is just like "put rgba everywhere, it'll be fine"
22:12 < bridge> <patiga> well surfaces usually have Bgra afaik
22:12 < bridge> <ar1gin> what??? who even uses that
22:12 < bridge> <patiga> monitor maybe, I dunno
22:12 < bridge> <ar1gin> bruh, why is everything else is rgba then...
22:13 < bridge> <patiga> https://www.reddit.com/r/vulkan/comments/p3iy0o/why_use_bgra_instead_of_rgba/
22:13 < bridge> <patiga> first comment first two sentences:
22:13 < bridge> <patiga> > It is quite common that the display controller in your GPU works with BGRA, not RGBA. So you get your swapchain images in the format that can be displayed so there's no extra hidden conversion needed.
22:13 < bridge> <patiga> but you don't really have to worry about that
22:13 < bridge> <patiga> like I said, you only need to add that textureformat to your targets in your FragmentStates
22:14 < bridge> <ar1gin> hmm, okay....
22:14 < bridge> <ar1gin> thanks for the help ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
22:14 < bridge> <ar1gin> i have a lot to learn
22:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why, we have 3 different ddnet implementation competitions
22:15 < bridge> <patiga> @jupeyy_keks I got sidetracked by the question. you only need to run cargo build in the rust directory and then open godot with the godot directory
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
22:18 < bridge> <ar1gin> im gonna do the 4th
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how do i load a map?
22:19 < bridge> <patiga> oop forgot
22:19 < bridge> <patiga> as command line argument
22:19 < bridge> <patiga> but only after `--`
22:19 < bridge> <patiga> ah
22:19 < bridge> <patiga> well
22:19 < bridge> <patiga> if you are in the godot editor
22:19 < bridge> <patiga> then you can only change the string in the main.gdscript file
22:20 < bridge> <patiga> but if you somehow manage to export
22:20 < bridge> <patiga> then you can do it as a command line argument `./DDNet.x86_64 -- path/to/map`
22:21 < bridge> <patiga> up until the end I only ever changed the script
22:21 < bridge> <patiga> exporting was clicking around a lot and downloading some 800MB first
22:21 < bridge> <patiga> Project -> export
22:21 < bridge> <blade67> ```
22:21 < bridge> <blade67> Loader.gd:73 @ load(): Current index: 2112   Data size: 583393   Buffer size: 585504   Last entry: 245   Expected entry: 218
22:21 < bridge> <blade67> ```
22:22 < bridge> <blade67> It doesn't copy the last byte for whatever reason
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah doin that rn
22:23 < bridge> <patiga> now that I think about it, it didn't actually use the rust release build on my machine coz I never compiled that :thonk:
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok worked
22:24 < bridge> <patiga> noice, sounds like you managed that faster than me :p
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i simply renamed release to debug xd
22:26 < bridge> <patiga> xd
22:27 < bridge> <patiga> you could also edit `godot/rust.gdextension`, but by the look of the file it should already use release on release builds o.o
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1167922738216841256/image.png?ex=654fe3cf&is=653d6ecf&hm=cefadfe6d945135f4e75a006c6a938f58ab7fd5e4d7c2ca921750b23bf112740&
22:28 < bridge> <patiga> woohoo! it also runs on not-my-machine ü•≥
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> now i try arctic frost
22:34 < bridge> <patiga> we'll never hear from our dear Jupstar again, their computer exploded üò¢
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my mouse cursor is gone xd
22:35 < bridge> <patiga> an not only captured by the window?
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> uff
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> moving the camera makes it drop fps hard
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1167924662790013038/image.png?ex=654fe59a&is=653d709a&hm=4822034c4cd5875add9f406a1c67bf8c37e09d22d1919f8a13b8356c0686a824&
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> < 30fps
22:36 < bridge> <patiga> and on the normal zoom level?
22:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it has glitches btw
22:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1167924874103230577/image.png?ex=654fe5cc&is=653d70cc&hm=fda712926d3f50cbbe5de4c001ca2aa8839a554fc548918460ca643a09afe4c0&
22:36 < bridge> <patiga> yeye, some tileflags are wrong
22:36 < bridge> <patiga> but I didn't bother to fix
22:36 < bridge> <patiga> should be ez tho
22:37 < bridge> <patiga> I think on rotation I need to toggle h+v-flip
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ~320 fps when not moving
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1167925052948353145/image.png?ex=654fe5f7&is=653d70f7&hm=43d607122d1aa9a0ff5dec1c27b416266e87c7f873d6dff716e80f1d30329e51&
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but moving = rip
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> < 30 fps always
22:37 < bridge> <patiga> and with moving <10?
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> moving <30fps, else 300fps
22:37 < bridge> <patiga> ah
22:37 < bridge> <patiga> well that ain't playable :D
22:38 < bridge> <patiga> well, let's just change the gameplay to celeste-style
22:38 < bridge> <blade67> No more errors! :HYPERS:
22:38 < bridge> <patiga> the camera is always static and we switch scene when the tee crosses the borders
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 2.2GB RAM usage
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ~400MB VRAM usage
22:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> check out the very nice kaitai struct thing @patiga made
22:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's probably really helpful in understanding how to read datafiles
22:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, already suggested üòÑ
22:40 < bridge> <blade67> It was! He sent it to me just earlier and it helped a lot!
22:40 < bridge> <blade67> In the end it was just a single byte breaking everything üôÇ
22:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @patiga btw release vs debug makes almost no difference
22:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1167925908087263232/image.png?ex=654fe6c3&is=653d71c3&hm=1e2d23932f3f15bb4f044bd7de566bc828fcbd96c0ccca056e155fa24f9b61c1&
22:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> basically same fps
22:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> guess the bottleneck is inside godot
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when using ddnet i get ~5k fps (without mangohud) and ~2500 fps with mangohud xdd
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so it's probably better than shown
22:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> didn't know that overlay is so expensive to render
22:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but ofc it won't make the 30fps better üòÑ
22:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> mangohud?
22:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
22:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's that? üôÇ
22:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the overlay in the screenshots
22:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud
22:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, cool üôÇ
22:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but too expensive xd
22:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess i'll use mesa hud instead
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS=VK_LAYER_MESA_overlay ./binary
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also drops frames tho
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok the minimal mangohud is faster
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1167928877469925406/image.png?ex=654fe987&is=653d7487&hm=1ac96d9f3f332ab0cea34344542dd7dbf73650a0c1c5e22f374e04223612f693&

22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but they still drop over 1k fps xd
22:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i just watched the fnaf movie
22:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dd-pg vs godot vs ddnet
22:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>

22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i have health hud disabled on ddnet
23:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> which i can't rn on dd-pg üòÑ
23:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what is ddpg
23:00 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> ddnet pog
23:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> teeworlds in rust
23:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> is there a dd-pg-13
23:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no what does the 13 mean?
23:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> american fsk/usk
23:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> parental guidance or so?
23:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah
23:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that
23:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> "Parental Guidance: Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13 to 15."
23:02 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> can you see servers in ddnet?
23:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> funny, deen said postgress xd
23:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i call it playground
23:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs im a kiddo
23:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
23:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> im old
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> don't remind me that i am old
23:11 < bridge> <patiga> hm, I kinda hoped that Godot itself would also run faster on release :/
23:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> im23
23:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so is the engine itself also built in debug mode?
23:12 < bridge> <patiga> I have no clue about that
23:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
23:14 < bridge> <patiga> and are you satisfied with the startup time? ^^
23:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xdd
23:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> totally
23:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tbf, ctf1 starts quite quick
23:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> did you export it
23:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the export templates are release builds
23:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
23:18  * ChillerDragon hehe heinrich gone
23:18  * ChillerDragon chiler home alone
23:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you know if the debug exports also use release built of the engine?
23:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> then ye it was release build
23:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> (i didnt use it, but i am curious)
23:19  * ChillerDragon axaxax censor free chat
23:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the export is literally copying compressed game data beside a prebuilt engine
23:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's how the engine works. it's just a player
23:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so if the export template is release then the build is release
23:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the editor does not build another engine core.
23:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> unity does the same thing actually
23:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> well i guess the gdext can be unoptimized if you tell godot to load a debug lib. i was talking about godot itself
23:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
23:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i also only meant godot itself
23:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> as for gdscript, literally pure vm no jit, so....
23:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :nouis:
23:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so basically precompiled?
23:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> WASM
23:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
23:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they should use WASM
23:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> instead of an own script xdd
23:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> honestly, they probably didn't really find a vm language that supports operator overloading other than c# so they just made one up
23:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and then gdscript doesn't have operator overloading itself
23:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they just made everything a built-in type
23:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or did it tho, i should double check
23:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it didn't
23:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also gdscript is really confusing about the built-in types
23:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lots of stuff are built-in, basically all flat data that lives in stack are builtins
23:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> including Vector3 etc.
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am never sure about learning a new language
23:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but the documentation still treats them as classes
23:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but you cant new them, and assign operator does different things to builtin vs non-builtin but they are all classes.
23:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the documentation never told you when assign is by valve when is by reference
23:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and you'll just have to assume, bcs they are all classes
23:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
23:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and it`s 5am
23:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> gn

23:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably depends on what you want to do here
23:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for food then chongqing is a start
23:47 < bridge> <ikeed> something special, not the stuff that people visit in hoardes, you know
23:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for culture, literally any third-tier city could do
23:47 < bridge> <ikeed> oh yeah food is relevant
23:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> yun nan might be fun but if you are like me who think mountains are just montains then probably not
23:48 < bridge> <ikeed> what so special about food in chongqing? iirc food in china is incredibly spicy
23:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> chongqing is the spicy place
23:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so ye
23:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also how about moving this convo to #off-topic
23:50 < bridge> <ikeed> i am not afraid of getting banned of all things but yeah sure
23:53 < bridge> <blade67> Silly question, but embeded images should always be 1024x1024, right?
