09:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > A flaw in the design of the Apple Silicon ‚ÄúM1‚Äù chip allows any two applications running under an OS to covertly exchange data between them, without using memory, sockets, files, or any other normal operating system features. This works between processes running as different users and under different privilege levels, creating a covert channel for surreptitious data exchange.
09:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
09:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The vulnerability is baked into Apple Silicon chips, and cannot be fixed without a new silicon revision.
09:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gg apple
09:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The only mitigation available to users is to run your entire OS as a VM.
09:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
09:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Poking fun at how ridiculous infosec clickbait vulnerability reporting has become lately. Just because it has a flashy website or it makes the news doesn't mean you need to care.
09:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess its not that bad
09:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
09:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://mastodon.sdf.org/@kline/106299403921451814 the freenode takeover started for real now
09:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> > creating a covert channel for surreptitious data exchange
09:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it's not a bug, it's a feature üôÇ
11:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> how to get my client id on server from client side in code
11:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's displayed in ctrl-shift-d so check the code for that
11:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or for cl_show_ids 1
12:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki maybe the lesson should be to read before you repost üòÑ
12:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> this is a bit confusing
12:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/847054676062502912/unknown.png
12:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yep
12:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @uwu in gameclient.cpp: m_Snap.m_pLocalInfo->m_ClientID
12:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> thx but what about 
12:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu>  m_Snap.m_LocalClientID
12:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> this must work to i think
12:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> maybe
12:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> perhaps
12:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> this must work too i think
12:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm not sure if that's the same id honestly
12:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but sounds reasonable, you can try
13:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <I_amigo_I> –∫—Ç–æ –∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ç—å –ø–∏—à–∏—Ç–µ –≤ –ª—Å
15:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Knew it was a matter of time before he actually started stopping people. Rich people never change
18:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://lwn.net/Articles/857252/
18:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 shits on fire https://www.gentoo.org/news/2021/05/26/gentoo-freenode-channels-hijacked.html
18:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://archlinux.org/news/move-of-official-irc-channels-to-liberachat/
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah great way to ensure everyone skips town
18:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They were really stupid with this
18:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is that even legal xd
18:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Btw whoever owns our channel on freenode should probably just kick everyone and close it
18:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think they dont care about ## yet
18:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk who owns it
18:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not even connected to freenode now :D
18:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They did seize ##hntop
18:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
18:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But it‚Äôs not that they would seize our 5p channel. It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôd rather not be associated with these clowns if possible
18:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> üëã
18:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe heinrich owns it
19:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no one owns it afaik, but there are only 3 matrix users in that room except for me and the bridge
19:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd kill the bridge on freenode once matrix access is ensured (e.g. by matrix working with libera.chat), effectively making that channel obsolete
19:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are working on it iirc
19:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
19:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it triggers me a bit that the irc bridge highlights me on the username
19:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i don want to mute it if someone says Ryozuki
19:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> add <, > to the list of characters that don't break words
19:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (that's how I solved it, at least)
19:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on weechat?
19:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u know how to do it i appreciate it
19:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://gist.github.com/TheFlyingCorpse/c7486531ea74ef897220e0eef4edcc0f
19:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe this works
19:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#option_weechat.look.word_chars_highlight
19:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> test
19:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yay
19:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that worked
19:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thanks
19:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess its not a default because some irc clients use this to highlight users?
19:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not a default because < isn't really considered a word character, I think
19:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
19:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is just a hack to fix the highlights üôÇ
19:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> test Ryozuki
19:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok nice
19:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> test passed
19:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw the wiki main page has been accessed 13,151 times.
19:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> according to the plugin

21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> hello which command i need to move all my new work to another branch with git
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> branch with work = origin and empty branch = newb
21:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is it staged already?
21:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> yes
21:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> unstage it, stash, git checkout newb
21:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> stash apply
21:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> lmao i dont know how i create master and origin
21:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/847199657197043742/unknown.png
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> this is wierd
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you aren't using CLI?
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> yes
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well gl i know nothing about graphical github interfaces lol
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> when i try to git checkou main and after push that said an error
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> idk what the error is
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> can you post it?
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> yeah wait
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> hmm that said `git push --set-upstream origin main` or something like that
21:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> fatal: The current branch origin has no upstream branch.
21:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use
21:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> 
21:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa>     git push --set-upstream origin origin
21:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> idk what branches you want but
21:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> should probably just refer to main
21:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://tenor.com/view/over-it-leave-me-alone-fuckoff-stressed-gif-15243809
21:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> did you run git push --set-upstream origin main ?
21:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> sure
21:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and when you git push -u ?
21:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> Everything up-to-date
21:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
21:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> but 1 files are missing
21:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ok i will sleep, im pretty sure tomorow everything i need will be move in main branch
21:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> :troll:
22:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> just @ me when you wake up :D
22:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao i found how modern discord bots work
22:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/847208987531149332/unknown.png
22:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
22:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> nice
22:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u type /
22:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can select the command and from which bot it is
22:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont need $ anymore
22:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/847209238164930610/unknown.png
22:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so there is API for registering commands for autocompletion?
22:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> how new is this?
22:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
22:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u dont need weird prefixes
22:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its some months old i think
22:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah so much better
22:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> cool
22:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no more help pages
22:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Ryozuki make it for ddnet
22:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont like python much
22:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can do it
22:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i can do it
22:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> uses d.py i assume?
22:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> or maybe you could fix /swap
23:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 @deen 
23:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I would like to test the http server info too, what has to be done on server side?
23:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I hope it fixes problems related to DoS on my server
23:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's no server side to it yet @fokkonaut
23:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's just the next step
23:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How is it going to look like tho? I saw some PINGEX stuff in the server code, for example
23:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What will change for the serverinfo on serverside
23:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> everything works the same way for servers for now
23:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's now the masterserver that contacts you for server info
23:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> via the same protocol as clients did before
23:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so i can simply only send out serverinfo to the master?
23:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and not to anyone else?
23:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but the masterserver might not have an easily identifiable IP address, it's behind a proxy so the actual IP address isn't disclosed
23:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the next step‚Ñ¢ will fix this properly
23:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Will I need curl or stuff like that? I dont have that in my 0.7 codebase
23:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it'll require https (e.g. by using curl) for the next step
23:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the backwards compatibility will remain, so you don't have to change anything
23:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> fuck xD
23:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> eh
23:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what do you mean by that? I want to specifically ONLY support the http serverinfo
23:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you wont see my server in the serverlist currently via DDNet client, you have to verify your IP address manually first in order to be able to see the server or to connect
23:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (via https://f.zillyhuhn.com)
23:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can try only responding to the masterserver (but I can't make guarantees about it not changing)
23:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How would I do that?
23:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> block info requests from everything but what you believe the masters IP address is
23:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And how do I "believe" this?
23:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can tell you its current address, but I don't know if it'll change or not
23:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Okay, thanks
23:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 193.27.14.89 @fokkonaut
23:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks
