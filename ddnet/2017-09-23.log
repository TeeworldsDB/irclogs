10:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> "To run the tests, you have to install GTest"
10:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> what is gtest?
10:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ah
10:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> libgtest-dev
11:14 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Ryozuki opened pull request #874: Add instructions to run tests in README (master...patch-2) https://git.io/vdJjd
11:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i think there should be a way to disable ci tests on readme and files that don't participate when compiling
12:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> I got a question. Lets say person a has rank 1 and person b has rank 2. But then person a gets an eveb better rank. Will the rank get overwritten or will person a have rank 1 and 2
12:41 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> You only have one rank per name
12:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Ok
12:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Will person b then have r2 oder r3
12:42 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Rank 2
12:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> And when u do /top5
12:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Will he be listed at 2 oder 3
12:43 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> 2
12:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> So rank gets overwritten
12:43 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Yes
12:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Completely
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Your old times are saved, you can look them up with /times <name>
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Ok
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> K ty
13:43 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki what do you mean, disable CI tests on readme?
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and other files that dont participate on compile
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> hello
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> like the 3 tests done automatically
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> when you make a pr
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> i'm back 👋🏻
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> gi
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> hi
13:48 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Hey
14:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> !!!!! @CookieMichal  ❤
14:42 <+ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> 😃
17:08 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki I don't really understand what you mean
17:08 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> do you want to remove the badges from the readme?
17:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Maybe we should have labels in issues? Like client, feature, bug, server, network
17:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?
17:10 <+ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> 👍🏻
17:10 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> does it have advantages?
17:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> arrangement ?
17:13 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: he means disable the CI tests on files that don't change compilation
17:14 <+Learath2> don't think I've seen any option in any of the CIs so we'd have to roll our own
17:15 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: doesn't seem worth the complexity
17:15 <+Learath2> most prolly, not like we have a limit on the amount of CI jobs we run
17:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yeah to complex i guess
17:16 <+ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> [ci-skip] ?
17:16 <+Learath2> nor does it take too long, except for travis which takes half an hour to find us a mac
17:16 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you can just merge before the tests pass if you want to disregard them
17:16 <+Learath2> yeah you can add [ci-skip] in your commit message but don't think we need to
17:16 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it's not like they're blocking
17:24 <+ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> u can trigger build only on tags
17:24 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but it's helpful that they trigger on pull request – we want to see if there's a compilation error
17:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> Who supports Trashmap here?
17:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> Failed to change setting because an error occurred
17:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> [Map]This error wasn't caused by you, please contact a server administrator to fix the problem
17:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ger is laggyt
17:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Dr. Jekyll its @timakro
17:50 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> @Dr. Jekyll is your map file larger than 2mb?
17:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> yes
17:50 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Then it won't work on trashmap, 2mb is the limit
17:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> The maximum file size is 5MB. The filename has to end with '.map'.
17:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> " "
17:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ger is lagging D:
17:52 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> The text is wrong then :p
17:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> K :[
17:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> 2MB maps? ^^
17:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> wow, are we living in 99 ?
17:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😮
17:53 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> <grumpy grandpa> back in my day, maps over 100KB were considered big
17:53 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> I'd say >1mb is big nowdays
17:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> 5169k map :[ (trimmed to 3979)
17:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 1mb is big nowadays?
17:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> where are we living 😮
17:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> well, if it is useless? 😃 we could probably optimize it a bit
17:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, we can optimize everything and its fine!
17:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but 1mb isn't that much xd
17:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> we went over this, its not optimizable
17:55 <+ddnet-discord> <timakro> zaf or ger?
17:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Dr. Jekyll sorry, I don't mean your map in particular,
17:55 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Savander you can make good looking maps with 300kb or so easily
17:56 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but the map format
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> the format is fine
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> More compression! 😄
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <timakro> @Dr. Jekyll zaf or ger?
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> ger
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> No i mean, that in general. 1mb is not a big deal. We have enough transfer, space
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Dr. Jekyll how can you say that the current format is fine if you haven't heard the proposal for a better format? ^^
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> to store thousands maps >1mb
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you have to transmit them to the clients as well
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> It's also about downloading them
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Not only space on server
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> tbh I don't know what percentage of ddnet traffic is map downloads
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i said, enough transfer, proper connection speed
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> traffic isn't free, @Savander
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> hmm actually envpoints aarent compressed so maybe it could be better
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i know, but i bet
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you won't reach limit
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> If you have to download with a bad connection 1mb can take a while 😄
17:59 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I was talking about server traffic
18:00 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> server traffic isn't free
18:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what do you mean by server traffic? Up/Down ?
18:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or maybe i missunderstood what you are trying to tell me
18:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😄
18:00 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> map downloads is what the server sends
18:00 <+ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> bandwith costs
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> bandwidth costs
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but [5:58 PM] heinrich5991: tbh I don't know what percentage of ddnet traffic is map downloads
18:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i know that bandwidth costs, but nowadays providers gave you a big amount of bandwidth
18:03 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> IIRC we had at least one country where we didn't have all too much traffic
18:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> especially for downloads, try to use OVH. Unlimited traffic
18:03 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> we can't choose servers freely ^^
18:04 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> we have a lot of different constraints, especially around attacks
18:04 <+ddnet-discord> <timakro> @Dr. Jekyll fixed on ger
18:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i know, but ovh in my opinion is good for storage systems
18:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> anty ddos, unlimited trafficc, not big costs
18:05 <+ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> this talk is going to end nowhere
18:05 <+ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> pls stop
18:05 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you can throw money at problems
18:05 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> or you can try to optimize it at a different level
18:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> Fixed how limit up to 5 ?
18:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> throw money at problems? Just choose proper hosting before 😄
18:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but right, you can optimize it at different level, didn't say that
18:06 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> have you seen how hard deen had to work to find a proper server?
18:06 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> more constriants don't help with that
18:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> @timakro  still getting error on a 3979kb map
18:06 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> have you seen the struggles to find a server that doesn't throw us out the moment we get attacked?
18:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I know,  i was here since 2014
18:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but im not talking about gaming servers, only about web servver
18:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and if i understand, maps are downloaded via http
18:07 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> by ddnet clients, true
18:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> most of them are ddnet, no?
18:07 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes, most of them are, I think
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> <timakro> huh, just tested a 2.8m map
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> @timakro  Then what's it testing for validdation? " If the uploaded file is no valid map the server can't run"
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> it runs onlocal server
18:16 <+ddnet-discord> <timakro> can you send it to me
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Hm
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> on solo, ghost resetes every passing of start line
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but time not
18:28 <+Learath2> @Savander we used to run servers on OVH before, iirc their anti-ddos didn't do much for us
18:43 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> This is fixed in my ghost PR 😀
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😮
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Push it!
19:12 <+Learath2> what are we pushing?
19:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/869
19:15 <+Learath2> It's a big PR I haven't tested it thus I won't be applying it until I do :P
19:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> : <
19:16 <+Learath2> Not even sure if it's a good idea for everyone
19:16 <+Learath2> does everyone want a recorder behaviour change?
19:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> request has a week 😄
19:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> should be discussed
19:17 <+Learath2> record on tee spawn, stop after 20s(quite arbitrary imho) if race didn't start?
19:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Not that bad, since on race
19:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> the behaviour before startline is important as well
19:19 <+Learath2> but for ddrace it's quite useless
19:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ghost is more usable on race
19:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> shorter races, smaller changes in time
19:25 <+Learath2> would be nicer if we could keep record on start behaviour on ddrace and optionally enable record on spawn with 20 cutoff on race
19:25 <+Learath2> but yeah i've seen some weird behaviour from the recorder before so it def needs fixing
19:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i agree
19:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> do people share ghosts?
19:27 <+Learath2> also idk how we check for race_start and race_end but might be a nice idea to have game messages for events like this
19:27 <+Learath2> might actually be cute to have the #1 ghost stored on the servers to be downloaded along with the map
19:27 <+Learath2> could see how your run compares to rank1
19:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> how are you syncing the ghost playback when YOU cross the start line, if theres an undetermined glength of time before the ghost crosses the start
19:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, good idea
19:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> anyway, that 20s  cuttof
19:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> is not only for demos?
19:29 <+Learath2> Savander god knows, as said I never tested it :P
19:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :
19:30 <+Learath2> @Dr. Jekyll also god knows as idk how we get the race_start event at all
19:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> @redix god
19:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> tel us
19:30 <+Learath2> we probably try to infer it from server time suddenly changing to 00:00:00
19:31 <+Learath2> and as we start the ghost recording from the same event, i'm guessing it lines up
19:34 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> if available it uses the race timer (stored in the warmup tick) to determine the race start
19:35 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> otherwise it searches for the start line. if it is non solo the race will restart on every start line touch
19:35 <+Learath2> warmup tick == 0 => race didn't start?
19:35 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> end is determined by the finish message
19:36 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> some flag is set when the race is running
19:37 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> but in general it would be nice to have some netmessages to determine race start and end
19:38 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> right now the code directly writes the ghost data to file. do you guys prefer to flush all data at the end of the race instead? 😄
19:41 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> i could remove the 20s at the beginning of the demo if it is a non solo server. but having the few secs before race starts at the beginning of each demo should not be a disadvantage i think
21:05 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: do you think FetchFile maybe belongs in engine.cpp along with HostLookup?
21:12 <+Learath2> or anyone else familiar with the code ^^ :P
22:37 <+ddnet-discord> <RayB.> <@&293541515781996568> Hello, 
22:37 <+ddnet-discord> <RayB.> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/612
22:37 <+ddnet-discord> <RayB.> As a part of this project, Dr.Jekyll & me are working on a tutorial map together. I asked timakro sometime ago if he could add a feature like the information tile for quads. Basically an image (animation in this case) which shows up when u stand on a specific tile. Since he isn't able to do it bcs of a lack in time. I wanted to ask if here is someone up to implement it. Thanks in advance.
22:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> What with this ?
22:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> turn quads on and off
22:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> conditionally
22:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Ravie> basically animation triggers which everyone wanted since forever but never got 🤔
22:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> i could probably do it
22:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Ravie> well you could just make clever use of paralax and clipping 🐱
22:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> triggerable clipping?
22:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Ravie> no, just use paralax and clipping in a way that if you stand in for exampel a range of 5 tiles it shows up
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <RayB.> With the amount of animations which we need to show up this isn't considerable expect we use 100 groups.
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> ye
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ravie> 100 is not that much
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ravie> ever looked at journey man in editor
22:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> eeeh do you actually need animations ot be revealed?
22:49 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vdUV0
22:49 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master b7f4ab4 def: Move comment
22:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> it looks kinda cluttered when they are all all going on at the same time
22:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I can't really see how you'd do sth like animation triggers without the code looking horrible
22:50 <+ddnet-discord> <timakro> the code in that pr looks horrible already
22:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> deen: Is there sth like forward-declaration for a typedef?
22:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> trying to avoid an extra include if possible
23:19 <+Learath2> did we change something about how we build in 10 series?
23:20 <+Learath2> none of the prebuilt clients after DDNet 9.3.1 work for me
23:20 <+Learath2> http://paste.pr0.tips/TT
23:21 <+Learath2> if I build any of them myself it works
