05:18 < bridge> <Tater> @Ryozuki why do rust projects get an insane number of github stars relative to their usefulness
09:29 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Because they are BLAZINGLY FAST
09:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and safe af
09:30 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
09:48 <+ChillerDragon> @Mr.Gh0s7 where do i run this? from a tty or from gnome?
10:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ?
10:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> most are rly useful
10:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but well stars dont mean much
10:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> did u see these repos with lists of js npm packages
10:59 < bridge> <Learath2> Because rust is cool and hip
11:02 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ChillerDragon: from terminal
11:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my gnome terminal in gnome?
11:03 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ye y not xD although I don't have a DE so not sure
11:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok doesnt work
11:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> alr ima nuke gnome sec
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> hm in a tty it also doesnt run
11:05 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> does it throw an error or smt?
11:05 < ws-client> <chiller@dwm> on gnome it says compositor alr running
11:06 < ws-client> <chiller@dwm> on tty it cant find display
11:06 < ws-client> <chiller@dwm> and on dwm it just does nothing xd
11:06 < ws-client> <chiller@dwm> i assume its running now
11:06 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah
11:06 < ws-client> <chiller@dwm> what does it do i dont get it
11:07 < ws-client> <chiller@dwm> ?
11:07 < ws-client> <chiller@dwm> ups i slipped xd
11:07 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> it makes your desktop look nice but the `picom --backend glx --no-vsync` should use glx as backend but not sure for what xD. I just found that it boosted my fps so I thought I would mention it for you to try it out
11:08 < ws-client> <chiller@dwm> look nice?
11:08 < ws-client> <chiller@dwm> i dont see any difference
11:08 < ws-client> <chiller@dwm> how should it look?
11:08 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> do you have something against my favorite npm package is-odd
11:09 < ws-client> <chiller@dwm> my fps are unaffected
11:09 < ws-client> <chiller@dwm> but im actually happy with my 3k fps now
11:09 < ws-client> <chiller@dwm> i have enough fps to do whatever i want
11:09 < ws-client> <chiller@dwm> my game is smooth while recording on 4k and having minecraft open in the background

11:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ez
11:13 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ye or arandr (gui for xrandr)
11:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> gui is bloat
11:13 < ws-client> <chiler@dwm> pog gui
11:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so xrandr
11:14 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I mean the siplicity of gui is nice if you want to mess with stuff. But it's bloat.
11:14 < ws-client> <chiler@dwm> omg azaing
11:14 < ws-client> <chiler@dwm> arandr is awesome thanks for the share
11:15 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ;)
11:15 < ws-client> <chiler@dwm> everybody at work uses these xrandr commands
11:15 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> fake!
11:15 < ws-client> <chiler@dwm> like in a meeting just to flex
11:15 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD
11:15 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> (for chiller (fake! was a reply to jup))
11:15 < ws-client> <chiler@dwm> WaIT leT me WriTe aScrIpT tO CoNneCt mY laPtoP tO ThE cOnFerEncE ScReeN
11:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :kek:

11:17 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :justatest:
11:17 < ws-client> <chiler@dwm> !ryo i do not have a bindsym command o.O
11:17 < ws-client> <chiler@dwm> lets runn main from a terminal then xd
11:18 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> it's L from DN with math equations. I had it and I liked it bcs it white-black
11:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye i know
11:18 < ws-client> <chiler@dwm> how do i fullscreen a pane in dwm?
11:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my name comes from death note
11:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ryuzaki
11:18 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> but what did pi refer to?
11:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the image has pi
11:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
11:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i just woke up dont mind me :justatest:
11:19 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> well most math equations do so I got confused
11:20 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> btw Chiller for screenshot I use shotgun. Like `shotgun screenshot.png`
11:21 < ws-client> <chiler@dwm> i use ``crapshot`` but i was wondering how to bind it to a key
11:21 < ws-client> <chiler@dwm> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1685265481.png
11:22 < ws-client> <chiler@dwm> anyways this is how ass my setup looks
11:22 < ws-client> <chiler@dwm> how to make it hot like urs?
11:22 < ws-client> <chiler@dwm> and i cant get my fakin browser bigger xd
11:22 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :). Mine looked like yours yesterday. But I changed it also yesterday
11:22 < ws-client> <chiler@dwm> wowo pro
11:23 < ws-client> <chiler@dwm> ok fak dis ima head back to gnome land
11:23 < ws-client> <chiler@dwm> rq
11:23 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> rq xD
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea one more question
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> how do i exit dwm? xd
11:24 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> well shortcuts are configured in dwm/config.h (btw I didn't know how to customized it yesterday bcs I just had zogtib's conf)
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> last time i did it really ugly
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> so i have to restart my wm to update shortcuts?
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> like i recompile my terminal to increase the font? xd
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> its fun and cursed at the same time
11:25 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah but it compiles instantly
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> ye ikr
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> thats so pog
11:26 <+ChillerDragon> most of the pain is restarting it
11:26 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> but ye if you restart dwm (after recompile) it throws all of the windows in the active screen
11:26 <+ChillerDragon> it keeps the windows?
11:26 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> which is why when I configured it I only had 2-3 windows open
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> so how do i logout of dwm? xd
11:27 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> hmm lemme see
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> even openbox had rightlick logout
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> how do you?
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> i can not tell which is less bloated dwm or openbox
11:27 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I just press win+alt+f4 (a zogtib's script)
11:28 <+ChillerDragon> ok thenn ill go with ``kill -9 $(pgrep dwm)``
11:29 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD
11:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> worked like a charm
11:29 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I don't know which was the default keybind because mine is heavily patched from zogtib
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what is a zogtib
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and where can i buy your config?
11:30 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> @gotroyb
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is he a tw player?
11:30 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> my config is not upstream
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> should i know him?
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> send ur repo
11:30 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah he's my big brother
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or riot
11:30 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :pepeH:
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what skin does he play?
11:31 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> he changes names but his mains are kj, ENOTME, ecp4 (or smt)
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cring name changer
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no wonder i dont know him
11:31 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD
11:32 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> you do know him in github I think https://github.com/gotroyb127
11:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maim best
11:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i kept this uber cring name for a decade but at least ppl dont have to keep track of ma name changes
11:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes maim pog
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I mean ``crapshot`` is just a wrapper around main to support different OSes and auto upload to zillyhuhn.com for irc share
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/gotroyb127/deeworlds
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i know this
11:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ;)
11:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> anyway I found the keybind to quit dwm. It is win+shift+q
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> good to know
11:35 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I tried it out and it works (also closed all my windows in the process :kek: )
11:37 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> > how to make it hot like urs?
11:37 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> > send ur repo or riot
11:37 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> gimme a sec
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> omg st is also so bugged
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> i can not delete via ssh xd
11:37 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD my st is also heavily patched but idk in which parts
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> i guess everyone is supposed to patch in what they need
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> and enjoy minimal bloat due to having bugs in all sectors that they do not use on a daily basis anyways
11:51 < bridge> <ReiTW> @Ryozuki Just a question when using cargo, it will just return the git repo of the crate you want to use right ? For eg I want to use a specific crate, I see its git repo, I can be sure it won't be something else when using it in a project
12:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont get ur question
12:04 < bridge> <Chairn> says the guy executing a command to change his screen setup
12:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what
12:05 < bridge> <Chairn> well, terminal is a gui
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😂
12:05 < bridge> <Chairn> if you think this is bloat, please make sui (sound user interface)
12:05 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> tui (telepathic user interface)
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "The graphical user interface, or GUI (/ˌdʒiːjuːˈaɪ/ JEE-yoo-EYE[1][Note 1] or /ˈɡuːi/[2] GOO-ee), is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based UIs, typed command labels or text navigation."
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> from wikipedia
12:07 < bridge> <Chairn> then it's more than just graphic because it already includes audio
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I guess one could say: we don't have a better word
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to describe what we actually mean
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> HCBUHPOSS - Hide complexity by using human perception of simple stuff

16:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> epic
17:14 < bridge> <cyberFighter> is there a list of libraries to download
17:24 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller you need compositor for transparency effects and blurs and efficient rounded corners and stuff
17:25 < bridge> <Ewan> this is by virtue of kwm’s compositor
17:26 < bridge> <Ewan> picom is just standalone
17:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see
17:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so compositor is bloat

17:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cyberFighter ^
17:30 < bridge> <cyberFighter> thanks
17:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you are on windows just get linux
17:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> as in real linux, wsl or the msys thingy for windows
17:32 < bridge> <cyberFighter> oh theres no wifi on that pc
17:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> F
17:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wif is crap anyways use a cable
17:32 < bridge> <cyberFighter> no cables rn :justatest:
17:33 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i can only download through phone, then send it to pc
17:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cable to phone?
17:33 < bridge> <cyberFighter> yeah
17:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my iphone can hotspot my debian laptop via cable
17:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> probably ur devices can do that too
17:35 < bridge> <cyberFighter> oh lemme see if i can
17:47 < bridge> <zogtib> lmao
17:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :p
17:49 < bridge> <zogtib> "zogtib" is the "official" ingame name I use and I generally play only solofng/dfng by different names most of the time (that means always)
17:50 < bridge> <zogtib> st actually is not patched
17:51 < bridge> <zogtib> perhaps an installation issue? terminfo entry not being used?
17:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea i fixed with setting TERM=xterm
18:00 < bridge> <zogtib> You can have `st` can use other font launchtime by setting its `-f` option, it also has keybinds for incrementing/decrementing font size runtime.

18:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh nice
18:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but not ctrl and +
18:03 < bridge> <zogtib> man-page says `Ctrl-Shift-Page Up/Down`
18:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what a fucked default
18:34 < bridge> <cyberFighter> chillerdragon it works
18:34 < bridge> <cyberFighter> ez
18:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pog
18:37 < bridge> <cyberFighter> time to write that long ass command manually
18:38 < bridge> <cyberFighter> :troll:
18:45 < bridge> <cyberFighter> is there a difference in sudo apt and sudo apt-get?
18:47 < bridge> <cyberFighter> oh damn it didnt find any packages wtf
18:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sudo apt update
18:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> both work fine apt-get is nicer for non interactive scripts and apt is less to type and more interactive
18:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so use apt
18:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dont write manually just copy paste
18:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cyberFighter why are u even compiling ddnet on a device w out internet what u hacking on?
18:58 < bridge> <cyberFighter> still no packages
18:58 < bridge> <cyberFighter> also its an old af pc
18:58 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i just wanna see it run ddnet
18:59 < bridge> <cyberFighter> like the newer versions

21:37 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> the sec is over (as in I finised it ⌛ ). I have a problem though ```warning: adding embedded git repository: slbuilds/dwm

21:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I created the repo in github and added the files but haven't pushed anything because of the above message though?
21:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Does anyone have any ideas?
21:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> should I create a new repo on github named `dwm` add the slbuild as a submodule with  `git submodule add <url> slbuilds/dwm`? I don't know how submodules work but it seems like that they would.
22:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
23:06 < bridge> <cyberFighter> jeez how many chars is that in those screenshots
23:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ?
23:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@cyberfighter)
23:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh the issue yea
23:22 < bridge> <cyberFighter> the issue
23:22 < bridge> <cyberFighter> sorry

23:44 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> searching it seemed that the main cause is a very large file but the largest file is in `dwm/.git/objects/pack/pack-<numbers>.pack` which is 5.9MB
23:47 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> searching in the internet*
23:52 < bridge> <Chairn> seems like it's working
23:53 < bridge> <Chairn> are you sure you're looking the correct branch on both github and lcoal
23:53 < bridge> <Chairn> are you sure you're looking the correct branch on both github and local?
23:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I created a branch with `git branch Inateblig` I switched to it with `git checkout Inateblig` I applied my changes `git apply mynew.diff` and then `git remote add Inateblig https://github.com/Inateblig/dwm.git` followed by `git push -u Inateblig Inateblig`
23:56 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> btw the repo on https://github.com/Inateblig/dwm is empty
