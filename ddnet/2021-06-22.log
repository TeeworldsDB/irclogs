00:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <tela> Disgusting
00:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie that's seriously cool
00:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does it do, exactly? 🙂
00:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> to me, only the second and third controversies hold up
00:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the third is a mistake, second is just ridiculous and they need to change it
00:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> 4th one is more complicated
00:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> the first one is fine?
00:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> games installing kernel drivers..... 😄
00:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh i dont think it's fine, but im willing to write it off as a mistake or malpractice
00:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> one they say they've corrected (?)
00:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I read that they only "corrected" that the kernel-mode anticheat lingers after the game was closed
00:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes
00:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 do you know whether we also serve 0.7 maps from https://maps2.ddnet.tw/ ?
00:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 idk, but we probably don't, 0.7 clients don't have http download

00:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <n0b0> seems legit
00:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> Yeah and it's friend Sophie was paid so must be 100% true.
00:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Aw, I clicked delete .1 too late :feelsbadman:
00:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> some Matrix scam? 😄
00:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> =]
00:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> Skeithi you did good =]
00:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Wasn't me lol
00:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> twas me o/
00:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> That's like the 3rd or 4th thing like that, should probably do something to prevent stuff like that somehow? :justatest:
00:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> ok then Learath2 who holds Learath1 and 0 in basement did good.
00:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> Skeith I don't think you will be rly able to do anything about this. On ddmax forum we had plenty of bots but we made a very simple solution. When making an account you had to answer a question related to ddmax. Can be anything for example "what is the name of DDracemaX server starting on letter n" easy and simple and people who play the game knew it.
00:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> After that we had no bots =]
01:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie in fact that's so cool, I really wanna talk to that person. do they speak english? ^^ some of the comments are in english 🙂

15:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 or @Learath2 do u know why so many projects dual license mit and apache 2.0 instead of using just 1? im curious about this
15:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> specially common on rust
15:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in*
15:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or on
15:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never know
15:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
15:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Requiring both MIT and Apache 2.0 as inbound licenses for contributions means that anyone making a contribution is providing the Apache 2.0 patent grant. And then having MIT and Apache 2.0 as outbound licenses people can use Rust under means that Rust provides widespread compatibility with all sorts of other FOSS licenses, including GPLv2.
15:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see
15:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/rationale-of-apache-dual-licensing/8952
15:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> What can't they combine them to make a new license name for it
15:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @TsFreddie u then have to have it approved by OSI or FSF
15:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> long process and not worht i guess
15:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (so it has recognition)
15:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Why did I type what instead of why
15:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I must had a stroke
15:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you smell toast?
15:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> was that a common symptom or what
15:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, people that have strokes regularly report smelling toast right before
15:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> interesting
15:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I guess chinese don't eat toast enough to have a connection
15:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Funnily enough it's almost always toast. Other phantom smells are associated with brain tumors
15:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if there is another smell people in cultures without toast associate it to
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I do smell smoke like at the time because I have rhinitis
15:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I get that too, I wonder why that one is
15:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ~~dehydration~~
15:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I know another interesting phantom smell thing. Some types of migraines cause them
15:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a friend who swears it smells of bananas when she has a migraine
15:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I just learned what migraine means cool
15:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I don't know if I have that but I do get headache like once a month.
15:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Migraines are very weird too. Some people get ocular ones. You get heavily distorted/glitched vision
15:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> but I don't smell anything during it I guess
15:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I get toothache when I have it
15:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Phantom smells are extremely uncommon in migraines
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it responds to painkillers its likely not a migraine, very few actually do
15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I never took any painkiller
15:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ~~I just bang my head on the wall~~
15:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay that is one I dont get. We have been using painkillers for a millenia. Why avoid those? :D
15:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Cause I can't recognize them and I'm way to lazy to go to a proper pharmacy for them
15:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 😅
15:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you need to go to a pharmacy like once, then you have a box at your home :D
15:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I should note that down or I'll never remember to go to one.
15:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean I get headaches every week so maybe its way less annoying when its only once a month or so
15:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Also wouldn't it be really bad if it isn't migraines
15:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cant afford to lay in bed for 4 hours everytime I get one
15:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wym, migraines are tortuous, you definitely would prefer any other type of headache :D
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> But like if you have regular headache but not migraines, wouldn't it be a tumor or some nerve damage :justatest:
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nooo. Those are so uncommon
16:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> The one time that someone might have some idea about why I have headaches, I was in the US and my health insurance is expiring.
16:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Stress headaches, ocular strain and muscular ones are so much more common
16:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I just went to get a pair of new glasses. The guy checked my eyes and just said you get headaches a lot don't you.
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That reminds me I need new glasses
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> And I didn't finish the following check up because my health care expired. The first few checks took like three months then I just graduated...
16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Then I went back to china, and the doctors here have 0 clues about what it might be.
16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <markwillow> Sit at home and make cool money in crypto currency , here I"m earning $500 daily and $3500 weekly.

16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> bad bot

16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <matrix-appservice-discord-t2bot> **ERROR:** No users matching markwillow found
16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Meh
16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Lol
16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Cool
16:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Would it stay in irc tho
16:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well just go to an optometrist and get your eyes checked?
16:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> After I payed my insurance I guess
16:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I thought china had very socialized healthcare
16:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> If you have a job yes
16:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, really? That sounds so american :D
16:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> come to scotland and get free eye test
16:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Well the price ain't outrageous like America even if you don't have insurance.
16:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> But still. Having one is better
16:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 😅
16:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, sounds a bit like the turkish model
16:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Highly socialized healthcare, very little cost at point of care, which gets down to 0 if you are employed
16:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Bruh I really should have did it there. I was in Scotland for a year and I didn't use any of the nhs service.
16:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (And if you are rich you can just take out private insurance and go to private hospitals which charge american rates)
16:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> NHS Scotland easily tops the rankings in europe, one of the best operated socialized healthcare systems
16:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I honestly don't really get how our society works. Probably because I never asked anyone about it, plus I don't have a job
16:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i read somewhere that the brain itself cannot feel pain
16:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I recently read about singapores healthcare system and they seem to have hit such a great balance
16:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :justatest: I was going to signed by the ddnet ripoff in July. So that might change tho.
16:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie congrats on the job!
16:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, but it can interpret other things happening to it as pain
16:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Congratz \○/
16:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Thanks, although I'm not really sure if I would like it there.
16:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie make sure to backport all their good ideas to DDNet 😄
16:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you dont you can always resign :)
16:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 😅 we'll see.
16:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Well it's a unity mobile game. it's probably going to be a lot less sophisticated than ddnet anyway
16:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <LCSG47> @Learath2
16:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @LCSG47
16:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> And sounds like they want the mmotee model on the side for the 💸 . Like material grinding and home building and stuff
16:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <LCSG47> I love you :lcsg47Love: @Learath2
16:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, they have to make money I guess
16:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Who doesn't love @Learath2
16:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :ddnet_lgbt:
16:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeeeee, capitalism baby, wooo
16:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mobile games = ez mony
16:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking they'd sell skins or hats tho. Much easier to implement
16:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Chinese mobile game market is actually pretty saturated.
16:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @TsFreddie but there is trillion of ppl in china
16:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i hear they have a mobile no matter if they are poor
16:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i dont know if its true
16:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Probably
16:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet, qq is huge, no?
16:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Tencent is huge in general
16:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Both qq and WeChat are tencent product
16:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the trick is to make a mobile game u can play with 1 hand while the other is holding while u are on the metro
16:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> So do the most popular mobile games.
16:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tencent is probably one of the strongest companies to be on earth, maybe right after the dutch west india company
16:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I played a cute mobile game recently. Mini Metro. Oddly fun, havent played anything on mobile since it got plagues by candy crush clones and raid shadow legends
16:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Tencent is insanely out reach in any field other than financial
16:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/havent/hadn't/
16:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> BiggerNouis is best mobile game
16:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I thought mini metro is a PC game
16:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It has a pc version too but such a simple game is so well suited for mobile
16:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I guess BiggerNouis does meet the criteria of single hand usage.
16:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> So the trick aren't really working my dude
16:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> the trick is advertising
16:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just noticed I'm trying to spend time here so I dont have to study physics
16:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll take my leave, gratz on the job @TsFreddie
16:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> 5% budget for game 95% budget for advertising

17:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice, so around 2 nuclear reactors xD
17:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> oof
17:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or more
17:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dunno
18:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probs depends on the power plant
18:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I think they were in Sichuan because they were using hydro power
18:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but before we at 100% renewable its still wasted it some way
18:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> China doesn't have many nuclear power plants iirc?
18:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> coal
18:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just like germany

18:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Lol
18:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Do you think they were actually trying to improve it
18:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the problem isnt that china isnt trying
18:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its just, that chinese ppl are getting rich
18:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and need more energy
18:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> US people still use much more energy per citizen
18:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I can't imagine how hard they have to try to manage.
18:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they really need to abuse the chinese deserts more
18:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> solar is cheap af
18:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I'm actually curious how they are burning more coals and rid of the haze in big cities at the same time.
18:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ~~maybe they are burning coals in the desert instead~~
18:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its probs cheap to use existing generators and just move them to a new house
18:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so they just move them xd
18:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Prob

18:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Now it is still bad but at least I can see the blue now
18:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i cant even imagine how awesome it would be in germany if there wouldn't be any fossil cars anymore
18:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> clean air, what a life quality
18:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> The first morning in the US blew me away for real.
18:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I was in Eugene Oregon. Probably one of the best air quality place in the US
18:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Allegedly
18:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you never been in a smaller town in china?
18:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i assume there are also better examples
18:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even before 2019
18:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Not until this year
18:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok, crazy
18:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> hebei kid has like no time for anything other than schools
18:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah, i think i saw that in some docu xD
18:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> south korean style
18:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> The education scene is like hardcore mode. You do 6 to 10 daily, no weekend. Less holiday, more off season classes and still can't get in a better college than a average kid in Beijing.
18:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> does that even make you a better student xd
18:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when im tired im dead basically xd
18:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Maybe, who knows. I skipped highschool for some other program with Programming stuff
18:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tbh i think within the next 100 years there will be a revolution in china
18:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Still pretty competitive but at least it's more about stuff that I can relate to.
18:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but dunno. i feel like creativity is also very important
18:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> whats the sense in knowing everything if you cannot connect everything
18:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Anyway I blew all of my education and went to US instead
18:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :kek:
18:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ez, and us was too ez for u
18:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs u suddenly could do what u want xd
18:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I like how usually people went abroad to get a better education. I went because I suck
18:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 😇
18:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lol
18:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> still worth it.
18:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> people don't usually know that I go to US because I can't get in any college in china. And somehow I'm the cool kids now
18:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie how accurate are western docus about life in china xd
18:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> idk
18:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> What's the gist of western docs
18:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> dude dont go to murica
18:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> they have the worst education
18:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> too late
18:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> they think europe is a country
18:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie well i only know german/french ones
18:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
18:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> e.g. this is a current one that has alot of views within 1 week:
18:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnQwBTHP4io
18:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> my one year master in scotland isn't any better tho. Probably because of the pandemic tho
18:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its about men having no woman bcs of the 1 child policy of china
18:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and that there a men that litteraly buy women from indonesia wtf
18:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for 10k$ or smth
18:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I think we are opening it up to 3 kids
18:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> And they really want you to have three now
18:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but trade with humans
18:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> imagine what would happen in western countries
18:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Hmm
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> go for it
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I mean.. it's definitely doable
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> insane xd
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> But I don't know if many actually go for that route
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> But I'm a city boy.
18:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Don't know much about the countryside culture
18:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do you think city china is more open?
18:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like give a fuck about tradition and stuff
18:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Oh there are definitely people who still care about traditions and superstitions
18:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well all i hear from china is always control control control
18:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> social apps, ppl that control reporters etc
18:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> But I think the stereotype is that they come here from the countryside
18:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Because they can get benefits from the city with a countryside status
18:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> like lower scores required for college and monetary support
18:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Don't know why that is tho
18:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> My family is pretty open.
18:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ~~Although I haven't told them I'm gay and see how that goes.~~
18:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
18:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I mean news media do must be owned by govs to go on newspaper or tv
18:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> But not many still watch tv these days. So they might be getting more serious about controlling social media and blogs and stuff
18:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <57117 | widoson> я считаю что киви это лучшый фрукт
18:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> English only please. You can speak other languages in #off-topic
18:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its just hard for me to imagine that ppl just accept it
18:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> here they go on streat for every shit xD
18:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> go to russia for education xd
18:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Also personally. Doesn't really bother me. I get info from many sources. And because I can read English, I get to consume western media, but the reality is, most of the time sources either copy and paste the same narrative and conflict with Chinese media and you can't really tell who's right and what is actually happening that you'd be better off just give up and do something else.
18:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Unless it's news like Pluto exploded, mostly likely media has pretty obvious conflicting information that are only visible if you read both sides.
18:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :tee_thinking: so why even bother. Society is overrated.
18:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :poggers:
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd yeah but there been so many dicatorships during the human's timespan
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and all die eventually
18:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I'm happy to be alive. My mom and her six other sisters can eat maybe a duck at the end of the month and they were supposed to be the richer family in the neighborhood, all other days were like a pot of watered down porridge and have to be shared by seven people.
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> In the 70s*
18:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what about your dad
18:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> My dad don't talk to me much
18:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> So I actually don't know
18:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Grandpa on the dad side died of cancer before I was born. Grandma is actually a egomaniac albeit a pretty nice person. None of the people on my dad side would tell me about their history unfortunately.
18:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thats sad
18:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Not really tho. Grandma is pretty nice to me. Dad is just too busy about his stuff, but he do bring in money and care about what I do.
18:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I just can't get the history out of them that's all
18:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ah thats nice
18:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I wasn't born poor, like proper poor. So I'm actually pretty spoiled, even though we weren't like owning three houses rich.
19:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Anyway you can see it, it'd be a huge improvement over what my parents went through. So I can't really fault the government for not doing their jobs. Because they were kinda doing it pretty ok, since they only set out to eliminate poverty and they didn't promise anything else soooo. I guess that's a win.
19:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> bruh I shouldn't be pro china tho. So fuck them anyway.
19:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :kek:
19:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye china isnt good
19:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ~~Bruh I hope I don't get famous and get exposed by the irclog then get me socially grounded~~
19:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you had a dream
19:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> which part are you talking about lol
19:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i meant it like "i had a dream"
19:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u the revolutionist of china
19:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u fight for ur human rights
19:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats what we'll get you too and the ppl can read it in the logs xd
19:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well not really
19:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he said he likes what they do
19:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> econemy wise
19:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> oh
19:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> atleast thats how i got it
19:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Not really tho
19:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I don't care
19:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> looking at our history, ppl also were cheap workers for like 100 years in the industrial revolution
19:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then slowly human rights emerged
19:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I mean. I'm not the cheap worker due to my degree.
19:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah china is already very modern anyway
19:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its kinda edge case
19:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they didnt start with 0
19:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ~~I wanna be the bad guy and suppress other cheap workers.~~
19:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :justatest:
19:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> at least u didnt stay in murica
19:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> (disclosure: that's a joke)
19:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I interviewed for google for 4 months iirc. They were really slow about moving forward for some reason. So I might almost did stay there?
19:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tbh without machines taking over human work, it will always just shift this problem to more poor countries
19:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Maybe only because I didn't get any other cards to play, only like 4 offered interviews.
19:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> good that it was just almost
19:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> murica worse than china
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Well retrospectively ye, if you consider the covid situation
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> At the time it was pretty exciting to be able to stay there
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 😅
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> But I'm also glad I got out of Scotland after being stranded there for so long because the travel restriction
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you really want to live there?
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Scot or murica
19:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> The key to live in murica is never go outside.
19:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it also helps if you're white and not poor
19:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> never go outside?
19:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> sounds boring
19:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> look up chicago at night on youtube
19:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Btw why is jao still green
19:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> they forgot to remove me
19:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I think america wasn't very hostile to Asians until last year
19:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i think because most racists belive that asians are superior
19:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Sure I got yelled at maybe once or twice because of my race. But luckily they usually have pretty bad accent and I can't understand a word they were yelling at me. But I can tell they were upset of me existing.
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :kek:
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> are you chinese?
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Ye
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Wasn't it obvious
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this channel is spicy today
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ill have to read it later
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> no because i see you are learning chinese
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> what
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> mf IS chinese 😂
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> didnt you post a picture of your writing before?
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Are yoU sayiNg I'm bad At chinEse wriTings
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what was the best thing you saw in murica
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> no i just misunderstood. thinking youre practicing or somethign 😄
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Because that's true. I'm pretty bad
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> racism in us is so stupid xD
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> all americans are immigrants
19:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think fewer people in japan learn to write japanese, for most stuff you don't need it and it's pretty complicate
19:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> write by hand, I mean. writing on the computer is easier
19:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe the same applies to china?
19:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/856947827016204288/1605857188020.jpg
19:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @Jupstar ✪
19:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> this is the dumbest meme i have ever seen and i dont evenm know why its funny
19:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's behind the heya?
19:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> idk
19:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i know someone who was given 200k in indigenous tribe reparations
19:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> probably the point that americans are imigrants
19:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i actually had no idea we were doing that
19:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I heard japanese is slowly drifting away from kanji
19:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean at some point all except africans are immigrants
19:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since all humans come from africa
19:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ?xd
19:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Wait wrong channel for the topic
19:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Want me to remove you? :D
20:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes
20:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I randomly got an invitation to google foobar. I wonder if they will take me if I finish the challange
20:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let's take care of the bot thing first tho, then I can do it
20:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Good luck
20:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Crush it and let em see it
20:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> okay
20:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh, I'm not that great with the theoretical stuff that this kind of challange usually checks, but we'll see
20:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> rly good game
20:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is the jankiest thing I've ever seen, love it 😄
20:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ok finally caught up
20:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 isn't it? I really like it. I doubt I would've been able to do that, maybe I should try it some time 😄
20:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You definitely can, this one is very hardcoded but you can even get this more dynamic by looking for signatures
20:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wouldn't have ever thought of it though
20:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ohhh
20:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it replaces the clan
20:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then it becomes a lot clearer
20:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought it introduced another column ^^
20:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, no definitely not, I don't think one could do another column with the way we make our tables
20:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would be nice if we added generic tables btw
20:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I made some for editor2 on 0.7
20:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @murpi are other votes already prohibited?
20:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> yes
20:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I think
20:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> nevermind, I thought it did
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I think they just used something like cheat engine to find the offset then applied it in some example. We do have a lot of memory manipulation tutorials in Chinese.
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :justatest: ~~for definitely educational purposes~~
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i got a random dm today
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/856984224388349982/unknown.png

22:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @heinrich5991 server list is slow again for me, few seconds for initial request and 1.5 for refreshes
22:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think you said what you added was not permanent anyway
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> #3925
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3925
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Not a ddnet issue
22:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (same happens for ddnet server obviously, noticed that while copying rcon pw from test server many times, but never thought of it being a bug)
22:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @lynn try restarting
22:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah wait
22:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check `br_cached_best_serverinfo_url` please
22:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/856990673600774204/unknown.png
22:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> master3
22:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> same for refresh + initial
22:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm
22:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> someone should make a map of the master servers xd
22:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> easier to visualize
22:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should be fast™
22:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> master1 and master3 are both in germany, one behind cloudflare and one isn't
22:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> master2 is in china
22:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i would think master2 would be faster for me
22:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doubt
22:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have curl installed?
22:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @murpi using votemute + mute is too annoying, I guess?
22:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> yeah, after being muted, the next best thing is to use the vote reason field
22:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah i have curl
22:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ill check
22:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `time curl --compressed https://master1.ddnet.tw/ddnet/15/servers.json`
22:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> repeat for the other masters
22:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah maybe do `time curl -sS -o/dev/null --compressed https://master1.ddnet.tw/ddnet/15/servers.json`
22:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/857001668272979968/unknown.png
22:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ah i used another thing i found on SE
