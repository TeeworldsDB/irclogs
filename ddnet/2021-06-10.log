13:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> Hello, i dont really know if this should go into bugs or developer but i will post it here. When i want to tab out/in ddracenetwork (for steam) it either lags really hard till im back into the game or it will occasionally just crash. And if i want to remove the checkmark from fullscreen in options it will crash 100% and once i restart the game the checkmark is still there. Wonder if this happened to someone else or if someone could help me w
13:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> works without steam?
13:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> try updating gpu drivers
13:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> well it doesnt work on non steam version either
13:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> and it says i got the latest drivers
14:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what GPU?
14:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can try F1, gfx_opengl_major 1 and restart client
14:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti
14:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> that didnt fix it btw
14:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> i want to mention that a few days ago this was all working normal for me, but now i rearranged my room so i plugged out every cable and such stuff and placed it somewhere else and now that i built up the setup again and plugged everything in some weird things started to happen like: tw crashing when tabbing/turning off fullscreen ; Office programs instantly fucking up when one is opened (i fixed this) ; and i have just noticed something weir
14:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> this is really weird and doesnt seem to be an only tw related topic for me
14:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> it started when i plugged my pc back in after rearranging my room

14:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> but i dont really know what causes this
14:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> and if we should/you want continue this problem here
14:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> (and sounds from non steam and steam games seem to not get recognized sometimes)
14:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> and if we should/you want to continue this problem here
14:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> you could try unplugging every device one by one and see if the issue still persists
14:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> yea i will try that thx
15:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Just downgrade the drivers
15:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> A friend had blue screens with current nv drivers
15:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> @Jupstar ✪ apparently my pc doesnt want me to do that xd and acts like i dont have any previous drivers to roll back on

15:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Oh I wouldn't use the windows ones either.. Download from nvidia.com
15:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> alright so i guess nvidia answered my rage and published a new driver a few seconds ago and now everything seems to be working fine x). And here i thought i did something bad, well sorry for taking advantage of all your time you guys and thx for trying to help. the problem was just the faulty driver all along.
17:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> no bro 😚
21:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> are there plans to support svg skins? idk if there has been discussion about this in the past
21:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no plans to do that
21:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i guess you can always export at a hi res anyway
21:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats what the build script does rn
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> imo they should be stored as vector graphics and exported at a default resolution that could be changed with a parameterized request
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but i understand that doesn't make much sense when all skins are already stored as png
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i am just not sure how fast slow pcs are in converting
21:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even with all my cores it still takes a mini bit of time
21:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no it would be downloaded at that resolution
21:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not converted client-side
21:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh ok
21:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> cool feature
21:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe just offer some specific resolutions that are auto-generated on uploadf
21:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe just offer some specific resolutions that are auto-generated on upload
21:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they will be part of the client
21:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so they're always just cached
21:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well im thinking skin db here
21:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the few more MB doesnt matter
21:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and you can choose resolution
21:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but on server disk they're svg
21:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah skin db should be updated for that and community
21:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> just makes sense to allow ppl to choose resolution i guess
21:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i never really get motivation to do it and nobody else does it xd
21:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> reasonable ones
21:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah
21:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but this of course means all of the skins have to be made into svgs which is... well probably not doable
21:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think 4k textures downscaled are fine too, e.g. if u at "2k" and use UHD option it will still look better than full hd textures
21:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah
21:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i have a few skins from the database as svg already 😄
21:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think 1080p is more than enough, like when are you ever zoomed in that much even at 4k
21:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> even pro gores zoom
21:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i like 4k more ^^
21:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i see the difference at default zoom
21:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> o do you mean assets
21:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not skin
21:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no skins too
21:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> both
21:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> woa
21:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> asset db when
21:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> would be so sick
21:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah u mean like that
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> u could have a client setting to show other people's assets on them
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so they would match with skin ^^
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well if the skin db gets an update it could be impl with that in mind probs
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> would be really cool looking
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> just means you would have to moderate it just like skin db
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> cus people might try to upload troll assets (swapped weapons)
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but i doubt that happens very soon
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea probably not
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> when ddnet 2 :3
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> e.g. that would be a start
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> to drop old clients completly with all their hacks
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or treat them as vanilla
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ddnet 2.... coming soon 2030 when we have the devs
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> speaking of which i still do not know cpp
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> shame
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the skin db is written in bash script and php
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we're already at ddnet 15 @lynn
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> go ahead xxd
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where you've been?
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> under a rock
21:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oof php
21:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i wonder if i still know php
21:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> actually only the dir syncing is annoying
21:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> except u dont care about performance and just sync it completly always
21:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but else u have to look into children children (e.g. community HD) and load all current files to not overwrite per children
21:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and i suck at php so that takes ages
21:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> didnt even know there was subdirectories :justatest:
21:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well there would be
21:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh i see what you're saying
21:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so in the client we just add /community/hd or smth
21:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is there something like os.walk in php
21:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> never heard of that xd
21:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is that javascript or what
21:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> python maybe
21:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> python
21:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway would have been easier to just use one db and have a json that just sets a "db_name" attribute or smth
21:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/os.html#os.walk
21:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but then other skin dbs wont work.. the classic stuff
21:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think it returns a generator of all file names
21:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dunno i always find such functions unintuitive xD
21:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> script languages are too hard for my brain
22:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway i need a sync function, so all missing skins are synced in the other databases and thats a script i'll have to write my own anyway
22:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> python :monkalaugh:
23:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://tryapl.org/
23:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "array programming language"
23:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would try it, but it uses unicode symbols for everything
23:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like a pain to write and learn
23:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `Avg←{(+⌿⍵)÷≢⍵}`
23:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a function to calc the average
23:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
