00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
05:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Do people get confused between servers and maps usually
05:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> There are some new chn players thought the server list is a map list and they keep asking why the map they were playing disappeared :justatest:
06:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yeah when i first played
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.w3.org/2021/01/pressrelease-webrtc-rec.html.en
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) transforms the communications landscape; becomes a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Recommendation and multiple Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ˜®
09:47 <+ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie yes people love to confuse server and map and map and mod etc
09:47 <+ChillerDragon> even long time players do that
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> make sense
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> People  dont read
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> That is the problem haha
10:09 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i am a bit biasd since i play a bit on servers that do not change but and there it is easier to get confused but im sure some people even say "come lets play the game multimap"
10:11 <+ChillerDragon> its the same with even people working in tech startups not knowing the difference between a search engine and a browser
10:11 <+ChillerDragon> most people just could not care less 
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean u get used t oit
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont confuse servers since 2015
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I remember other games working the same way, being able to change map on servers, so it's defintely not just TW/DDNet
13:29 <+ChillerDragon> yea no its a common thing and i think even if people say it wrong most of them understand how it works
13:29 <+ChillerDragon> no need to get active 
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> yikes when you want to quickly rebuild but latest shell history was not "make" but "git reset --hard"
16:11 <+ChillerDragon> oh nice restored using ctrl+z in vscode so nice
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ChillerDragon: Thanks for your grep -F tip, this actually gave me the right search term "fixed string" and led me to the right SO question https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/282445/grepping-a-fixed-string-at-the-beginning-of-a-line
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> thats not the problem, its just that i didnt even know how to open the vote menu
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> again people dont read
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> as you press esc to quit the game you see a menu
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> you will see a call vote
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> if you read
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> well how do i know call vote lets me change map
17:16 <+ChillerDragon> ah nice @timakro
17:16 <+ChillerDragon> didnt i send that so link anyways?
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably posted it here before, but if someone wants to enjoy a nice rant: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/commit/1e70e82baa9193f6f027338b0fab0f5078971fbe
