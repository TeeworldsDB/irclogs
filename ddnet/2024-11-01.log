06:18 < bridge> <pathos3005> Can you add these maps to your new CTF test servers? https://twelo.pages.dev/maps
06:18 < bridge> <pathos3005> And you can use these votes for the maps https://gitlab.com/pathosethoslogos/tw/-/blob/master/0_CTF.cfg

08:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> epyc compiling 2 llvm versions
09:25 < bridge> <kebscs> Is ther even enough new features for new patch
09:25 < bridge> <kebscs> Feels like its been mostly bugfixes and a lot of features are just ready for review past month
10:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Me? I donâ€™t like ctf1left .\_.
10:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @pathos3005 i added ctf_choco

11:56 < bridge> <woidless> How to make gores type in my server?
12:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> second time you are asking. I think you need to explain exactly what you want. This is a developer channel, so you get a C++ programming answer in here, which is seemingly not what you are looking for.
12:49 < bridge> <pathos3005> Wasn't there some setting like `input_grab` or something like that?
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It got removed
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> SDL does not support it anymore
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Also mouse acceleration is kinda wanky
12:52 < bridge> <pathos3005> Ah check check, makes sense, must be some old patch then since SDL was upgraded long time ago for DDNet
15:15 < bridge> <EGYT> Yeah
15:19 < bridge> <EGYT> Would have been nice if you could ping me whenever there are new strings to translate, because I could forget to check once and whoops - now a release has an unfinished translation :^)
15:25 < bridge> <meloÆž> egyt is back!!!
15:25 < bridge> <egyt> Um, I never gone, I think
15:31 < bridge> <egyt> I don't have notifications for when the new version releases, and because of that I have to check if there are any manually!
15:35 < bridge> <egyt> That's quite sad that GitHub doesn't have an option like "Notify when <file> gets changed", though it would have been useless to me if it didn't notify by email, which I check pretty much every day, heh
15:39 < bridge> <teero777> hi melon
15:39 < bridge> <meloÆž> hi teero
16:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Fun fact, in Windows, you can shake your window to tab out all other windows that is behind
16:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1301935889412263956/2024-11-01_16-46-45.mp4?ex=672649c8&is=6724f848&hm=ad9dbc8b1166096e9c77b730c1d7c3e2791bed645e9c53ad8739e829eefc0c75&
16:53 < bridge> <robyt3> I disabled that though because I've only ever activated it accidentally
16:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> for me this is quite convenient since I have many apps which do different things, then all of a sudden I just wanna open League and it's own the Desktop xd
16:58 < bridge> <robyt3> I'd drag that application to a separate desktop entirely and keep everything else on the other desktop in that case
16:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> maybe that would be the smart choise, but you know me
17:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I'm like a professional idiot

17:00 < bridge> <meloÆž> your steam launch icons are brokie? :kek:
17:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Oh yeah, steam files are broken for me.
17:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ye :pepeW:
17:01 < bridge> <meloÆž> lmao
17:01 < bridge> <cauldron1> Change the asset mapres or whatever itâ€™s called to a transparent image? Like how itâ€™s done in this video with skins: https://youtu.be/e4l1lZ5uw6M
17:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> cannot fix it without reinstalling that shit
17:01 < bridge> <meloÆž> rip
17:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> not like i care tho, since I can right click Steam and launch games that way
17:26 < bridge> <zhn> still curious :justatest:
17:32 < bridge> <reitw> you just need to fix it
17:32 < bridge> <reitw> they are just urls opening steam client

17:38 < bridge> <egyt> Oh, a *The Escapists 2* player
18:46 < bridge> <zhn> according to engine/server/register.*, it's impossible
18:53 < bridge> <zhn> it was always weird honestly, i remember running into the same problem when i tried to port forward as a kid. who knew that server sends its own port from configuration and it can not be mapped to other port in any other ways :pepeW:
19:57 < bridge> <egorpotemkin2011> Help me please
19:59 < bridge> <egorpotemkin2011> look, when I go to any map, I always have the emotion of anger, I went into the Character and set it so that when I go to the server, the emotion is normal, but it is really angry, I donâ€™t know what to do
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It's halloween event
20:02 < bridge> <egorpotemkin2011> and that's why I have the emotion of anger when I log into the server?
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yes
20:02 < bridge> <egorpotemkin2011> oh thank you very much I will know :3
20:09 < bridge> <meloÆž> we're all angry this halloween!
20:32 < bridge> <mirfay123> why arent we scared
20:33 < bridge> <mirfay123> ðŸ‘»
20:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> boo
20:58 < bridge> <mirfay123> boo
23:23 < bridge> <0xdeen> you're scaring the others
23:57 < bridge> <Ewan> anyone here ever use the calamine crate :justatest:
