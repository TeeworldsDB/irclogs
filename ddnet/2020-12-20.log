01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 this is not working for DDNet clients for me...
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Aswell as the server somehow doesn't get the ShowDistance msg from the client...
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have absolutely no clue
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you need to debug it
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How am I supposed to know what you are sending
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont know how to do debug this, I am not very familiar with this code
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i tried the DebugDump() from uuid manager, but the messages are listed there
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats why i asked whether the uuid's can differ, due to an update or idk...
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Aha, I found the issue
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> seems like my extended protocol is old, it automatically adds a "message-" before the actual address
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that doesn't sound correct
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay weird, the showdistance message still doesnt work, i compared the uuid and it is the same
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> capabilities work now tho
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> got it i think
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah no xd
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> got it
04:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :twintri:
05:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i suggest put maps football and basketball in Fun server:giftee_red:
05:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i dont think its possible since it relies on different server code
07:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> today's aoc took me 1.5h üòÆ
08:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> well, making "fun" server like actually fun to play, containing some other mods would be cool, but I don't know if it's easy to implement since ddnet servers knows only how to work with DDRace mod
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 yeah, seems like too much work today üòÑ
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Shouldn't there be some kind of programming abstraction which makes these kind of 2D puzzles easy? It should somehow abstract the 4 directions, 4 corners, 90 degree rotations etc.
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> And 2D coordinates ofc
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Finally a math paper I could enjoy https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322530755
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Didn't know math could actually be useful
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> üôÉ
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki you might enjoy this one too, a little tough to read but very intriguing
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I saw someone using an old timey roguelike engine for a couple puzzles
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> maybe can put both codes together (drake and football) or something like this:saddo:
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> and maybe later mappers can made maps ddrace with ball üòõ
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> if this happened being would awesome XD
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> ddnet is not know for putting a bunch of non ddr stuff into one mod if you want something like that buy ddnet++
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> ddnet style is to just host plain ball servers instead
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> üëÅÔ∏è
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Analysis and Qualitative Effects of Large Breasts on Aerodynamic Performance and Wa k e   of a ‚ÄúMiss Kobayashi‚Äôs Dragon Maid‚Äù Character
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a man of culture i see
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:

13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ddnet++:lol:
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikey.> dafuq is ddnet++ lol
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikey.> 20 sep 2019 ... this thing is olddd
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you have to buy a ddnet-pro account to find out what ddnet++ is
14:06 <+ChillerDragon> u can also use F-DDrace its under more active devlopment but it has less gametypes
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie looks broken :P
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> only happens on ime, so it will probably be fine after we switch back to uiless mode and render candidates ourselves
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> you can check this if you want to do it. I still don't know how to use ddnet's text. https://github.com/Robyt3/teeworlds/pull/1/files
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The text renderer? We use the old one, no?
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think we changed much if at all
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i haven't used the old one for years. the first thing i did to vanilla is just nuking the old one :nouis:
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> also implementing ime three times is kinda overwhelming
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i mean DoEditBox, chat and console all has their own text input render thing.
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> looks like the problem in
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/discussions/0/3002177117180590832/
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is that only on some computers @TsFreddie ?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> not my computers for sure
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> screenshots is some random chinese player's
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> screenshot is some random chinese player's
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> that one only happens when doing inputs tho
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the steam post doesn't mention there is a trigger for the problem
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but it does sounds like the same graphical glitch
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> is the svg for tele weapons available? I know I've had it at some point but it was long ago on my old pc
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @TsFreddie yeah, he also said he fixed the problem, but sadly they never say how they do it xD
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :tee_thinking: might be different then, his machine always does that on ime.
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie maybe port the new textrenderer to ddnet too? üòõ
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> TextContainer is faster tho
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it probably is
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well we render the text the same way everywhere, it's just that we do input inconsistently
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so we should move everything into clineinput first
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> robyt3 did it in vanilla. so i just glued a ime solution on top.
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did he add rendering into clineinput btw?
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i did lol.
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do you render the entire line in clineinput or do you just render the segment that's being currently edited?
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think the entire line when something changed.
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> wait. no. the layout code only trigger when something changed.
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and all quads are rendered each frame
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Just wanted to say thank you to somebody who implement feature that I asked for that shows map name in scoreboard, extremely helpful, using it all the time
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you did not even suggest that
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1818
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> "From discord Evgesha"?
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is that you?
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Yes
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
17:42 <+ChillerDragon> ur welcome :)
17:42 <+ChillerDragon> its bad implemented tho when it comes to chopping off longer names its a bit random
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> lmao fokko disliked xd
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I guess "you can't hit others with laser/ninja" is not a thing?
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> if it's possible to set up as tile
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> then probably makes sense to include it
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I tried placing it and it doesn't seem to work (unless I messed something up)
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> oh laser is a thing, ninja doesn't seem to be
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> btw
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> there are a lot of problems with this update in the sense of code
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> for example your client does not know if it can hit something
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well that's your problem then :lol:
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> or it is... But client is not aware of every setting
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> there are some non-included
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I'll skip ninja until someone can confirm if it exists
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> one known is if u are outside of a tune zone and someone shoots a projectile from inside with changed settings it will look weird af
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from outside perspective
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aka tune zones arent predicted
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> so settings which are not supported will be included in some time, so for the first version of the HUD there might not be some settings, that what I've meant
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I guess it's kinda hard to fix
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> also there is no prediction for disallowed deep-fly
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye this issue has been with us since forever
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ppl dont like tune zones anyway
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so they arent used much anyway
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> it sucks since in louis' entities there is a shit tile for it
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I can't see it
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Roco> i want so speak a special thanks to @Learath2 who hosted yesterday the server for us, since we had problems from our Tournaments servers. The whole GCTF team speaks a good thanks to @DDNet
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No problem at all, feel free to ask us anytime, we don't mind helping people host events like these
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks Learath2
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Are timeout codes broken in the client?
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i cant seem to use my own cl_timeout_code
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the server always receives the same
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is it based on the seed only?
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and `CClient::m_GenerateTimeoutSeed` does not have any sense at all
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It all seems kinda broken to me, can anyone explain if i am wrong?
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 Would it be possible that you add support for F-Client team states and aimline? They are both extended net msgs and F-Client catches the DDNetPlayer with a new entry `EXPLAYERFLAG_AIM`
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> teamstate is the same as 0.6 just as an extended msg
