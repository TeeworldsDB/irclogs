00:02 < eeeee> deen: instead of serverside recording maybe you could just connect a dummy client and record in it
00:02 <@deen> eeeee: serverside recording for each player*
00:03 < eeeee> if you turn off clipping then it should be the same
00:04 <@deen> then you have to send a lot of data to that client on some maps
00:07 <@deen> and the client has to do some intelligent filtering
00:07 <@deen> sounds easier to do it in a thread
00:17 < eeeee> what intelligent filtering? i thought he would just record pretty much everything to a demo file
00:17 <@deen> that's not the kind of demo i want
00:17 <@deen> or the one we currently have
00:17 <@deen> you get a demo of a players' run if they improved the global record on that map
00:19 < eeeee> oh i see
00:19 < eeeee> my idea was just continiously recording the whole server
00:19 <@deen> that wouldn't be such a big problem
00:19 <@deen> but rather boring^^
00:19 < eeeee> good for tournaments though
00:20 <@deen> yes
00:20 <@deen> we actually have a recording mode for that, i just haven't tested it
01:45 < laxa> deen: 4 new video inc for hall of fame tomorrow morning, I go to sleep now :)
01:46 <@deen> laxa: wow, so much
01:46 < laxa> and 2 demos were refused, cause maps are too recent :p
01:46 <@deen> 30 demos in the hall of fame now
01:46 < laxa> 2 from nealson solo maps, 2 from Maple & Skeith on novice maps
01:46 <@deen> videos*
01:46 < Maple> i could send more , but i dont want to look like a showoff xD
01:47 < laxa> if you want my opinion, runs are not that good, and pretty boring
01:47 < laxa> but at least then people try to run them
01:47 < laxa> for example
01:47 < laxa> lanux made a demo for just_shotgun
01:47 < laxa> 1 week later, 3 new guys made better ranks on it :D
01:47 <@deen> haha
01:47 < laxa> I just reuploaded a good version
01:47 < laxa> and now I have to upload version of a different player
01:48 < Maple> yea i know i didnt want to send those runs
01:48 < Maple> but skeith felt like it
01:49 < laxa> you received my pm on the forum Maple ?
01:50 < Maple> sec
01:50 < laxa> well, don't upload demo that contains more than the run itself
01:50 < laxa> you could at least do this for me :)
01:50 < Maple> how to use ddnet client to do that
01:50 < Maple> setting&
01:50 < Maple> ?
01:51 < laxa> with demo viewer
01:51 < laxa> there is a thread on the forum about it
01:51 < laxa> it's pretty simple
01:51 < laxa> you choose begin of the new demo
01:51 < laxa> end of it
01:51 < laxa> then save into another new demo
01:51 < laxa> ok, going to sleep, bye
01:52 < Maple> what is name ofo thread
01:52 <@deen> bye

11:53 < GoJEGrEEN> hi deen 
11:53 < GoJEGrEEN> are u there
11:53 < GoJEGrEEN> ?
13:59 <@EastByte> deen: my json parsing leaks?
14:30 <@EastByte> oh got it
14:53 <@deen> EastByte: yep, should free memory again :P
14:53 <@deen> if anyone sees GoJEGrEEN again, Im interested in DDNet Persian!
16:31 < o_be_one> hi

18:45 <@deen> I'm fuzzing gzip, 7zip, tar, bzip2, xz now. Looks fine so far
18:46 <@EastByte> fuzzing?
18:47 <@deen> yeah, i found crashes in opus & wavpack already
18:47 <@deen> http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/
18:47 <@EastByte> ah that kind of fuzzing
18:47 <@deen> also, i read the source code of AFL and it's pretty beautiful
18:47 <@deen> probably the nicest C I've ever read
18:48 <@deen> the whole thing is just 5000 lines
18:48 <@EastByte> it might be something for me aswell then^^
18:51 <@deen> i wanted to fuzz ddnet's network packets for the server, but would have to rewrite the server to read from files instead of network
18:54 <@deen> the other idea was to change the tool to work with network packets, but not sure about a clean approach
18:54 <@deen> files are so much nicer

19:55 < eeeee> can't you write some bash script which reads files and netcats the contents to ddnet server?
19:55 < eeeee> or that fuzzer directly instruments file reading somehow?
19:57 <@deen> eeeee: i thought about that too, not sure
