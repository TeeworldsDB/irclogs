15:26 < Savander> hi
15:26 < o_be_one> hi :)
15:27 < Savander> What rank has teeworlds on steam greenlight? :)) heinrich5991 
15:27 < Savander> closer to 1?:D
15:30 < Learath2> teeworlds seems to have received nice feedback compared to the other games in this round dont have exact number tho
15:30 < Savander> im asking because of https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=113927#p113927
15:31 < Savander> so i thought, he can check his real rank position;)
15:32 < Savander> I checked other games from greenlight too, some of them were released few days ago, and received much less feedback :P :D
15:43 < Learath2> the flamewar in that forum topic tho
15:44 < Savander> my friend just started making a trailer.
15:44 < Savander> i saw some parts, looks really... good.
15:50 < Learath2> We really should get to work on somekind of tutorial before the game is release
15:50 < Savander> about basics
