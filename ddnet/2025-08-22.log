00:00 < bridge> <Ewan> but why
00:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> dependency, compile time, random ci failure, executable size
00:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> with no benefit apart from testing itself sometimes more thorougly than the cpp side is
00:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im not sure if all rust tests even have a counterpart
00:07 < bridge> <Ewan> idk if we should be eliminating the potential for rust additions tho
00:08 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess heinrich thought adding the bridge would be enough to get people contributing with rust? i was not around when it was added but i do know it adds very little burden if you have a competent dev env
00:11 < bridge> <kebscs> i guess its for quic
00:12 < bridge> <kebscs> but since its not happening any time soon rn its just bloat
00:13 < bridge> <Ewan> or we can actually try to put it to use
00:15 < bridge> <kebscs> i dont see how rn
00:15 < bridge> <kebscs> we can do pretty much everything in c++
00:18 < bridge> <teero777> isn't a time machine just a 4D car?
00:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> most time machines are 3 dimensional
00:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the space they move in is 4d
00:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i like the i punched a hole through spacetime to where i wanted to go then drove through it depiction of time machines
00:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> theres also the wibbly wobbly timey wimey dimension way
00:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or the magic teleportation
00:21 < bridge> <teero777> but a 3d object would never be able to propel itself in to the 4th dimention
00:21 < bridge> <teero777> but a 3d object would never be able to propel itself in to the 4th dimension
00:22 < bridge> <teero777> just as it is never possible for a 2D object to exist that propels itself in the 3rd dimention
00:22 < bridge> <teero777> just as it is never possible for a 2D object to exist that propels itself in the 3rd dimension
00:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> a 2d object can exist on any slice of a 3d plane
00:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and move across it
00:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i guess the part that rotates you in the 4th dimension has to be 4 dimensional
00:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> there could be some weird interaction which allows something 3 dimensional to do timey wimey stuff without being 4th dimensional
00:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> like how if you pour water imbetween 2 slides and hold it upright, and let go of the slides, the "2d" water flattens even though it was fully 2d
00:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> bad example, the water is 3d and so are all of its particles
00:38 < bridge> <teero777> if you can imagine a pure 2D object that moves across the 3D space by itself with no other influences then idk. shouldn't be possible i think
00:39 < bridge> <kebscs> an object that you can see only from front/back?
00:39 < bridge> <kebscs> and invisible from sides?
00:39 < bridge> <teero777> 2D is not an ambiguous term... xd
00:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well it has to be for the time travel to work
00:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats what makes it fiction
00:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you only need a little wobbly physics to make time travel possible
00:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> how the consequences work out is upto whoever divided by 0
00:45 < bridge> <lahcxn> How about you 2 travel back in time to your last shower 3 weeks ago?
00:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> go back to kog /:
00:48 < bridge> <kebscs> back in time 2 ⁉️
00:50 < bridge> <lahcxn> I cant, perma muted
00:53 < bridge> <teero777> im going to make sure you get perma muted here too if you use dev channel for ragebait xD
00:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> deserved
00:57 < bridge> <lahcxn> And what will you gain from that? You try to give this message a soft appearance with a “xD”. But in reality it is just an angry threat. Please look within and consider why you have to direct anger at others like this.
00:59 < bridge> <teero777> wtf ai? or do you have some autocomplete for " to “
01:00 < bridge> <lahcxn> ?what
01:01 < bridge> <teero777> `“` is not a character you can type on a normal keyboard, either you are on your phone and your autocorrect corrects `"` to `“` or you can type `“` directly on your keyboard or phone
01:02 < bridge> <totar> also c/cpp libraries for QUIC exist, theres ones from msft and facebook that look perfectly fine.
01:02 < bridge> <teero777> `“` is not a character you can type on a normal keyboard, either you are on your phone and your autocorrect corrects `"` to `“` or you can type `“` directly on your keyboard or phone.
01:02 < bridge> <teero777> or you made the effort to find out the unicode for this which i don't believe xD
01:03 < bridge> <lahcxn> Define a normal keyboard? It takes a next level xenophobe to be prejudice towards different types of keyboards. But to anwser your question, i am using a phone
01:05 < bridge> <teero777> @totar wanna see my sim
01:05 < bridge> <totar> 5 minutes
01:05 < bridge> <teero777> k
01:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i would spend a chunk of time trying to do it myself once the rust ver is completed
01:09 < bridge> <totar> what's the point of doing it again in cpp if the rust version was complete?
01:10 < bridge> <totar> you want the rust version as a guide?
01:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yah, the pr looks scary
01:11 < bridge> <totar> hmm
01:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dislike rust because im old
01:12 < bridge> <totar> I know this to be false
01:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> my dislike of rust does not exist?
01:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or my dislike of rust isnt because im old?
01:12 < bridge> <totar> you are not old xd
01:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh
01:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> old-fashioned
01:12 < bridge> <totar> ok sure
01:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> c enjoyer
01:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im old tho
01:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> there are people who look adulty to me and boom theyre 12 like what
01:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats a child
01:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> when did that happen
01:13 < bridge> <totar> is the QUIC PR really that scary? Leatro keeps saying that it's easy
01:13 < bridge> <totar> is the QUIC PR really that scary? Learto keeps saying that it's easy
01:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> consider i dont know rust
01:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and the borrow checker has some bones to pick with me from last time i tried
01:13 < bridge> <totar> ok but if you did it in cpp then you don't need rust
01:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah which is why i want to do redo it in cpp
01:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 12 stones 1 bird
01:14 < bridge> <totar> yeah, I think you should just go for it
01:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 1. no rust woo
01:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 2. i learn rust
01:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 3. i learn whats going on in quic
01:14 < bridge> <totar> I don't think you need to wait for the rust ver to be done
01:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ah i see
01:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but look at the checklist??
01:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why is it just not changing transport protocol
01:15 < bridge> <totar> idk lemme glance at it agai
01:16 < bridge> <teero777> @chairn :(
01:16 < bridge> <chairn> missclick
01:16 < bridge> <totar> I some of those checklist things can be skipped in the initial version?
01:17 < bridge> <totar> like idk why we need masterserver registering to go over QUIC
01:17 < bridge> <totar> also idk which checklist item you referred to with that message
01:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1408228842111369307/image.png?ex=68a8facf&is=68a7a94f&hm=d7d5e59ae874437a1f7a7d2766c27db5d91fb70248a6042998217a12ac8ec4b2&
01:18 < bridge> <totar> ah, I think because the way the network system is designed really wants conless UDP, so you need to redesign it
01:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why cant quic be conless?
01:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or pretend to be
01:19 < bridge> <totar> that defeats the point
01:19 < bridge> <totar> well
01:19 < bridge> <totar> maybe you can hide it idk
01:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i thought the point was encryption/compression
01:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we dont have issues with the connection handshake
01:19 < bridge> <totar> @learath2 can you explain the idea behind the QUIC impl, you mentioned it being invisible to the game or something how does that work
01:20 < bridge> <totar> please spill details
01:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it will just happen and then youll just do the normal (unnecesary) handshake
01:20 < bridge> <totar> there's a lot of features in QUIC
01:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> those are the ones i care about
01:20 < bridge> <totar> also it's definitley not compression
01:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ):<
01:20 < bridge> <totar> I dont think QUIC does that for you
01:21 < bridge> <totar> might be wrong idk
01:21 < bridge> <learath2> Well the contents of the packets are completely unchanged, it’s just transported over quic. That’s probably what I was talking about
01:22 < bridge> <totar> but network.cpp and similar files still need complete refactor? Is that correct? It's not invisible to them
01:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it looks like theres some registration code
01:23 < bridge> <totar> did heinrich keep the UDP functionality working in his PR? He seems to have deleted the entire cpp files for that so I assume he reimplemented those in rust
01:23 < bridge> <learath2> #6961 is pretty much done if you want to take a look
01:23 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6961
01:23 < bridge> <totar> I'm reading it
01:23 < bridge> <totar> it's large
01:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its extremley scary
01:24 < bridge> <totar> nothing is that scary
01:24 < bridge> <learath2> tw06.rs is where the old style packets are handled
01:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `"protocol must be one of ddnet-18+quic, tw-0.5+udp, tw-0.6+udp or tw-0.7+udp".fmt(f)` 0.5?
01:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> can i still connect to 0.5 servers?
01:25 < bridge> <totar> yeah I think
01:25 < bridge> <totar> maybe?
01:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no mastersrv support tho
01:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> download link broken
01:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for 0.5 trunk
01:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 0.5.2 works
01:27 < bridge> <totar> idk the network layer is really not *THAT* big in ddnet, I don't think this is an insane thing to take over in cpp. but you'd have to write tests for everything
01:27 < bridge> <teero777> !remind 5 tater come vc
01:27 < chillerbot> Helo teero777 I will remind you at Fri Aug 22 2025 01:32:53 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.
01:28 < bridge> <learath2> You want to do quic in C++ instead?
01:28 < bridge> <totar> why not?
01:28 < bridge> <totar> is there a reason it's harder
01:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> doesnt seem to work
01:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1408231478252408832/image.png?ex=68a8fd44&is=68a7abc4&hm=772f88591c08761bae9ea433372435dbd3bb05875f980c8fdaa855ab9f6121a8&
01:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i wonder if i can force it
01:29 < bridge> <learath2> Not really, but I thought you wouldn’t be interested in quic, but maybe just something like dtls instead
01:29 < bridge> <learath2> Would be easier to bolt on, with minimal changes
01:30 < bridge> <totar> I've never heard of that ngl
01:30 < bridge> <totar> oh wait
01:30 < bridge> <totar> nvm I have
01:30 < bridge> <totar> I thought we want QUIC benefits
01:30 < bridge> <totar> I didn't think a worse solution would be accepted
01:31 < bridge> <learath2> I think the quality of the quic libraries in C++ wasn’t all that great. Cloudflares rust implementation does have bindings though iirc
01:31 < bridge> <totar> the microsft C library looks pretty good to me idk
01:31 < bridge> <totar> https://github.com/microsoft/msquic
01:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> just stuck on game info
01:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> just stuck on getting game info
01:32 < bridge> <learath2> Probably wouldn’t be, it would be really nice to get all the quic benefits
01:32 < chillerbot> DO NOT FORGET @teero777 TO: tater come vc
01:33 < bridge> <teero777> i like that
01:33 < bridge> <learath2> But maybe if you push it along with an accounts implementation you could get it pushed through
01:33 < bridge> <totar> I thought accounts were like integrated into QUIC protocol
01:33 < bridge> <learath2> They kinda are, in their current form
01:34 < bridge> <totar> or I was told something like that
01:34 < bridge> <totar> ok
01:34 < bridge> <learath2> But nothing stops you from completely doing that part differently too. Not like the accounts got deployed anywhere yet
01:34 < bridge> <learath2> I guess jupsti uses them in ddnet-rs and I doubt he’d switch over, so that would be another nice civil war in 6 years
01:35 < bridge> <totar> idk I don't really want to change the account server very much
01:35 < bridge> <kebscs> b-but rust... 😭
01:36 < bridge> <totar> also like, why would we integrate accounts into a networking protocol. That doesn't make any sense
01:36 < bridge> <learath2> You could try to tie the connection to the client certificate like quic does, basically bolting it on top of dtls instead
01:37 < bridge> <totar> is that a normal thing to do with quic
01:37 < bridge> <totar> do they intend you to use it like that
01:38 < bridge> <learath2> The accounts are basically just certificates, so currently they are just used as the connections client certificate
01:39 < bridge> <learath2> Not my area really, you’d have to ask jupstar and heinrich, who are probably tired of people probing around it questioning their design
01:39 < bridge> <totar> well they should have finished it after they designed it .-.
01:40 < bridge> <learath2> As far as I understand what got implemented is pretty much jupstars proposal in the accounts issue
01:41 < bridge> <totar> wait but this sounds like you can get the certificates and verify them without QUIC then?
01:41 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, but I think if the connections shared secret is not derived from the client certificate something something security issue
01:42 < bridge> <totar> idk I haven't thought about it
01:43 < bridge> <learath2> I’m sure it’s all in there somewhere #3411
01:43 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3411
01:43 < bridge> <totar> I think it's documented in the account repo
01:43 < bridge> <totar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-accounts/issues/1
01:43 < bridge> <learath2> This thing has been in progress for so long that everything is just melted together in my brain now. I don’t remember when what happened where
01:45 < bridge> <totar> idk the certificate crypto thing is nice but I feel like it's not what we should have started with
01:45 < bridge> <learath2> I will not be giving any more opinions on it because it always devolves into some argument
01:46 < bridge> <totar> I will lol. I wish it worked like this. I made this a while ago
01:46 < bridge> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1408235956003143680/image.png?ex=68a9016f&is=68a7afef&hm=1cde35a70541d7404bc1965c04a53b6e46eb252d15f2b6a8d181878d6aba9e52&
01:47 < bridge> <learath2> I plead the 5th
01:48 < bridge> <learath2> Something something MITM
01:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but https
01:48 < bridge> <totar> no he's right
01:48 < bridge> <learath2> Not that red arrow
01:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> o
01:48 < bridge> <totar> but like
01:48 < bridge> <totar> we already accept this risk
01:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> how
01:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yoink the otc then what
01:49 < bridge> <totar> someone can MITM any rcon login
01:49 < bridge> <learath2> There are ways to do it, you can authenticate servers by certificates and CAs. I designed and implemented that a while back
01:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> pretend to be the client, but then there are 2 conns fighting over the thing
01:49 < bridge> <learath2> A while as in 2017 or something
01:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> rcon was insecure anyway
01:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> pretend to be the client, but then there are 2 conns fighting over the thing, either can say "im being mitmed please stop"
01:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the red arrow needs some way to encrypt
01:50 < bridge> <totar> also importantly, we can upgrade to the certificate fancyness or QUIC or DTLS from this design pretty easily
01:51 < bridge> <learath2> I do not remember the details, but my proposal for keeping the link plaintext, or just encrypting parts of it wasn’t really popular
01:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> remmeber them plez
01:52 < bridge> <learath2> Something something security issue. Idk been a decade since someone first tried to add accounts
01:52 < bridge> <totar> kog is using unentryped tokens linked to a bind for multiple years and nothing bad has happened
01:53 < bridge> <learath2> If only y’all hadn’t annoyed heinrich off of this channel he would definitely remember
01:53 < bridge> <totar> also like, we're not a bank. What is the worst thing someone can do if they compromise your account? That should be so vanishinly rare that it could be handled case by case
01:54 < bridge> <totar> we don't even have virtual items
01:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```

01:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats the getting ready client info
01:57 < bridge> <totar> whats this for?
01:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> trying to get ddnet to connect to 0.5
01:57 < bridge> <totar> o nice
01:57 < bridge> <totar> I assume it doesn't work then
01:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> when 0.6down?
01:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why is it sixup
01:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and now seven
01:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and not seven
01:58 < bridge> <learath2> It’s sleep o’clock. Idk what to do with quic and accounts, maybe jupstar might have an idea how you can hook up his accounts without quic to start with
01:58 < bridge> <learath2> It’s sleep o’clock. Idk what to do with quic and accounts, maybe jupstar might have an idea on how you can hook up his accounts without quic to start with
01:58 < bridge> <totar> idk I could make the entire account server and the client/server implementation for the diagram I posted in like 10% as much time as it would take me to implement QUIC. So it's hard to be motivated to implement QUIC
01:59 < bridge> <totar> I think it literally takes like 2 days
02:01 < bridge> <learath2> I do not think your proposal makes it past code review, or design review really. “we are not a bank” probably won’t fly with many
02:02 < bridge> <totar> what if the red line was not red for some reason
02:03 < bridge> <learath2> Then it has more of a chance making it past the council
02:05 < bridge> <learath2> But honestly, you could just likely piggyback off of jupstars work. The certificates could be authenticated over any link really, I think it’s just much more convenient (and easy to properly secure) if they are used as client certificates (in quic or tls)
02:07 < bridge> <learath2> Even more honestly, I think you should spend your time on other things. We couldn’t manage to get an account system agreed on and merged in a decade, it’s quite unlikely to change soon. The closest we got was this attempt, and if it ever gets finished it’ll probably get merged. A completely new proposal will probably just dig up all the old conversations again, for days and days
02:14 < bridge> <totar> I mean I didn't really expect my proposal to be accepted any way, since it goes against the work that's already done and I know how this go. But I don't really understand or have interest in the current account system, even if it was finished it doesn't outline how it should be integrated into the website or moderation system in a useful way, and I have no idea who would do that. It's like so much less work to finish a much simpler system

02:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> hein is 0.7 maintainer??
02:22 < bridge> <totar> yes, for a while
02:22 < bridge> <murpi> y'all underestimating how much learath and heinrich have contributed, not only to DDNet, but to teeworlds as a whole 👀
02:22 < bridge> <totar> although he doesn't seem to merge stuff so idk
02:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> "is it okay to merge this while oy is afk"
02:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 0.7 is as directionless as ddnet
02:22 < bridge> <learath2> Me neither. Idk what happened along the way. I quite liked the initial proposal, but somehow I just don’t vibe with it anymore. Seeing deen look at the demo and not understand why he had 3 different identifiers may have had something to do with it

02:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> goodnight

02:24 < bridge> <totar> lol
02:25 < bridge> <learath2> Jupstar demo’d the accounts along with ddnet-rs at the meetup. You basically get a unique id, you get a global username, you get a per network “semi-global” username, you get your display name
02:26 < bridge> <totar> I count 4 identifiers
02:27 < bridge> <totar> I count 4 identifiers /j
02:27 < bridge> <totar> yeah idk, I don't even remember reading about those in the account information description
02:28 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly, I’m not really the best person sum this up as I don’t really understand it all that well myself, and I was convinced all of the identifiers were useful and necessary for this system to operate with all the design goals. But I have many doubts about UX if deen looked at it like it’s from an alien planet
02:28 < bridge> <totar> I mean to be fair, discord also has the same 4 identifiers kinda
02:28 < bridge> <totar> snowflake, account name, display name, server nickname
02:28 < bridge> <totar> so it's not insane
02:29 < bridge> <learath2> There is also a possibility that I misunderstood something. But if I am misunderstanding it, joe-layman the professional Linear blocker will have a muuch harder time understanding
02:30 < bridge> <learath2> It’s not insane, but it might be too complicated. But anyway, I have made peace with it, if this is the account system we can get merged, I’m ready to compromise a bit on the UX
02:31 < bridge> <totar> I mean this is opinion, some people prefer having competetive username space for simplicity. I would probably do it how old discord did, where you have 
02:31 < bridge> <totar> unique id, username+discriminator and that's it
02:32 < bridge> <learath2> My very first proposal in 2016 (I think), was unique usernames but FFA display names like it is right now
02:33 < bridge> <totar> idk that's fine too
02:33 < bridge> <learath2> Or like steam does it
02:33 < bridge> <totar> popular players will probably whine about not getting their prefered unique username tho
02:33 < bridge> <totar> and maybe validly
02:33 < bridge> <totar> do we really want some random person who isn't Aoe to have the Aoe username
02:34 < bridge> <learath2> Exactly why we just kinda ended up with a design that explicitly does not address any of these controversial issues
02:34 < bridge> <totar> but having 200 Aoe's is maybe not better idk
02:34 < bridge> <learath2> It says nothing about display names, nothing about points, nothing about moderation
02:37 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, I don’t completely understand it and I wouldn’t want to misrepresent other peoples work, so you’ll have to have a chat with the jupman. I really need to sleep, my eyes are half closed
02:39 < bridge> <totar> gn
02:54 < bridge> <kebscs> No denying in that :deen_star:
02:55 < bridge> <kebscs> But even big CEOs step down from their roles to keep the company growing
05:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> require 3k pts or more to get a name xd

05:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> to get a name not an account
05:49 < bridge> <totar> so everyone will play as "account id 1094057561" for the first 3k points?
05:50 < bridge> <totar> they need a name somewhere
05:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> display name != account name
05:51 < bridge> <totar> hmm fair maybe
05:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it could be ~your chosen name
05:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so we dont have to deal with 2 names at once
05:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ~ == guest
05:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `~` == guest
05:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `~` == nameless

05:52 < bridge> <notzxpixty> is it legit

05:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and guessts can be some other symbol
05:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> client cooporation we can turn them into symbols
05:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or have them as "auth levels" -1 = unnamed/not using account name -2 = no account
05:53 < bridge> <totar> I think a better system would something where you upgrade from a discriminator based name to an exclusive unique name that no one else can then use
05:53 < bridge> <totar> 
05:53 < bridge> <totar> so like multiple people are allowed play as ``bun bun#3241`` or ``bun bun#9956`` but once you reach 3k points you can claim the username ``bun bun`` without the discriminator and no one else can use that username regardless.

05:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> people will race to get names but i guess there can always be disputes
05:54 < bridge> <totar> well the racing was gonna happen with your method too
05:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah
05:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont like discriminators
05:54 < bridge> <totar> I do! :D
05:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> unique names ftw
05:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ur opinion is valid
05:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i want to be able to use a non account name
05:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> like for my dummy, my dummy cant also be bun bun
05:55 < bridge> <totar> you can still have display names
05:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> making everyone [D] would be nice
05:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well i guess i would prefer server telling you which one is dummy
05:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i just want a way to tell whos a dummy of who
05:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> unreltaed matter
06:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It is defs bugged. Sometimes severs simply don't respond to a connect request.. No idea why, smth about the dos protection ig. On rus servers it mostly works
06:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Heinrich can only technically merge. But Oy does not want him to actually do it .\_.
08:00 < bridge> <Assa> gumo ^^
09:03 < bridge> <Assa> is there some json or metadata which I can check in order to know which client versions are downloadable?
09:03 < bridge> <Assa> I am sure crawling ddnet.org/downloads is not the correct way 😄
09:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ``git tag``
09:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ? xd
09:15 < bridge> <learath2> As years pass I'm starting to understand more and more why Oy ran things like he used to
09:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ono lerato is doing the oy
09:16 < bridge> <learath2> Just a nice and simple "wontfix". Wanna argue, feel free to just shout into the void
09:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** based 
09:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** aura maintainer
09:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 yea i havent found my inner peace to handle that properly yet. I think having some maintainer with strong opinions who can be stubborn is good. And I can do that to some degree. But then also I dont want to make people sad that want to help, have problems or put time into something you dont like :C 
09:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i guess communicating up front that any contributions might be rejected without the room for discussion even if multiple users want it could help
09:19 < bridge> <learath2> Recently I've come to realize the nicer you are the more people just take advantage. The more willing to discuss things you are the more they will just drag things oon and on
09:21 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** I think there is value in discussion even if you finally as a maintainer decide to ignore other peoples opinion xd
09:21 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i have a little chat with 90% of the cheaters on my fng server before i use rcon
09:22 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** listen to what the others have to say and then based on that decide what to do
09:22 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** even if you decide to fully ignore it
09:23 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but yes it can take time, but then you just have to shutdown the conversation as soon as it starts to spin circles
09:23 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 also pls dont stop to be nice :/ just dont be noob and dont get exploited
09:27 < bridge> <learath2> You know what we need on the team? A villain, someone okay with just being hated
09:36 < bridge> <totar> natural life cycle of open source software
09:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> We have a Heinrich xd
09:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But I think he might be too soft
09:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2: where can I help? I am a villain for hire.
09:55 < bridge> <learath2> Heinrich is an angel, we need an actual demon. "Wontfix", don't like it, cry me a river, making too much noise, banned
09:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I see
09:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I feel like I will be kicked by Heinrich if I do that .\_.
09:56 < bridge> <learath2> You seem to have the same problem that we do, you said you didn't want to make people that worked on stuff sad
09:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I can try
09:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you need me to
09:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Lerato I’ll do anything for you uwu

10:13 < bridge> <learath2> Both steam and website client use the same userdir, inside appdata
10:20 < bridge> <Assa> I think for my purpose rn i can ignore the steam data directories for this
10:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Any C++ std lib enjoyers? How does C++ infer type to be `std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::system_clock, std::chrono::nanoseconds>` from `std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::system_clock>`?
10:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Any C++ std lib enjoyers? How does C++ infer type `std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::system_clock, std::chrono::nanoseconds>` from `std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::system_clock>`?
10:26 < bridge> <learath2> It's the associated duration type for system clock on your implementation
10:26 < bridge> <learath2> `std::system_clock::duration`
10:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ye, I saw that there's such thing, but I don't see how it's used in `std::chrono::time_point`
10:27 < bridge> <learath2> time_point is a template class, the second parameter has a default, it uses the clocks duration
10:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```cpp
10:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     template<typename _Clock, typename _Dur = typename _Clock::duration>
10:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat>       struct time_point;
10:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```

10:53 < bridge> <aegisub> ddnet needs a wm4
10:53 < bridge> <0xdeen> Short term it hurts them, but long term it is good for DDNet and for contributors if they know who they have to talk to about new features and how they should be designed. Less wasted effort, better contributions
10:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** woah a deen
10:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @0xdeen how do they know "who" to talk to?
10:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont have a matrix available right now to see which msg you replied to. But its proably either the dictator or villain one. Either way if you suggest such strategy for ddnet i think the "who" is not obvious
10:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** who makes decisions in this soup of maintainers?
10:58 < bridge> <learath2> He replied to the one where I said you also don't seem to want to be willing to make people sad
10:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ty
10:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** still curious about the "who" part tho
10:59 < bridge> <learath2> Well the soup of maintainers. Not anyone specific
10:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i see
10:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** where a maintainer
10:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i need a maintainer
10:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
10:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** doesnt sound as funny
11:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 wat we do if maintainers disagree?
11:01 < bridge> <learath2> It's not often that that happens, but when it does I guess you need to convince at least 2
11:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wat to do about the epic crypto battle #10634 vs #10636 I do not feel comfortable looking into that ._.

11:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 so its numbers that vote? So I can team up with archimede to veto quic? xd
11:03 < bridge> <learath2> We always have the more equal maintainers to resolve any actual conflict

13:03 < bridge> <learath2> Nice graphs
13:03 < bridge> <Assa> oh it appears the datacollection was wrong on linear for 17.4
13:04 < bridge> <learath2> Did you make sure they all used the same backend?
13:04 < bridge> <Assa> yes, all on vulkan
13:05 < bridge> <Assa> but when creating these, I made 60 second benchmarks instead of 30 before. I noticed but forgot to delete the benchmark for linear on 17.4 apparently xD
13:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** did you make sure they all use the same gpu?
13:05 < bridge> <Assa> ofc it shows "more fps" when you measure frames double
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> yes all on the same gpu, non on onboard gpu (as you can tell from fps

15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> its about him
15:16 < bridge> <Assa> there was a guy ranking all well known mathematicians, ramanujan is S+ rank, we still don't understand everything he did today
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Knew_Infinity
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye sad he died young af
15:17 < bridge> <Assa> imagine beeing so bored at work that you just reinvent math all by yourself
15:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://promptql.io/blog/being-confidently-wrong-is-holding-ai-back
15:22 < bridge> <Assa> AGI is not around the corner (meaing the next few years), but I find ai tools sometimes very useful to perform mundane tasks
15:22 < bridge> <learath2> I had a thought about this a couple weeks back. I was wondering why might AI always be so confidently wrong. I think it might have something to do with the fact that it's trained on just the internet. People on the internet never admit they are wrong, and the people who don't know about something entirely would never even write about that thing
15:22 < bridge> <Assa> like create a python stub that taks x, y, z as argument and use argparse or something
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah, btw also when i ask smth to the ai and i say "im not sure" "maybe im wrong" it ignores it and says "YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!"
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> with a suppositition i mean
15:23 < bridge> <Assa> it turns out that our language model based AIs get smarter with more data, but the rate is log(log(n) and we are almost at the limit of data collection over the internet
15:23 < bridge> <learath2> It always tries to placate too yeah, it just keeps being nice to you at the cost of being inaccurate if need be
15:24 < bridge> <Assa> I experienced the opposite, I gave ai code and just said "please explain what it does". The code I gave it contained a bug and it immediately found it
15:24 < bridge> <learath2> In this specific case I think the data just might not contain enough of people being "wrong" and admitting being wrong 😄
15:27 < bridge> <Assa> it does sometimes tries to placebo you, yes. But I believe a lot can be done with good prompting. I know from chat gpt 3 that asking for an expert or telling it to have 150 iq or more resulted in better answers xD
15:27 < bridge> <chairn> ai is confidently wrong because it doesn't understand what you say, it just predicts the most likely answer
15:28 < bridge> <chairn> understanding is impossible with current architecture
15:28 < bridge> <Assa> true, even for the reasoning models
15:28 < bridge> <melon> > hey AI write me a print function in c++
15:28 < bridge> <melon> 
15:28 < bridge> <melon> hey! sure:
15:28 < bridge> <melon> ```cpp
15:28 < bridge> <melon> void print() {
15:28 < bridge> <melon> std::cout << "hello! 🚀" << std::endl;
15:28 < bridge> <melon> }
15:29 < bridge> <melon> ```
15:29 < bridge> <melon> > wouldnt using std::printf be better here?
15:29 < bridge> <melon> 
15:29 < bridge> <melon> YES! ABSOLUTELY! YOU'RE A GODSENT WHY DIDNT I THINK OF IT, HERES THE CHANGED VERSION!
15:29 < bridge> <melon> in short: i hate AI gaslighting you into making you think you're a genius
15:31 < bridge> <Assa> I wonder what questions you put into it tbh xD
15:33 < bridge> <learath2> gpt5 is a little better at being less like this
15:38 < bridge> <Assa> others say it feels a little "less" human und is unfriendly or professional. I believe it is just more dev-like :kek:
15:38 < bridge> <Assa> others say it feels a little "less" human und is unfriendly or strictly professional. I believe it is just more dev-like :kek:
15:38 < bridge> <learath2> It is unfriendly, I did prefer the tone of gpt4, though I don't really use it all that much tbf
15:39 < bridge> <Assa> I prefer gtp5 currently, it's just more straigt forward
15:39 < bridge> <Assa> I prefer gtp5 currently, it's just more straight forward
15:39 < bridge> <melon> i used AI just for the meme, the only time i actually thought it may help me find the answer i got the most AI answer i've ever seen
15:39 < bridge> <melon> i use AI just for the meme, the only time i actually thought it may help me find the answer i got the most AI answer i've ever seen
15:40 < bridge> <learath2> It's good at mind numbing tasks, like e.g. I wanted to make a copy of my CV with placeholder stuff
15:40 < bridge> <Assa> if you're stuck on a problem you may ask AI for solutions. I find this prompting sometimes really helpful, because not everybody can access the topic expert immediately
15:40 < bridge> <learath2> I cba to lorem ipsum it myself
15:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> more German!
15:42 < bridge> <Assa> I have a general question: Do you think we should add an option to debug rendering? Like show group clips, show automatic quad clips, show sound regions, and stuff like that?
15:44 < bridge> <Assa> I have a general question: Do you think we should add an option to debug rendering? Like show group clips, show automatic quad clips, show sound regions, and stuff like that? We could also add hitboxes of pickups and anything else you might want to debug
15:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> something like the f3 menu in minecraft with all debug info would be nice
15:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> maybe position/velocity/angle hud could also be moved there
15:47 < bridge> <Assa> this exists already, this is basically strg + shift + d
15:47 < bridge> <Assa> i mean cntrl ofc
15:48 < bridge> <Assa> I mean another thing which also exists in minecraft, where you can see hitboxes of mobs or chunks
15:48 < bridge> <Assa> chunks would be the group and quad clips in comparison
15:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> it has much less info and pressing shift also triggers the emoticon menu which is annoying
15:50 < bridge> <Assa> "less info"? it contains a shitload of info and you can even have more info with cntrl + shift + g
15:50 < bridge> <Assa> we have that as hud elements, I like it like that
15:50 < bridge> <Assa> this is also useful information for a player
15:51 < bridge> <Assa> this is also useful information for a player for gameplay (yes even the position and the tile offsets, but to know this you need to be a pro)
16:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kollpotato bind issue my emote menu is on "f"
16:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> default binds should not overlap

16:05 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Emote bind on E (it stands for emote)

16:37 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon what do we do about envelope sync?
16:37 < ChillerDragon> oof
16:37 < ChillerDragon> we wait for avo maybe?
16:38 < bridge> <Assa> avo answered
16:38 < bridge> <Assa> not in the thread, but in the discord
16:38 < bridge> <learath2> You definitely wait for Avo, and come up with a plan on what happens to old maps
16:39 < bridge> <Assa> I provided a conversion script for avo, old maps should not be affected in any way
16:39 < bridge> <Assa> we don't have that q-move feature at ddnet
16:40 < bridge> <Assa> I provided a conversion script for avo, old maps should not be affected in any negative way
16:40 < bridge> <learath2> What was broken with Sync in general anyway?
16:40 < bridge> <Assa> sync and unsyc both sync to server time because they use the same static variable. And syncing doesn't sync with start time
16:40 < bridge> <Assa> sync and unsyc both sync to server time because they use the same static variable. And syncing doesn't sync with start time, as it's supposed to
16:40 < bridge> <learath2> So it effectively did nothing?
16:40 < bridge> <Assa> so envelopes basically sync to random server time no matter when you join
16:41 < bridge> <Assa> yes, it does nothing
16:41 < bridge> <learath2> Q: What happens to maps when you fix it? Won't they look different now that it does something?
16:41 < bridge> <Assa> that's why I wrote, either fix it or patch it out.
16:42 < bridge> <Assa> they are synced to server time, they look different every time you rejoin a server anyway. When I fix it, envelopes sync on the start line, which breaks nothing, because nothing syncs with gameplay
16:42 < bridge> <Assa> they are synced to server time, they look different every time you rejoin a server anyway. When I fix it, envelopes sync on the start line time, which breaks nothing, because nothing syncs with gameplay
16:42 < bridge> <Assa> they are synced to server time, they look different every time you rejoin a server anyway. When I fix it, envelopes sync on the start line time, which breaks nothing, because nothing synced with gameplay before anyway
16:43 < bridge> <Assa> do you understand my problem with it?
16:44 < bridge> <Assa> like it doesn't matter if I reset it on the start line, because the behaviour befor is essentially **random** anyways
16:44 < bridge> <Assa> like it doesn't matter if I reset it on the start line, because the behaviour before is essentially **random** anyways
16:44 < bridge> <learath2> But isn't the old behaviour at least continuous? Like won't fixing this cause crossing the start line to make animation jumps?
16:44 < bridge> <Assa> sb broke maps 6 years ago by disabling this
16:45 < bridge> <Assa> test the PR, it flicks once and stops until you leave the start line
16:45 < bridge> <Assa> test the PR, it flicks once and stops until you leave the start line. I put a lot of effort in not making it flickering
16:45 < bridge> <learath2> let me check what happened there, let's not reintroduce some other bug
16:46 < bridge> <Assa> I can tell you, the map `Caveing I` ? or similar broke
16:46 < bridge> <Assa> because there was an unsynced basically random envelope, which turned the map pitch black
16:46 < bridge> <Assa> therefore this feature was disabled **which didn't even fix the issue** and the map was fixed later
16:47 < bridge> <Assa> let me look what the map was, but I found it in bugs and pinged robyt a week ago
16:47 < bridge> <learath2> do you know the commit that fixed this?
16:48 < bridge> <learath2> or "didn't fix it" or disabled the feature
16:48 < bridge> <Assa> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/757720336274948198/1211244170275201055
16:48 < bridge> <Assa> hmm hard to tell, because this code moved a lot as well, give me a sec
16:56 < bridge> <Assa> I found this old issue which desibes the bug when it came out: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/755
16:57 < bridge> <louis> sync changed to server time lots of updates aho in ddnet 10 i think
16:57 < bridge> <louis> both ways of syncing are useful though
16:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa discord answer does not count. If its not on github it doesnt help.
16:58 < bridge> <Assa> took me a lot of digging, this PR caused it: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/602
16:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you can repost there. But i like to see all updated kog maps released on official server before merge.
16:59 < bridge> <Assa> both times sync to server time, so no sync is broken.
16:59 < bridge> <learath2> Heh, I remember this
17:00 < bridge> <louis> wdym
17:00 < bridge> <learath2> So, does the "Sync" option do what heinrich claimed there?
17:01 < bridge> <Assa> heinrich is totally wrong there, this is not was sync does and never what sync was supposed to do
17:01 < bridge> <Assa> Look at the tooltip
17:02 < bridge> <Assa> posted the tooltip description here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10678#issuecomment-3188023780
17:02 < bridge> <Assa> both sync to server time, they are equal.
17:02 < bridge> <louis> oh ye u mean the ticked and unticked box
17:03 < bridge> <Assa> i mean the envelope box `sync` ye
17:03 < bridge> <learath2> Ok, I now remember what happened here
17:04 < bridge> <Assa> I like how the other person in this thread says "then the description is wrong" and this never got changed in 6 years
17:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** where @Nimda announcing map releases in #developer https://ddnet.org/irclogs/2017-01-04.log
17:04 < bridge> <Assa> I like how the other person in this thread says "then the description is wrong" and this never got changed in 8 years
17:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** woah even github integration on irc
17:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** seems like 2017 was the golden age of ddnet
17:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> xd i was just browsing this channel today and saw nimda
17:05 < bridge> <learath2> Sync is a vanilla thing, it really was for making sure animations looked the exact same for all clients. Then ddrace (and other race modes) started using the game timer instead of the ugly broadcast timer when we switched to 0.6. That changed the meaning of "Sync" to the one you see in the tooltip. When necropotame moved the run timer from the game timer to the warmup timer, Sync reverted back to it's meaning from vanilla
17:06 < bridge> <learath2> Now, the question is I don't quite remember what non-"Sync" envelopes do in vanilla
17:07 < bridge> <Assa> they were probably supposed to sync to client time instead, but the current implemenation doesn't do that, because it uses the same static s_Time

17:07 < bridge> <Assa> so currently everything just syncs to server time
17:07 < bridge> <learath2> Can you show me where this is for posterity?
17:08 < bridge> <Assa> "probably", because the code for this works on client time. Problem is that it's bugged xD
17:08 < bridge> <Assa> I can give you a link to it's current implementation working on client time and point out why it's bugged
17:09 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, that's enough
17:09 < bridge> <learath2> I can track it back into teeworlds and see what happened there
17:10 < bridge> <Assa> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/236b73df7a89674660e7b5cf2333e6e175e04522/src/game/client/components/maplayers.cpp#L49
17:11 < bridge> <Assa> this is the current bugged line, working on statis s_Time, which gets synced to server time in the code above, since it's static
17:11 < bridge> <Assa> this is the current bugged line, working on static s_Time, which gets synced to server time in the code above, since it's static
17:13 < bridge> <Assa> Now if you are really smart you notice, that unsynced envelopes behave differently, if the map doesn't contain any synced envelope, which still doesn't matter for ddnet, because the start time is essentially random. But it matters for avos Q-Move things
17:13 < bridge> <learath2> I see, there is only one s_Time, so if there are any synchronized components it all becomes synced
17:13 < bridge> <Assa> Now if you are really smart you notice, that unsynced envelopes behave differently, if the map doesn't contain any synced envelope, which still doesn't matter for ddnet, because the start time is essentially random. But it matters for avos Q-Move things, which is why it adds an unused sync envelope
17:13 < bridge> <learath2> And it's still broken in teeworlds too btw, just took a look at vanilla
17:13 < bridge> <Assa> exactly
17:15 < bridge> <learath2> Ok, so what is the plan with kog moving quads? You gave them a script to fix their maps? I guess all of the envelopes just need to become sync and it'll be just fine no matter the version
17:15 < bridge> <Assa> they actually need to become unsyced, so the startline doesn't reset them, because they are synced to server time anyway
17:16 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, you want to make Sync mean what it used to mean with the game-timer racetimer. So make it work as the tooltip suggests
17:16 < bridge> <Assa> yes
17:17 < bridge> <Assa> I had a community vote btw, if they should be stopped before the start line or reset, they wanted the reset
17:17 < bridge> <learath2> I guess there isn't much value in a client time envelope anyway, right? Should we provide that option too maybe as an extension while we are at it?
17:18 < bridge> <Assa> there is no value in client time envelope* except for offline background maps
17:18 < bridge> <learath2> Mh, really?
17:18 < bridge> <Assa> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/295908390956433410/1405499738924777503
17:18 < bridge> <Assa> I know, it's not _very_ representative
17:18 < bridge> <Assa> but better than nothing
17:19 < bridge> <learath2> How does your patch handle that? If Sync = race time, non-Sync = server time
17:19 < bridge> <learath2> If no server time available use client time?
17:19 < bridge> <Assa> server time is always available, race time not
17:20 < bridge> <learath2> Really? `pGameClient->m_Snap.m_pGameInfoObj` won't be null while you are in the main menu?
17:20 < bridge> <Assa> if the race didn't yet, the snap contains positive warmup values and if you start the race, the warmup time ticks negative from 0 :pepeW:  whoever did it shall burn in hell
17:20 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, yes yes, sync is backwards, to what the vanilla one means
17:21 < bridge> <Assa> there is the m_Online variable
17:22 < bridge> <Assa> there is the `OnlineOnly` variable
17:22 < bridge> <Assa> maplayers get initialized with OnlineOnly if you join a game, for background it gets initialized with "false"
17:23 < bridge> <Assa> I guess I could also check for a gamesnap beeing present 👍  and fall back to offline time
17:23 < bridge> <learath2> Q: Should we maybe abstract these time calculations and stuff out of the individual components? `Client()->LocalTime()` and `Client()->OnlineTime()`?
17:24 < bridge> <Assa> imo yes, what do you mean by OnlineTime?
17:24 < bridge> <Assa> GameTick?
17:25 < bridge> <learath2> `Client()->LocalTime()` would be the local client time that just keeps ticking up
17:25 < bridge> <learath2> `Client()->OnlineTime()` would be the "server time" the game tick
17:25 < bridge> <learath2> `Client()->RaceTime()` could be for the "race timer"
17:25 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe `ServerTime()` would be a more appropriate name for it?
17:26 < bridge> <learath2> Ah it seems we already do have a `LocalTime`
17:26 < bridge> <Assa> you also need the prediction time variants and intra ticks and the race time is just the negative warmup time :pepeW:
17:26 < bridge> <Assa> btw I noticed, that the game tick only increases in steps of 2 and the intratick was really bad
17:27 < bridge> <Assa> btw I noticed, that the game tick only increases in steps of 2 and the intratick was really ~~bad~~ inaccurate
17:27 < bridge> <Assa> oh yeah and because the gametick jumps in steps of 2, the intratick goes over 1 which is also unexpected
17:28 < ChillerDragon> i have a case of spacebard heating: screenshots used to cause a frame lag for me, they no longer do. Now i dont know if the screenshot was taken or not xd, there is no more feedback
17:28 < bridge> <Assa> press f1
17:28 < ChillerDragon> guess my screenshot binds needs a ;echo screenshot
17:28 < ChillerDragon> ye f1 pressing i do but its annoying
17:29 < bridge> <Assa> maybe we should have a camera icon fading out
17:29 < bridge> <Assa> @learath2 so what do we do with sync now?
17:31 < bridge> <learath2> The gametick goes up by 2 because of the snaprate yeah
17:32 < bridge> <learath2> I think you make a good case and seem to have a plan for the only use that would break. I think it can be merged
17:32 < bridge> <learath2> Just let me actually take a look at how you coded it
17:32 < bridge> <Assa> trust me I spend a lot of time in it to make it actually work. Timing things is hard and I was breaking over this issue
17:33 < bridge> <Assa> "why is it still flickering" until I found out that the intraticks still update when nothing else does
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why is my pw not workin anymore in zillyhuhn
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and can i use chillerbot in offtopic over there?
17:34 < bridge> <learath2> e.g. `-WarmupTimer` being used without checking for `GAMESTATEFLAG_RACETIME` feels sus to me
17:34 < bridge> <Assa> I took a look at the hud code, sec
17:36 < bridge> <Assa> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/236b73df7a89674660e7b5cf2333e6e175e04522/src/game/client/components/hud.cpp#L126
17:36 < bridge> <Assa> 
17:36 < bridge> <Assa> Hud also doesn't check for that gameflag afaict
17:36 < bridge> <Assa> it checks for sudden death 🤔 but because it doesn't render the timer then
17:37 < bridge> <Assa> wait in one part it checks for this flag, in another it doesn't
17:37 < bridge> <Assa> :pepeRage:
17:38 < bridge> <learath2> That case is for the normal timer I think
17:38 < bridge> <learath2> It used to be !warmuptimer, then necropotame made it <= 0, curious
17:39 < bridge> <Assa> yes the warmup timer runs backwards beginning from the race start
17:39 < bridge> <learath2> That case looks wrong to me
17:39 < bridge> <Assa> so if it's -120, your race start was 120 ticks ago
17:39 < bridge> <learath2> We only get our proper race timer because we don't set a timelimit
17:40 < bridge> <Assa> time is just a conzept :pepeW:  so are timeouts
17:40 < bridge> <Assa> time is just a concept :pepeW:  so are timeouts
17:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar2 ur pw should still work but there is no bot in #off-topic :c what do u need?
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Neither Jupstar nor Jupstar2 work with the pw
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I just want to spam the bot xd
17:43 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, you should be checking for `GAMESTATEFLAG_RACETIME` but there is also `CurrentRaceTime` and `LastRaceTick` I wonder why these aren't just used
17:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** click the i forgot pw link
17:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** jk there isnt any
17:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** u fucked
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rest in pieces
17:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lemme see if u can boot the bot again
17:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ah sec
17:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** gores
17:44 < bridge> <Assa> I'll update the code
17:45 < bridge> <learath2> We should sit down and unify all these timers everywhere one day
17:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ddnet meetings when
17:46 < bridge> <learath2> It sounds like something that would fit very well in @robyt3's billion line long TODO file
17:46 < bridge> <Assa> I am willing to do that, after fixing synchronized envelopes
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Lets meet in Luxembourg
17:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** im in
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> For the rich ppl
17:46 < bridge> <Assa> I am for switzerland (so I can visit my gf)
17:46 < bridge> <learath2> Berlin next
17:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** everything nice
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No not Berlin
17:47 < bridge> <learath2> Yes Berlin
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> North sea is nice
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We can buy a whole house cheap in non-main season
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Geming hosue
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Geming house
17:48 < bridge> <teero777> north sea is nice
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @teero777 sry for offtopic, but should I go shopping now or later
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I am so undecided
17:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
17:51 < bridge> <learath2> order
17:51 < bridge> <Assa> now, you'll enjoy the things you bought at the evening :owo:
17:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** intensive decision making about env sync bugs that will last decades happening ... meanwhile jopsti: shopping?????
17:52 < bridge> <teero777> go now so you have snacks later
17:53 < bridge> <teero777> do twitch livesteam
17:53 < bridge> <teero777> do twitch livestream
17:53 < bridge> <Assa> fixed/added and tested ingame ✅
17:54 < bridge> <Assa> in the end patching sync out is also an option, I just need to have this clarified before implementing recorder tiles :owo:
17:54 < bridge> <Assa> beeing able to synchronize envelopes to gameplay is huge
17:55 < bridge> <learath2> I actually don't feel so good rn. I'll go distract myself a bit. I'll try to review it later, maybe after some food
17:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ offtopic bot is on just create jupsti3 with signup token  nimrocks
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oke
17:55 < bridge> <Assa> okay, bless you and get well 🙂 have a nice evening and a good dinner 👍 thank you for caring
17:56 < bridge> <Assa> I also don't feel so good after 2 L coffee :nouis:
17:57 < bridge> <Assa> Are any of you coffeine addicted as well?
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You have 2 gf or why are you so nice
17:57 < bridge> <Assa> me?
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> One in swizzerland one in germany
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> player
17:58 < bridge> <Assa> no, I have one girlfriend who lives in switzerland, but was 3 months in germany for an apprentice ship (Praktikum?)
18:00 < bridge> <Assa> I try to be always nice to people and I have high regards for the devs here. Mabye because they spend a lot of time working for free for a sometimes thankless community
18:00 < bridge> <Assa> this inkcludes you @jupeyy_keks :owo:
18:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** josspit the goat
18:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i also like coffee :coffee: 
18:01 < bridge> <Assa> at work I have to answer on a helpdesk where users write tickets
18:01 < bridge> <Assa> if you have ever done that, you had days where you want to grab the manual and punch it so much at the users head until it goes in
18:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** rtfm mentioned
18:09 < bridge> <kebscs> no 🙂
18:13 < bridge> <melon> no(t as much as I used to)
18:13 < bridge> <melon> I'll have a cup o coffee here and there but I started drinking more tea :)
18:17 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon anything you want me to review (except the android thing)?
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> great my internet is down
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> friday night
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> probs no internet till monday
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> god bless me
18:22 < bridge> <melon> you can dip into development the entire weekend!!!!
18:23 < bridge> <louis> just self host internet
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> router doesnt connect to fiber sudeenly
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> i love my luck
18:30 < bridge> <Assa> sounds like a WAN problem
18:31 < bridge> <Assa> you may ask your neighbors if they have issues
18:42 < bridge> <imilchshake> Omg DDNet hackathon
18:42 < bridge> <imilchshake> :deen_star:
18:42 < bridge> <imilchshake> I'd take vacation days for that
18:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa idk
19:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got a tech person to come tomorrow morning
19:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill drinl the night away
19:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would go too sounds pog
19:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> we have the rust room and the c room
19:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> and battle it out
19:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
19:27 < bridge> <Assa> so vikings vs weebs with in high socks? big /s
19:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont look weeb
19:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> probs more viking when i forget to shabe xd

20:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: you use neovim, right?
20:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I have this annoying bug when I open LSP hover window it doesn't close when I go to definition :\ Do you have anything like that?
20:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/34946 this is probably the fix
20:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** how do u know?
20:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fanspin and `top` ? 
20:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ah you mean the window 
20:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** not a lsp running in the background when vim is closed
20:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes i have that too its new also sometimes causes some big traces to be printed when i dont close it and carry on xd
20:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but idc much @milkeeycat i am more worried about the assert that ruins my progress
20:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/27196 this is the worst
20:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Never happened to me xd
20:58 < bridge> <kebscs> @louis.place are you working on the target switches?
20:59 < bridge> <kebscs> or can i resolve comments and add prediction
20:59 < bridge> <louis> i been a bit busy
20:59 < bridge> <louis> feel free to code on it though
20:59 < bridge> <louis> do u want perms on my branch?
21:00 < bridge> <kebscs> sure
21:00 < bridge> <kebscs> how does that work
21:00 < bridge> <kebscs> will i be able to just push to it?
21:00 < bridge> <louis> not sure but probably, i'll just give u access to my ddnet fork i think
21:00 < bridge> <louis> ill add in the sounds and particles sometime soon i hope too
21:02 < bridge> <kebscs> alr
21:02 < bridge> <Assa> I can send the sounds I made to kebs as well
21:02 < bridge> <louis> https://github.com/l-ouis/ddnet/tree/switch-body invite should be sent to your email or notifs
21:02 < bridge> <kebscs> ok got it
21:13 < bridge> <Assa> anyone else opinions on sounds for the targets? Currently we have the following:
21:13 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1408529542611468389/target_short_ding_sound_1.wav?ex=68aa12dc&is=68a8c15c&hm=7b1b8e34d4de39012a57933befa423ad0da3586b804750c6d7f2d137ec56f153&
21:13 < bridge> <Assa> I know Kebs 😄 I want to ask others as well
21:13 < bridge> <pioooooo> pipe
21:14 < bridge> <Assa> you mean like this? https://pixabay.com/de/sound-effects/metal-pipe-230698/
21:15 < bridge> <pioooooo> :kek:
21:15 < bridge> <Assa> probably something like this would also work: https://pixabay.com/de/sound-effects/metal-pipe-357573/
21:15 < bridge> <kebscs> <https://freesound.org/people/willc2_45220/sounds/73264/>
21:16 < bridge> <kebscs> i like this one
21:16 < bridge> <kebscs> assa's sounds are church bell for me
21:16 < bridge> <Assa> i think it sounds a bit too blechern, like abgedämpft, hmm
21:16 < bridge> <Assa> grr
21:16 < bridge> <Assa> **dampened**
21:17 < bridge> <pioooooo> This is better
21:18 < bridge> <Assa> I got an actual church bell I used in a map, it sounds very different
21:19 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1408530939536998460/bell.opus?ex=68aa1429&is=68a8c2a9&hm=470da1ec60bcbc06029b262ddeb90d51f00191c0f20decfe8559a56c13266bf8&
21:19 < bridge> <kebscs> Maybe could be bit higher
21:19 < bridge> <kebscs> But if you have a lot of hard on ear sounds it's not good when you git few targets at once
21:19 < bridge> <Assa> yeah I see that
21:19 < bridge> <kebscs> With current sound what was in the pr I placed 100 targets and did ninja strike through it
21:20 < bridge> <kebscs> Volume got very high
21:20 < bridge> <Assa> we need at least 3 different variants
21:20 < bridge> <Assa> oh you should adjust the volume in the game not in the files
21:20 < bridge> <Assa> oh you should adjust the volume in the game not in the files (for a sound source)
21:20 < bridge> <Assa> oh you should adjust the volume in the game not in the files (for a sound source not by settings or something)
21:21 < bridge> <kebscs> Volume is good, unless you hit few at once
21:21 < bridge> <kebscs> Couldn't be 1 with varying pitch by a little?
21:25 < bridge> <Assa> yeye, I made it like this for the others as well
21:25 < bridge> <Assa> checking out other sounds currently
21:25 < bridge> <Assa> https://pixabay.com/de/sound-effects/hotel-bell-ding-2-202586/
21:25 < bridge> <Assa> xD
21:28 < bridge> <robyt3> Note that we also need to include the license of the sounds, unless you are creating them yourself :justatest:
21:28 < bridge> <Assa> the one you send reminds me of getting a frying pan and hitting it with a wooden spoon
21:28 < bridge> <Assa> brb hitting a frying pan
21:32 < bridge> <learath2> Not a huge fan
21:32 < bridge> <Assa> turns out pots sound better
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> interview secured for next week
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> they wanna whiteboard in C++ :justatest:
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> time to get practicing
21:33 < bridge> <learath2> how about something more along these lines?
21:33 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1408534587646283959/light-switch-382712.mp3?ex=68aa178f&is=68a8c60f&hm=9c7df48f6a4dd0062cd6a7ffacea12be7573c2f266e3b775561249390125d8cb&
21:37 < bridge> <Assa> would also work, but I'd remove the first click (the silent one)
21:37 < bridge> <learath2> was more as a general idea yeah, something "switchy"
21:39 < bridge> <kebscs> the target graphic reminds me of a pan so that checks out
21:39 < bridge> <kebscs> and youre close the sound description is "A single metallic ding sound created by striking a chopstick onto a can" 😂
21:40 < bridge> <Assa> the closest sound to this I was able to create was with a pot and a wood spoon xD but I don't hit it like I want to
21:42 < bridge> <Assa> I think my mic is too bad for this ._.
21:42 < bridge> <learath2> Any foley artists in here?
21:43 < bridge> <Assa> I know ^^ I am doing sounds myself, the orgle music in kings leap was also self written
21:43 < bridge> <Assa> I know ^^ I am doing sounds myself, the ~~orgel~~ organ music in kings leap was also self written
21:44 < bridge> <learath2> A coin being tapped on its face on a desk doesn't sound too bad
21:45 < bridge> <Assa> I know ^^ I am doing sounds myself, the ~~orgel~~ organ music in kings leap was also self written (nobody asked me ever about it 🙁 because everyone mutes the game and nobody cares)
21:46 < bridge> <kebscs> noone puts this much effort into map
21:46 < bridge> <kebscs> thought its some free sound
21:48 < bridge> <Assa> except me, I spend over 100 hours on this map mapping
21:48 < bridge> <kebscs> why gave up on it being solo :/
21:48 < bridge> <learath2> How about this full sound on every hit?
21:49 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1408538465607614655/metal-pipe-329305.mp3?ex=68aa1b2b&is=68a8c9ab&hm=de77e27735edd07fbf2db3095dab02889654aaa82418e788dc2bc4dc47ee0036&
21:49 < bridge> <Assa> I prefered it beeing released
21:50 < bridge> <Assa> @learath2 made the joke already
21:52 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, I'd prefer to not have anything metallic if possible, or maybe very subtly metallic. Thuds or thumps re-timed or trimmed could be an idea, a switch sound could be another
21:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> there is a website for making short sound effects https://sfxr.me/
21:54 < bridge> <Assa> 8 bit sounds don't match here
21:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> how much bits do u need?
21:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> there is an option for 16 bits
21:59 < bridge> <learath2> it's not the amount of bits, it's the way these sounds are generated from very simple envelopes and very simple filters that create this artificial feeling to the sounds
22:03 < bridge> <robyt3> I was hoping for the mysterious metal pipe sound effect from Goldeneye 64's music
22:03 < bridge> <learath2> I guess it can make some decent thuds though
22:03 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1408542132486012958/pickupCoin.wav?ex=68aa1e95&is=68a8cd15&hm=aa61ff8575adb5369e7b70308689d287710c70ba93f19fe6cc3dc7447e6819c7&
22:03 < bridge> <learath2> Still very machiney
22:04 < bridge> <kollpotato> so u guys plan to make irl sound effects? (just curious)
22:04 < bridge> <learath2> Still a fun tool, I might use this later in something else
22:04 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1408542394256986122/pickupCoin1.wav?ex=68aa1ed4&is=68a8cd54&hm=242be4d946930c1d4cf5649c3c4ab3a7f53f0f774347ea8e82a9897303a260ce&
22:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Reaper is close enough to free if you feel like using serious software
22:05 < bridge> <learath2> Or take them from some other place. I think pretty much every sound effect in teeworlds is done like that
22:06 < bridge> <learath2> You know what, I like the vibes of this product
22:06 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1408542828761579520/image.png?ex=68aa1f3b&is=68a8cdbb&hm=0498843e77acd1cd62c57cd6870009d72aa77fd02407d0cd5f830edb4a7e6bc7&
22:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's nagware that costs like $50 ish for a license if you wanna use it professionally
22:11 < bridge> <learath2> Is there open source audio software?
22:11 < bridge> <learath2> I guess Goldwave exists, but it's not like this
22:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah LMMS is one but it's not so hot
22:11 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym?
22:12 < bridge> <learath2> I guess Audacity exists, but it's not like this
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> there are several different types of audio software
22:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's aight ig
22:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah Audacity for basic edits is great
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> tenacity exists. audacity is not really open source anymore
22:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> :(
22:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://ardour.org/
22:13 < bridge> <learath2> what happened there?
22:13 < bridge> <Ewan> ever since it was acquired by Muse Group (same people who own Ultimate Guitar and Musescore, also partly owned by the YouTuber Tantacrul) they made some unusual licensing changes which made it so people under a certain age couldn't use the software
22:13 < bridge> <louis> open source daws suck in my experience
22:13 < bridge> <Ewan> they backpedaled a lot
22:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> new sounds!?!?!
22:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> can we get new sound for vote seperate from chat ping!!
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> OSS daws kinda suck. people are really ride or die for reaper, it's the closest you can really get. LMMS is OK, there's another more recent GTK one i forgot the name of but it was not stable at all last i used it
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> started with a Z
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> but  you really have to define your requirements further, there are so many different kinds of audio software that we;re sorta comparing apples to oranges
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> I think it started when they added telemetry to audacity
22:14 < bridge> <louis> would be nice
22:15 < bridge> <learath2> I did not know telemetry was not allowed :pepeW:
22:15 < bridge> <learath2> Was it opt-out?
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i applied for a job at muse to work on MuseScore doing C++/Qt stuff but they already hired a person by the time i did the interview
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> it would've been cool but i would have had to be nocturnal because the job is in italy
22:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i already was more or less nocturnal at time tho
22:16 < bridge> <Ewan> https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/audacitys-new-owner-is-in-another-fight-with-the-open-source-community/
22:16 < bridge> <robyt3> AFAICT it even was opt-in
22:16 < bridge> <robyt3> https://github.com/audacity/audacity/pull/835
22:17 < bridge> <Ewan> have they even shipped a Qt version yet? i know that port was one of their main focuses
22:17 < bridge> <Ewan> they had jobs open at muse for porting audacity from WxWidgets to Qt
22:17 < bridge> <Ewan> around that time
22:19 < bridge> <learath2> Note to self, we shouldn't add telemetry to ddnet
22:19 < bridge> <Ewan> f3
22:19 < bridge> <Ewan> unrelated, has anyone here ever used CoderPad? is there a way I can use the site to stage my own practice interview?
22:19 < bridge> <Ewan> im scared shitless for this C++ whiteboarding
22:19 < bridge> <Ewan> 3-4 technical interviews
22:20 < bridge> <louis> in my experience it's basically google docs with syntax highlighting
22:20 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
22:20 < bridge> <Ewan> they told me that's what they'll be using but maybe i'm better off grinding leetcode intermediate questions for now
22:20 < bridge> <louis> uhhh, but i think it depends on the company interviewing. some might just use it as a whiteboard others might have practice questions and actual execution
22:21 < bridge> <robyt3> I guess sending the data to the likes of Google and Yandex was the main issue of this PR
22:22 < bridge> <learath2> amazon used their own internal coding thing for the interview, only syntax highlighting, they just pasted in questions and watched you solve them
22:23 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, yeah I see why that might be an issue. I was very confused why people would be so mad at just opt-in telemetry
22:24 < bridge> <learath2> I browsed around a couple websites and found leetcode to be the most pleasant with the quality of the questions being high
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i think they've been around the longest
22:25 < bridge> <learath2> Hackerrank has autocomplete in their free version, which is nicer, but honestly you won't get autocomplete in the interview
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
22:25 < bridge> <learath2> and hackerrank questions are just flat out wrong sometimes
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> that seems like it wouldn't help me prep for this
22:26 < bridge> <louis> out of curiousity what company? if u dont mind
22:26 < bridge> <learath2> (though btw practicing didn't really help me all that much, deen was right that they seemed more interested in how I approached things rather than the ability to come up with the perfect solution immediately)
22:27 < bridge> <Ewan> "Magnite - The Largest Independent Sell-Side Advertising Company"
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> i was told the team i'm on is responsible for delegating which ads to run & to whom based on the highest bidder in their pool of advertisements for any particular slot
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> a slot being those involuntary ad breaks you get watching a show on hulu or whatever
22:29 < bridge> <Ewan> well
22:29 < bridge> <Ewan> the team i'd be on lol
22:29 < bridge> <Ewan> theoretically
22:30 < bridge> <learath2> When is your interview?
22:30 < bridge> <Ewan> next week
22:30 < bridge> <Ewan> she said the hiring manager is out for a few days
22:30 < bridge> <Ewan> but we need him for the interview
22:31 < bridge> <learath2> Well good luck
22:31 < bridge> <Ewan> thanks
22:32 < bridge> <Ewan> i also applied to a part-time job at Thekla (Jonathan Blow's game studio, he made the game Braid & the studio as a whole was responsible for The Witness)
22:32 < bridge> <Ewan> on-site job migrating all their infrastructure (CI and source control) from rented servers to on-premises hardware
22:33 < bridge> <Ewan> so i'd theoretically build the servers, flash them, and get all their services running with backups and stuff, then it'd taper off because there's not much else to do at that point
22:33 < bridge> <Ewan> it sounds like it'd be perfect for nixos
22:33 < bridge> <Ewan> assuming i get to make that call
22:33 < bridge> <Ewan> er, whoever gets the role
22:35 < bridge> <kebscs> @louis.place did you delete GetWeaklyHit etc
22:35 < bridge> <kebscs> or did i break smth, bcs they disappeared after rebase
22:35 < bridge> <Assa> if you get the job can you fix the fucking issue I got with prime?
22:36 < bridge> <louis> uhhh idk i mightve deleted it, it mightve been passed as an optional flag in the normal hit function?
22:36 < bridge> <kebscs> idk i can still hit it with gun
22:36 < bridge> <louis> not sure the best way to go abt it. Also delay with alternatating switch is really freaky so i'm not sure if the pr should support it
22:36 < bridge> <learath2> They already rejected me. I have a feeling it was because of the third dude I interviewed with. I just fumbled his question too badly
22:37 < bridge> <louis> hmm maybe i deleted it, not sure. it was like 5 lines though
22:37 < bridge> <Assa> then F them I guess
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> rip lerato. you will get them next time
22:37 < bridge> <learath2> I just don’t seem to be compatible with how they do hiring in this sector. Or I need to be on benzos like permanently
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> questionable life hack: have you ever tried valium before an interview
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> LMFAO
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> not benzos but same vibes
22:38 < bridge> <kebscs> idk, could you check if it didnt delete smth by accident <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10529/files>
22:38 < bridge> <kebscs> idk, could you quick check if it didnt delete smth by accident <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10529/files>
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> apparently it is
22:39 < bridge> <Assa> thinking about cancelling prime
22:40 < bridge> <louis> hmm @kebscs does the moving work on branch now
22:40 < bridge> <louis> maybe iforgot to push it or smth lmao
22:41 < bridge> <louis> if so that's my bad
22:41 < bridge> <louis> hmm @kebscs does the moving work on the current branch
22:41 < bridge> <learath2> I just don’t function well under stress, (and to be fair IMO their question was stupid, it was object oriented design and they looked at me like an alien for not wanting to put something in a throwaway class with a single method)
22:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> leet code shit
22:42 < bridge> <kebscs> no
22:42 < bridge> <kebscs> i think i broke it
22:42 < bridge> <kebscs> idk how, do you have that commit saved?
22:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> I feel that part about stress very deeply.
22:43 < bridge> <learath2> He did seem interested in the cute platformer game thing. I wonder if he’d join here sometime
22:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i found leetcode pretty fun when i had the willpower to grind on the same issue for hours on end for fun in HS
22:44 < bridge> <Ewan> i would sit in the hallways at school while ditching class working on easy/intermediate LC problems
22:44 < bridge> <Ewan> but now i get so distracted
22:44 < bridge> <louis> @kebscs  <https://github.com/l-ouis/ddnet/tree/switch-body-bckp> for my latest local changes
22:44 < bridge> <louis> maybe u accidentally forced pushed a commit too far back, not sure either
22:45 < bridge> <louis> @kebscs  <https://github.com/l-ouis/ddnet/tree/switch-body-bckp> for the latest changes from me
22:45 < bridge> <learath2> I never enjoyed lc. I still don’t, it’s like a completely different thing
22:45 < bridge> <kebscs> ty
22:45 < bridge> <kebscs> this looks more like it
22:45 < bridge> <learath2> I do enjoy solving linked list questions, but only because I get to mess around with pointers
22:46 < bridge> <Ewan> it's coding for the sake of coding instead of an end result
22:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> yeah
22:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> comparable to doing a sudoku
22:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> comparable to solving a sudoku
22:46 < bridge> <learath2> Whenever someone asks me I give the analogy of an accountant being asked to do recreational math
22:48 < bridge> <Assa> I'd love an interview where they'd just give me a problem and ask 'write a program to solve it'
22:49 < bridge> <jxsl13> and the actual program is required to check whether your application ever stops :justatest:
22:49 < bridge> <learath2> Probably not all that practical sadly
22:51 < bridge> <Assa> but it shows a lot about a developer, style, organization, documentation
22:51 < bridge> <learath2> In this session we’ll ask you to write a program that calculates BB(6) in polynomial time. You have an hour, go
22:51 < bridge> <Assa> xD
22:52 < bridge> <Assa> writes a proof that this is impossible
22:53 < bridge> <learath2> “This proof is not novel”
22:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> application rejected
22:54 < bridge> <Assa> thanks for wasting my time
22:55 < bridge> <Ewan> same, you're never gonna be plopped into a scenario where you have to sort robots based on which ones have dealt damage to one another or whatever. if  you're working on a deep scenario like that, you likely put yourself there
22:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm hiring a graphics programmer
22:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> "implement Metropolis light transport"
22:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> :greenthing:
22:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i'd rather deal with the thing top to bottom
22:56 < bridge> <Ewan> i had no idea that was a thing
22:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> I thought I banner you, risu 👀
22:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> banned
22:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> tell us more, risu
22:57 < bridge> <Assa> Some interviews ask horendous things and then the job is just sys admin in the end
22:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's escaping me right now but there was a light transport method so complicated that only like the writer of the original paper properly understood it
22:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but it was also the fastest method lol
22:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> windows sys admin is horrendous
22:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but I don't remember the name
22:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> that would make for a really fun joke
22:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> as an interview question
22:58 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly my questions weren’t too bad. I just was about to die on the third guy, so I couldn’t even figure out what he wanted from me
22:58 < bridge> <Assa> windows ~~sys admin~~ is horrendous
22:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> facts
22:59 < bridge> <learath2> I actually don’t know if they mind if the questions are talked about publicly
23:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> you signed an nda?
23:01 < bridge> <learath2> I didn’t afaict, idk maybe there was tinytext somewhere saying if I talk about the questions they are legally allowed to execute me
23:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> probably just signed off gifting them your personal data 👀
23:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Ok my guess was close, the technique I was thinking of was Manifold Exploration Metropolis Light Transport
23:05 < bridge> <learath2> Idk what I’m supposed to do now tbh, self improvement arc where I just grind leetcode every day, or sad arc where I bedrot for a couple months until I feel better
23:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10529
23:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i want them to spin around and make an impact sound, woosh around and click every time it turns before snapping back in place
23:05 < bridge> <Ewan> I'm sure you're sick of the latter
23:06 < bridge> <learath2> Not really, I’m very good at doing nothing, proficient even
23:06 < bridge> <Ewan> more knowledge won't hurt you surely :kek:
23:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> does grinding leetcode actually get you a job?
23:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> sounds suspect
23:08 < bridge> <kebscs> depends which one
23:08 < bridge> <kebscs> depends which company
23:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> whats ur current job?
23:09 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1408558785613533257/IMG_1011.png?ex=68aa2e18&is=68a8dc98&hm=7e04fdb79c1a6fe9d5f0daf12bb807a3d17e1e1793dc75196c0283d3bf4339be&
23:09 < bridge> <learath2> I call it unemploymentcore
23:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> u have enough money to bedrot?
23:10 < chillerbot> You can see donors and how to donate here https://ddnet.org/funding/
23:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> i call that success
23:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> otherwise how do u pay rent
23:10 < bridge> <learath2> I’ll decide tomorrow what I’ll do with my life. I’m getting sleepy, I’ll sleep
23:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> gn lerato
23:11 < bridge> <learath2> The deep state funds me to slow down the development of ddnet
23:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @robyt3 so wat u say? we do some coding?
23:17 < bridge> <kollpotato> chillahdragon can i join
23:18 < bridge> <robyt3> I'm rather busy for the next weeks
23:19 < bridge> <kebscs> 128 player support?
23:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: who's your 3rd favorite maintainer? :santatrollet:
23:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> who are top 2
23:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1408418469455597689
23:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> lerato, then rossbit, and then i suppose the 3rd one is the deen
23:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> did deen merge stuff lately
23:27 < bridge> <Ewan> what does this even mean lol
23:28 < bridge> <Ewan> surely you are not a saudi prince
23:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No way you pulled the lerato rossbit! Ouch
23:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s time to email Heinrich
23:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Of course josspit is the goat. But I don’t think he is down for C++ xd
23:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think deen is my least favorite maintainer
23:53 < bridge> <kebscs> :tear:
23:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (I hope he doesn’t read that .\_.)
23:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't think it's a slight against deen
23:53 < bridge> <Ewan> he is just not very active
23:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> deen is good merger
23:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No questions asked, no annoying nitpicks and fast
23:54 < bridge> <Ewan> he trusts u
23:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @kollpotato: I need to plan code with someone that can merge it. If they don’t mind I suppose you could join. But there is a chance Heinrich actually does not want to dot it .\_.
23:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And deen for sure will not do it
23:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Neither josspit
23:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So I have to text some fake maintainers like Archimede and zwelf xd but that doesn’t work either
23:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So Heinrich is my last shot at paying this months rent
23:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> rcon auth levels
