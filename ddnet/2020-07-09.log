00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Our current RUS hoster has quite cheap dedicated servers, can get one for ~40 â‚¬ / month: https://en.ihor.ru/dedic#cfgMTIzNDU2Nzg5MDs0OzA7MTswOzA7MDswOzMwOzE7MDsxOzE7ODswOzA7NTswOzA7MTswOzA7MTsxMDAwOzEwMA==
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u pay once and they just mail you the physical server
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> that'd be.... â‚¬802 for the gold one?
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu yeah
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, even if we use it for 8 years, it'll come out to 100e per year, not a great deal for a server of that size
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen 40e a month is rather expensive, no? I don't think any of our servers including ger2 cost that much
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, but they promise "forever"
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We could try yet another OVH vps in Warsaw as an alternative/addition to RUS
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> > @TortiLeq we can always debounce it a little, like only kill servers if they are empty for a while
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> @Learath2 is have sense
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hasn't OVH let us down each time we tried it? Even with a dedicated server
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they have ðŸ˜„
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> somehow others report good experiences with them, maybe it's our fault
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> For lower costs we can set up ddnet servers on new energy save devices but... who have enough money? Konsti?
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I have literally no idea how to compare VPSes, all the sites have these fancy empty promises like "Protects against 10 Gbit/s DDoS"
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> They are joking i think
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> They want to earn more money by clickbating
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen OVH always touts their Additional 3 Tbps network
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> But yeah now its not very important. Most important is DoS and ddos topic...
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> Easy to say :banhammer: ddosers but really hard to do
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @deen i hope i can sponsor that host from september
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> since i found a job that takes me :kek:
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> half a year worth searching jobs
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> the people who say OVH are good are the ones who work for them
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby I knew u worked at OVH
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> how much would cost hosting with actual DDoS protection?
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly, ddos protection is mostly about having a large enough bandwidth and being able to efficiently drop garbage traffic
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think even if we had a large enough bandwidth, the teeworlds networking code is just not up to par for dropping the traffic quickly enough
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe with a stateful eBPF filter we can do bette
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> r
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Ask google to host tw servers
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now that'd be cute
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking of trying a cloud hoster like linode or digitalocean actually
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They have rather nice bandwidth promises and I'm wondering if they'd actually null-route us for using like 1-2gbps ðŸ˜›
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> if that hosting is above 100 Euroes, im not gonna pay for that lmao
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i really wish to support that
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Just delete ddosers from life
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont merge
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its wrong
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe this guy only wants to appear in the credits
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki if you can take the time, could you say why it is wrong (and if you assume that he's still using gtranslate, perhaps tell him that translations using that are mostly useless)
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no i wont, i dont want to teach spanish
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill simply correct it tomorrow
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> any sane spanish speaker can clearly see this is wrong
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Restablecer arma deseada en muerte" -> "Restablecer el arma deseada al morir"
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its so wrong
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I've never taken a spanish class, I really can't tell
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then just close the PR and tell him one wrong grammar usage
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its mostly missing articles and correctly conjugatin the verbs
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if articles is a word
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> articles is a word
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the word class of "the" in english
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and "a"
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
02:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FeaRZ> 1- about the merge. I just follow the instructions on the ddnet page. I have no idea how to use github so I created another pull request to fix the errors in the grammar.
02:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FeaRZ> 
02:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FeaRZ> 2- How many errors were there?
02:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FeaRZ> @Ryozuki 1- about the merge. I just follow the instructions on the ddnet page. I have no idea how to use github so I created another pull request to fix the errors in the grammar.
02:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FeaRZ> 
02:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FeaRZ> 2- How many errors were there?
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Fix updating mapinfos like mapper
07:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what's wrong with mapinfos?
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen you sure that it was correct to delete the cldefaultzoom stuff in camera::onreset?
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just by looking at the code it seems like it should be still broken
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but mh, it seems to work
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but defaultzoom - 10 is -1 in my case, my default zoom is 9
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @deen tried updating 3 months a mapper name through django it never worked
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @deen tried updating ~3 times a mapper name through django it never worked
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @FeaRZ please only update languages that you speak fairly well
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's annoying to have to go through all strings to check whether the grammar is still okay, whether they fit the context and whether they fit into the space allocated for them
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> Maybe set default zoom to 9 on fng
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> Hehe
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> omg
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @deen
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @heinrich5991
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> his french translations are also rly wrong
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> idk if u pulled it already
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/730706452326383666/unknown.png
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> he basically changed "mouse sens" to "mouse direction"
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2473
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> aight
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and the "grammar" mistakes he fixed are also wrong
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2473/commits/4e2ea9753147de0d2d0b5b9c9d61df5e6cedd2bc you could judge whether my imperfect french skills were okay enough for this one change
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i.e he removed every space before punctuations
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but in french we actually have space before these..
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye, I know, that's how I realized something was off
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sens. de la souris could work, but wouldn't fit either
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yeah its not perfect but it makes sens
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> the . shows the word isnt "sens"
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yeah its not perfect but it makes sense
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but yeah at that point just write the entire word "sensibilitÃ©"
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doesn't fit anyway, and omitting "de la" there shouldn't matter much
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I'm no native speaker, so I wouldn't touch any of the translations anyway ðŸ˜„
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 @heinrich5991 i made some changes to my own bridge server, including learaths repackmsg function, but that also removed the packing in message.h, which is now failing my ex.cpp test (by heinrich)
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what should i do about it? just remove the test like ddnet?
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/runs/853167159
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 :/ why did you remove the test? ^^
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> well if it fails ðŸ¤”
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 i think its gone since a long time already
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea i dont know, i just noticed there is no ex.cpp
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can you take a look at how to fix the test tho?
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. it seems there never was a src/test/ex.cpp(?)
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> git log -- src/test/ex.cpp shows nothing
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then you didnt add it to ddnet xD
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i got it from cherry picking your commit you did to ddnet7
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> will you add the test to ddnet?
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> I know how to make better ddos protection. Just use better internet. Not 1GiB/s.
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 i removed a test?
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TortiLeq the teeworlds networking code cant deal with 1 gbit of traffic either
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just throw better nonexisting cpus at it
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> heinrich, will the ex test be added?
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or why did it not exist?
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could deal with it if we utilized extra cores better
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> One of our first GER server was 10 Gbit/s, but they kicked us out because of DoS attacks anyway
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love how they let u have 10gbit as long as you dont use it all
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thanks my man
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you add the non-reflection measures back then?
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise we might have been kicked off because we were DoSing others
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nono, it was because of the incoming traffic causing problems for other customers
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the 10 Gbit/s was shared, not exclusive for us anyway
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I noticed some hosters have 4.5 GHz CPUs, might be less work to switch to something like that instead of using multiple threads for netcode
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut probably not because I don't want to port the test right now
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if i want to remove it, can i just delete the ex.cpp file?
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, and delete it from CMakeLists.txt
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Patiga https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/730723604303577188 congratulations, you predicted the outcome
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen i wonder if we would benefit from the extra single core speed
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess we would as we probably arent having a bottleneck in the kernel yet
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sometimes we do get a kernel bottleneck
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> when there is a large attack with many small packets on a single server
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> recvmmsg helps a bit
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah the kernel can only do so many packets per second per core, I'm not sure if that scales well with the core speed
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should get a high performance networking enthusiast hooked on ddnet :D
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd also be nice if we could have access to a high powered firewall where we can drop things with ebpf filters before it even reaches us
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen one problem with #2482 is that you cant explicitly set values to default
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2482
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I implemented it the same way, then I implemented it with an extra bool inside the config but that doesmt work with the direct way we modify configs in the settings menu
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @snail u need to rename mapper in other places too, not only django
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> > @TortiLeq the teeworlds networking code cant deal with 1 gbit of traffic either
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> @Learath2 so we can make teeworlds more safer for ddos
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> Cant*
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> > @TortiLeq the teeworlds networking code cant deal with 1 gbit of traffic either
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> @Learath2 so we cant make teeworlds more safer for ddos
12:59 <+ChillerDragon> yo @deen trafilaw told me you know what this wordlist.txt is
13:00 <+ChillerDragon> how does it work what does it do and who loads this file?
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> When you save and the save code exists or you have an empty save code, 3 words get used
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> to generate a new save code
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and the other question: `grep -Fr wordlist.txt src/`
13:03 <+ChillerDragon> ok thanks so its in ddnet code and for /save code
13:05 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/6da2f117cf7db7531211997f7b1db5579c33235e/src/game/server/score/sql_score.cpp#L167
13:05 <+ChillerDragon> yikes hardcoded so it has to be in the path where the server is launched from .-. well i guess its fine
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It just has to be in a storage path
13:06 <+ChillerDragon> ah true
13:06 <+ChillerDragon> ok nice i can move it to ~/.teeworlds then huh?
13:06 <+ChillerDragon> so it does not annoy me in the binary directory
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't particularly like that you can't launch a server without this either
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah it can go into data too
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is so problematic about this file? @Learath2
13:07 <+ChillerDragon> how dangerous is it to move the file while the server is running?
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not at all
13:07 <+ChillerDragon> its only used at server start right?
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
13:07 <+ChillerDragon> ok awesome
13:07 <+ChillerDragon> and server wont start without?
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 idk it's a rather large text blob only used for an optional feature
13:07 <+ChillerDragon> oh optional
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> soon, we'll have save codes without mysql, too
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh yep. Sqlite3 is exciting
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> @snail for french i can check and correct if needed
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> After i've readed .. I think there are plenty of correction i need to to x)
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> I will do that this week
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We could compile the wordlist in, but not sure if that's better
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> seems cleaner the way it currently is
13:31 <+fstd> anybody else getting synflooded by 185.166.24.0/22?  might be related to the last days ddos
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nope, haven't noticed
13:40 <+fstd> well it's low throughput so it's hard to notice if you aren't looking for it
13:40 <+fstd> the curious thing is that i don't even serve a proper website (syns on port 443)
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> checked a tcpdump on ddnet.tw, nothing from that address
13:42 <+fstd> aight
14:14 <+fstd> emails to the abuse contact for that network bounce...
14:14 <+fstd> fantastic
14:14 <+Learath2> meh, probably nothing will come of it, cybercrime isn't a crime if you aren't hurting the bottomline of a company
14:15 <+Learath2> I guess maybe if you sound srs enough the hoster might be scared you'd actually bother with it
14:16 <+fstd> i wasn't expecting much, best case they enable ingress filtering
14:17 <+fstd> i figured bottomline or not, some sysadmin might not like the idea of someone spoofing his whole address space from within
14:19 <+ChillerDragon> fstd: how do I check if i get flooded by this ip 
14:20 <+fstd> ChillerDragon: tcpdump -i eth0 -nl 'src net 185.166.24.0/22'
14:20 <+fstd> if your network interface is 'eth0' that is
14:20 <+ChillerDragon> is it rn?
14:20 <+ChillerDragon> yy ik
14:21 <+fstd> well i'm still receiving, although not much
14:21 <+fstd> 20 packets per sec or so
14:21 <+fstd> which is why i'm assuming i'm not the only receiver
14:24 <+ChillerDragon> did not get any traffic 
14:24 <+ChillerDragon> so its unlikley tw related
14:25 <+fstd> but my webserver doesn't serve anything
14:25 <+fstd> literally just https://www.pr0.tips/
14:26 <+ChillerDragon> oh so its web requests?
14:26 <+fstd> "foo bar www"
14:26 <+fstd> it's SYNs on the https port, yes
14:26 <+fstd> no actual requests though
14:26 <+ChillerDragon> i get so many crazy requests on my pstd server
14:26 <+Learath2> fstd: I don't get anything either on any server I have
14:27 <+fstd> hm that's so weird
14:29 <+ChillerDragon> fstd: do you also get these? https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/LV
14:29 <+ChillerDragon> looks like bugbounty hunters :D
14:30 <+fstd> nah that's just people probing for known vulnerabilities in certain web apps
14:30 <+fstd> and yeah i get those a lot (but paste.pr0.tips is running over at Learath2's)
14:30 <+ChillerDragon> oh
14:30 <+ChillerDragon> i thought u host that
14:31 <+fstd> pstd_server can't make sense of a lot of those requests due to the way it (does not) implement http
14:31 <+ChillerDragon> y
14:31 <+fstd> i could actually move it back to my server these days, yeah
14:31 <+fstd> oh wait, no
14:31 <+ChillerDragon> btw does econ still work in ddnet6? or am i stoopid?
14:32 <+ChillerDragon> if i connect via econ to ddnet6 i just crash the server
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> ah ok nvm using netcat it worked
14:36 <+Learath2> I buy a cake tin online that looks like it's one piece, turns out you can remove it's bottom... Why can't I just get a solid one piece cake tin?
14:37 <+Learath2> At this rate I'll have to get a normal one and have it welded....
14:41 <+fstd> tf is a cake tin?
14:41 <+Learath2> the thing you bake a cake in
14:41 <+fstd> removable bottom sounds like a useful feature then
14:41 <+fstd> to get the cake out
14:42 <+fstd> without messing it up
14:42 <+Learath2> Unless you are baking custards like cheesecake which need to be baked in a waterbath. Then a removable bottom is the perfect place for the water to get in and give you a sad soggy bottom
14:43 <+fstd> i see, lol
14:43 <+fstd> fortunately cheese cake tastes like ass so nobody should ever have a reason to make one :P
14:44 <+Learath2> Just because you never had a good one
14:46 <+fstd> did you just call my momma a sub-par cheesecake maker?
14:47 <+Learath2> Okay, then you just don't like cheesecakes
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> xD
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> fstd: heh, I also got that for abuse contacts a few times. that's when you know they don't give a shit
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Learath2: Post some cake photos next time ðŸ˜„

17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/Deen/mangos the deen on github did some wow server reimplementation stuff ðŸ™‚
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, he forked it and did a single change 10 years ago
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> what is a "wordlist.txt"
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's a list of words for random savecodes
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `git log -- data/wordlist.txt`
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ah i guess i just need to copy it to my serverdir for the server to start again :)
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, yes
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Cheesecake is good:kek:
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 can we take https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2433 in?
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen there are still a couple double messages that need to be masked
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> quite a few people on old clients, thats since yesterday

18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (older versions than 10 didn't access https://info.ddnet.tw/info
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Cuz they faked version number to not get shit timer
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol @jao still uses ddnet 1.8.7 :kek:
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/730831328135872582/Screen_Shot_2020-07-09_at_12.01.11_PM.png
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> wowo jao murderer
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :justatest:
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FeaRZ> @heinrich5991 sorry, I don't have idea that the spaces were okay on the french translation sorry about that. My bad
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FeaRZ> @heinrich5991 I speak only Spanish and a little english
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FeaRZ> @heinrich5991 Spanish is my native language and I speak a little english
19:44 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Can someone help me add sqlite to cmake? I can compile https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2465 without any errors locally, but the Github CI isn't satisfied.
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Zwelf: Did you forget to git add the cmake/FindSQLite3.cmake file?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> do we need the sqlite3ext.h btw?
20:25 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> No need for the sqlite3ext.h, I don't plan to use sqlite3 extensions.
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Zwelf: Can we reenable /practice btw? I heard something was broken and thus it's disabled
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 thanks for all the reviews btw, you're very proactive and giving good feedback
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and I know that reviewing is less fun than writing own new code, so it's much appreciated
20:30 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Can be enabled again if #2446 is deployed. Was related to the ClientID = TeamID change on solo servers.
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm okay with doign reviews. I sometimes worry that I'm making PR authors work too much
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, I'll reenable practice  then
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so far it's been reasonable I think with the work you asked
20:37 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> yes, didn't write a FindSQLite3.cmake yet.. those look a bit scary, but can try to copy a simple one and modify it
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> while player is sitting in editor and getting mention, ddnet's icon on panel doesnt pulse
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, but you get a message in editor i think
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> yes, but im in *another* program atm
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> so i cant get that someone mentioned me
21:44 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> @deen can you compile sqlite3 with  SQLITE_OMIT_LOAD_EXTENSION (`CFLAGS=-DSQLITE_OMIT_LOAD_EXTENSION ./configure`) and rename sqlite to sqlite3 for consistency
21:49 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Currently there are linking errors to ld (using the .so would work as well)
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Zwelf: done
23:36 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Thanks
