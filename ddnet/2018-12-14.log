00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dany~> Hello, does anyone know why sometimes I can not access servers? I'm left with the screen in black or I get the map "DM1" but I can not play u.u, if someone has a solution that tells me :(
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dany~> ~ Dany
00:48 <+Learath2> @deen, could that be you?
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> @Dany~ You mean you see them but can't connect or you don't see them at all ?
02:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander_> I sometimes am not able to join GER servers, it just stays on the `Connecting to <ip>` screen and nothing is loading
02:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dany~> ome I see but I only get the map "DM1" When the map is ctf5, blmap4, among others, I practically do not hit enter any DDrace,
02:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dany~> and others I can not enter, it stays in "conecting to * IP *"
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dany~> Something similar happens to me like @Alexander_
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dany~> ome I see but I only get the map "DM1" When the map is ctf5, blmap4, among others, I practically do not hit enter any DDrace,
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dany~> and others I can not enter, it stays in "conecting to * IP *" @â™ªâ™«
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander_> the first problem Dany is facing has not happened to me
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> If you add the servers in your favorites it might helps for when you don't see them on the list
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> sometimes the master servers may not respond i guess
04:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> we are having problems in Chile
04:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> the zoom resets to default and are laggy :'v
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ending up in dm1 really sounds like packet drops
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Probably because of my change? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1404
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Are you using DDNet client or another one?
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess I'll revert it for now, servers look quite empty
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Alexander_ @Dany~ @sorgaxD fixed?
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dany~> I'll go see @deen
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it takes pretty long until my times are shown real ind not in the old score boeard, i also cant zoom in ddrace for a minute after joining
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> cant zooz
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Im 'corneum due to server attacks the server cant send you the packets that fast/ they get lost
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so the client doesnt know its allowed to use zoom and display the score in time format
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ah i thought its a clientside problem
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> thx
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> devs i need a little help. i bought a new monitor and now some teeworlds graphics drag a tail behind them the faster i get. seems to be mostly on freeze or generally darker graphics. they dont appear on screenshots and it doesnt happen in entities but my gpu gets coilwhining. i tried some graphic options already.
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum some monitor technology just has this afterglow
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or some motion blurring?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> free sync u mean
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> well use some blur into the mouse because it feels like 30hz using it
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> afterglow sounds right
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> its not a gamebreaker but it sure isnt pretty too
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i think it would be good to have, while moving i cant really focus on the tiles cuz its so sharply fast looking
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it might be ghosting from the monitor. it happens, when the monitor overvolts the pixels to have faster grey-grey swap or something like that.. in case that's the reason look for overdrive setting in your monitor
17:39 <+Ryozuki> test
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what do i put in overdrive
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i solved it. i just changed to nvidia color settings. thanks anyway, and can i do something about coilwhining in entities?
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> I mean the fps drop isnt big
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> it's like small lag
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> 0.1 sec screen bug every 2-5 secs it's annoying af
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> @deen yes! fixed ðŸ˜„
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> but now there is another problem :'v
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/523198660528570388/screenshot_2018-12-14_15-03-08.png
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Skills yeah, but the question is, does this happen in the other client versions i said, if not, the problem is tracked down to your pc/pc settings... but if, then it's the client
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shawn.> My friend has this problem since like a week, he tried downloading again but didnt work
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shawn.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/523217991567933470/2018-12-14_201731.bmp
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh yeah someone had that issue, but didnt had it with OpenGL3.3, but other issues with it.
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i already tried a test branch, but every time ppl have to try out things they magically disappear
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/text-try
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Shawn. he can try OpenGL 3.3 and only look if the text work... other things doesn't matter, bcs then it might be related to the GL version at all... it is a driver bug, and very probably he has some AMD gpu (e,g. AMD A4 4000)
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shawn.> he has r9 270 not apu, but cpu and gpu are amd yes
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok, he can try few things:
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 1. update gpu driver.. amd has a optional driver, he has to use that
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 2. start client f1-> gfx_opengl3 1 -> restart look if text is rendered correctly, set gfx_opengl3 back to  0, tell me, maybe fixable, maybe not
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shawn.> ok thanks a lot mate, it got fixed ðŸ˜„
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> did he go with 2.?
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shawn.> he just wrote in f1 gfx_opengl3 1
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no other issues with that option? when he joins a map?
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> older amd gpus tend to be broken with it xD
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shawn.> he said it lags
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD not what i suspected, but possible, i have no plan
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> lol
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> i still have deem bugs
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> it's not fps drop i'm feeling it's client
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> or smthing
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> cba downloading different ddnet versions win10 own  virusshit complains ddnet.exe is virus etc
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> and my own viruschecker too
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Skills then pls try version 11.0.3 and 10.8.6
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh https://ddnet.tw/downloads/
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> these downloads should be fine
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> yea it still says it brother
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> i tried it
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well then deactivate anti virus
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it's false positive appearently
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> virustotal.com says nothing
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> Ya ik  , it's only because viruschecker doenst appear recognise the .exe client so it says that
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Shawn. he can ofc try go on https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commits/text-try, there is that small âœ“, click it -> details at continuous-integration -> artifacts -> win64 gives this link:
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/k5qutlydtsg6w9ps/artifacts/build64%2FDDNet-11.3.1-win64.zip
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it's the autobuild from github, not build by me.
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this is a client trying to fix it without opengl3.3, if that doesn't work @deen can set the major version to 3.0, and then try again, because it's funny that OpenGL3.3 renders it correctly while non 3.3 does not
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> @Jupstar âœª The ''bug'' himself it's kinda hard to recognise but when i changed my refresh rate to 100 it gives like my screen monitor gives 144 or even more because it's laggy af then when i go to refreshrate 60 -> ''bug'' is bit less but it still gives them and when i watch blocks it gives like shake to them xd
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> Didn't have any problem on my old pc and it was worse than this one
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> Feeling like it's the client i can try other versions tho
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah would be really helpful
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> else i will try helping you find another solution
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shawn.> i think its just his connection that makes him lag
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> very important are the versions i said xD, they are some key changes
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shawn.> ty for the help anyway
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> Nah it's not the connection i guess it wasnt on my old pc
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> how it could be on this one
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not for you @Skills
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> ah
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he had a different issue
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> yikes problem on these old versions can't open these says .dll missing
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what dll
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> libwinpthread
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> sdl2
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> libopuslife
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> libfreetyle or smthing
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he has to unpack the whole .zip
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> ya i did
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you*
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> says the same
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but the files are there xD
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> did your antivrus delete them or what?
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> nope
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> i disabled it already
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> btw have u used win64?
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> yea
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> downloads
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> I could try on winrar tho
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> i think it will work
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah better unpack always
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dont use the windows integrated thing
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> But why it says missing files
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> when it's in folder
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs it only unpacks some files into a temporary directory
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> winrar might do a better job
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but unpacking is always the best solution
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> no need to unpack
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> winrar
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> works fine
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nice
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> lemme try now
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> yeah it was the client
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so what version did u try now?
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> 11.0.3
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
22:01 <+Ryozuki> deen: https://hookrace.net/blog/writing-a-2d-platform-game-in-nim-with-sdl2/ the "strfmt" link is kinda broken :P
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> as you can see in the picture, tileset dilate isnt working properly.
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> (1080p with opengl 3.3 , VBO and multiple units on)
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/523250071404281856/screenshot_2018-12-14_22-26-04.png
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah sad for you, then u cant use it
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not all gpu drivers are bugfree
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> which option
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> the vbo or the multiple unit
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> opengl3.3
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> at all
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> oh,
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> well thats sad
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if you have luck, a gpu driver update works
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> looks like nvidia drivers dont support this
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they do
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gtx 760, gtx 960 gtx 1070 all worked and testet
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tested*
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i have 1050ti
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> update the drivers
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> maybe this product does not have that support
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i did already
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it should work normally
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then maybe the current driver is broken
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> other games just working fine as they should
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or the manifacturor disables features
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah good for the other games that are written with directx
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> maybe some option could break the opengl
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> the FSAA probably
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not impossible
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do you have it non zero?
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> 4x
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> idk if it affects tiles too
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> normally it shouldnt
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just tested it, works for me
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> maybe that is not opengl, but the tileset itself, i'll try repackaging it
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh true, the grass tiles seems fine
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> didnt even notice
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe they were altered with border fix tool
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the worst tool of teeworlds ever created
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> btw also removed in 0.7 which fixes the same issue
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> then tell to the devs that its broken
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it's not broken
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> then how it was randomly gotten
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it tries to fix a bug, that isn't fixable
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> hmm
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so you guys will fix it manually?
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> e.g. non opengl 3.3 creates lines too if zooming in or out
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> instead of the program?
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs the mipmap level calculation is random
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> best is to not fix it
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> then i'll try to improvize it
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well but isnt that tileset in the normal data directory
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean its not embedeed tile set is it?
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it's grass main background
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> it is not
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what server are u on
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but i guess when i pasted my backup mapres into the original one, i overwrote it
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> by accident
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> the thing is no matter which server i was on, im on my LAN server and happens the same
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok then nvm
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i capsed off opengl and its kinda gone
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah restore the correct grass main
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> should fix it
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on ctf5 i dont have issues
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> aha
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ahaha
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so the vbo is kinda broken
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> mixing it with multiple unit will be broken
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no ðŸ˜ƒ vbo = vertex buffer object
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> multi texture units only means it switches the textures binds less
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but looks like it renders it wrong if i use multiple units
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but multiple units alone fixed my outlines too even zooming in / out
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh sounds strange xD
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sure you only changes that nothing else?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i only capsed off VBO
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah wait
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u had it on?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> yes
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> see
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> 
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/523253337899139073/screenshot_2018-12-14_22-41-07.png
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well it says only for iGPU
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> integrated GPU
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> mine is
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> fafak
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> how that
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you have a dedicated
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there is no CPU with nvidia integrated card
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> HMMM well idk i never actually looked up for it
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> actually i should remove that option
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and the MacOS fix too
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> how it was come to this option to put VBO
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> the macos fix was working
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> seems like some old intel gpus struggled with VBOs
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probably bcs system RAM is slower than VRAM
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i have a brand new i5
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it has nothing todo with your i5 xd
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> xd
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u have a gtx 1050ti
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> mhmm
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that's 100% dedicated GPU
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> okay, so the VBO option seems like broken for my gpu
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah but it's not made for your GPU
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> only for integrated GPUs xD
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ye you told me ðŸ˜‰
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> okay thanks for helping me discuss this
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> your welcome
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> non then less strange u have a map render bug with it xD, just looked up, the map rendering doesnt even use the preinit VBO XD
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> actually nothing uses it once connected to a server with opengl 3.3, except u have the menu open or something
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> lol something was missing there? ðŸ˜„
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i tried to remove all streaming xD
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that is some black magic right now
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> should i give my configs for that?
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> or you guys can figure it out
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i am ok with it
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> okay
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or did u somehow forget to restart the client
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i did
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> restart
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> else i will just mark it as black magic in my brain
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> totally ok with that
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> how it was useful having VBO for integrated gpu?
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it preinits the memory(for iGPU  in the RAM, so it doesnt need to reallocate the memory always)
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> VRAM works different, seems like modern GPUs just have some big heaps to stream to instead of the need of reallocate or something like that
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i cant really go into detail bcs it's dependend of intel and nvidia and AMDs implementation
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> if u say so
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it's my guess ðŸ˜„
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> im looking forward finding the solution for the VBO fixes
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh, i don't think that this is fixable
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> either it's a driver or black magic
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> maybe make a program line where it must detect which gpu are you using
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but as soon OpenGL3.3 is on the maps are loaded into seperate VBOs
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not the streamed VBO which is preinit
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i am 99.99% sure about that
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well if you give me all GPUs that exist
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> oh im starting to understand it a bit
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i can do that
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> having some responses out of the internet
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> looking up to the producers like Nvidia, intel, amd
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and search for all gpus which are integrated?.... .-.
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> idk
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> my guesses xd
22:55 <+Ryozuki> would it be worth to use https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer on ddnet?
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah but modern iGPUs don't have that issue appearently
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it's only a fix for some GPUs
22:55 <+Ryozuki> https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer *
22:55 <+Ryozuki> ups
22:55 <+Ryozuki> it comes bundled with gcc 4.8
