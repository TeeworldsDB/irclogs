02:04 <+laxa> anyone here ?
02:04 <+laxa> I cant connect to any french server
02:05 <+laxa> they are not listed on ddnet.tw/status
02:06 <+laxa> I see UDP packets going out but no response from server
09:28 <@deen> laxa: that usually means DoS attack and the OVH firewall blocks all unknown IPs
12:28 <+laxa> deen: there was no DDOS at that time actually :s
12:28 <+laxa> I could ping the server though
12:28 <+laxa> tried to connect with VPN also, same problem
12:29 <+laxa> there is no french flag back on the DDNET client when filtering ?
12:30 <+laxa> Still having the problem right now, now that servers are listed on ddnet.tw/status
12:31 <+laxa> well, they arent listed anymore :(
12:35 <@deen> well, I see an attack incoming on FRA all the time
12:36 <@deen> continous since 00:30 CEST tonight
12:36 <@deen> and apparently we can neither configure nor turn off the firewall
12:54 <+laxa> hum ok, I see, that sucks
12:54 <+laxa> Hope things get better for ddnet
22:15 <+Learath2> !ping
22:15 <@Nimda> Pong!
23:04 <+laxa> setting the !lockdown will prevent the spams btw
