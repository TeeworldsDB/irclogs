22:07 <@deen> if anyone wants to take a look: https://github.com/def-/nimes
22:33 < shahan> hello
22:35 < shahan> i'm here to ask about dummies in ddnet
22:35 <@deen> shahan: hi
22:36 < shahan> Last year i'm far from teeworlds development, but few days ago I was looking through tw commits and ddrace new features
22:36 < shahan> (ddnet is now official ddrace maintainer, right?)
22:37 < shahan> so,I found this commit https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/62aa0117340359dd21ff7c83d4d6d9517b9eb241
22:37 <@deen> it's not officially called ddrace
22:37 <@deen> but the old ddrace has been unmaintained for quite some time
22:37 < shahan> i decided so only in case of ddrace.info redirects me to ddnet.tw
22:39 < shahan> @deen, anyways, I'm here about server side dummies in ddnet. Does ddnet alreay have it, or, are dummies in ddnet's future plans?
22:39 <@deen> we have dummies in our clients
22:39 <@deen> i mainly see them as a tool for testing maps, but players disagree
22:40 <@deen> so you'll see many players with their dummies on DDNet servers
22:52 < shahan> i'm thinking about merging iddrace to ddnet, if ddnet is not going to implement serverside dummies (even only for maptesting)
22:53 <@deen> Hmm, that's a difficult decision
22:53 <@deen> One of the reasons for client dummies was that we were just one small ddrace server of many back then
22:53 <@deen> so people could play with dummy everywhere
22:54 <@deen> But in our forum there is currently a huge thread about problems with a new dummy feature which are caused by network latency
22:54 <@deen> and the dummy in client always causes problems
22:54 <@deen> maybe it actually is time to get rid of it
22:54 < shahan> yeah, it requires a good internet connection
22:55 <@deen> it also makes the client source code sooo terrible
22:55 <@deen> if you get dummy into ddnet server, I'd like to try that out
22:55 <@deen> maybe you could also post in http://forum.ddnet.tw/ if you want to see what others think
22:56 < shahan> okay
22:56 < shahan> then I can try to implement dummies and make a pull request
22:57 < shahan> but only as a training/testing feature
22:57 < shahan> not for alone playing
22:57 <@deen> nono, also for playing alone
22:57 <@deen> people do that anyway with client dummies now
22:57 < shahan> it worse than masturbation :C
22:58 <@deen> we even have dummy maps
22:58 <@deen> where your partner is just  frozen all the time
22:58 <@deen> and dummy tournaments with those
22:58 <@deen> With 810 tees online at the same time at the last one ;) http://ddnet.tw/stats/807.png
22:59 < shahan> yeah, I watched this tournament
23:00 <@deen> And here's some of the problems with client dummy: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1359
23:00 <@deen> eeeee: compiling Nim with SDL2 to Android was mindblowingly easy. I had to change main -> SDL_main and that's it. Now I just need to figure out how to load files on this thing
23:02 <@deen> the sdl2 people really did great work with emscripten and android support
23:03 < shahan> @deen: well, I'll continue discussion on ddnet forum. Thank you for quick reply and support :) Glad to see that you are open for suggestions ^^
23:03 <@deen> now that I think about it, it just makes more sense to have dummy in server
23:11 < shahan> hm
23:11 < shahan> i'm trying to register 
23:11 < shahan> but i can't answer the question
23:11 < shahan> What does TW stand for?
23:11 < fstd> >.>
23:11 <@deen> That's the hard question!
23:11 <@deen> Teeworlds
23:12 < fstd> TW obviously stands for simplicity and the KISS principle!
23:12 < Learath2> TwoWorlds
23:12 < shahan> )))))))))))0
23:12 < shahan> i thought about another meaning of 'stand for'
23:12 < shahan> something like 'mission of TW'
23:13 <@deen> "What does TW mean?" would be better?
23:13 < fstd> no, because obviously means Taiwan
23:13 <@deen> I wish I had a log of the attempted answers to those registration questions
23:36 <@deen> Ha, works!
23:36 <@deen> Totally laggy, but who cares?!
