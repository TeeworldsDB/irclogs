00:05 <@heinrich5991> deen: you also removed two other commits, was that on purpose? 8fc0bab94402680a7e5771fddea9bd1d487d57aa and b3d3a8103d78f1048266eb200ccb3a9eae20b677
00:05 <@heinrich5991> "Display tee position in editor proof" and "Fix clear entities for ddrace gametype"
00:05 <@deen> ehm, no...
00:06 <@deen> I should've pulled first

00:11 <@deen> thanks

00:11 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master fb5c34d Dennis Felsing: Merge pull request #522 from heinrich5991/pr_ddnet_bam_45...
00:11 <@deen> but it doesn't work :P
00:12 <@deen> configure.lua:6: bad argument #1 to 'setfenv' (number expected, got nil)
00:12 <@deen> with bam 0.4
00:12 <@heinrich5991> works on my machine :/
00:12 <@deen> why can you check the lua version?
00:12 <@deen> I bet I don't have exactly Lua 5.1
00:13 <@deen> $ lua
00:13 <@deen> Lua 5.3.3  Copyright (C) 1994-2016 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
00:13 <@heinrich5991> type bam -h
00:14 <@heinrich5991> deen: bam ships its own lua, can you check that version?
00:14 <@deen> bam version 0.4.x. built Apr 19 2015 02:53:13 using Lua 5.1
00:14 <@deen> right
00:18 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #523: Hopefully fix a problem bam.lua that I don't see locally (master...pr_ddnet_bam_45_second_take) https://git.io/v6THm
00:19 <@heinrich5991> deen: can you check whether that works? I can't reproduce your error
00:22 <@deen> did you remove config.lua to test?
00:22 <@deen> works now, thanks
00:22 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to master: https://git.io/v6TH7

00:23 <@heinrich5991> ah, that triggers it
00:23 <@heinrich5991> I thought bam -c config did that
00:23 <+Henningstone> deen: please put the "int i;" in the function str_next_word in system.c at the very top of the function
00:24 <+Henningstone> compilers may complain...
00:24 <@deen> Henningstone: i always forget that windows is stuck on c89
00:24 <@deen> maybe we should force c89 on gcc as well to trigger the same problem, then it's easier not to make it
00:25 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/v6TQq
00:25 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 5b19be9 def: C89 fix
19:50 <+Henningstone> deen: did you realize that https://git.io/v6TuD is somehow broken? If I search e.g. for "KoG" in the serverbrowser, it shows a bunch of servers to have players matching "kog" on it, even if that haven't.
19:57 <+Henningstone> additionally refreshing the serverlist tends to lag hard if there is a filter set
23:52 <+fstd_> patches welcome
