01:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> there is no doc currently
03:01 < bridge> <soulyvevo> trippy
05:29 < bridge> <totar> does anyone know wtf flow.cpp does?
05:30 < bridge> <totar> likewise ``m_FlowAffected`` on ``CParticle``
05:34 < bridge> <totar> it seems to do nothing except draw debug info?
05:35 < bridge> <totar> it's like for explosions to push around particles except it doesn't seem to be work
05:35 < bridge> <zhn> @fokkonaut this
05:35 < bridge> <zhn> was added in 0.4 even afair, never used
05:36 < bridge> <zhn> maybe even earlier
05:36 < bridge> <zhn> oh fokko xd
05:36 < bridge> <totar> but it's basically done?
05:36 < bridge> <zhn> why it did ping fokko lmao
05:36 < bridge> <zhn> im sorry
05:36 < bridge> <totar> xd
05:36 < bridge> <zhn> hm i don't really know since it didn't get on prs in ddnet
05:37 < bridge> <totar> there's even an old loc to turn it back on
05:37 < bridge> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1312276323032629289/image.png?ex=674be810&is=674a9690&hm=20c9fc0122bcdcc9cf54d9c233c08c16c1170cfd5d7f5a6773cee63ecba434ba&
05:38 < bridge> <totar> well atleast people know about it so I guess there's a reason it's off idk
07:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> guys
07:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> what if we add a map command or flag that hint client it should use high precision and make that flag a new default (but make sure old maps still uses the normal precision). <a:HUH:1178720004980605089> so if a mapper want heavy uses of edge hook and 45aim bind they can disable that. it's just a hint tho, but ddnet client will respect that obviously, and we don't give client a config in client so non-hacker player don't just mess around with it.
07:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> why do we have telecursor when tp's description says roughly the samething?
07:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> even though it didn't work like that
07:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1312307546979176448/image.png?ex=674c0524&is=674ab3a4&hm=68b69b38caa90ead410c375039a06567a325a5d4d78ef01bba2c2ac96157fd87&
07:49 < bridge> <woidless> Where is the Player Search API located in teedata
07:50 < bridge> <Ewan> @jupeyy_keks thoughts on this cool bug https://medal.tv/games/ddracenetwork/clips/jbdE0ptSCg3IpuCxk?invite=cr-MSxBMlgsMTUwOTE1MjY3LA
07:51 < bridge> <Ewan> tater and i are thinking it's probably just vram corruption
07:51 < bridge> <Ewan> game lags out bad and has white streaks, but only at a specific zoom level, and only on that one session of having that map loaded
07:51 < bridge> <Ewan> was reproducible by zooming in and out within that session but not after (e.g. switched maps and switched back and couldnt replicate)
07:52 < bridge> <Ewan> though i have seen broken maps cause some wild ass bugs
07:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the description of tele / teleport / tp / telecursor all does the same thing when there is 0 arguments wtf
07:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and only telecursor is implemented as the one that teleports to cursor hmm
07:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and only telecursor & tele are implemented as the one that teleports to cursor hmm
07:57 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry
07:58 < bridge> <Ewan> actually i think teleport coords has been moved into another command actually so i relinquish all responsibility in that regard
07:58 < bridge> <Ewan> actually i think teleport coords has been moved into another command so i relinquish all responsibility in that regard
07:58 < bridge> <Ewan> womp womp
07:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the description didn't update when they did that probably
07:59 < bridge> <Ewan> yee
07:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do i remove tp's description or just add the cursor thing back
07:59 < bridge> <Ewan> they moved it out on purpose so idk
07:59 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe just update the description to be good for each
08:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ok then
08:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> still no idea why `tele` just decide to do the same thing as `telecursor` then there is no argument tho
08:00 < bridge> <Ewan> it's a flexible command
08:00 < bridge> <Ewan> imo it should all be 1 command cuz it's all very easy to infer user intent based on # of args
08:00 < bridge> <Ewan> but you know
08:01 < bridge> <Ewan> gotta make it complicated
08:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> god damn it
08:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1312312558849363989/image.png?ex=674c09cf&is=674ab84f&hm=8cbb51b889fe0982ef6e26ad78368aac6abb1c5000ffd21908a226e9c44764ee&
08:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> why does telecursor need to teleport you to other players
08:01 < bridge> <Ewan> ppl just be changing shit for no reason
08:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that doesn't even have anything with cursor
08:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i hate
08:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> life
08:02 < bridge> <Ewan> same
08:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i will just make sure the behavior is the same as previously and open another pr to clearify everything maybe
08:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i will just make sure the behavior is the same as previously implement and open another pr to clearify everything maybe
08:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i will just make sure the behavior is the same as previously implemented and open another pr to clearify everything maybe
08:06 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe
08:06 < bridge> <Ewan> i wouldnt revert anything without a great reason
08:06 < bridge> <Ewan> we'd have to make a case for it etc
08:06 < bridge> <Ewan> too much work
08:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 😴
08:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we are here
08:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Morning
08:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> norming
09:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> is @fokkonaut still active 👀
09:29 < bridge> <totar> I approve
09:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
09:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :greenthing: care to try that PR above and edge hooks?
09:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if you adjusted your aim to zoom 9 already i'm gonna cry tho
09:34 < bridge> <Ewan> hi fokkonaut how are u
09:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I'm not playing a lot lately, but I think it's enough to send our target pos instead of all those infos like follow factor. (or? idk?)
09:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> good and u
09:35 < bridge> <Ewan> p good
09:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's for other command, not related to control and character input
09:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's for other commands, not related to control and character input
09:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ah, oki
09:35 < bridge> <Ewan> employed. somehow liberating feeling even tho it is the opposite
09:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hahaha, but cool ;)
09:35 < bridge> <Ewan> thx
09:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i'll test it, but cant promise that it'd be done today
09:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do what you want, just tagging you cuz the issue is yours
09:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:amogus:876956004674338848>
09:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> for me it was just weird, that after someone implemented the target pos sending to server, the zoom level did change physics. When you aim right through an edge and hook/Shoot, and it goes through, you can zoom out/in and it might not work, without changing angles, because it's more precise now
09:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And that's just weird
09:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it should just always take the original zoom lvl 10 for determining the angle
09:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> then the precision isnalways same, regardless of zoom lvl
09:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do you remember when that was
09:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cuz i am actually quite worried about breaking some new players habit instead too.
09:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> no, that's one of those things that just got merged quite quickly
09:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ah
09:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it should be like a few months just
09:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ok so that's not that bad then
09:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> dunno why heinrich and others didnt care tbh
09:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
09:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :nouis: i am debating whether to introduce a flag to let mapper decide whether they want high precision tho
09:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like for the fun maps
09:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like for those easier fun maps instead of just tech after tech
09:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> wrong remote moment?
09:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
09:42 < bridge> <Solly> yes
09:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i did that before
09:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> relatable
09:43 < bridge> <Solly> i just presed the button that appeared on github
09:43 < bridge> <totar> Not you...
09:44 < bridge> <Solly> ?
09:44 < bridge> <totar> This happens every month xd
09:44 < bridge> <Solly> its an easy mistake
09:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
09:44 < bridge> <totar> It is
09:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> is it bcs this
09:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1312338483876069438/image.png?ex=674c21f4&is=674ad074&hm=54bf12539d572b9279ee097281152e9730769baa5f304213f53982c514379758&
09:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> no idea how github choose the default upstream tho
09:45 < bridge> <totar> Github forks are so cursed and annoying
09:45 < bridge> <totar> Major regret making it a fork
09:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> can you just break it
09:45 < bridge> <totar> Idk
09:45 < bridge> <Solly> github forks are cursed
09:46 < bridge> <totar> The only thing I like is the diff on the main page and commit behind number
09:46 < bridge> <totar> You can easily audit the code
09:46 < bridge> <Solly> but i wish it was part of git
09:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> found this https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/detaching-a-fork
09:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> not sure if it is relevant
09:46 < bridge> <Solly> like origin is normally the remote you are just using
09:46 < bridge> <Solly> and upstream is normally what you are forking from
09:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ah it involves deleting the branch
09:47 < bridge> <totar> "You cant"
09:47 < bridge> <Solly> github could somehow detect that in your repo
09:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ah it involves deleting the **repo**
09:47 < bridge> <Solly> yeah you can
09:47 < bridge> <Solly> delete your repo
09:47 < bridge> <Solly> then create it
09:47 < bridge> <Solly> push all the branches
09:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> lol
09:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> bummer
09:47 < bridge> <totar> Idk too scary for now id rather just ignore it xd
09:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> just a few closed issue is probably not bad
09:48 < bridge> <totar> This one wasn't even the fault of the github fork
09:48 < bridge> <totar> Well
09:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> at least we are not [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)
09:48 < bridge> <totar> Not the tclient fork
09:48 < bridge> <totar> Wtf why
09:49 < bridge> <totar> Is this the Indian tutorial thing
09:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye
09:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> yes
09:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it is still going
09:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> express maintainer is pretty chill about it somehow tho
09:50 < bridge> <totar> I mean it's not their fault really be mad at the video creator
09:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> well i do think it is a pretty dumb move to instruct on live repo
09:51 < bridge> <totar> Yeah everyone agrees on that
09:51 < bridge> <totar> But they should have taken it down by now
09:52 < bridge> <Solly> what hapepned?
09:52 < bridge> <totar> Sometimes I forget how confusing github used to be before I understood anything. I was one of those people who took forever to find the release section and accidently downloaded the source code several times.
09:52 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Not long ago it was possible to ask GitHub support to detach your fork. Worked for me.
09:53 < bridge> <totar> That link is dead for me
09:53 < bridge> <Solly> every week my mobile provider spams me with a message saying "to use data on your phone you will need to ...."
09:53 < bridge> <Solly> if i block the number they switch the number they send it from
09:54 < bridge> <totar> Sometimes my phone filters those
09:54 < bridge> <Solly> everytime i can be bothered i block and report as spam cuz its those 3 digit ones
09:54 < bridge> <totar> I probably got about 500-1000 text messages about the election the last 4 months
09:54 < bridge> <Solly> JESUS CHRIST
09:55 < bridge> <totar> Idk samsung seems to have good filtering so it wasn't an issue
09:55 < bridge> <Solly> I havent recieved that many text msgs in my life
09:55 < bridge> <Solly> thats
09:55 < bridge> <totar> Basically zero got through
09:55 < bridge> <Solly> thats horrible
09:55 < bridge> <Solly> stupid fcuking polotics
09:55 < bridge> <Solly> #off-topic moment
09:55 < bridge> <totar> They all stopped now lol
09:55 < bridge> <Solly> :)
10:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Solly i had the same issue. I solved it by removing my sim card. No more ads!
10:18 < bridge> <Solly> wow
10:18 < bridge> <Solly> overthrowing the government also works
10:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> paying for a provider that abuses its power to send ads felt really wrong
10:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> seems like this is a common thing here in indonesia so I decided to try going without sim card and it worked quite well so far. I don't miss it at all actually.
10:20 < bridge> <Solly> i have a sim card for the phone # so i can verify stuff but i dont  pay anything
10:20 < bridge> <robyt3> It's very basic so enabling it in this state wouldn't do much because
10:20 < bridge> <robyt3> - the effect is minor that you can hardly notice it because particles disappear quickly
10:20 < bridge> <robyt3> - there are currently no particle generator tiles that would make it noticeable
10:20 < bridge> <robyt3> - it works weirdly in some cases, e.g. the tee momentum can keep moving smoke/dust particles on the ground
10:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh not paying is nice
10:20 < bridge> <Solly> do u have to pay to have a phone #?
10:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am not sure i think i could still receive sms after the prepaid balance expired
10:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but depending on phone numbers always felt wrong to me
10:22 < bridge> <Solly> the mobile everything feels extremley predatory
10:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i did not login to my bank since they introduced the requirement of an ios and android app to login. It is sad to see how it is widely accepted that having an ios or android phone with active phone number becomes slowly a base requirement to take part in society.
10:24 < bridge> <Solly> nod nod
10:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> especially if these systems are propriatary and the vendors abuse it to force ads and spyware onto their users
10:25 < bridge> <Solly> nod nod
10:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> proprietary* such hard word
10:26 < bridge> <Solly> well if dictionaries werent so closed of and controled by the high and mighty  few
10:27 < bridge> <Solly> we could make it spelt eazier
10:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> indeed
10:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do anyone really use dyncam control when spectating players?
10:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like to move the camera around
10:53 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon
10:54 < bridge> <woidless> I noticed the same type of server on two identical servers, but with different types of server. I would also like to add color to my server types.
10:55 < bridge> <soulyvevo> nah and it always annoyed me
10:55 < bridge> <soulyvevo> always felt better to just zoom
10:57 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i think many the colors depend on the mod name
10:57 < bridge> <soulyvevo> not sure if thats the case for all of them
10:57 < bridge> <soulyvevo> but when you name your mod anything and add "fng" or "race" at the end of it
10:58 < bridge> <soulyvevo> it should have a different color
10:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ok then, i'm essentially nuking that
10:58 < bridge> <soulyvevo> so for example *modname       fng*
10:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe some mod uses that but i doubt it
10:59 < bridge> <woidless> But then 2 types will be shown
10:59 < bridge> <woidless> SlowNet fng
11:00 < bridge> <learath2> The colors are iirc random
11:00 < bridge> <learath2> Through a hash, so it's "statically" random
11:00 < bridge> <Solly> @chillerdragon stap sniffing lmao
11:00 < bridge> <Solly> no one should read my code, its bad
11:01 < bridge> <Solly> :D
11:01 < bridge> <woidless> But how do you get these colors on your type?
11:02 < bridge> <soulyvevo> is this the case for all colors? im checking the server browser and it looks like some are hardcoded
11:02 < bridge> <learath2> You don't have to do anything, the name of your gamemode determines the color it gets
11:02 < bridge> <learath2> There is a possibility that I never commited this and I'm lying
11:03 < bridge> <learath2> I most certainly wrote the code for it, but maybe I never made it a PR 🙃
11:03 < bridge> <soulyvevo> trollearath
11:03 < bridge> <woidless> Why is the color white on my "SlowNet" type?
11:03 < bridge> <woidless> I use ddnet++
11:03 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah I guess it's just hardcoded
11:03 < bridge> <learath2> Sorry
11:05 < bridge> <learath2> So you get your color by making a pull request to ddnet, and wait for a new client release. But idk if we want to make this a thing everyone does. It would be annoying to have 80 branches in the code for every mod ever
11:06 < bridge> <soulyvevo> ye i think fokkonauts mod has iDM at the end of the mod name or something
11:06 < bridge> <soulyvevo> but i cant see it now
11:10 < bridge> <woidless> I am currently writing a website with one coder, like a bot that can log on to any server
11:17 < bridge> <woidless> With the use of swarfey
11:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> heinrich said something about gamemode color before i think
11:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> actually, can we also nuke spectating your paused self too
11:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> actually nvm, i think mods might use that more often
11:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> wait no, i think we can still do that, just don't let client select themself, mod can still force it by snapping the spectator info
11:33 < bridge> <Solly> THEY PICKED ANOTHER NUMBER
11:33 < bridge> <Solly> AND SENT ME THE SAME TEXT
11:39 < bridge> <reemmuss> 2024-11-30 11:38:23 E http: https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/register failed. libcurl error (6): Could not resolve host: master1.ddnet.org

11:45 < bridge> <reemmuss> come general 4 and scrreen me
11:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i can't
11:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe someone else can help
11:45 < bridge> <reemmuss> k
11:45 < bridge> <Solly> do `ping master1.ddnet.org`
11:46 < bridge> <reemmuss> Where should I do?
11:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also check if your server time is correct, sync with a timeserver if not btw
11:46 < bridge> <Solly> ask chatgpt
11:46 < bridge> <Solly> ~~ask chatgpt :)~~
11:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> asking chatgpt is probably not a bad idea tbh
11:46 < bridge> <Solly> its the first thing i do for most problems now
11:46 < bridge> <Solly> and most of the time it resolves the problem
11:47 < bridge> <reemmuss> I wrote to chatgpt 10 times but it could not be resolved.
11:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> too bad i can't use chatgpt, they ban every account that shows a trace of being in china
11:47 < bridge> <reemmuss> me vds amazon aws eu

11:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> supermaven got into my way when coding so i rm -rf'd it out of my system :kek:
11:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :cammo:
11:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> how
11:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean it sometime is dumber than copilot
11:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> even when i turned off inline completion it still sometimes auto completed
11:48 < bridge> <reemmuss> help me friends
11:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> it made me so angry
11:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> in what editor
11:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> vim
11:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> lol
11:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe just a bad plugin then
11:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> they are not focusing on plugins now
11:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> which is kinda sad
11:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't want to use cursor
11:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> type `ping master1.ddnet.org` in your console @reemmuss
11:50 < bridge> <reemmuss> ok waitr
11:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the only time i find autocomplete annoying is when i write in python
11:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> why python of all langs?
11:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cuz you know. tab is how you format the code.

15:06 < bridge> <swarfey> but start saying u use my lib and not me :pepeW:
15:07 < bridge> <woidless> Is it possible to make a website where you can enter the ip:port of the server, click connect and then perform any actions of the bot by sending a request to the hosting where swarfey is installed!

15:12 < bridge> <woidless> How to add your mod here
15:12 < bridge> <swarfey> 1. watch some tutorial on how to open up a webserver using node.js
15:12 < bridge> <swarfey> 2. create a web api so you the client connects to your desired server when you send a request to it
15:12 < bridge> <swarfey> 3. if you pro learn how to use websockets & make it useful
15:13 < bridge> <Assa> This code can cause an SEH exception:
15:13 < bridge> <Assa> ```
15:13 < bridge> <Assa> auto name_match = [payload_name](PayloadParameterSchema p) { return p.name == payload_name; };
15:13 < bridge> <Assa> auto ppms = std::find_if(payload.begin(), payload.end(), name_match);
15:13 < bridge> <Assa> ```
15:13 < bridge> <Assa> Anybody an idea why and how
15:13 < bridge> <swarfey> but k-i-o's electron client should work fine, idk why you would want more
15:13 < bridge> <Assa> maybe I should ask chatgpt first
15:13 < bridge> <woidless> lol i change s-ddr to my mod
15:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> chillerdragon: you should make a web interface for DMing you

15:24 < bridge> <woidless> i dont understand english lol
15:24 < bridge> <learath2> Hmm, let me pick something
15:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: help me to write a compiler :DD
15:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Maybe start with some english lessons then. English is essential for contributing to ddnet @woidless 
15:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh no @milkeeycat compiler hard

15:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 i wonder how hard stripe is in C i can add it to the todo

15:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless you are not making any sense to me
15:31 < bridge> <woidless> Но почему у меня не поставился цвет
15:31 < bridge> <woidless> But why didn't I get a color
15:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for which gametype?
15:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I just realized I did the exact same thing to teeworlds that the indian youtuber did to expressjs https://youtu.be/mxBwyEIeaRQ?t=1081
15:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but it had no impact because the video is too long for the 10 viewers to even reach that part
16:02 < bridge> <woidless> SlowNet
16:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Yes that makes sense. SlowNet is not in the snippet of code I sent you. It is not a known gametype to the ddnet client.
16:16 < bridge> <Assa> Found out, that his was an issue with google test causing payload to be empty (which is logically impossible) by doing some memory shenanigans
16:20 < bridge> <Assa> Found out, that his was an issue with google test causing payload to be empty (which is logically impossible) by doing some memory shenanigans. Apperently gtest uses fixtures
16:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> another reason not to use gtest and write your own test framework instead
16:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> all i need for testing is assert_eq and assert_streq thats just one if statement with either ``==`` or ``strncmp`` no need to pull in a dependency for that
16:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> why havent i seen this stuff earlier xd
16:38 < bridge> <Assa> gtest isn't bad for this, it was very easy to setup, does your assert eq, assert ne, assert gt ... statements for you for multiple types, and it's just a testing dependency anyway, so I don't worry about that
16:42 < bridge> <Ewan> i fully recommend catch2 over gtest
16:42 < bridge> <Ewan> even if it wasn’t better avoiding google is reason enough
16:49 < bridge> <Assa> that's actually a good recommendation, [sections](<https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/devel/docs/tutorial.md#test-cases-and-sections>) are something I'd need, gonna look into it, thank you!

17:26 < bridge> <robyt3> @sollybunny You reverted changes from master again in #9284

17:28 < bridge> <woidless> @learath2
17:28 < bridge> <woidless> Where is the Player Check API located in Teedata?
17:34 < bridge> <Solly> NOTTT AGAAINNN
17:35 < bridge> <robyt3> How do you rebase/merge?
17:35 < bridge> <Solly> ^ git novice
17:35 < bridge> <Solly> i only use reset
17:35 < bridge> <Solly> rebase and merge are scary
17:35 < bridge> <robyt3> All you should have to do it update the master branch, then checkout your feature branch and `git rebase master`
17:35 < bridge> <robyt3> All you should have to do is update the master branch, then checkout your feature branch and `git rebase master`
17:35 < bridge> <Solly> git pull ddnet master?
17:36 < bridge> <Solly> :)
17:36 < bridge> <robyt3> assuming you never change your master, pulling should work
17:36 < bridge> <robyt3> otherwise fetch, then reset
17:36 < bridge> <Solly> welp other than that

17:38 < bridge> <montikboom> Use /r
17:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Well, I use a script that fetches upstream, resets master, pushes it to origin and deletes stale branches
17:38 < bridge> <Solly> $stupid{use /r} yeah im in T0 LIKE A CHAD
17:38 < bridge> <DDNet> This command was not found.
17:38 < bridge> <Solly> ah i want my bot
17:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Well, I use a script that fetches upstream, resets master, pushes it to origin and deletes merged branches

20:51 < bridge> <reitw> are u refering to smth like that
20:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Repetitive strain injury mentioned?!
20:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Oh thanks, I was looking at a bad table :p
21:05 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Hey, does anyone here know what the nameplate font is?
21:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do we have a specific font for nameplate?
21:08 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> well thats gotta be some sort of font
21:08 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> I would like to know the font so I can design it on top of my head.. 🤣
21:08 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1312510644922089642/image.png?ex=674cc24b&is=674b70cb&hm=16afd46bd8c9875d79bf1b78b7445029f413fc41c8c20ee74a52a32c0c6eda11&
21:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> dejavu sans
21:09 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> I was the one to take the screenshot so I didn't have a nametag above my head
21:09 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> is that a standard windows font or a custom one?
21:09 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Should be standard iirc
21:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it is all dejavu sans until it isn't
21:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you can just grab it from ddnet install directory
21:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's in the data folder
21:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> every fotn we use it there
21:10 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Alright, thanks a lot for the quick response.
21:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> every fonts we use are there
21:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you can probably just make your entities background white and dummy spectate yourself to take a screenshot for nameplate :kek:
21:13 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> The font looks smoother ingame, are you sure thats the font?
21:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> game renders font pretty differently
21:16 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> nevermind I got it 🤣
21:16 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> i had to tweak it a bit
21:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> are you using photoshop
21:16 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> yeah :kek:
21:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> did you just changed the rendering to smooth instead of whatever it was
21:16 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1312512640433520721/image.png?ex=674cc426&is=674b72a6&hm=e52557e705aa5e003d62eeb0cf0bb292e9c4c4e841a97ea130410a0b3da51258&
21:17 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> I am close to perfection
21:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 🔥
22:27 < bridge> <Solly> nvm bro
22:51 < bridge> <oxyzo.> good luck to the tee thats gonna have to pass through this without touching other tees
23:16 < bridge> <teero777> if you have a demo then set `cl_nameplates_own` to 1 and skip to the point where you took this screenshot
23:17 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> I managed to get it done in photoshop, but thanks anyways :D
