11:38 <@heinrich5991> hi
11:38 <@heinrich5991> ask your question
11:39 <@heinrich5991> (and don't wait for someone to tell you to ask your question ^^)
11:40 < jonas_nf> I have a problem with ddnet, see my mousesenes is really weird and the Graphichs arent the right setting for my screen, but i cant change it cuase my mouse sens is so weird, like it just keeps jumping up and down like crazy, it happend after i tryed to change my graphics, and i honestly dont know what to do :/
11:40 < jonas_nf> So i can only see half of the screeen, and my mouse sens keep jumping, so i cant edit it :o
11:42 < jonas_nf> And i was wondering mabye there was a command or something in f1, so i can change the graphics that way? or how am i gonna solve this problem ;o
11:48 <@EastByte> you can change the graphics settings directly in settings.cfg
11:49 <@EastByte> go into the ddnet folder, run config_directory.bat (which should open the configuration directory) and edit settings.cfg using notepad or something
11:50 <@EastByte> oh, actually settings_ddnet.cfg not settings.cfg
11:52 < jonas_nf> Settings_ddnet?
11:52 < jonas_nf> i dont have such folder
11:53 <@EastByte> the folder will open once you click on config_directory.bat
11:57 < laxa> Hey guys
11:57 < laxa> Who is in charge of the website ?
11:58 < laxa> A friend of mine found a XSS on ddnet.tw
11:58 <@heinrich5991> you can probably report to EastByte
12:00 < jonas_nf> i think i got it to work, but now all teeworlds skins are blurry? - i tryed to restart dint really help :o
12:00 <@heinrich5991> jonas_nf: disable compression in the graphics settings
12:01 < laxa> EastByte: still there ?
12:01 < jonas_nf> no, it worked, i guessi must have clicked it when my mouse was bugging :o
12:01 < jonas_nf> Thank you alot for the help, i apreciate it!
12:36 <@heinrich5991> laxa: you could PM him, he'll probably read when he gets back
