06:41 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
06:43 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
07:41 < eeeee> deen: can pls you add some CORS headers to maps.ddnet.tw
07:43 < eeeee> namely, Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
07:44 < eeeee> not sure if we'd need Access-Control-Allow-Methods, i don't understand the spec :/
08:09 < eeeee> other than that, http map download works in js (what a novel idea)
09:54 < laxadedi> ll
09:54 < laxadedi> oops :p
11:30 <@deen> sure, eeeee 
11:40 <@deen> done
12:05 <@deen> you guys, always encoding your names in magic values
12:15 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: I hope you're doing curl via websockets ^^
12:15 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #144: websockets for server (DDRace64...websockets_pullreq) http://git.io/bFrW
12:35 <@deen> many ddnet servers should be running websockets now
12:38 <@deen> seems to indeed use a bit more memory
12:44 <@deen> really amazing work, eeeee. Hope to see the final JS client soon
15:29 < o_be_one> hi all
16:21 <@deen> hi
19:44 < o_be_one> hi there
19:44 < o_be_one> someone knows COFF file ?
19:47 < Learath2> you are trying to compile with Visual studio ? o_be_one
19:51 < o_be_one> yes Learath2 , vc++ 10
19:51 < o_be_one> 2010
19:51 < Learath2> you need the SP1 update iirc 
19:51 < Learath2> not sure tho i didnt use it for a while
19:52 < o_be_one> ok someone told that it needs to simply remove COFF file
19:58 < eeeee> deen: i think js client for chrome is ready for release, but for firefox we'd need a couple more improvements (pointer lock doesn't work as good and ff seems to have stricter limit on number of open websockets, so pinging all the servers in srvbrowser takes a while)
19:59 < eeeee> anyway i started cleaning it up to make it possible to merge
19:59 <@deen> yay!
19:59 < eeeee> we'd be able to build it with config option like websockets 
19:59 <@deen> that's awesome
20:00 <@deen> people will be really shocked when they see the js client
20:00 <@deen> does it work on mobile phones btw?^^
20:00 < eeeee> idk, i think most people who care already know :)
20:00 < eeeee> maybe except a couple vanilla devs
20:01 <@deen> nope, the regular ddnet players will love that
20:01 <@deen> when I just put an iframe with the client on ddnet.tw :P
20:01 < eeeee> it runs on mobile, but controls are not adapted at all
20:01 < o_be_one> someone told me that there is a trojan in the compiled ddnet oO
20:01 < eeeee> so you cannot actually do anything
20:01 < o_be_one> server
20:01 <@deen> o_be_one: i know that antivirus software says so
20:01 <@deen> i even complained to some of them, but they don't even respond
20:02 <@deen> if you compile with visual c++ the antivirus warning goes away, iirc
20:02 <@deen> only happens with mingw
20:03 < eeeee> we could enable some anrdoid code to make it usable on mobile, but thats gonna be quite a bit of work
20:03 < eeeee> would also drain battery and make the phone super hot
20:03 <@deen> yeahyeah
20:03 < o_be_one> good to know
20:03 <@deen> i'm just asking, it's fine as it is
20:04 <@deen> if someone is interested, they can try to get it working on iphone or sth
20:04 <@deen> for android we have a client already
20:04 < o_be_one> seen some android files yeah
20:11 < o_be_one> XXLTomate, u there ?
