00:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> TIL you can fetch github pr's along with normal branches so you can easily check them out
00:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> RUS dead?
00:34 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 closed pull request #876: [?] Add condition variables (master...dd_pr_cond_vars) https://git.io/vdUKQ
00:36 <+Learath2> @Dr. Jekyll seems so
00:37 <+Learath2> deen: ^^
01:14 <+Henningstone> I wonder is there any special reason for CRenderTools::RenderTilemapGenerateSkip being in CRenderTools? It doesn't access any of its attributes or methods, but it does access members of CLayers through a pointer passed to it. Wouldn't it make more sense to have this function in CLayers instead?
03:21 <+eeeee> layers waste so much memory, someone should figure out an encoding for them which has both compression and fast random access (for collision checks)
03:21 <+eeeee> and fast iteration for rendering (what that Skip function currently does)
04:46 <+Learath2> eeeee: why so happy that I'm moving fetcher into CEngine?
05:04 <+Learath2> eeeee: I think CFetcher is here to stay :/
05:08 <+Learath2> It looks horrible in CEngine with the messy inheritence stuff
07:18 <@deen> eeeee: absolutely. memory is the main constraint. But I was afraid that switching to another representation would probably make cpu the bottleneck instead
07:33 <@deen> Since you guys were wondering about the RUS server. Just found in my spam folder:
07:33 <@deen> У нас произошёл технический сбой на коммутационном оборудовании. Работа сети восстановлена в течение 10-15 минут. К сожалению, нам необходимо в срочном порядке провести работы на сетевом оборудовании (обновление прошивки) для 
07:33 <@deen> того, чтобы устранить некорректную работу. Работы будут проведены в 01:00. Сеть не будет доступна в течение 15 минут. Приносим свои извинения и надеемся на Ваше понимание!
07:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> otlichno moy drug,  spasibo za informatsya
10:00 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> clearl we need a blockchain for ddnet records. every record comes with a teehistorian recording so everyone can verify that the rank is valid on that version of the map. so we can allow unofficial servers
10:02 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> as a replacement of the current centealized database
13:56 <@heinrich5991> bockchain! cloud computing! cyber!
17:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> in gameclient.cpp, do m_pMapLayersBackGround and m_pMapLayersForeGround always point at the same set of layers (unless using entitiy background replacement)
17:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> hmmmm actually, even using background entites, they both still point to the same set
19:51 <+eeeee> deen: nope, that's not enough for unofficial servers unfortunately. e.g. people can create servers which implement /r and splice the teehistorian record.
19:52 <@heinrich5991> true, TAS will be possible
19:52 <@deen> TAS is possible right now too
19:53 <@deen> just record it and replay it on an official server
19:53 <@heinrich5991> bit harder, needs automatic adjustment for ping problems
19:53 <@heinrich5991> but yes
19:53 <@deen> or a vps at the same hoster that we use
21:36 <@heinrich5991> deen: is there a way of asserting that two byte arrays are the same in gtest?
22:04 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ok, so let's stop talking in the admin channel and move our conversation here
22:04 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> why should we be talking in the admin channel for stuff except bugs that can be exploited?
22:05 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @snail @Learath2
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Ryozuki well @heinrich5991 apparently agrees with you
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> oh
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> this is literally i achieve a change in ddnet tbh
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> if this will be really done
22:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> this is literally the first time i achieve a change in ddnet tbh
22:11 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Learath2 said that there's not much that is discussed in the admin channel, so don't expect too much
22:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> this literally changes nothing because it is logically impossible to disprove a conspiracy
22:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Ryozuki please present
22:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> present?
22:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I mean your argument
22:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> what are we discussing then
22:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> so we can all discuss this further and reach a fine conclusion
22:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> About admin discussion being open so that non-admin people can give opinion, except when the discussion involves ssh keys, passwords, exploits?
22:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> I would also make a open discussion for moderator applications
22:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> And discussions about who is no longer useful as ddnet staff
22:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> e.g afk people
22:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> moderator applications would turn into a popularity contest
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> If its highly moderated maybe not
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> chat-moderated
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> if it's highly moderated it's not a fair discussion
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> we could give each person a argument against or in favour
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Wheres the point in making moderator shit public tho
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> arguments considered non-valid will be declined
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I don't know how mod applciations are processed, but I guess these discussions usually happen in private
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> non-valid = stupid reasons
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> who decides what is stupid?
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> we would make a discussion about it too
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> set some list
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> as far as I saw before, every moderator application is hard. you have to trust that person, even if you don't really know them
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> with this, most i'm his friend i want him mod and +1 would be invalid arguments
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> is it mostly mod applications that you're after?
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> "And discussions about who is no longer useful as ddnet staff"
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and any other admin discussion that takes places and not involve ssh keys exploits passwords
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> that can happen eventually
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and any other admin discussion that takes place and not involve ssh keys exploits passwords
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Isnt that kinda embarissing for the unuseful staff?
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> well organized, i think this can be achieved (the mod discussion part)
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> how would you kmow we are still not running some shady business manipulating the votes?
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Ezy and?
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> you obv don't trust us
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> and while hunting for the IRN infiltration we had to consider a few people
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> @Ryozuki dont fuck peoples tw life up man
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> don't you think it's rude to besmirch their reputation?
22:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> they besmirch or whathever it means their reputation themselves
22:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> if u want to keep ur reputation leave ur staff position if you go afk
22:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I think discussions directly about people is probably a bad idea
22:21 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=69&t=5601
22:21 <@deen> @Ryozuki I'll be afk a few months soon. should I be kicked now?
22:21 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Being inactive for longer than 1 month can result in a demotion.
22:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @deen no, cause you are the one who pays the server.
22:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Ryozuki we don't always talk about people in staff, if you are staff you obv take that risk
22:21 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> discussing mods in public is very biased in the way that people wont be honest because they dont want the applicant to be mad at them, especially if they are friends but one doesnt think the other would be a good mod
22:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i'll take that risk
22:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> imho u all should too
22:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i think you don't want to discuss those things in fear of losing ur rank
22:22 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> and then it will be a popularity contest aswell
22:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we all take that risk aswell
22:22 <+ddnet-discord> <snail> also if its not fair right now, why would it be fair when its the 10 discord active members deciding it
22:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> e.g. I pointed out your ssh key while hunting for Sajed
22:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @snail more people better, always
22:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and im, pretty sure it would be more than 10
22:23 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki except when wrong things are said about people. ^^
22:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> thats why i said highly moderated
22:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and why we would set a invalid arguments filter
22:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> or smth like that
22:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> at which point you could claim we moderate it to get the result we want
22:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> no
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but how do you distinguish wrong from right?
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> you would follow the rules decided by all people to moderate correctly
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> how do you verify that we follow the rules?
22:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> mm looking at the discussion
22:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> making a log of deleted messages by who
22:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I can make parts of the discussion disappear without a trace
22:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> botted
22:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> audit log
22:25 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> is there a trusted person in the community who doesn't have any mod/admin/whatever rights?
22:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> which I could manipulate
22:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> @heinrich5991 vali
22:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ok
22:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> there needs to be some trust
22:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> so you cant delete other chat
22:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> @heinrich5991 sp someone
22:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> but only with a bot
22:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and that bot logs the stuff
22:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> nvm doesnt makes sense
22:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> now u will say who hosts it
22:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and blah
22:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> you say and blah like the blah is nothing
22:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i dont
22:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> you either need to place some trust or come up with a perfect way to manage a democracy
22:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> Well democracy has proven to be incredibly hard to do right, and even if you think you've got it right it's still not enough for some people and for others it's too much... I think the ddnet admins are well in the position to decide amongst themselves whom to trust and which application to accept... After all, it's in their own interest isn't it? And if the community starts complaining afterwards, <message clipped>
22:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> but sometimes you complain and nothing would happen too
22:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I know of no country where democracy is perfect
22:29 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> if there's a trusted person in the community without any rights, we could appoint them to watch the admins
22:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> imho a democracy is better than oligarchy
22:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I have responded to every piece of complaint I personally have received
22:29 <@deen> I propose SP|Someone
22:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ^
22:29 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> how about that, @Ryozuki
22:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Democracy im ddnet? 50% would troll
22:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 about sp someone? xD
22:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> jk
22:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> if something was not responded to that thing wasnt shouted loud enough
22:29 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> why do the admins need to be controlled now? what happend? xd
22:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Spain happened
22:30 <@deen> and who controls the controller?
22:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> shh
22:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> its not because that
22:30 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> deen: if you're serious, I can work with that
22:30 <@deen> actually I thoguht my function is to watch the admins
22:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i just made a complain and exposed arguments, now its good u heard me, its up to you if u want to do smth, part of it or nothing
22:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> see you say that as if doing nothing is a bad thing, sometimes the status quo turns out to be the best for the majority
22:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 make a high sophisticated AI to filter invalid arguments xD
22:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> or he could just filter the arguments himself :P
22:32 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> what about deen as a watcher, @Ryozuki ?
22:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Henningstone doesn't work unless you implicitly trust @heinrich5991
22:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i would be fine with it
22:32 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> I thought deen doesn't want to deel with admin complaints?
22:32 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> deal*
22:32 <@deen> yeah, i don't
22:32 <@deen> i watch from very far away
22:32 <@deen> so it's all very quiet
22:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yep thats what i thought
22:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> @Learath2 I consider both least @deen and @heinrich5991 as unquestionable trustable
22:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and why i didnt proposed before
22:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> @Learath2 I consider both @deen and @heinrich5991 as unquestionable trustable
22:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 you also have a really good judgement too
22:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and you really know how to keep calm
22:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and how to express things
22:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> in a no offense way
22:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i find that rly good
22:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Henningstone everyone has to for this while thing to be unquestionable
22:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> yeah @heinrich5991 is pretty good at neutral arguments 😃
22:33 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ❤
22:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> that smiley smiles too much... : ) is what I want
22:34 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> 🙂
22:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> :tw_twinbop:
22:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ^ cute
22:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Wait
22:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> So why do you even want to change things like mod applications in public?
22:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> deen, you could also host teesmash :) https://github.com/timazuki/TeeSmash
22:36 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ok, I admit that I don't watch mod discussions etc., I bet deen doesn't either
22:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @snail or I follow it most of the time
22:37 <@deen> @Ryozuki I'm lazy, but some admin can run it
22:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> np
22:37 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> why do we need to eat all of tw?
22:37 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> if someone else hosts this, it's fine, no?
22:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> unique already hosts this
22:38 <+ddnet-discord> <vali> @heinrich5991 we need a new era of communism
22:38 <+ddnet-discord> <vali> HEIL @FluffiexD
22:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> oh no...
22:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> I think
22:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Great idea
22:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Tezcan> We should do a 2nd tournament @Ryozuki
22:38 <+ddnet-discord> <vali> who deleted my chat?
22:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> @FluffiexD Heinrich
22:39 <+ddnet-discord> <vali> @deen  I promise you one, your ddnet will go down in the next month
22:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> no what you want is bound to turn into anarchy as t->\+inf
22:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Nah actually it was prob @jao undercover
22:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> someone put him the troll role
22:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> so he can't talk here
22:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> I think we should open a different channel to discuss these highly philosophical questions, maybe we can come up with our own new system that would finally though surprisingly work and make the whole world a better place? The world could use that...
22:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Henningstone xD
22:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> this channel is linked to irc
22:41 < vali> faggot
22:41 <+vali> adkw
22:41 <+vali> dkw
22:41 <+vali> ak
22:41 <+vali> dwak
22:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> nice
22:41 <+vali> dwa
22:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Haha
22:41 <+vali> kwad
22:41 <+Henningstone> Nimda best troll xD
22:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 !lockdown yes?
22:41 <@heinrich5991> it is already lockdowned
22:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Lockdown tournament
22:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Ryozuki I have one more argument against public mod discussions
22:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> people can be judged for their vote
22:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> what means that
22:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> you want to make votes anonymous?
22:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> fine with that
22:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> we would need our own chat system then
22:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> yeah but how to secure voting system?
22:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> at which point you can't guarantee non repeated votes
22:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> hmmm
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> anonymous voting is impossible, which is why we still have normal votes in elections
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> votes in my country are pretty anonymous 😃
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> U live with erdogan tho
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> in mine too, you cant know what he votes
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 yet i'm sure you don't vote from home
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you just separate identity from the actual vote
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> but i live in a pesudodictatorship so
22:44 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> pseudo*
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> anoynmous votes over the internet is impossible
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> or neo is better maybe
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Learath2 bold claim, people have made others
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> IIRC
22:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I dare you to find a way, I spent hours to figure out a way
22:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> dna vote xD
22:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> with which I can identify you
22:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> :/
22:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> well discussing that is useles
22:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> as its clearly impossible
22:46 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> "clearly impossible"
22:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 i'd love to know if there is a way
22:47 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yea, me too, googling
22:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 in ddnet i mean
22:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> our politicians either I bet :D
22:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> 😄
22:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://www.adoodle.org/
22:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> if anonymous votes are impossible I don't think we should make public discussions out of moderators aswell
22:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ?
22:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> doesn't get you non repeatable votes
22:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> the vote system requires an email
22:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> xD
22:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> Please give a list of emails (one for each line or in comma separated form or else).
22:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> The voter will receive an email containing a unique personal vote ticket and two links to vote and display the results of the vote. Naturally a voter can only vote once.
22:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> then you trust adoodle.org to keep their identity a secret
22:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> using a external service for us i dont think its a problem
22:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> its a ddnet vote, not a entire state vote
22:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> @Learath2 u think people would go that far just to judge someone?
22:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> funny how you trust a possibly for profit company more then us 😄
22:51 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Learath2 e.g. trustless online poker is also possible btw (haven't found sth in quick googling)
22:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 :P
22:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 whats that?
22:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> online poker is possible as it's not necessary for the sides to know the other persons identity
22:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> just something I remember from a cryptography course
22:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ah
22:53 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but you still have to shuffle the cards
22:53 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> some way
22:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it's only necessary to get a trusted roll from the "casino"
22:53 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> no
22:53 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> trustless
22:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it's called provably fair
22:53 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> as I said
22:53 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> decentralized and everything
22:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> provably fair provides the trust i mean
22:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> no need for any implicit trust
22:53 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but it's something I would have considered impossible before that class
22:54 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> so don't consider anonymous voting impossible so fast
22:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well if there was a solution to anonymous voting i think state sized entities would have found it
22:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> or maybe not
22:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> why would a state whatn unanymous
22:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> they like data
22:54 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> anonymous voting over the internet is just not a good idea over the internet
22:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and knowing people
22:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well not the state but the unis
22:54 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> computers get hacked etc.
22:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> well yeah, unis, I think I read about anonymous online voting before, so you have that 😃
22:56 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature
22:56 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> sounds like a good start
22:57 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> (cryptography/math can do more for you than one would think)
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> What the
22:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @Savander ?
22:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> weird discussion
23:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> World never was equal, why you are trying to make it here? 😄
23:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> And why not?
23:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> :P
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> cause, it's impossible 😄
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> People are egocentric race
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> it would only be possible as long as each and everyone has the same understanding
23:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> and common sense oc
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> which just doesn't happen. A handful 'bad' people is enough... Wait how do you know they are bad? For them you are bad xd
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> see, already doesn't work
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You can make world better, but you will find 10 more people who will fuck you up
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> doesn't mean you shouldn#t try
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ^
23:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It could work only if you will choose specific persons
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like in sects
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> DDNet the sect?
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😄
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> thats the oposite of what we want
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> choosing specific people
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> like currently
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> well
23:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> we = me
23:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we 😃
23:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> łi łi
23:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Çřåčķ
23:34 <+Learath2> deen: here?
