05:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Isn't our mac built seg faulting. Maybe we should just temporarily revert to 15.4 on steam until someone got around to debug it.
07:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can you start ddnet client over github actions ^^
07:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ez macos debug session
08:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <SandFist> @everyone Hello ! I leave cs: go and give all my inventory, the first three who send a trade - I will give a knife  https://stearncomminuty.ru/tradofer/6561150893378940
08:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that was fast
08:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in the vm it works xd

08:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its so funny how much time i wasted for this game finding bugs that don't exists
09:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :justatest:
09:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think I can revert just one platform
09:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 😔
10:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Actually the guy posted in a thread by someone else. And that someone else deleted the thread, probably because he was annoyed by the notifications.
11:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just got 5g enabled
11:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have this incredible urge to buy windows 11, it seems to be working already
11:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is ur brain noticing the wavelengths
11:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> beware of the aliens
11:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
12:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's incredible I can contact all my vaccinated friends
12:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I hope I can get the second dose before the incompetent italian govt starts running low again
12:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are doing 3 weeks between doses now but if they start running out it will become 5 again
12:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Longer wait causes a higher antibody response in second dose, so probably not a big problem to do it slower. Study was only in > 80 year olds though: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.15.21257017v1 Most of Germany is doing 6 weeks for the mrna vaccines
13:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> isn't it free
13:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It can be better but it does make my vacation plans very annoying :D
13:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is for windows 10 owners
13:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ok
13:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> In some countries I checked full vaccination is currently not required for travel, quick tests are often enough
13:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie it was a joke about Bill Gates controlling people who got vaccinated through their new 5G antennas in the shoulder 😉
13:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh that's not an issue. The issue is that I need to be in turkey by a certain date. If they lengthen the span too much I might miss it
13:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I see
13:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie Not sure if these conspiracy theories reached China: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_misinformation
13:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's 33 degrees and I'm wearing pants, I am dying here :P
13:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> oh i'm pretty aware of them
13:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can we get to winter already?
13:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> go into the freeze
15:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> you'd skip autumn? :(
15:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm I can do autumn too
15:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> autumn with long rainy days and stormy weather
15:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> especially now with the majority of people having to stay at home
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Is anyone skilled in probability here? A deck of 32 cards, 4 of which are jacks, are dealt to three players. Each player gets 10 cards, the remaining 2 cards are the so-called Skat. What's the probability of (a) any of the players having exactly 3 jacks and (b) all players having at least 1 jack?
16:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It's a uni problem. I'm curious to know, because the solution isn't published yet. (I'm not getting points for this.)
16:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, sounds interesting. I'll try
16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I already solved (c) probability of the first player having having exactly 2 jacks and (d) probability that there is at least 1 jack in the Skat.
16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I found them easy in comparison
16:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> And I got estimates from a python script which simulates the experiments
16:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is (a) ~0.22? timakro
16:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yes, nice
16:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> How did you do it?
16:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I asked how many possibilities we have to distribute 4 jacks to 32 card positions
16:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the 32 card positions are 10 player 1, 10 player 2, 10 player 3, and 2 skat
16:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then we have to place the first jack on any player, 30 possibilities, 9 possibilities for the second jack, 8 for the third, and 22 for the last
16:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I'm overcounting a bit because the first three jacks are indistinguishable, so divide that by 3!
16:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not entirely sure it's correct, now that I explained it
16:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `30*9*8*22/3! / (32!/28!/4!)`
16:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> read it? timakro ^^ comments/questions/critique?
16:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm still processing \:D
16:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I never had a talent for probability
16:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Ah the denominator is "32 choose 4"
16:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah makes sense
16:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Why the first three jacks are indistinguishable?
16:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it doesn't matter in which order we pick the jacks of the player
16:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we could also pick the second jack first, and then the first and then the third
16:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we need to not distinuish that because the denominator also doesn't distinguish it
16:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 32 choose 4 is without ordering
16:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have a guess for (b), too
16:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Why not divide by 4 factorial instead of 3 factorial?
16:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because the fourth isn't indistinguishable
16:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can't pick the fourth first, because the other two wouldn't be from the same player
16:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is (b) about 0.569?
16:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Python says .4311
16:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> darn it
16:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, combinatorics is also hard for me 😄
16:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> couldn't get two in a row, would've been too lucky
16:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm super impressed you got (a) \:)
16:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Combinatorics can feel a bit like a gamble ^^
16:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
16:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I calculated 1-
16:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oops
16:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I also got that right 😮
16:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> notice how our numbers add to 1? ^^
16:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Ah
16:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wanna hear this explanation too? I'm excited 😄
16:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Let's go!
16:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so, I calculated the opposite event
16:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "at least one" screams like "opposite event" 😛
16:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so what's the opposite event? at least one player doesn't have a jack
16:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I actually thought that too
16:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so, how likely is it that player 1 doesn't have a jack?
16:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `22*21*20*19//4!`
16:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we do have three players though, it gets a little more complicated
16:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we could take `3 * 22*21*20*19//4!`, but then we're overcounting the card positions where two players have no jack
16:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (it cannot happen that three players have no jack)
16:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so we just need to subtract the possibilities where two players have no jack
16:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how likely is it that player 1 & 2 have no jack? `12*11*10*9//4!`
16:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how many possibilities do we have for two players that have no jack? 3
16:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so in total we get `22*21*20*19//4! - 12*11*10*9//4!`
16:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ore more cleanly: ((22 choose 4) - (12 choose 4)) / (32 choose 4)
16:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Very nice
16:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Thanks man, gonna have to train this stuff
16:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> glad to be a help, these brain cells got a bit dusty ^^
16:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> did you do this in uni too? Did you even study, or are you still at it?
16:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I do study maths, but I think most of my intuition comes from the mathematic olympiads I did at school
16:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my intuiton wrt. combinatorics
16:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, I tried going backwards by picking the skats first but keep getting .17 for the first one 😛
16:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I've got two friends who study maths, personally I'm happy I picked computer science hehe
16:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Quite a challenging unassuming looking problem 😛
16:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> well, you can learn those rules like not forgetting to substract P(A n B) when you add P(A) + P(B), like heinrich correctly did in (b)
16:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> More than that of course, but I bet it's pretty powerful when you've got some practice
16:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Here is what I tried, that on the surface appears correct. Of all the states of this system after distributing. There are 3 states for the skats, there will be 0, 1 or 2 jokers. If there is one skat joker the players have 3. There are 3 ways to distribute these jokers, you can give 3 to one person, 2 to one 1 to another, and one each. Only 1 of those states is desirable. So 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9. If there are 0 skat jokers the players have 4, 1/
16:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wish discord showed math like latex
16:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki on the math discord we have a bot that does latex
16:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.mathjax.org/
16:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> someone integrate this
16:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I think already assuming the probability of the 3 states (0, 1 or 2 jokers in the skat) to be the same is wrong
16:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, that’s where I assume my error lays too
16:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heinrich’s answer just makes sense so I didn’t really bother looking into fixing it 😛
17:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> i hate math
17:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Me2
17:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> :signs: math best
17:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let’s ban math
17:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> :tear:
17:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> What I love about mathematicians at uni\: They don't force you to do group exercises and appreciate the value of trying a problem alone at first. They write a clean and correct scripts\: I've had lecturers with the worst dialect/handwriting, but there are always latex scripts and they are invaluable.

17:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’d guess it depends on the uni, the lecturer and the material. My analysis 2 textbook is so hard to comprehend and the lecturer has such meh english
17:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Takes me like 30 minutes to get through understanding one proof because the textbook shoves so much into one = sign
17:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Not saying they tend to have bad handwriting, currently my maths professor is great. But what I'm saying is at least there is the script as a backup. In a robotics course they lecturer provides these semi mathematical slides with formulas all over the place, it's terrible. Different symbols for the same thing, just untidy
17:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> .!ban 3.141.5.92 math 3600 too hard
17:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> \:)
17:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Somebody on this planet has an PI IP *chuckle*
17:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Somebody on this planet has a PI IP *chuckle*
17:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’d seriously pay someone to never see higher math again in my life
17:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> What are you studying?
17:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Probs CS
17:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Computer engineering, haven’t touched a computer related topic in months
17:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> CS != computer engineering?
17:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Feels like I’m just in a “engineering” course. I’m studying thermodynamics and analysis ffs
17:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nope, very different curriculums
17:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Is it more close to hardware?
17:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, and it doesn’t have much theory at all, even in algorithms it’s more their use instead of their properties
17:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here its called informatics engineering, computer engineering being a specialisation later
17:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ori dk
17:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe its the same
17:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Expect for the physics and math. Gotta learn those as if you will be sending a rocket to the moon…
17:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never understood the difference
17:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Sounds fun, honestly
17:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why do I need to know the proof of green’s thrm? It works, like why do you quiz me on it?
17:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> You can REALLY make a case that it is unnecessary
17:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> With physics and maths it's the same for CS at my uni
17:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But I don't mind too much I like seeing some "real" math

17:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Useless garbage that I won’t ever use in a lifetime. I will right here tell you that if the proof of green’s thrm is of any use to me within my lifetime I will donate every single cent I’ve earned up until then to the uni
17:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Not too much though please \:D
17:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> There are multiple PI IPs
17:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> i only checked these two :)
17:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don’t get me wrong I love hearing about the inner workings of math, but I’m not a mathematician, they are a mere curiosity to me, why tf do I have to know these?
17:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> for science
17:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> for analysis
17:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’m not a scientist either
17:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> you can be if you want to 👀
17:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://farm.bot/
17:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> go to a quiet place, set up ur open source farm bot and enjoy life without maths
17:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> What's the PI IP with most possible digits?
17:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If only I randomly made like a couple million dollars and can afford to just live in a quiet place and farm
17:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> farming would be pretty chill
17:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> but i've heard farmers are really just betting on earth to give them profit.
17:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which is why I need a couple million as a backup 😄
17:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ah, fair enough
17:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://community.twistedfields.com/t/introducing-acorn-a-precision-farming-rover-from-twisted-fields/17
17:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that looks cool
17:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> one of my aunt is a farmer. the off season is like nothing to do for them.
17:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know the common advice of, make your hobby your work? I think I advocate for the complete opposite now
17:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Keep your hobbies away from your work as much as possible
17:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> oh no. i'm doomed
17:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Within 5 years uni managed to ruin computers for me
17:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> well depends on how you define hobby i guess.
17:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can’t wait until the day I graduate and my boss ruins it further
17:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> i always thought my hobby is computers. but really it is just video games.
17:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i ditched uni 1st year did a 2 year oficial thingy and now i have a job
17:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> oh no, i'm still doomed
17:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
17:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I’d ditched uni I’d have so many issues with my parents
17:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean, i wouldnt ditch uni if i were at year 5
17:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just saw what was coming and decided it was not worth my time
17:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 4 probs 5 years
17:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> life is 2 short
17:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I’ll go back to studying thermodynamics for my COMPUTER engineering degree
17:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:  COMPUTER :monkalaugh:
17:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Next year I have fluid dynamics, so that will be extra fun
17:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 🤔 i never thought of ditching uni. but i'm not evolved as much as regular students i would imagine.
17:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> also i was in US so i might've been in easy mode.
17:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some jobs listings require uni for doing frontend stuff with reactjs which baffles me but so be it
17:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is enough out there
17:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> uni is pretty chill for me. i did almost get expelled because someone stole my code. but luckily it was resolved. but that's like the one time i'm stressed out in uni
17:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
17:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> code thiefs
17:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Some kid from pakistan stole some of my draft paper to steal my code, he didn’t understand it and he put it back 😛
17:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
17:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> how to get to know department head personally 101: get in plagiarize situation and spend 5 sessions one on one with him to talk about it.
17:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mind you we were doing cs101, so this is like very basic stuff
17:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> honestly being the one who can actually code in early CS kinda sucks.
17:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Took him 5 damn sessions? They usually just do an oral exam here and it’s immediately obvious who actually knows the material
17:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> well he knows who's the knower. he just want to make sure i didn't give my answer out to others
17:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Why? Just don't go to the programming classes, theory is usually still more new/interesting
17:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> which is still plagiarizing
17:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was called to an oral exam because the programming part of my exam was full marks, but the theory was half. Apparently it’s the other way around for most people. Told the guy I just am not good at writing the steps of quicksort with a pen
17:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, makes sense
17:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> well too late. already got sniped and forcefully "befriended" with many random dudes that i really don't like.
17:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Having the social skills of a potato helps. I just flat out told people that asked me for help that they should study instead
17:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :justatest:
17:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> that's a strategy i guess
17:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Might be the reason I don’t have many friends except that weird russian kid
17:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did offer to tutor them btw, these people just don’t care though. Not once in my 5 years here has someone asked me to teach them something. Always can you pls do my exam for me
17:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> well for me i can't really escape, it's like you are automatically obligated to help other chinese students. it's weird. even if you say no they still come back because they don't know anyone else.
17:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> just like how i don't know anyone else
17:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pretend you don’t speak chinese
17:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> well that probably won't go well in the end lol
17:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen u got best marks only in CS? xd
17:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 🤔 people keep saying don't get dragged into a group of chinese. but i don't know why it is impossible, but it is impossible somehow
17:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> i mean while being abroad ofc.
17:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Haha, same with turkish people abroad. Not staying at a dorm and never going to the uni is your only option
17:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> oof
17:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Funnily enough through the 3 or so friends I made so many random people reach out to ask me to do their exams
17:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like wtf, who asks a friend of a friend of a friend
17:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 👀
17:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> asking someone to do ur exam is already rly pityful
17:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why even go to uni
17:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> well i get that too
17:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got that even in the 2 year thing i did
17:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they even offered me 50€
17:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is only one circumstance in which I’d agree with this. People whose courses have nothing to do with computers and aren’t going to graduate if they don’t pass
17:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> also many chinese go abroad for uni not because they want better education, because they can't get in a chinese one via "the exam"
17:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm
17:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don’t condone torturing students with irrelevant courses because the curriculum is shit
17:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> too hard exams?
17:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> so chinese students usually suck, especially when you suck at general education too (e.g. me)
17:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> too much competition i guess
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here u need x mark at a special exam to enter the ranking list for unis
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> hm, sounds good and bad at the same time
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> “The exam” also is very hard in turkey, but we have private unis to help the situation so less turkish kids abroad
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in university you mean? Math, Physics and Biology were a bit worse than CS for me. Why?
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In turkey you need to be within top 240k to get into any engineering course anywhere. Top 10k if you want to get into any half decent one
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> i only know a bit english and my programming thing in highschool because i was going for the program that skips "the exam". but that program was cancelled the year i went for it. even though i have exclusively prepared for it since elementary school.
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 2.5m take it each year so about top 10%
17:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> oof
17:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Why not, from feeling u and heinrich are ppl that always have best mark xD
17:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> so i have to go for US college last minute. i spend three month on some english and applied one and just went.
17:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well ur written english is p good
17:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Didn’t they require toefl?
17:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ye
17:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> i spend three month to get a TOEFL score
17:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What was your score after 3 months?
17:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> it was ok enough to not require an extra year for preliminary english courses, instead the uni offered in credit english courses.
17:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> so i can take english courses as my credit
17:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I got lazy, skipped too many classes probably, only started studying 1-2 days before exam. Didn't feel like it's worth it to put in so much more effort for a slightly better mark
17:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> which made it a bit more easier for me i guess
17:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> i got only 70 lol
17:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 😅
17:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My random italian uni requires 90 minimum, I can’t imagine the US accepting much less
17:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, 70 is pretty decent for only 3 months of studying
17:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> well the uni has pretty low bar and short on money.
17:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And you seem to have improved your english a lot during your time in the US. Your written english is great
17:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I see, but if you just learn so less you probably had the knowledge before.
17:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Since you also have quite alot of projects you are part of, that would fit xD
17:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> people keep saying that but my academic writing is still really bad.
17:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> i can write email just fine tho.
17:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, that’s a very specific skill that you have to study for specifically. Can’t really just absorb it through osmosis 😄
17:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not really. I tried to pick stuff in university where I don't have experience, so mostly algorithms and weird theory
17:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Oh ok
17:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen do you feel like you’ve learned something in uni that you wouldn’t be able to learn on your own?
17:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Now I know how to sort numbers in exactly sqrt(n)+3 time on an infinite two dimensional board of cellular automata 😄
17:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 Yeah, definitely. I would not have learned the hardware and theory stuff on my own, the programming in uni was not so interesting
17:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> After 5 years, I can confidently say that I haven’t acquired a single piece of information relevant to anything I will do in the future
17:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> i learned valgrind exists, so that's a plus for me.
17:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But yeah, I'm probably not using anything from university for my actual work (or side projects)
17:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I learned some linear algebra which was probably the only course that might have any application in the future
17:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I probably should have taken database classes since I'm working on a database system now
17:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie in some cases sanitizers are the faster / more modern solution
17:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> it might be weird to say, but i do enjoy math class where i realize how calculator works even though it was nothing about calculators.
17:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ah, I learned some good latex skills in university, we had a class for that, really liked the professor's latex style.
17:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> that's pretty cool
17:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> our uni just expected you to know it in the end.
17:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and algorithms and optimizations, we had some competitions for that, I really enjoyed them
17:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I took introduction to databases last year, quite a boring lecture. I might have enjoyed something a little more thorough though
17:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> i was doing algorithms and stuff ever since middle school. so i basically avoided all of the competition things.
17:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> and i really don't like algorithms and data structure even though i'm supposed to be good at it
17:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I found all my computer related lectures to be very out of date and very rigid. Algorithms professor didn’t like how I picked my pivots for quicksort (because it made the answer shorter). Database lass didn’t like that I used partitions
17:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 🤔 i think the outdated stuff are supposed to be the basic.
17:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Computer networks guy just wouldn’t shut up about virtual circuits and some ISDN stuff
17:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Programming Paradigms class in university I also liked and feels like it helps with programming even in less obscure languages. So maybe I learnt more than I thought after all
17:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dialup facebook…
18:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 🤔 i have a feeling that you're just annoyed that you are getting "useless" information.
18:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, what did you do in this class?
18:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I am not only annoyed, I’m extremely annoyed
18:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Haskell, Prolog, Parallel Programming, some compiler basics
18:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now that sounds interesting
18:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 🤔 maybe you should stop thinking uni as an education of subject rather than an education of the process of dealing with the subject. ~~or maybe i'm taking my uni wrong~~
18:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s neither. It’s just a painful obstacle they put in your way so you are ready for the 30 years of misery awaiting you at the tail end
18:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> but to be fair i was in uni for the piece of paper that i get to show other people in the first place
18:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> also because parents ofc
18:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Exactly why I’m still bothering at all. If I didn’t care about the paper or had an ounce of confidence I’d just drop it
18:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 🤔 are you having trouble finishing it tho
18:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ofc I’m having trouble finishing it. I’m on the 5th year of a 3 year degree 😄
18:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :justatest:
18:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> oh
18:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ~~have you tried a therapy~~
18:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm enjoying work, if that's what you're referring to as "30 years of misery"
18:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because at this point “understanding” and “knowing” something are very different. I’m very good at the first, you’d be hard pressed to find a subject I can’t understand at all. My focus duration of a goldfish makes it extremely hard to get good at the second one
18:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> well i think my uni is just easier in the end.
18:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> See in this instance I’m supposed to be solving my 50th instance of a thermodynamics problem but I drifted into chatting with you
18:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hopefully I’ll find something I enjoy too
18:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> my time in u of edinburgh didn't go too well but i was assuming that was bc of the pandemic
18:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> also i wasn't prepared for a thesis for like at all
18:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> bc my undergrad uni somehow doesn't require one
18:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> undergrad was in the US?
18:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ye
18:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I heard it's more common there to require no bachelor thesis
18:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> probably. i know our journalism major do have thesis. but we don't, we need an extra course for scientific writing but that's all.
18:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> so i have no idea what i was doing during the master's thesis..
18:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh thesis will be so fun for me, I don’t know any of the professors at all
18:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 🤔 In UoE we can get allocated. I only get to know one right before my thesis started.
18:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I also didn't know the profs I worked with, just applied to their open thesis positions
18:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hopefully that’s how it works here too, I’m choosing to not think about that now so I don’t just break down at the insanity of the pit I dug myself into
18:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have 6 exam sessions to collect so many credits it’s unbelievable. I’m planning to get it close enough and beg for my life 😛
18:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :justatest: anxiety hell
18:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ok my brain isn't working. i meant to type year 5 for a 3 year program feels like anxiety hell
18:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 1 hour of random reading and green tea does wonders for it. You get to pretend for an entire hour that you have free time to be wasting
18:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’m about to start reading some Engels. Always wanted to learn more about marxist philosophy
18:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :justatest: maybe get a therapist for realsies.
18:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> After I finish this degree up I will definitely need one
18:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’m planning to move to tibet after I’m done to become a monk
18:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I don't think that's how Tibet works
18:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Damn
18:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Would it be lama instead of monk
18:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Wouldn't it*
18:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can I become a llama? I’d be okay with that too
18:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> maybe only chinese distinguish the two
18:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is way too complicated. I’ve decided to instead go to new zealand to herd sheep
18:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> that reminds me a movie I've watched on a plane once. Where you get surgically transformed into an animal of choice if you are single for too long.
18:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> bring me with u
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol wtf is that plot
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I really don't know
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lobster
18:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is the weirdest movie I've ever read the synopsis of
18:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just might watch it
18:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Tell me what you think if you watched it. Bc I sure don't know how to think when I watched it.
18:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> heinrich feels like the cool guy in the class that just knows everything.
19:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> classic china... in germany we usually do not call the smart ones "cool" \:D
19:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> smart people think smarter people are cool
19:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> 😅
19:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> Might be a age thing
19:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> I wouldn't call the smart ones cool in elementary school either
21:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea i guess since i dropped out of school so early for me class=elementary and smart ones used to get bullied there not called cool \:D but chinas schools are a bit different i think
21:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> Ye I don't think we have a lot of bullying and name calling and stuff
21:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> Usually if kid just straight up fights
21:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> Usually kid just straight up fights*
21:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> either that or just bring quiet and nobody really bothers you
21:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> Probably because chinese teacher do hit childrens sometimes and parents have no problem letting them or even encourage them to lol
21:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> ingame hitting each other is also quite a common thing
21:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> 😅
21:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> that was a joke but it's interesting that most games are about fighting/killing/defeating each other
21:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> Well a game is about winning so it has to be an activity that has a winner.
21:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> ~~Like war~~
21:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> do u have to win in order for it to be a game tho
21:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> If you consider desert bus to be a game then no I guess
21:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> LOL
21:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Conway's Game of Life
21:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> gg
21:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> Well in game of life dead cells are losers. It just happens to be automatic:kek:
21:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> they can revive :troll:
22:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> But for real tho. Are there any "non 
22:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> -violent" games that aren't simulators or sports
22:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> even my pillow can be used for violent purposes
22:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> so
22:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> all puzzle games
22:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> Oh right
22:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> rhythm games aren't violent too
22:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> I guess I even forgot BiggerNouis
22:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> beat saber :justatest:
22:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> its not violent you're just slicing cubic fruit
22:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> fruit ninja
22:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> There should be a steam simulator game where you play games for skins/hats drops and sell them to buy games that are on sale.
22:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <可爱的懒散> You starts with $0 and see how many games you can buy.
22:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lol
22:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> sports are also about winning + some sports are violent
22:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> tank race
