00:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @.puch as fokko said not without changing the code. There is no config to disable 0.6. I am curious why do you want that?
00:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ninekeem we can talk without spamming ddnet #developer on https://chat.zillyhuhn.com/ but I think the best would be if you get an account on wire and add @zillyhuhn its free your can register for example here https://teams.wire.com/register/email/
00:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ninekeem what is the build error you get for bundled libs? The mysql thing is weird it works fine on debian 12 for me. The error message is not very useful ._. can I easily reproduce your k8s environment to debug my self?
00:33 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i guess they are tired of people running with hax and thats why they want to disable 0.6
00:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> interesting
00:35 < bridge> <totar> 0.7 as anticheat :kek:
00:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> at this point you might want to use a teeworlds server instead of a ddnet bridge server @.puch as much as I would love to drop 0.6 in general i do not think it is worth the maintenance effort to add that config to ddnet-insta
00:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> btw most cheat clients are based on recent enough ddnet they should all be able to connect to 0.7 as well

11:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ninekeem the ddnet deps from the readme should be enough https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet?tab=readme-ov-file#dependencies-on-linux--macos
11:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you use alpine right? thats always a potential pain in the ass
11:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> back when i tried to build a Docker image for the old ddnet++ i rage quitted on alpine because of some musl bugs and switched to ubuntu https://github.com/BanBansNet/ddnet-docker/blob/e44c32ae0784762fe6692d333299e0d3b210c7ae/ddnetpp/Dockerfile
11:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i did make ddnet with mysql work on alpine tho and iirc i even tested that in kubernetes and the db was working https://github.com/BanBansNet/ddnet-docker/blob/e44c32ae0784762fe6692d333299e0d3b210c7ae/ddnet-mysql/Dockerfile
11:28 < bridge> <Assa> I wonder that this docker repo doesn't spin up a db for records or download all maps from ddnet-maps, but at least it's a nice and easy container
11:29 < bridge> <Assa> but I guess it's overkill anyways üòÑ
12:51 < bridge> <robyt3> ChillerDragon: I don't think you can just change the linker for the Android build, it specifically uses lld from Android NDK toolchain. Also make sure you don't use rust nightly, I think that also leads to linking errors.
12:52 < bridge> <robyt3> Use `keytool` to create a signing key, though you can also use the default debug key for testing

14:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I originally wrote it as `fmap (fmap flip) $ (.) . flip` but I rewrote it like that because I thought it looked funny
14:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Hmm, `(flip .) . ((.) . flip)` is even funnier, but I think it's getting a bit too obfuscated at this point

14:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> though then again, typing `:t (flip .) . ((.) . flip)` into `ghci` I would instantly explain to me the meaning of that code

14:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> as a mod i should warn you to stop posting inappropriate messages
14:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It turns out that the type of the function explains its meaning much better than the actual code in this case
