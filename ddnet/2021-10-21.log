03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> using mouse to drag values in the editor (like position values for a group) seems to only do it in steps of 2
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you have to press shift
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> was that changed? i think shift always was for slow mode
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ah didnt know
03:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> that changed ye but its nice
06:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> why many maps ðŸ˜®
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen is it not working correctly?
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @perrodecerro Halloween versions
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut seems so
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What did FÃ¤n say to that?
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I could not aim in old editor i can not aim in new editor so a big neutral from my side for the new desktop mouse \:D
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> I'm trying to make SDL resize smoothly on Wayland
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/900679430253477948/output.mp4
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> It's not perfect but at least it doesn't flash like it currently does
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wayland trol
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> lol no tearing updates
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the font looks seriously broken oO
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> the video looks seriously broken
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i can not play it
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> I normally play on X11 with old opengl
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> Text is broken on opengl 3
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on opengl3 with wayland or also x11?
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> downloaded the video was worth it
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have opengl3 + x11 with no broken text
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> looks smooth af good job m8
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> It's probably a driver bug
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> I haven't tested opengl 3 on wayland because only gles works with my glew version

11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, no embed for me either
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> I don't know what codecs discord supports
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> I searched stack overflow for how to make a video smaller with ffmpeg
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> and used that
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wasnt it -c or -a
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> I searched stack exchange for how to make a video smaller with ffmpeg
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> `ffmpeg -i recording.mp4 -vcodec libx265 -crf 28 output.mp4`
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i expected electron to be able to play any .mp4
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah ye -crf
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> u can probably skip the -vcodec part
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> using h264:
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/900681128850096158/output2.mp4
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yay ðŸ¥³
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yo heinrich this ca-ddnet.pem file should it be in cmakelists or not?
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> did that change over time?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should be in, did not change over time, I think
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> weird because if i have it in cmake complains
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> Text on opengl3 is broken for me since ddnet 15.3
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use libx264
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz discord is dumb and cant support "modern" codecs
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> element cant either as it seems
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> I just used ffmpeg without `-vcodec` and it worked
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye its the default i guess
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ffmpeg so good
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ffmpeg top10 underrated softwares
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not underrated
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:D
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its just that normies dont know about it cuz its used by software under the hood
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yes
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Maiski do you compile ddnet yourself?
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I hear "oh ffmpeg can do that" a lot at work tho...
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> no
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> omg i always switch from vim to vscode when i have to edit multiple lines that are not aligned \:c
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> can some vim wizard tell  me how to append to multiple line ends of different length
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how many?
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> like 10
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> dont come at me with macros
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `Atext to be appended<esc>`
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then navigate to each line and press `.`
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh yea that works i guess
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> what about 100 lines?
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> alternatively, if they're adjacent, you could also do search&replace: `V<select lines>:s/$/text to be appended/`
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but that worked like a charm i never use A and . i know about them but i should really learn to use em
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you cant know all vim
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea but the time it takes to type \:s/$/append/ is probably slower than to open vscode o.O
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjFYbOK1qzY
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> that would be cool sadly i can not get it working
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> no but i would like to improve my multi line game to not be so dependent on vscode anymore
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> First bad commit is a77e3ca84229b72da9b5f7b92cf2b596f191c6a3
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Smells like another gl error we ignore
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which jupstar will claim is a driver bug, then I'll have to try debug it, then it'll turn out to be us not being in spec like the last time
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/c85ffb90afc3f245fa942a3982518d7c7e5a0306/data/shader/text.frag#L32-L34
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> Adding these lines back fixes it
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> divide by zero doesn't look good
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> funny enough the issue you relate to, we i never assumed a driver bug.
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> We first thought about a buffer overflow, or corruption and later found out, that its the undefined enumAlso text shader is GL 3.3 not GL 3, and also not used int GL 3

15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lmao what happend to lld
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as for the issue @Maiski i cannot find any well defined behavior in the spec
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glBlendFunc.xhtml
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> says "Incoming (source) alpha is correctly thought of as a material opacity, ranging from 1.0 ( K A ), representing complete opacity, to 0.0 (0), representing complete transparency."Which i assume is wrong, as the spec does not garantuee that, so i'd say it is indeed UB
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> does ddnet server link curl?
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i can not find it in the cmakelists

15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> seems client only to me
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what error do you get?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i fixed it
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> my cmakelists.txt is better than my german now
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what did you change btw? \:D

18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah got it
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ez
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ur like the cmake magician now
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Itube> Stop speak gay watafak
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> Jupstar âœª: I moved ack_configure and SDL's resize event sending to after SwapBuffers on top of <https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/4821> (so the whole resize is delayed).  It still needs some work to make it work better.
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> SDL's API wasn't designed for Wayland, so handling resizes "properly" is impossible
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> The only place where SDL can safely resize a backbuffer is SwapWindow, so the whole resize must be delayed
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and how about cancel the SDL loop after a resize event and trigger a redraw from the main app?
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> next frame can then listen to the next resize event
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> SDL can't force its users to immediately redraw after getting a resize event
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no, but ddnet could do it manually
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> actually i'm not sure if that would help
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so its hanging inside the window manager?
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> there can be a race between rendering and handling events
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> yes, the clients sends an old-sized buffer to the window manager, then acks the configure and finally sends a new correctly sized buffer
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> yes, the client sends an old-sized buffer to the window manager, then acks the configure and finally sends a new correctly sized buffer
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh, then wayland is really weird programmed
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> SDL can't resize the buffer earlier because that can be racy
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs of waylands frontbuffer only design or what?
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> because resizing the buffer from an event thread can collide with render calls from another thread
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> the buffer must be resized in the render thread
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i mean i understand the problem in itself, but how does this fixes something, it just hides the problem under a scaled old framebuffer or smth
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> The committed buffer will be the size the window manager expects it to be
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes, but lets assume your WM works with 60fps, but your app only works with 10 fps
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do you want to wait for the app?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> yes
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> that's how you get perfect frames
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mh ok
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but that will make resizing really weird
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i am really not a fan of waylands perfect frame obsession, the main reason i dont use it yet
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs the performance is really great, no doubt about it
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> yes, playing DDNet is quite annoying with the delay
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i hope they allow front buffer rendering at some point
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> else gamers will probs not switch
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> especially with ubuntu already using wayland
