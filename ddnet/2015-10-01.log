18:27 < Phaturia> Hi, I just started to browse the ddnet.tw webpage, and i find this: http://ddnet.tw/status/ Can i ask what the hell is doing the first ''DDNet.tw"? Just that server have always very very big cpu load.. Its not so healthy :D
18:51 < o_be_two> hello
19:00 < Learath2> Phaturia: its the server the site is hosted on 
19:03 < laxa> Phaturia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_(Unix)
19:04 < laxa> since the website isn't that critic, I think the server is running a lots of update scripts like calculation of points etc...
19:10 < Phaturia> its ok that the websrv, but a webserver isnt so resource fucker :D but yeah update/calculation maybe
19:20 < Phaturia> And any information about the servers processors? There is just a usage percent. I'm just curious
19:30 < laxa> the web server is 3.2 Ghz
19:30 < laxa> single core
19:30 < laxa> it's a VPS
19:30 < laxa> Oh
19:30 < laxa> 3.8 or 3.4
19:30 < laxa> https://www.harmony-hosting.com/page/vps
19:30 < laxa> this is the hoster for the webserver
19:33 <@deen> Phaturia: sure it's healthy
19:34 <@deen> Phaturia: I wouldn't push the game servers like that to prevent lag spikes, but on a website-only server it's totally fine
19:36 < Phaturia> so its doing updates in the background?
19:36 < Phaturia> like laxa ssaid
19:37 <@deen> yeah, it updates http://ddnet.tw/ranks/ for example
19:37 < laxa> Well, if niceness is well defined, it should be completely transparent to the users on the website
19:37 < laxa> and knowing deen, it is well defined :p
19:38 < Phaturia> :O its 6€/month
19:38 <@deen> laxa: forum performance IS a bit lower when the updates are running, but i doubt anyone notices
19:38 < Phaturia> now i have VPS at arubaclod.com .it .hu
19:38 < Phaturia> at the same config is just 1€/month
19:39 < laxa> Indeed :)
19:39 < laxa> Phaturia: link your offer
19:40 < Phaturia> https://www.arubacloud.com/vps/virtual-private-server-range.aspx
19:40 < Phaturia> the storage is much lower, but as i see its not needed
19:41 < laxa> can't compare
19:41 < laxa> it's cloud offer
19:41 < laxa> you have not unlimited bandwitch
19:41 < laxa> 1 core they say, no idea of power
19:42 <@deen> i would be wary of "vmware" and no mention of ddos protection
19:42 < Phaturia> what is problem with limited bandwith? 2TB not enugh? ~how much currently?
19:42 < Phaturia> hmm yeah ddos is a tough question
19:42 <@deen> without ddos attacks everything would be super cheap
19:43 <@deen> we would only need a single GER server and I'd run the website on it too, all for 10 € / month
19:44 < Phaturia> what ddos protection do? (yes i know what is ddos, but how is that preventing?)
19:49 < Phaturia> laxa: about cpu power: its one of my server
19:49 < Phaturia> # cat /proc/cpuinfo processor       : 0 vendor_id       : GenuineIntel cpu family      : 6 model           : 45 model name      : Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 0 @ 2.00GHz stepping        : 7 microcode       : 0x710 cpu MHz         : 2000.000 cache size      : 20480 KB physical id     : 0 siblings        : 1 core id         : 0 cpu cores       : 1 apicid          : 0 initial apicid  : 0 fpu             : yes fpu_exception   : yes cpuid leve
19:50 < laxa> it's in the cloud, you have no garanty of cpu power
19:50 < laxa> and they can fake that information
19:50 < Phaturia> current servers are dedicated servers just for this?
19:56 < laxa> some are
