09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> @heinrich5991 that commit applies weapon inputs according to their intended/desired ticks instead of according to when they arrive to the server (which may be earlier than intended due to lag/jitter, and not always guaranteed to be in order)
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> if this code causes unwanted weapon switches I might have an idea why. the client only sends one input per tick (so normally inputs are guaranteed to be applied in order), but if an input arrives later than its intended tick (due to lag), the server will set the intended tick to the current tick. so if two inputs arrive late at the same time (originally intended for tick N-1 and  <message clipped>
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> can somebody explain this? https://streamable.com/sr6xe
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well isnt it ur recording?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> different team?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> solo?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> same team
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> no solo
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> not client side
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmm looks crazy then
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> literally never had that happen before
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> wasn't able to reproduce yet either
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I assume you had weak, then the tee under you got insane speed and speed glitched into the bottom tee
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Dont you know downwards speedfly?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Idk how to do downwards speedfly but i thought it looks different
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> didn't look like insane speed to me, thought you need more velocity for that
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It looks different for sure, but there is no other way that could happen
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> was probably just enough speed to glitch through I guess
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can some of you fix bugs?
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like that afk mark thing is 10 seconds at most to fix up
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what has to be fixed?
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The flag needs its own flags array
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you can think of a mark that'd be obv to people without nameplates you can pr that aswell but thats not whats blocking a release
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should start doing feature freezes before releases
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we should do feature freezes
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> please yes
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 Maybe someone can look through my prs before the release?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut what were they about?
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The 4 tick reset for the prohectiles lgtm but it needs @nuborn for a proper fix on ddnet client
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The 4 tick reset for the projectiles lgtm but it needs @nuborn for a proper fix on ddnet client
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But also the rest
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you could also do the prediction for it if you want it merged before him
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I cant :D
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But can you look at the rest?
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 256p I dont think we'll merge
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Like the deci sec fix, or flag color for custom mods, showall, nameless score removal
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea me neither
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We would probably go for n players
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With bitfields and vectors
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/605071430282903573
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The resume on move thing idk, it seems there arent many people who want it
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I will close botj
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> both*
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could merge it, its not much code
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doesnt harm other people either its hidden behind a command
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then merge it, I'd use it
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fix style
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But I will close the 256p pr, okay?
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ye close the 256 one
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am not at home for some days, can you do it?
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> waaa
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i would change it to only resume if ur not deep or in a freeze tile
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> to allow using pause while being dragged
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Or just type /resumemoved
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Type the cmd again
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats not a nice ux
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or use bind
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Lol, same is for show others
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont see how bad ux justifies bad ux
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont see how it is bad ux just because you dont like iz
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You wouldnt resume moved if you are in freeze tho
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Youd just normally pause
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its not bad ux, ux isnt designed for retards, its designed for reasonable users
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> the feature itself is kinda meh
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont like the afk mark
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki Suggest a better way to mark people
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its already good
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The blink is subpar
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No one notices it
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the blink is blended in game
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its what i like most
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like not having speak
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u use emotes
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the fcking mark is ugly af
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> üëç üëç üëç
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its my opinion
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and mine
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Disable it then?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The mark is way more obv, it'll stop people from picking up afks and crying
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you are better with the blink you are free to disable and look at that instead
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bad solutions that can be disabled
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u wanna go that way
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> I think displaying an emote like zzz constantly could be better
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this would be perfect for a forum thread
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to discuss
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> probably
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> This indicator is stupid, you still cant decide who is afk and who isnt if you have to pick a tee from a boat
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Imagine many tees standing next to each other in freeze
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the nameplates are overlapping
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The mark is not visible at all
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Something like a constant zzz emote is way better, it is centered on the tee and still not such an ugly symbol there
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> have to agree with that
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The 3 people who use the forum will agree with you
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because you are the only ones using it :D
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FallenKN> so we don't have to do a poll if you already know that :P
