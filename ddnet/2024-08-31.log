12:48 < bridge_> <zhn> ok last one was unexpected

12:58 < bridge_> <teero777> Tunes cannot fully reproduce slow motion since the core gets quantized. It might look similar but it is not the same.
13:01 < bridge_> <zhn> chillerdragon: i don't really think you need another handle in controller just to use `CCharacter::SetArmor(...)`
13:01 < bridge_> <zhn> id add something like `OnArmorChange(...)` instead of nailing this one
13:02 < bridge_> <zhn> but that means that code should actually use function wrappers xd
13:09 < bridge_> <sashka_krashiha> Guys, what should I do if I was banned for VPN even though I don't use it?
13:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @sashka_krashiha create a ticket on discord in the # create a ticket channel
13:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn armor isnt much set elsewhere and i thought its a nice opportunity to abstract away this progress computation which is used twice
13:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pro @milkeeycat 
13:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @3x1st_ i recommend updating to debian 12
13:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what are the chances that gdb is showing me a wrong backtrace? .-.
13:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what are the chances of a debug print being wrong?
13:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> uhm i think i found a bug
13:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1725104828.png
13:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can reproduce with gdb but then i get a bogus backtrace
13:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can not reproduce with asan 
13:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah got it. The fix was ``touch src/game/server/entities/laser.cpp`` to invalidate the make cache
13:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> seems like cmake trolled me here and did not compile the lastest version on disk somehow?!
14:08 < bridge_> <zhn> chillerdragon: there's not so many mods that will actually use armor progress, `On[placeholder]Change` is more generic imo
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> armor progress can be cool for mods dont u think? But yeah its more about deactivating ddnets default behavior from other game types. While also cleaning up ddnet code.
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I am also fine with yours @zhn but i think mine is better :p

17:28 < bridge_> <mazty> So, how its possible making slow down without using external apps like cheat engine

21:20 < bridge_> <0xdeen> Thanks for report, fixed.
21:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> why is "no login required" on by default in the server browser
21:58 < bridge_> <„ÇÄ„Åé> cuz why not
22:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we can maybe make it dependent on if the client logged into an account, as soon as we have (client) support
22:03 < bridge_> <syrinok> I guess cause new players join and don't know wtf's going on, and the login process on KoG is very much a process, people that get to that point can probably figure out that the servers are filtered and undo it
22:05 < bridge_> <syrinok> I only just realized (earlier today) it was enabled as well, idk how long its been like that)
22:05 < bridge_> <syrinok> I only just realized (earlier today) it was enabled as well, idk how long its been like that
22:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> i was trying to follow someone by name and it didn't get cleared when i press the clear filter button so it seems like crazy bad UX
