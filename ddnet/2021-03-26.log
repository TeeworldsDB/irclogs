10:17 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon why are u not in our irc channel anymore?
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Does someone know a lib to fetch hardware info?
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> For some people its probs to hard
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> CPU
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Motherboard
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> GPU
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> something like that
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> First result on Google: https://github.com/oshi/oshi
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah, but thats java isnt it
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i want to integrate it into the client
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, java
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> second result on google: https://github.com/ThePhD/infoware
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i saw that too, but im not sure what it can do
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the readme is rather non verbose
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/hyperic/sigar
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (no update for 4 years and website down)
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> rip
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe i should just print GPU info into the f1 console
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> already a good start
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NovaShock> ever since new update ive started to get heavy fps drops even drops below 100,didnt change any settings since update
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NovaShock> seems like it only starts to happen after alt+tab,since I use it to look at discord and websites,but never had these frame drops before
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> sry Ryozuki vps reboot and didnt safe the best irc channel in my config xd
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> someone else had this too, and he tried the non steam version and it worked fine
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but no garantuee
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> zink on windows works, but it still has bad performance on windows for some reason:
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/pal1000/mesa-dist-win/issues/50#issuecomment-784566368
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> cool
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> probably still better for us to fix the intel opengl problems somehow :/
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if you have any good idea, go ahead, i dont have intel hardware except a pretty old (10 years) laptop, and that works completly fine
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so i cannot test anything
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm really bad with the graphics stack, so probably not :/
14:15 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> aaaaaaaaa
14:15 <+bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> o/ chillerdragon :)

14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> duped message
14:18 <+bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> yup it's nice as long as you don't try to sent code snippets :D
14:18 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ``test``
14:18 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> yay code format finally
14:18 <+bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> yup but poor IRC users just get a flood :D
14:18 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> there are no irc users xd
14:18 <+bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> heh is that true??
14:19 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> what is irc?
14:19 <+bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> ah, no there's heinrich5991
14:19 <+bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> and another who I won't ping
14:19 <+bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> * and another whom I won't ping
14:19 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> so any idea on how to get on my quakenet channels?
14:20 <+bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> nah, sorry, no idea there
14:20 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> k
14:20 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i unfriend u
14:20 <+bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> Either you could run your own bridge or pursuade Quakenet to run one
14:20 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i run a bridge already but too lazy to edit the cfg
14:20 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i think my vps is banned on freenode xd
14:20 <+bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> lol OK :D
14:21 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ok not a single reason left to ever install discord again yay
14:21 <+bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> yay! Enjoy the freedom :)
14:22 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> hmm unlucky tho that we can't see irc users reconnecting i miss that
14:22 <+bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> yeah I don't know why you can see reconnections
14:23 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> its kinda important to know if the bridge irc client is ded or alive
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://twitter.com/nulllzero/status/1374248856364453888?s=19
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xd
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExJWxMjVEAgPDRQ?format=jpg&name=large
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xd
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> would be so funny
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> just noticed there are some weird messages in the console
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> after loading a map i got:
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```shell
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> [2021-03-26 22:24:53][storage]: failed to remove: data/```
22:29 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> That looks like a weird dir to remove
22:29 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> But I get plenty of remove fails too but usually more expected files like replay demos
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why would you want to remove the data/ folder anyway?
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is that newest client
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we had smth like that before
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but definitely not ok to try to remove it
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> best you upload the map on a github issue
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is that newest client/server
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> im still on 15.2.5
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cant remember the exact version we had this
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> "update failed, please check logs"
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah, best you just manually update, older versions have weird bugs with the updater xD
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> please check logs --> no log file generated ðŸ˜¦
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah, it was a file that doesnt exist on windows, that created the fail
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the auto updater had a bad time since steam release xDD
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> seem like the message is gone
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but now i got plenty of alert for non divisible by 4 or 8 :(, can i disable them?
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sakido> gfx_show_warning 0
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> by fixing the images
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Client seem to exec config stored in the map file. For instance on "Try It" i get:
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```shell
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> [2021-03-26 22:44:42][tune]: sv_team 2
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> [2021-03-26 22:44:42][console]: No such command: sv_team.
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> [2021-03-26 22:44:42][console]: No such command: sv_max_team_size.
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> [2021-03-26 22:44:42][console]: No such command: switch_open.
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> [2021-03-26 22:44:42][console]: No such command: sv_deepfly.```
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hmm i have an idea
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> You wanna try remote bind execution :D?
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> bind d +kill
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah lol didnt work
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe it got fixed
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Can we get an option to filter this spam? :jaouis:
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/825125224461893683/unknown.png
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Having it pop up once and not repeat itself would be nice
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wow, didn't know windows had symlink like in linux
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Sakido that has been removed.
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Chairn usually this means you downloaded some thumbnails instead of full images
