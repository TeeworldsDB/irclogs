00:01 < bridge_> <Arrow> Hey! so i want to suggest this "new" ranks bar on game, this is implemented on MTA San Andreas but i guess it can be displayed here on teeworlds, they use f5 as a button to be visible. This may no be imperative, but is a cool way to make the game feel a bit "fresh" to say so. It can be implementes as the following photos:

00:01 < bridge_> <Arrow> here are some concepts

00:03 < bridge_> <Arrow> with the idea of pressing B twice on game and change whether is a global rank or team rank

00:03 < bridge_> <robyt3> The ranks could also be shown as a separate tab next to the ingame server info in the menu. Or is it important that you see the ranks in a HUD while playing?

00:04 < bridge_> <Arrow> i mean you can see it while playing
00:05 < bridge_> <Arrow> with an animation of smth appearing
00:05 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> If you are an influencer or speedrunner who hunts maps, maybe
00:05 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> we need the opinions of speedrunners in this case
00:06 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> 👁️
00:06 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> does it need to be smaller, does it need to update while in game, etc
00:06 < bridge_> <Arrow> let me record it
00:06 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> does it need to be smaller, does it need to update while already racing, etc
00:08 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> It would be nice to have a plugin system similar to Trackmania 2020's, where adding client side plugins allow you to add speedrunning mods which can benefit you in speedrunning or map hunting
00:08 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> and other fun stuff
00:11 < bridge_> <Iza> until you find that one plugin that does the run automatically for you :think_bot:

00:12 < bridge_> <Arrow> @robyt3 those are the animations
00:12 < bridge_> <Arrow> and yes... im waiting for the key to be delivered to activate windows :justatest:
00:27 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> oh yeah, ath lua script moments
00:28 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I mean, botting is already a thing, but the matter of fact is, how harder can it be to detect?
00:29 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> maybe there are plugins which actually help against cheaters and can be a must-have for any server who might wanna use them for an anticheat
00:30 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> the only ai i will accept is anticheat
00:30 < bridge_> <teero777> @cellegenrih it is impossible to detect a wellmade bot
00:30 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> maybe a plugin which checks your client info to the server and identify if the given values are not matching
00:30 < bridge_> <teero777> values can be faked
00:30 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> and those who have not these plugins will be flagged?
00:31 < bridge_> <teero777> any information given to the server can be faked
00:31 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> You know, if the game wouldn't have been open sourced and would have a closed dev team instead, it would be preventable
00:31 < bridge_> <teero777> yes.
00:32 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I still feel like you guys should do this exact thing, cuz like
00:33 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> no new devs, or even in very rare occourances
00:33 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> only devs update the clients
00:33 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> they can concentrate on building up a better security without being compromised the moment they are done with it
00:34 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> also would be possible to make an account system possible and finally get the strings with vanilla Teeworlds shut
00:34 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> also would be possible to make an account system possible and finally get the strings with vanilla Teeworlds cut
00:34 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> also would be possible to make an account systemand finally get the strings with vanilla Teeworlds cut
00:34 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> also would be possible to make an account system and finally get the strings with vanilla Teeworlds cut
00:34 < bridge_> <teero777> @cellegenrih this was all discussed on github please inform yourself
00:34 < bridge_> <patiga> @cellegenrih client-side cheat detection is very much useless in an open-source game
00:35 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I'm coping with my opinion, I know this game's doomed sooner or later if no changes apply
00:35 < bridge_> <teero777> this game is trust base anyways
00:35 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> yeah maybe thats a problem also
00:35 < bridge_> <teero777> this game is trust based anyways
00:36 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> just see Oy being trusted with 0.7
00:36 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> now chillerdragon does all that shit
00:36 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> mad respect to him but damn
00:36 < bridge_> <Iza> No
00:36 < bridge_> <teero777> the ip has to be legit for exchange of information but the rest
00:37 < bridge_> <Iza> Every input you make has to be validated by the server
00:38 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I said that the game should be close sourced, cuz a modified client can make up any value the server requests and give that instead, while recieving info from the server that you request
00:38 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> both security issue and client issue
00:38 < bridge_> <teero777> well you can still just send empty input packets just as if you were doing nothing
00:38 < bridge_> <Arrow> @robyt3 ill send you the files for the top time from mta, maybe can be helpful
00:38 < bridge_> <teero777> id quit ddnet
00:38 < bridge_> <Arrow> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1127368242025988196/race_toptimes.zip
00:39 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Why, would you be affected?
00:39 < bridge_> <Iza> If the game would’ve been closed source, it’d be dead by now
00:39 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> if you've already contributed in coding ddnet and wish to code more, why not apply as dev in a closed developer team?
00:39 < bridge_> <teero777> ddnet is a sandbox for me
00:40 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> nothing's stopping you from being a bigger part of the community when it comes to private stuff
00:40 < bridge_> <teero777> then you would be forced to continue contributing and have a big role in the community.
00:41 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Ahm, yes?
00:41 < bridge_> <teero777> sometimes you just make features for fun. i dont wanna be a fulltime tw dev
00:41 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I mean if you want to actually make the game great, you gotta work lol
00:41 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> not laze around
00:41 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> I feel like closed source wouldn't help much with bots, someone with enough skills can still reverse engineer the packets and send whatever he wants and you already need a fair bit of skills to make a competent bot with ddnet's open spaghetti
00:41 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> but again, people don't care as much on this game cuz it's not great aint it
00:42 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> and as in people, I meant devs
00:42 < bridge_> <teero777> @cellegenrih closing source would kill this game
00:42 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> how
00:42 < bridge_> <teero777> i agree with Ravie
00:42 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> it wouldn't help yes
00:42 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> cuz the game's code is already published
00:42 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> it needs a complete rewrite now
00:42 < bridge_> <teero777> then what would it get us?
00:42 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> even if it wasn't
00:43 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> it needs a complete rewrite now if you all want it close sourced
00:43 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> a better game
00:43 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> with a new engine
00:43 < bridge_> <teero777> rewriting physics would completely change the game. it would be a diffrent game
00:44 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Maybe changing the game's what will make it succeed one day. Not living in a bubble which you cannot escape from, unless you want it
00:44 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Whatever matricks will do, I'll follow him for sure
00:44 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> @cellegenrih the thing is you can never stop someone determined enough, you can reverse engineer the packets, decompile the game etc
00:45 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> that's really up to you to decide if you wanna have a team who is dedicated enough to make a good compiler instead of straight up giving up.
00:45 < bridge_> <Iza> Didn’t someone just mention that you cant send fake packets? Because of the way ddnet relies on the server
00:46 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> the player spoofing incident?
00:47 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Also, I read about laws and saw ways that only Avo does, I still cannot believe that he didn't make an entirely different game out of Teeworlds, because him and his own team can accomplish more shit, than whatever you guys do at the moment in months
00:48 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Whatever avo does is what I want to imagine you all do
00:48 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> he is a real dev ngl
00:48 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> he is a real dev (or leader) ngl
00:48 < bridge_> <teero777> cringe ngl
00:49 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I ask you, when was the last time you guys touched with an account system?
00:49 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> if so, how long?
00:50 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I don't think it's cringe that Avo managed to set up account years before and still improve that system  in a way, that's now benefits server security
00:50 < bridge_> <Iza> Who’s avo
00:51 < bridge_> <teero777> i ment your messages and how you argue
00:51 < bridge_> <teero777> i meant your messages and how you argue
00:51 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> if he could joink 0.7 MRPG's login system and use that to login in KoG servers automatically, he already got a KoG client
00:51 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> accounts are an old issue and I feel like admins aren't even fully sure if they want it
00:51 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Well now you guys can learn from Avo
00:51 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> ask him
00:51 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> At least I did
00:52 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> if he could joink 0.7 MRPG's login system and use that to login in KoG servers automatically, then he already got a KoG client
00:52 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I get that and I don't mind
00:52 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I'm not rude,  I'm just strongly stand by my opinions
00:53 < bridge_> <teero777> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3411
00:57 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> zoozti (konsti) in the first comment:
00:57 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> NOOOOOOO ACCOUNT BAAAADD, LOGIIIN SUUUUXXX
00:57 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> like bruh
00:57 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> login has no disatvantages
00:57 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> login has no disadvantages
00:58 < bridge_> <teero777> have you read the comments????
00:58 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> unlike no logins, where you can literally steal anybody's identity, no unique names are available, can fake the clans and can come back with different ip.
00:58 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> do I need to explain all of them of would you understand why I list them?
00:59 < bridge_> <Iza> The admins are just too split up about this topic, that’s the huge problem here
01:00 < bridge_> <patiga> @cellegenrih you are either simplifying this discussion or are not aware of the state of opinions in the developer/admin team. login does have disadvantages, different ones depending on the implementation
01:00 < bridge_> <Iza> I can’t even blame them, it takes hard work to implement it the right way. The ddrace way
01:00 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> cuz some say that their system is their best they can do (lie)
01:00 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> or that they cannot do that (also lie, avo proved that wrong long ago)
01:00 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> or that they cannot change it due to long stuff needing to be migrated to the new one (actually lazy mentality)
01:01 < bridge_> <patiga> @cellegenrih please feel free to join the discussion on github. accounts are a difficult topic and showing enthusiasm and participating in solving the problems that come with accounts could be helpful on github
01:01 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Lemme say this, the communities are divided, nobody asks for others' help and the communities are being so divided, that they are themselves considered a fucking gamer
01:01 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Lemme say this, the communities are divided, nobody asks for others' help and the communities are being so divided, that they are themselves considered a fucking game
01:02 < bridge_> <teero777> this conversation will be lost on discrd. patiga is right
01:02 < bridge_> <teero777> this conversation will be lost on discord. patiga is right
01:02 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I don't think they would appreciate my opinions on github ddnet repo
01:02 < bridge_> <patiga> both communities seem healthy to me, its nice that each can do their own thing
01:02 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> cuz you know, they won't agree whatever you throw at it 🙂
01:03 < bridge_> <teero777> then why exactly are you even arguing?
01:03 < bridge_> <patiga> as long as you stay civil, comments are appreciated
01:03 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Are you guys devs?
01:03 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> besides patiga, are you?
01:03 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> my convo was with u teero originally
01:04 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> anyone can be, just fix a typo in the code and ask for a role
01:06 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> im no cpp dev
01:06 < bridge_> <teero777> i can see that
01:06 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> what do you mean by that
01:06 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> that I cannot code in general?
01:06 < bridge_> <patiga> I don't know what you mean with the dev question. I think it could for example be a great help if someone would simply list the pros and cons of the current favored options. after a (as neutral as possible) comprehensive list is finished, discussions could be more focused on how to compromise or which things outweight other things. last time I checked no such thing was done
01:07 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> suuuuuure, simply list it so others can argue more
01:07 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> such a great idea don't you think?
01:07 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Oh was that already happened? When ddnet 2.0 requests were announced? oh
01:07 < bridge_> <patiga> hm?
01:07 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> Don't you know?
01:08 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> people had their chances to request changes they want to see
01:08 < bridge_> <patiga> I don't know of anyone doing what I just mentioned
01:08 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> so many arguments and shit posts went there, that ddnet had to shut it down
01:08 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> such a good idea
01:08 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> indeed
01:08 < bridge_> <patiga> that is a very different topic
01:08 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> nope it is the same
01:08 < bridge_> <patiga> what point are you trying to make rn
01:08 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> that the game won't change itself unless you guys don't change on the game
01:08 < bridge_> <teero777> aight im getting tired of this useless conversation. gn
01:09 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> gn
01:09 < bridge_> <patiga> gn :)
01:10 < bridge_> <patiga> afaik that thing was a huge misunderstanding, where people blew stuff out of proportion which really didn't help.
01:10 < bridge_> <patiga> that doesn't mean that discussion is unhealthy though
01:10 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> this whole game is unhealthy at some extent
01:10 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> no denying that
01:10 < bridge_> <patiga> the point I was trying to make is: you yourself could also try to contribute to the account thing
01:11 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> from mild profanity, all the way of ddosing non stop
01:11 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> this game is unhealthy af
01:11 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> No I don't think I will
01:11 < bridge_> <patiga> we has a very straight forward discussion up until now. this shot came out of nowhere and doesn't seem immediately related to what we were talking about before
01:12 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> I ask you all, to look at what Avo does, cuz he already did it for you
01:12 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> why not ask him? 🙂
01:12 < bridge_> <patiga> that is very oversimplifying
01:12 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> is it bad?
01:12 < bridge_> <patiga> I'll also leave this discussion now, gn :)
01:12 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> welp see ya
01:12 < bridge_> <tbtgnc.> is there any way that i can see the history of the maps that i have been playing
01:12 < bridge_> <patiga> your demo folder could help you
01:12 < bridge_> <tbtgnc.> where is it
01:12 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> on DDNet's website, if you look at your profile name
01:13 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> you can see what maps you finished last, but idk if you can see the current maps being played
01:13 < bridge_> <patiga> in the client you can just click "demos" in the main menu, then you can sort by date
01:13 < bridge_> <tbtgnc.> i will try thanks
01:13 < bridge_> <tbtgnc.> ok thank you
01:13 < bridge_> <patiga> (I'm not sure how many demos are saved by the client by default)
01:13 < bridge_> <cellegenrih> or that, looking at your demos might help
01:14 < bridge_> <tbtgnc.> which one
01:14 < bridge_> <tbtgnc.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1127377174144487554/image.png

01:15 < bridge_> <patiga> on the ranks tab, you can use the player search
01:20 < bridge_> <murpi> Says who?
01:21 < bridge_> <murpi> You haven't changed, have you? Don't steer up useless drama.
01:22 < bridge_> <Iza> My conclusion that learath stated he would very much like an account system but deen for example isn’t much of a fan of it (of the account implementation suggestions made a while ago)
01:22 < bridge_> <murpi> deen was the first person who tried to get a working account system :thonk: wtf are u talking about
01:23 < bridge_> <Iza> From what I’ve read back then, I concluded that there’s not much of an interest
01:24 < bridge_> <Iza> I mean sorry if I picked that up the wrong way
01:31 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> me
01:31 < bridge_> <CellegenPayments> cant argue about a topic or what?
01:32 < bridge_> <CellegenPayments> had to go up my alt acc on my phone for this
01:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> ??
01:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> why
01:32 < bridge_> <CellegenPayments> I have separate uses
01:33 < bridge_> <CellegenPayments> my accs have separate uses
01:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> you're saying you have an account just for perpetuating useless drama
01:33 < bridge_> <CellegenPayments> ?
01:33 < bridge_> <CellegenPayments> what makes you think its the case??
01:33 < bridge_> <CellegenPayments> im in bed rn
01:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> > "don't stir up useless drama"
01:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> > "had to go to alt account for this"
01:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> > "don't stir up useless drama"
01:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> 
01:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> > "had to go to alt account for this"
01:34 < bridge_> <CellegenPayments> i dont argue now, gn
01:41 < bridge_> <murpi> You can, but in a respectful manner. Keep the derogatory remarks to yourself.
01:42 < bridge_> <CellegenPayments> right

05:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> didn’t test ddrace
06:52 < bridge_> <louis.place> damn can i have dev role then :troll: ill even be studying cs in college
08:18 < bridge_> <thekid36> At least there's some sort of agreement on wanting the system.. there's discussion to be made about the implementation but it seems like we're going in that direction.
08:18 < bridge_> <thekid36> 
08:18 < bridge_> <thekid36> From what I gathered, I feel like around 80% of the community will either agree or be neutral for the accounts system..(cause I mean... there's no real disadvantages for having an account..and other games have always had accounts)
08:18 < bridge_> <thekid36> then there's a small (or big, since we can consider this group as the "active players") group of people that fears the loss of the points/ranks collected through the year. 
08:18 < bridge_> <thekid36> But it seems that there's an ongoing discussion for this aswell.
08:18 < bridge_> <thekid36> 
08:18 < bridge_> <thekid36> anonymous surveys can be done to collect more opinions (if that's needed) and the various implementations of the system should be organized with its advantages and disadvantages so the devs can decide better.
08:18 < bridge_> <thekid36> 
08:18 < bridge_> <thekid36> The "problems" that people point out when bringing up this topic are the fact that ideas are being thrown..but there aren't enough supporters of the ideas that make them go "yes, let's implement this".
08:18 < bridge_> <thekid36> I understand that devs are doing this in their free time but the accounts discussion is open since some years now...
08:18 < bridge_> <thekid36> either the discussion reached a dead end or there's still things that need to be discussed
08:18 < bridge_> <thekid36> 
08:18 < bridge_> <thekid36> I know that what I wrote is kinda pointless..just treat it like a reminder of what's happening from the viewpoint of an outside reader
08:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> thanks
08:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> your finger lanor does not go unappreciated
08:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> your finger labor does not go unappreciated
08:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> i want an offtopic for the ppl who regular the dev chat
08:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> xdd
08:27 < bridge_> <limewater23> im new to matrix
08:28 < bridge_> <limewater23> what's this room mostly discussion about?
08:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> er
08:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> how did u get here if u don’t know what it’s about
08:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> smells like bot
08:29 < bridge_> <limewater23> I got this and random searched the public rooms
08:29 < bridge_> <Juan Mejia> Hello
08:29 < bridge_> <limewater23> hello Juan
08:30 < bridge_> <Ewan> this is the development channel for a game called ddracenetwork (https://ddnet.org)
08:30 < bridge_> <limewater23> ohhh that makes more sense I thought it's like discord
08:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> I’m talking to you through a discord bridge rn
08:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> it’s also available on irc
08:31 < bridge_> <limewater23> discord bridge?
08:31 < bridge_> <limewater23> so you can connect this to discord
08:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> this is getting kinda offtopic. if u want more info u can join the discord or w/e and talk in general
08:33 < bridge_> <limewater23> I feel I need to leave this room, I thought it is for all network developers
08:33 < bridge_> <limewater23> kk
08:33 < bridge_> <limewater23> same name in discord?
08:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> there should be a link to the dc on the page i linked above
08:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> tbh the problem is not the implementation (if we ignore what system exactly would be chosen)
08:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
08:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It's really mostly about:
08:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If you look at the discussion it's mostly split between, decentralized or centralized account system.
08:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> How the account is managed (does ddnet store the account details on their servers. do users store the account details on their computer (e.g. saving a local key), do we even want to have key-pairs (which are basically like autogenerated strong private passwords)
08:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
08:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Basically all main maintainers here in ddnet have a different opinion on that.
08:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I think before we do some overcomplicated account system with saving key pairs on the local computer and have some centralized list of accounts somewhere that all game servers have to fetch we can also just do a normal username, password login.
08:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> So to me the only real alternative is having a decentralized approach that can be extended to a managed one (e.g. ddnet stores your key-pair.. u will never download it to disk. the key-pair is your identification) if you loose it, u're fcked xdd (you can probably invent a system to make it recoverable, e.g. if you additionally register to all game servers with a email or smth like that).
08:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Any centralized approach means that the server has to be aware of ddnet to some extend (either by asking ddnet servers if the login is valid, or downloading the public key list). So this approach is less optimal for other game modes that also want to implement accounts.
08:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> So the discussion is also about other hosters/mods etc. which ddnet might want to respect
08:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
08:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> All methods have pros and cons, i also dont want to annoy you with too much details.
08:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
08:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But a simple login/register account system, just for ddnet only, would probably be implemented in less than a week. So it's not really about the free time. It's more about discussions over discussions and don't come to an conclusion

It's more about discussions over discussions and don't come to an conclusion (also an optional one where you dont loose your current progress)
08:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> i think there have been plenty of opinions voiced on this subject and talking about it much more won’t do much. i think there should be a vote, accounts/no accounts, key pair/password, centralized/distributed, etc
08:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> or something more than ppl’s opinions floating around in the issue
08:59 < bridge_> <totar> Someone with authority should just pick one of the options or there should be a dev poll
08:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> this is also something users have to be onboard with. This isn’t something that angry users can be told to use the old version for and whatnot
09:02 < bridge_> <vy0x2> But a simple poll accounts/no accounts cant be made without giving context and pro/con arguments. Otherwise everyone has a different view what accounts are
09:03 < bridge_> <vy0x2> And who is going to read a article before voting something? So i kinda agree that only people who are into the stuff should decide
09:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> that’s the dumbest thing I’ve heard all day
09:06 < bridge_> <vy0x2> Okay asks a big user base questions without explaining what the options are
09:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> “we shouldn’t *let* the users vote because they probably won’t know what’s going on anyway“
09:06 < bridge_> <vy0x2> We already announced an account system and everyone had a different view how its gonna be implemented
09:07 < bridge_> <Ewan> I don’t see why there can’t be a user vote with an associated foreword or blog post or something. even if ppl aren’t going to read, just make it so those who do can vote
09:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> and you won’t necessarily need to know all about both sides to know where you stand on the matter
09:08 < bridge_> <vy0x2> Thats exactly what i am saying. You had to append a article (blog post you named it) otherwise user dont know what they are even voting
09:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea I agree
09:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> sry I thought you were saying it should be restricted only to devs since most users won’t read
09:10 < bridge_> <vy0x2> I am saying that less than 10% will read the article and only those 10% should decide, not the 90% who are just clicking left or right. I think you tried to say that too
09:10 < bridge_> <vy0x2> > even if ppl aren’t going to read, just make it so those who do can vote
09:10 < bridge_> <Ewan> yes, i agree
09:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> btw i saw your multi view spec thing. looks dope
09:11 < bridge_> <vy0x2> Thanks!
09:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> i wonder where deen stands on the acc system? w/ something so large he’d probably have to call some shots since he manages servers on top of dev, iirc
09:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> has to play both sides of the coin
09:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> i wonder where deen stands on the acc system? w/ something so large he’d probably have to call some shots explicitly since he manages servers on top of dev, iirc
09:38 < bridge_> <Ewan> i think I’ll get back to my file loader tmrw. been working on other stuff

10:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> deen wants accounts
10:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the problem is that when he announced it, it looked like ddnet 2
10:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so people thought it would be a massive update
10:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and it grew too much on expectstions
11:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/cuviper/alloc_geiger
11:50 < bridge_> <vy0x2> If somebody knows, would be glad about a tip 🙂
12:00 < ChillerDragon> knows what
12:01 < bridge_> <robyt3> Try using `UI()->MouseButtonClicked(0)`
12:06 < bridge_> <vy0x2> ChillerDragon, i referenced a message yesterday 19:00
12:09 < bridge_> <vy0x2> Hm i tried that yesterday but i think i got false everytime when i used that in CHud::RenderSpectatorHud, possible that its disabled somewhere?
12:09 < bridge_> <vy0x2> Hm i tried that yesterday but i think i got false everytime when i used that in CHud::RenderSpectatorHud, possible that mouse clicks are disabled somewhere in the spectator hud?
12:10 < bridge_> <robyt3> Maybe it doesn't work there because it doesn't update the UI :/
12:11 < bridge_> <robyt3> Then you need to add a `OnInput` function for the `CSpectator` component (search in code for other usages)
12:11 < bridge_> <robyt3> Then handle mouse events manually in the `CSpectator::OnInput` function
12:13 < bridge_> <vy0x2> Okay thanks! I will try that later.
12:17 < bridge_> <learath2> Deen was ready to implement standard centralized accounts
14:36 < Konsti> Seems like in latest client version doing emotes fast wont work properly on yourself. I see it changing fast at other players but at myself i can only do them in the default delays. The eyes change tho

23:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> incorrect. it might have been slightly harder. cheats exist for closed-source games
23:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I feel like we shouldn't. ddnet wouldn't exist if teeworlds had not been open-source
23:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's also possible for the closed-source client
23:25 < bridge_> <deen> If DDNet was closed source it would have died long ago, same for any intermediate step from TW -> Race -> DDRace -> DDNet

23:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh i missed that convo
23:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> definitly only open source
23:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i mean free software
23:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> same thing, really
23:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> disagree
23:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but mostly ye
23:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.en.html
23:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > The terms “free software” and “open source” stand for almost the same range of programs. However, they say deeply different things about those programs, based on different values. The free software movement campaigns for freedom for the users of computing; it is a movement for freedom and justice. By contrast, the open source idea values mainly practical advantage and does not campaign for principles. This is why we do not agree with ope
23:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > The idea of open source is that allowing users to change and redistribute the software will make it more powerful and reliable. But this is not guaranteed. Developers of proprietary software are not necessarily incompetent. Sometimes they produce a program that is powerful and reliable, even though it does not respect the users' freedom. Free software activists and open source enthusiasts will react very differently to that.
23:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
23:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > A pure open source enthusiast, one that is not at all influenced by the ideals of free software, will say, “I am surprised you were able to make the program work so well without using our development model, but you did. How can I get a copy?” This attitude will reward schemes that take away our freedom, leading to its loss.
23:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
23:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > The free software activist will say, “Your program is very attractive, but I value my freedom more. So I reject your program. I will get my work done some other way, and support a project to develop a free replacement.” If we value our freedom, we can act to maintain and defend it.
