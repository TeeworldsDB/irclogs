01:49 < bridge> <Ewan> ryo do u know why all my VTs are frozen and showing the openrc init console
01:49 < bridge> <Ewan> and when i disable the desktop manager i am booted back into said frozen VT
01:52 < bridge> <Ewan> *display manager
02:12 < bridge> <Ewan> Lol shit

02:13 < bridge> <Ewan> You think i would havw this issue if inwent X570
02:14 < bridge> <Ewan> You think i would have this issue i went with X570
02:18 < bridge> <Ewan> Im pretty sure my CPU has those lanes
02:29 < bridge> <Ewan> You think i would have this issue if i went with X570
02:29 < bridge> <Ewan> Sorry chiller for the edits damn
03:56 < bridge> <Ewan> ah should i use LVM for my raid or my motherboardâ€™s feature
04:15 < bridge> <Ewan> im going to see if wayland will cooperate
07:24 < bridge> <Ewan> You think i would have this issue if i went with X670

07:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> axaxax Heinrich being troled by a fellow bot
07:54 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller fix my xorg
08:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
08:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> read logs idk
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> logs are sad
08:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> u must have done smth wront
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> likely
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> but what idk
08:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u add the flag as i said
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> which
08:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> didt kernel
08:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> dist
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i think that just re-emerges the gpu driver anyway
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> and i dont think its a driver issue
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> cuz works fine on root
08:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> sudo emerge @modules-rebuild
08:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> what
08:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> root works fine with desktop?
08:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u rly add ur user to the video group
08:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> or search if u need to be in a group
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> added to group
08:21 < bridge> <Ewan> groups ewan
08:21 < bridge> <Ewan> wheel audio video users plugdev
08:22 < bridge> <Ewan> these stupid logs are entirely inconclusive. gnome doesn't log without systemd afaict and gdm/x logs have the same contents
08:22 < bridge> <Ewan> and their contents are... some error about my xbox controller, and nothing else
08:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i sent earlier
08:23 < bridge> <Ewan> gdm log (same as x log)
08:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i followed the non-root xorg wiki page to a tee
08:24 < bridge> <Ewan> looked at the gnome and x pages and they don't seem to have anything relevant
08:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> what are ur global use flags again
08:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u follow https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GNOME/Guide#OpenRC
08:26 < bridge> <Ewan> Yes
08:26 < bridge> <Ewan> Hold on a moment
08:27 < bridge> <Ewan> `USE="elogind dist-kernel -qt5 -kde gtk gnome -systemd fish X wayland screencast lm-sensors contrib mount alsa pipewire pulseaudio xinerama opengl vulkan udev fontconfig vorbis opus vdpau bluetooth lvm readline"`
08:30 < bridge> <Ewan> do u sort ur use flags
08:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> by non root u mean when u login from ur display manager right
08:30 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
08:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Display_manager
08:30 < bridge> <Ewan> elogind should be running bcs it's enabled as a service in openrc but i can't know for sure because i can't access a shell until i'm logged in
08:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> u most likely have smth wrong with the DM then
08:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> which one u using
08:31 < bridge> <Ewan> DM? gdm
08:32 < bridge> <Ewan> i could try swapping it for lightdm or smth
08:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u flw this
08:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1149230590697144320/Screenshot_2023-09-07-08-31-49-251_org.mozilla.firefox.jpg
08:32 < bridge> <Ewan> Yes
08:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> wait a sec i do another rep
08:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
08:32 < bridge> <Ewan> Lol
08:32 < bridge> <Ewan> Tech support at gym
08:32 < bridge> <Ewan> amazing

08:35 < bridge> <Ewan> GL
08:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> the conf part too
08:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> ?
08:35 < bridge> <Ewan> Yes
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> root@machine ~# cat /etc/conf.d/display-manager 
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> # We always try and start the DM on a static VT. The various DMs normally
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> # default to using VT7. If you wish to use the display-manager init
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> # script, then you should ensure that the VT checked is the same VT your
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> # DM wants to use.
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> # We do this check to ensure that you haven't accidentally configured
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> # something to run on the VT in your /etc/inittab file so that
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> # you don't get a dead keyboard.
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> CHECKVT=7
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> 
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> # What display manager do you use ?
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> #     [ xdm | greetd | gdm | sddm | gpe | lightdm | entrance ]
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> # NOTE: If this is set in /etc/rc.conf, that setting will override this one.
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> DISPLAYMANAGER="gdm"
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe try another
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> ssdm
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> which is lightest
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> ssdm or lightdm
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> try ssdm first
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> its the one in the guide
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> lightest is no DM at all, like me
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think lightdm is unmaintained
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> er sddm
08:37 < bridge> <Ewan> o rly
08:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i used lightdm for a while
08:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i made my own greeter
08:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> or maybe it was xdm
08:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> idj
08:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
08:37 < bridge> <Ewan> sddm is kde
08:40 < bridge> <Ewan> holy shit
08:40 < bridge> <Ewan> it was actually gdm
08:40 < bridge> <Ewan> ??????
08:41 < bridge> <teero777> ly is nice
08:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
08:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u try ssdm or another
08:42 < bridge> <teero777> https://github.com/fairyglade/ly
08:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GNOME/GDM
08:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft did u flw this at all
08:42 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe not
08:43 < bridge> <Ewan> actually yeah
08:43 < bridge> <Ewan> looks familiar
08:43 < bridge> <teero777> you mean me? Then yes I've tried a few of them but they were kinda slow and I didn't like the design
08:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> Grant permissions for gdm to access the X server:
08:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> user $xhost +SI:localuser:gdm
08:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i meant ewan but nice to know
08:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> before going without DM i tried a terminal one
08:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i prefer none
08:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe it was ly
08:44 < bridge> <teero777> so you just have a script to start your gui?
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> i've never seen this article in my life
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> its called xinitrc
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> but ye
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> dont be usin that
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> use .xinit with startx
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> securer or something
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> according to the internet
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> a script that sets dbus, ssh agent and startx
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> or is the file called xinitrc. i dont remember
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> .xinit is .xinitrc
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> bruv
08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> .
08:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i got it
08:46 < bridge> <Ewan> how comfy
08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> my setup is mostly following the Gentoo guide for non dm
08:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i got my wayland fractional scaling and everything
08:46 < bridge> <Ewan> excellent
08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur using wayland?
08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u setup audio
08:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> use pipewire not pulse
08:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i set up pipewire
08:47 < bridge> <Ewan> (im pretty sure)
08:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> good ur modern
08:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i got a news about it
08:47 < bridge> <Ewan> and followed the instructions
08:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> now
08:47 < bridge> <Ewan> hard to tell in gnome shell cuz it does both
08:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> install rustup
08:47 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
08:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> its needed trust me
08:48 < bridge> <Ewan> so anything that needs a bash compatible shell will use the /bin/sh symlink right
08:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u have gcc
08:48 < bridge> <Ewan> so $SHELL can be a non bash compat
08:48 < bridge> <Ewan> yea i have gcc
08:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess
08:48 < bridge> <Ewan> need fish shell
08:49 < bridge> <Ewan> how 2 delete pkg
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u followed guide for term it will work tm
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok so u need to understand
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> how portage works
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> and what --oneshot means
08:49 < bridge> <Ewan> listening
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> whenever u emerge smth without oneshot
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> it will be added to the world file
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> pkgs there are kept if u use --depclean
08:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> with oneshot they are not added to world
08:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> oneshot is useful in some cases
08:50 < bridge> <Ewan> do i remove it from world file and then depclean?
08:50 < bridge> <Ewan> the pkg
08:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> to remove from file u do
08:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> emerge --ask --deselect dksndbhe
08:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> then depclean
08:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> u usually one want pkgs in world file that are binaries u use or libraries u use directly, e.g to build ddnet urself without portage
08:51 < bridge> <teero777> Now tell me what `dksndbhe` means xdd
08:51 < bridge> <Ewan> i think is spam
08:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> this allows u to not have duplicate depa and to portage to manage deps with more freedom
08:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> thanks for coming to my ted talk
08:52 < bridge> <Ewan> cool
08:52 < bridge> <Ewan> so are dependency pkgs for directly requested pkgs oneshotted
08:52 < bridge> <Ewan> and that' why it's depclean
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> nooo
08:53 < bridge> <Ewan> ug
08:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> its like this
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> u founs X on github and u wanna build it urself
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> without portage
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> u need Y library
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> u install that library without oneshot because u need it kept
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> oneshot is useful when big upgrades happen
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway u should read about portage
08:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gentoo_Cheat_Sheet
08:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i will
08:55 < bridge> <Ewan> soon
08:55 < bridge> <teero777> So oneshot is used for compilation dependencies mostly?
08:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is ur bible
08:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye, but portage manages comp deps for u anyway
08:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> let me see again
08:56 < bridge> <Ewan> gdm not working even after that command
08:56 < bridge> <Ewan> might just use startx
08:56 < bridge> <Ewan> i miss windose
08:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1079934-start-0.html
08:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> oneshot best practices forum
08:56 < bridge> <Ewan> how 2 go back to startx/xinit
08:57 < bridge> <Ewan> add to end of profile or what
08:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh god
08:57 < bridge> <Ewan> it's 1 am
08:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> startx init is more complex and requires u to know what u doing more or less
08:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> use another dm
08:57 < bridge> <Ewan> h
08:58 < bridge> <Ewan> is it not just this
08:58 < bridge> <Ewan> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Guide#Using_startx
08:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess

09:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> epic
09:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe ur missing smth
09:41 < bridge> <Ewan> likely
09:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> how does it freeze bte
09:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> and by VT u mean ur terminal or the tty
09:44 < bridge> <Ewan> when dm opens all VTs but the one the dm/de is on go to the same screen (what i see on boot, openrc init stuff)
09:45 < bridge> <Ewan> and they're all unresponsive to input
09:45 < bridge> <Ewan> no cursor blink either
09:45 < bridge> <Ewan> when dm opens, all VTs but the one the dm/de is on go to the same screen (what i see on boot, openrc init stuff)
09:48 < bridge> <Ewan> now somethinge lse is broken
09:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> by VT u mean tty then???
09:48 < bridge> <Ewan> sure
09:48 < bridge> <Ewan> whatever
09:48 < bridge> <Ewan> i should have many ttys
09:48 < bridge> <Ewan> each bound to a vt
09:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> how can a tty go to the "same screen"
09:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> whay does that meam
09:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> mean
09:48 < bridge> <Ewan> all vts on the same tty
09:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ????
09:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> how can a tty be on the same tty
09:49 < bridge> <Ewan> what do u want from me
09:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i asked u if a vt is a tty
09:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> im just confused by what u sayin
09:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i press ctr alt f1 it shows me the same thing as if i pressed ctrl alt f5 or snth
09:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> and what is that same thing
09:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> a login ?
09:50 < bridge> <Ewan> no not a login

09:51 < bridge> <Ewan> this
09:51 < bridge> <Ewan> if dm/de uses vt 7, this is on 1-6
09:51 < bridge> <Ewan> no blinking cursor, unresponsive to keyboard input
09:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm
09:52 < bridge> <Ewan> and now sddm is taking me into a black screen with a x shaped mouse pointer. great
09:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> odd

10:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i was so close
10:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i had gnome working in sddm
10:27 < bridge> <Ewan> but then a gamma ray flipped a bit in my computer and broke it
10:27 < bridge> <learath2> Did you follow the gnome under openrc guide? Gnome is pretty tied to systemd nowadays and you need some tinkering
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> Yes
10:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> have you asked chat gpt
10:30 < bridge> <Ewan> No
10:30 < bridge> <Ewan> It would just say install systemd or@smth
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> imagine using gentoo, but then also gnome xd
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> Wdym by that
10:31 < bridge> <teero777> kinda ironic xd
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> How
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> Itâ€™s not a minimalist distro. Itâ€™s just super flexible
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, gnome is made for ppl that want easy as possible.
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> at least to me
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> feels like a tablet WM
10:32 < bridge> <Ewan> GNOME ui makes sense to me tbh
10:32 < bridge> <learath2> @mpft so what is the issue anyway?
10:32 < bridge> <teero777> Gentoo is peak Software and then..
10:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that too XD
10:32 < bridge> <learath2> If something is working, then stops working, it's almost always something you've done ðŸ˜„
10:32 < bridge> <teero777> Eyoo
10:32 < bridge> <teero777> I have an idea
10:33 < bridge> <Ewan> Some misconfigurations that I canâ€™t identify are making it so that GDM canâ€™t start X as a non-root user (yes I looked at the article)
10:33 < bridge> <Ewan> Then ryo proposed it could be GDMâ€™s fault, so I installed SDDM as a test and it worked as ewan
10:33 < bridge> <Ewan> Then I went to get lightdm which i prefer to sddm and it broke again
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i wouldnt be surprised if chillerdragon sooner or later starts x11 for DDNet and kills it afterwards again.. because bloat
10:33 < bridge> <teero777> Do you people think making the pitch of different sounds like hammering and stuff a little bit random to add variety would sound cool?
10:33 < bridge> <teero777> Like in mc
10:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> where is it used there? for cows?
10:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i think for static material it would suck (e.g. footsteps)
10:37 < bridge> <teero777> I'll try it when I'm hime
10:37 < bridge> <teero777> I'll try it when I'm home
10:37 < bridge> <teero777> Basically for everything
10:44 < ChillerDragon> wat even is x11 for ddnet
10:44 < bridge> <deen> Anyone here has seen spoofing that worked with sv_vanilla_antispoof 1? Asking for @discovd
10:45 < ChillerDragon> whats @discovd?
10:45 < ChillerDragon> is that a name?
10:45 < bridge> <deen> AAR
10:45 < bridge> <deen> yes
10:45 < ChillerDragon> i have yet to reproduce spoofing in 0.6.3 :D 
10:46 < ChillerDragon> what did discovd discover?
10:46 < ChillerDragon> spoofing that affects vanilla clients on ddnet servers?
10:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the pitching must be pretty weak then ^^
10:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @deen does that mean existing clients getting something spoofed into their connection, or connection spam from random IP addresses?
10:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because the former isn't protected against by `sv_vanilla_antispoof 1`
10:47 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks sometimes a sheep goes meeeh and sometimes it goes moeoooh
10:47 < bridge> <learath2> (I've seen something similar-ish by just using proxies and connecting until established, the timeout duration is long enough that the server gets filled)
10:48 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks sometimes a sheep goes mÃ¤Ã¤Ã¤h and sometimes it goes mÃ¶Ã¶Ã¶h
10:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah, that's true, but that's also kinda realistic considering it's a "voice"
10:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but metal hammered on other metal will probably sound the same xd
10:49 < bridge> <teero777> Well maybe grenade launcher should sometimes do blÃ¶p and sometimes blop
10:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i'd find it interesting for tee noises
10:50 < bridge> <teero777> *high pitch tee screaming intensifies *
10:50 < bridge> <teero777> *high pitch tee screaming intensifies*
10:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> female tee UH
10:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> male te uhhhh
10:51 < bridge> <Ewan> Yeah
10:51 < bridge> <Ewan> But Iâ€™d sooner say it was a gamma ray
10:51 < bridge> <teero777> :justatest:
10:51 < bridge> <teero777> I Don wanna introduce that issue to ddnet
10:51 < bridge> <teero777> I don wanna introduce that issue to ddnet
10:52 < bridge> <teero777> tw sx mod?!?
10:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the xxx module
10:52 < bridge> <teero777> XD
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> Fix my gdm
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> I give u ssh access
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> Better be fixed when i wake up
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> post it here
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> Lol
10:53 < bridge> <teero777> Free for all
10:53 < CherryEx> Why not
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> Iâ€™d have to port forward bro
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> Too much work
10:54 < ChillerDragon> dont post it here! lerato will wipe your drive
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> :pepeW:
10:54 < bridge> <teero777> I'll secretely install arch
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> Good luck
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> SSH daemon doesnâ€™t have that kind of lifespan
10:54 < bridge> <teero777> Without rebooting xddd
10:55 < ChillerDragon> if you manage to install arch via ssh thatd be pro
10:55 < bridge> <teero777> I don't think it's possible though
10:55 < ChillerDragon> only noobs need to reboot
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> I can see it happening with one of those arch install scripts. You just have to get everything right the first time
10:55 < ChillerDragon> ez linux kernel hotreloading
10:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I did that on a vps
10:59 < bridge> <teero777> no problem ;)
11:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> of a provider that didn't offer arch support
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> what do they do when you break it
11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> god damn it heinrich not again
11:01 < bridge> <deen> Connection spam from random IPs
11:01 < bridge> <deen> Do we have any protection for that?
11:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's simply VPN IPs, but not spoofed
11:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> at least on my server i banned the IPs that connected and the attack stopped
11:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we don't have protection from clients being able to receive packets on those IP addresses
11:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> for clients that cannot receive packets on those IP addresses, connection establishment should be impossible
11:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I was afk,  don't think I did anything(?)
11:07 < bridge> <Ewan> Surely the host was upset when you bricked your VM for the 4th time before getting the arch install right
11:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I didn't brick it IIRC
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> why would they care? xd
11:09 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> on my vps i can install a new OS or reset the current one the whole day if i have nothing better to do xd
11:10 < bridge> <learath2> I did this with devuan
11:12 < bridge> <learath2> You just re-image it from their web panel. Atleast that's how I did it until I got it working
11:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> marmare is robyte v2
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> marmare is robyte for editor xd
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess CXXFLAGS='-march=native -mtune=native'
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i add this locally
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> there is a cmake-kit.json next to workspace. u could create a new kit, that is e.g. called "Max Perf"
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> true
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks btw u use llvm right
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u try this
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> clang -O3 -mllvm -polly
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> it enabled the polly optimizer
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://polly.llvm.org/docs/UsingPollyWithClang.html
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://polly.llvm.org/index.html
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> gentoo llvm doesnt come with poly for my sadness
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> Automatic OpenMP code generation
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> To automatically detect parallel loops and generate OpenMP code for them you also need to add -mllvm -polly-parallel -lgomp to your CFLAGS.
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> clang -O3 -mllvm -polly -mllvm -polly-parallel -lgomp file.c
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i didnt use polly, but i tried openmp for some stuff.
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But it didn't really do anything noticeable
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> this works with openmp too
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> but polly is a polyhedral optimizer
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> LLVM Framework for High-Level Loop and Data-Locality Optimizations
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> Polly can also exploit OpenMP level parallelism, expose SIMDization opportunities.
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i should try some day
11:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
11:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> on my debian vps it has polly
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> did u run benchmarks xd
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> we should have benchmarks
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its hard
11:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> if we have benches that can run headless
11:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> im willing to provide daily runs
11:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> on my server
11:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> so we see change over time/commits
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> would be funny to look at
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but yeah kinda annoying to do.. wanted to do once. but lost motivation ðŸ˜„
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> even if we find 3 fps loss somewhere. i'd be way too lazy to check if it's worth it xd
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and to be relatively good, u also need different hardware
11:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah we just need latest processor
11:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> and a 4090
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> tru
11:59 < bridge> <deen> @discovd you can try that ^
12:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks does vulkan always make a 1.1 context
12:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> or can it make 1.3
12:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2023-09-07 12:03:05 I gfx: Created Vulkan 1.1 context.
12:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2023-09-07 12:03:05 I gfx: GPU vendor: NVIDIA
12:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2023-09-07 12:03:05 I gfx: GPU renderer: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080
12:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2023-09-07 12:03:05 I gfx: GPU version: Vulkan 1.3.242 (driver: 535.104.5.0)
12:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> we should use latest shiniest stuff
12:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> vulkan like opengl is downward compatible
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but it requests a 1.1 context.. if the driver decides to do 1.3 instead that's probably not forbidden
12:05 < bridge> <teero777> what exactly does `m_MixingRate` do in sound.cpp?
12:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think no one touched this code in ten years
12:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh yeah
12:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> i checked that code some time ago
12:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> sound is untouched barring 1 change to fix a race condition iirc
12:06 < bridge> <teero777> xD
12:06 < bridge> <teero777> soon voice chat in tw
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> u should first update
12:06 < bridge> <teero777> soon proximity chat in tw
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> the wave lib we use
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> forgot the name
12:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> of the lib
12:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> wavpack
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah pls change the format to smth more common xD
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i think the 16 bit requirement is kinda annoying to use
12:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's no newer version of the exact library we use AFAIK
12:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> robyte mentioned it
12:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we already include support opus, I think
12:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we already include support for opus, I think
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1138489285809541180
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lets switch to vorbis
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> higher quality
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/dbry/WavPack/blob/master/doc/WavPack5PortingGuide.pdf
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> what you should know is, that we do mixing our own
12:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> wavpack tiny decoder's latest version is 4.40 AFAICT
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> what about simply using sdl audio
12:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we use sdl_audio already
12:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> does it support reading file formats?
12:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
12:09 < bridge> <teero777> i multiplied mixing rate by 1.5x and now my game froze,....
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> Due to popular demand, here is a simple multi-channel audio mixer.
12:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> It supports 8 channels of 16 bit stereo audio, plus a single channel of music. It can load FLAC, MP3, Ogg, VOC, and WAV format audio. It can also load MIDI, MOD, and Opus audio, depending on build options (see the note below for details.)
12:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> interesting
12:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> sdl always had support libs
12:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> it also has sdl image
12:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2_image/FrontPage
12:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> This is a simple library to load images of various formats as SDL surfaces.
12:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
12:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> It can load BMP, GIF, JPEG, LBM, PCX, PNG, PNM (PPM/PGM/PBM), QOI, TGA, XCF, XPM, and simple SVG format images. It can also load AVIF, JPEG-XL, TIFF, and WebP images, depending on build options (see the note below for details.)
12:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we already use SDL_sound though
12:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think SDL_sound is from sdl itself
12:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it doesnt mix for u
12:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
12:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a lib?
12:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> sdl mixer looks more updated
12:11 < bridge> <discovd> i cant do that because ips are keep changing
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> maybe try to find an online VPN IP list and ban all (but over external software, bcs ddnet's banning system is extremly unefficient)
12:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> are you sure it's IP spoofing and not just an attacker with a lot of available IP addresses?
12:12 < bridge> <teero777> ahh mixing rate is default 48000
12:12 < bridge> <teero777> that makes sense
12:13 < bridge> <discovd> i dont think its spoofed ip its proxy or vpn i think because we have protection with device mikrotik and much
12:13 < bridge> <discovd> can u send me a link?
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> google.com
12:13 < bridge> <teero777> `MACRO_CONFIG_INT(SndRate, snd_rate, 48000, 5512, 384000, CFGFLAG_SAVE | CFGFLAG_CLIENT, "Sound mixing rate")`
12:13 < bridge> <teero777> this mf here
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah, it's basically your speakers sample rate
12:31 < bridge> <teero777> it works XDD
12:32 < bridge> <teero777> wait ill send vid
12:33 < bridge> <teero777> haha this is fun

12:37 < bridge> <teero777> XDD
12:37 < bridge> <teero777> ðŸ˜‚

12:38 < bridge> <teero777> this is genius
12:41 < ChillerDragon> anyone ever had trouble with increasing the bash_history size? Mine seems capped at 2k lines ._. my `HISTSIZE` and  `HISTFILESIZE` are both over 9k and set in /etc/bash.bashrc ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc `histappend` is on
12:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> just use fish
12:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ^^
12:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> should be no problem to increase history size though
12:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oh, you have a problem with it, sorry
12:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> nvm
12:44 < ChillerDragon> i like bash :c
12:46 < ChillerDragon> who even is @discovd and what is he doing?

12:48 < bridge> <teero777> it just segfaulted at the end
12:48 < bridge> <learath2> The turkish community seems to be just attacking eachothers servers all day
12:51 < ChillerDragon> he is turk?
12:52 < bridge> <discovd> ye
12:52 < ChillerDragon> ah hi
12:52 < ChillerDragon> what are you hosting?
12:52 < bridge> <discovd> hi
12:52 < bridge> <discovd> ddnet server
12:52 < ChillerDragon> official ddnet turk servers?
12:52 < ChillerDragon> i see
12:52 < bridge> <discovd> nah deen is not accepting
12:52 < ChillerDragon> inofficial turk ddnet servers
12:52 < ChillerDragon> why does deen even care about you then?
12:52 < ChillerDragon> so nice of deen :)
12:53 < ChillerDragon> leak some ip or server name
12:53 < ChillerDragon> i wanna check it out
12:53 < bridge> <discovd> just search arx3000 or turkey in internet on ddnet
12:54 < ChillerDragon> got it
12:54 < ChillerDragon> ah only 1 server
12:54 < bridge> <discovd> ye
12:54 < ChillerDragon> i cant connect ffs
12:54 < ChillerDragon> did you activate some firewall?
12:54 < bridge> <discovd> nah u need to wait
12:54 < ChillerDragon> is it a feature? :D
12:54 < ChillerDragon> or attack?
12:54 < bridge> <discovd> nah because of attack
12:54 < ChillerDragon> rip
12:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> seems like a nice community
12:55 < ChillerDragon> turkey moment
12:55 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 have you tried fixing ddos for ddnet servers?
12:55 < ChillerDragon> there seems to be a problem with it on turkey servers
12:56 < bridge> <discovd> turk hosts are broken
12:56 < bridge> <discovd> xD
12:56 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 have you tried putting kaspersky into ddnet server?
12:56 < ChillerDragon> oh its the host?
12:56 < ChillerDragon> rip turks .-.
12:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> have u tried turning it off and on again
12:58 < bridge> <discovd> who
13:01 < ChillerDragon> all
13:01 < ChillerDragon> its a universal fix to all problems
13:02 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 have you tried turning the ddos off?
13:03 < bridge> <teero777> where are the sounds actually played?
13:03 < bridge> <teero777> i cant find it
13:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> check grenadeexplosion
13:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> or smth like that
13:04 < bridge> <teero777> yea there are Play and PlayAt functions in client/sound.cpp
13:04 < bridge> <teero777> but they dont really call anything.
13:04 < bridge> <teero777> maybe some update function plays all of the sounds when neccessary
13:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```cpp
13:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> if(g_Config.m_SndGame)
13:05 < bridge> <ryozuki>         m_pClient->m_Sounds.PlayAt(CSounds::CHN_WORLD, SOUND_PLAYER_AIRJUMP, 1.0f, Pos);
13:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
13:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> honestly we should change this
13:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> and put the if inside playatr
13:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> so we never forget
13:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually let me pr this
13:05 < bridge> <teero777> where is the actual call to SDL?
13:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> @teero777 iirc
13:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> it works with a callback
13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```cpp
13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> static void SdlCallback(void *pUnused, Uint8 *pStream, int Len)
13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> {

13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is the callback given to sdl
13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> mix does the work
13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```cpp
13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>     // Set 16-bit stereo audio at 22Khz
13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>     Format.freq = g_Config.m_SndRate;

13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>     Format.channels = 2;
13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>     Format.samples = g_Config.m_SndBufferSize;
13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>     Format.callback = SdlCallback;
13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>     Format.userdata = NULL;
13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>     // Open the audio device and start playing sound!
13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki>     m_Device = SDL_OpenAudioDevice(NULL, 0, &Format, &FormatOut, 0);
13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
13:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> here is the sdl call with callback
13:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> im such a pro
13:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> joking
13:09 < bridge> <teero777> ah ok cool
13:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> monthly contribution done

13:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> this actually fixes a place where that config wasnt checke

14:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 according to the variable description
14:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> snd_game is for game sounds
14:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> snd_enable is for all sounds
14:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess game sounds means hammer? xd
14:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> but the fact not all call sites had  this, is a bug, and more reason for this change
14:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> OH wait
14:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> i am chanbging snd_game
14:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> im blind

14:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> @teero777 u messed 2 pings today  btw xd
14:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> @patiga can u update vek dep to 0.16 in twmap or reexport it?
15:07 < ChillerDragon> is anyone running a big endian system here?
15:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> No
15:11 < ChillerDragon> :c
15:11 < ChillerDragon> how can i test some endiannessiness then
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Why
15:11 < ChillerDragon> i wanna know if my code works on big endian
15:12 < ChillerDragon> and by my code i mean code i found on stackoverflow
15:12 < ChillerDragon> i am certified copy paste engineer
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ok good luck. Are you working with binary data or what
15:13 < ChillerDragon> im planning to
15:13 < ChillerDragon> right now im just printing binary
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> In which language
15:14 < ChillerDragon> x86
15:14 < ChillerDragon> idk is that a language=
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yeah why not xd
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Maybe use a serialize lib, so u dont have to care
15:15 < ChillerDragon> i will just swap the broken code
15:16 < ChillerDragon> assume the dude on so used big endian
15:16 < ChillerDragon> and nobody else is using it
15:16 < ChillerDragon> so its gonna work epic
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Good idea
16:31 < bridge> <discovd> how can i fix this :D?

16:33 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i dont think we can
16:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Have u applied a ip ban list now?
16:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Share some of their ips
16:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I want to know if they are known vps ips(or whatever)
16:35 < bridge> <discovd> let me check 1 min
16:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: x86 is always little endian
16:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but endianness in the token stuff is such a red herring
16:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you simply reproduce the bytes you got on the wire
16:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there is no endianness here
16:41 < bridge> <teero777> where?
16:41 < bridge> <discovd> 2023-09-07 10:41:00 I net_ban: #40 '92.204.135.37' banned for 525598 minutes (Follow the server rules. Type /rules into the chat.)

16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> @discovd dont share ips
16:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> common sense pls xd
16:42 < bridge> <discovd> for this
16:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can dm him
16:44 < bridge> <teero777> @ryozuki what did I miss?
16:44 < bridge> <teero777> Ah messed
16:44 < bridge> <teero777> Not missed xd
16:45 < bridge> <teero777> can't even read
16:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure if sharing IP addresses is bad, but I removed them for now
16:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 3/5 were marked as proxies for me btw
16:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> share ur ip then :brownbear:
16:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> 1.1.1.1 this is mine :gigachad:
16:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> note that the above wasn't tied to any names
16:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but here: 95.89.10.229. currently in saarbrÃ¼cken
16:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you could probably get my IP address easily, you host wiki.ddnet.org after all
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> does cloudflare share ips
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess ye
16:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it does
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> well its it would be hard to pinpoint u
16:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
16:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> a) I have a wiki account
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Why
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It's bot ips
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok ok i retire  what i said
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont kill me
16:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> b) you can send a link in this channel in a conversation with me
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> just wanted to be cautious xd
16:52 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 oh boi im far from reaching tokens :D 
16:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> thanks
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ah thanks
16:52 < ChillerDragon> im just trying to print 0x41 not as 14 :D 
16:52 < ChillerDragon> but that works now
16:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: there is no big endian x86
16:52 < ChillerDragon> ye saw that
16:52 < ChillerDragon> sounds good
16:53 < ChillerDragon> not sure what the SO dude was using then
16:53 < ChillerDragon> maybe he didnt test his code
16:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> link?
16:53 < ChillerDragon> https://stackoverflow.com/a/18879886/6287070
16:53 < ChillerDragon> it works fine on my machine but only if i swap it
16:53 < ChillerDragon> then 0x41 prints 41
16:53 < ChillerDragon> but out of the box it prints 14
16:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @discovd have you read this
16:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> With a public vpn list or similar. You could probably prevent just
16:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Most
16:54 < ChillerDragon> im now down the rabbit hole on how big the sockaddr struct is :D 
16:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> good luck
16:54 < ChillerDragon> seems like on my system its 16 byte
16:54 < ChillerDragon> tw allocates 128
16:54 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/630e49010cd91e97ce49d315b00d4ece193ebe82/ext/socket/rubysocket.h#L240
16:54 < ChillerDragon> and ruby adds additional 2048 padding
16:54 < ChillerDragon> isnt darwin mac?
16:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it depends on what you do
16:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
16:55 < ChillerDragon> does ddnet run on SunOS?
16:55 < ChillerDragon> 2048 seems a bit big
16:55 < ChillerDragon> im doing a recvfrom()
16:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 16 byte is too few for even an ipv6 address with port
16:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> month of august
16:55 < ChillerDragon> ah true
16:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1149357246829047878/image.png
16:55 < ChillerDragon> im going with 128 full tw style then
16:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd do some research
16:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how large is `sockaddr_inet` and `sockaddr_inet6`?
16:58 < ChillerDragon> i guess that depends on your system?
16:59 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1694098780.png
17:00 < ChillerDragon> wot heinrich did you just leak your ip?
17:00 < ChillerDragon> time to spoof heinrich axaxax
17:01 < ChillerDragon> heinrich check irc dms
17:02 < Ryozuki> what u sayin in dms
17:03 < Ryozuki> btw chiller do u have OTR
17:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, must be the same on all amd64 linux systems
17:05 < ChillerDragon> ryo i discussed sensitive heinrich leak in dms xd
17:05 < ChillerDragon> idk OTR
17:05 < Ryozuki> meh the otr plugin for weechat is 5y old
17:05 < Ryozuki> and python 2
17:06 < Ryozuki> OTR allows us to chat in encrypted manner but that later no one can prove you were you when saying that stuff
17:06 < Ryozuki> wanted to try chatting with you
17:06 < Ryozuki> otr = off the record
17:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no one can prove cryptographically from the application protocol*
17:07 < Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging
17:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if someone trusted observes you sending messages, then they obviously have proof that you sent messages
17:07 < Ryozuki> The primary motivation behind the protocol was providing deniable authentication for the conversation participants while keeping conversations confidential, like a private conversation in real life, or off the record in journalism sourcing. This is in contrast with cryptography tools that produce output which can be later used as a verifiable record of the communication event and the identities of
17:07 < Ryozuki> the participants. The initial introductory paper was named "Off-the-Record Communication, or, Why Not To Use PGP".[1]
17:08 < Ryozuki> would be fun if u could make weechat scripts in rust
17:08 < Ryozuki> or wasm
17:08 < Ryozuki> Language: Guile (4) Â· Javascript (2) Â· Lua (8) Â· Perl (89) Â· Python (233) Â· Python2-compatible (207) Â· Python2-only (57) Â· Python3-compatible (176) Â· Python3-only (26) Â· Ruby (27) Â· Tcl (6)
17:08 < Ryozuki> it supports those rn
17:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm not sure we have a good way to do APIs in wasm yet
17:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> for stuff as simple as string passing, e.g.
17:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Greetings! It's kinda off-topic but instead of just asking to ask I'll just ask ;).
17:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 
17:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I'm trying to make my own CAD, but not for consumers, just for me.
17:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I have found that Opencascade kernel to be what I want to work with (OCCT kernel) as it's the only FOSS kernel.
17:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> OCCT is written in C++ (for ryozuki reading there're no "working" rust bindings except for this `https://github.com/bschwind/opencascade-rs` which is a work in progress)
17:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 
17:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I have completed this `https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt__tutorial.html` which is basically like hello world for using the OCCT kernel to create a model.
17:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 
17:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I want to interact with the application mainly via code AKA code-only/code-first.
17:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> zogtib told be to interface it with Lua.
17:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> My problem is I don't know where to start ðŸ˜…
17:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Any proposals are welcome :).
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> sadly idk anything about CAD
17:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you know a good way to do that btw, I'd be interested @ryozuki
17:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> btw
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have to research
17:19 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> don't worry I just want to interface a cpp application with another prob interperted language
17:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/
17:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> > As an embedder of WebAssembly you can also provide WebAssembly modules functionality from the host by creating host-defined functions, memories, globals, etc, which can do things that WebAssembly cannot (such as print to the screen).
17:20 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> The way I am doing it atm is writting cpp code and then compiling it and manually linking stuff which is what I want to avoid
17:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> whis i had more time to do stuff
17:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> wish*
17:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> but when i do i just play dota
17:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> smh
17:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> so making the host-wasm functionality is easy i think, what i want to know is how to define for example a library/interface for a language that compiles to wasm
17:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess in rust u would use extern
17:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rs
17:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> #[link(wasm_import_module = "mod")]
17:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> extern { fn foo(); }
17:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
17:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
17:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u use wasm bindgen its probs
17:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
17:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> #[wasm_bindgen]
17:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> extern {
17:24 < bridge> <ryozuki>     fn alert(s: &str);
17:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
17:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
17:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack
19:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> is there a german that knows about "and one" here?
19:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> we usually speak german in germany
19:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a german group
19:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> that makes german music
19:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> but some are in english
19:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is how i got hooked up
19:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_One
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> nope xd
20:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> neither
21:16 < bridge> <teero777> nope
21:20 < bridge> <Ewan> fix my gdm
21:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> maybe u shouldnt use gentoo as your first distro lmao
21:23 < bridge> <Ewan> what
21:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> maybe u should experiment around with a working out of box distro first
21:25 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym first
21:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> maybe u should experiment second
21:25 < bridge> <Ewan> this is not second
21:25 < bridge> <Ewan> this is like
21:25 < bridge> <Ewan> sixth
21:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u tried linux for real right
21:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> not VM or the windows shit thing
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, last month u were still windows fan boy xD
21:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i used arch for 2 years
21:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> why u got so many problems then
21:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well u should use ur arch xp for it
21:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i told u gamma rays
21:26 < ChillerDragon> who wants to teach me assembly? xd
21:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> o/
21:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont know too
21:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i learnt a bit
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> chillerdragon: let's go
21:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> nasm
21:27 < ChillerDragon> ok
21:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> x86 assmebly?
21:27 < ChillerDragon> yes
21:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> use nasm to learn x86-64
21:27 < ChillerDragon> i got a label
21:27 < ChillerDragon> pointing to memory
21:27 < ChillerDragon> i guess
21:27 < ChillerDragon> my wording is ass
21:27 < ChillerDragon> and now i want to load the first byte of that into rax
21:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/
21:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```nasm

21:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> message:  db        "Hello, World", 10      ; note the newline at the end
21:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
21:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk how to trigger highlight
21:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```asm
21:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> section .bss
21:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon>     udp_recv_buf resb 1400
21:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```
21:29 < ChillerDragon> how do i move the first byte of udp_recv_buf into rax?
21:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> u will hit a problem if u use 64bit and use a modern gcc (if u call C libs, which u will inveitable do) due to relocations or smth
21:29 < ChillerDragon> and then the second etc
21:29 < ChillerDragon> i dont use any c bloat
21:29 < ChillerDragon> i just syscall into linux c bloat
21:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> u will cuz making syscalls is not better
21:29 < ChillerDragon> hm
21:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> my guess is
21:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> u need to load udp_recv_buf  address
21:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i guess just 1 byte
21:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> u probs use a lower register or smth
21:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not much experienced either
21:30 < ChillerDragon> so lea?
21:30 < ChillerDragon> or the [
21:30 < ChillerDragon> idk the diff yet
21:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its []
21:31 < ChillerDragon> you can mov and specify size i think
21:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> mov   rax,label_name
21:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> Labels in NASM are automatically treated as addresses.
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lea = get address
21:31 < ChillerDragon> omg
21:31 < ChillerDragon> i got 04
21:31 < ChillerDragon> looks legit
21:31 < ChillerDragon> 04 is average first tw protocol byte
21:31 < bridge> <Ewan> pro
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> fagging pro style
21:32 < bridge> <Ewan> uh
21:32 < ChillerDragon> cuz i know it all by heart
21:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> what did u do
21:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xDD
21:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> typical chiller
21:32 < ChillerDragon> i did `mov byte rax, [udp_recv_bug]
21:32 < ChillerDragon> thnaks ryowo
21:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> wait
21:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> try without []
21:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> im curious
21:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> TIL mov byte
21:32 < ChillerDragon> without i get ED
21:32 < ChillerDragon> that cant be
21:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i see
21:32 < ChillerDragon> its funny how asm seems to let you do everything
21:33 < ChillerDragon> i think i fucked my stack earlier on hello world
21:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can do the other way too
21:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> mov [var], eax
21:33 < ChillerDragon> but still less crashes than c
21:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye in asm u need to manage  ur stack
21:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> the good thing is
21:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> if ur a pro
21:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> and some function doesnt need a stack prepared
21:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can skip it
21:33 < ChillerDragon> ong
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> i made new user joe and it worked for him
21:33 < ChillerDragon> [buf+1]
21:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz u know when to not comform to a call ABI
21:33 < ChillerDragon> gives me 00
21:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> perks of asm
21:33 < ChillerDragon> 00 is totally legit 2nd byte
21:33 < ChillerDragon> holy shit
21:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> cursed user, maybe ur bash_profile is broken
21:34 < ChillerDragon> dood
21:35 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
21:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i just nuked ewan
21:35 < bridge> <Ewan> and made a new ewan
21:35 < bridge> <Ewan> and i'm in

21:39 < ChillerDragon> nice
21:39 < ChillerDragon> where is that from
21:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/
21:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i sent it already
21:42 < ChillerDragon> ah nice i didnt scrol that far xd
22:03 < bridge> <Ewan> guys xorg fixed
22:03 < ChillerDragon> pro
22:03 < bridge> <Ewan> honestly elated
22:03 < bridge> <Ewan> the wayland oversampling looks good but i still wish you could opt out
22:04 < bridge> <Ewan> firefox looks almost identical to if i set the pixel ratio to 1.5 w no scaling
22:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Cosmic rays, go
22:04 < bridge> <Ewan> but its a little blurry

22:07 < bridge> <Ewan> ryo ur pkg broken
22:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i want a refund
22:10 < bridge> <learath2> it's just masked

22:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually
22:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i probs dont need the \0
22:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz this is not c
22:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah it works
22:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually if i use rdx instead of rdi i save a instruction

22:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> games-action/ddnet ~amd64
22:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> so u can update ddnet
22:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
22:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have this
