13:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 the colors for used/unused envelopes should be inverted ðŸ˜„
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao huh isnt it green for used red for unused?
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> for tele red is used and green unused
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> should be consistent with that logic
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm that sounds silly :D
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> ye maybe but now people are used to it ðŸ˜›
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll fix it when I'm back home I guess
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> ty ðŸ˜„
14:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> a "delete all unused envelopes" would also be handy btw
14:56 <+Learath2> @jao if you can tell me exactly where to place it I can add it right this second. If not it'll need to wait until later :)
14:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> in one of these places maybe
14:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/512990163249397767/unknown.png
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> maybe in envelopes window, under Delete or whatever, I already can't find anything between all those buttons
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Where is the current delete button for a single envelope? can you send me a screenshot? broke something in my sdl on this computer...
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> 
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/512991590172852225/unknown.png
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> don't it fits here
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> also since it's a general button
15:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm do we have a place for optimization tools? e.g. delete empty layers, delete empty groups, delete unused tilesets?
15:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> border is sort of like that
15:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> otherwise no
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> btw my mouse cursor disappeared after tabbing in/out of editor
15:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> that cursor code is so broken I have no idea why it's broken ðŸ˜›
15:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It looks the same as anywhere else but works so differently
15:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> idk how it would done actually, but i would like to see a huge improvement of making rig animations and better dev platform
15:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ðŸ˜³
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Rig animations? What are we rigging?
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> quads
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> for advanced anims
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> acting like bones
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> its like, you dont need to hold those fucking little colorde dots to add movement anim into a quad
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> takes me like forever to make some
16:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> Do you add community translations?
16:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> amm i dont think so :P
16:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see, that'd be TONS of work
16:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Proper animations take a lot of work
16:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not even sure if teeworlds has any of the framework in place to do bones
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Kriss7475 yes
16:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> Even without flag?
16:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
16:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> Then I may do Silesian translation :D
16:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> (voivodeship in Poland with it's own dialectl
16:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> (voivodeship in Poland with it's own dialect)
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Silesian ðŸ¤” I wonder which flag we'd put next to that :D
16:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> I would love to see silesian translation lol
17:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:POL_woj_dolnoslaskie_COA_2009.svg
17:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> This maybe
17:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> 
17:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/513021920715735055/200px-Katowice_Flaga.svg.png
17:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> or better this
17:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> Because it's flag of Katowice, the largest city in Silesia
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> @Learath2
20:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> where can i get file with all lines needed for translation?
21:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> you mean client language? teeworlds folder / data / languages
21:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> use notepad+ for advanced looking
21:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> or any kind of coding software
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> yes but i mean with all the lines used in ddnet
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> those files are probably outdated
21:33 <+Learath2> Kriss7475 ddnet repository still has data/languages
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> which one is most complete?
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> (has the most strings used in ddnet)
21:36 <+Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/data/languages
21:36 <+Learath2> This is the entire thing
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> This is hard -_- there are no good dictionaries online for Silesian
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> I have to use my own from '96
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> If anyone, by pure concidence, is Silesian and knows a good dictionary or can help with translation I would greatly appreciate your help (Writing this in English for ppl here to understand)
23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> use basic english translating into your won. you only need to overwrite it
23:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> use basic english translating into your own. you only need to overwrite it
