10:36 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> wtf happend to the maprlses?
11:18 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] ChillerDragon opened pull request #1001: added '/mods' command which shows a list of moderators (master...master) https://git.io/vNg9r
11:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i thought we discussed that it doesnt show public who forced which vote
11:23 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ty deen xd

11:25 <@deen> Ryozuki: I heard good things about QtCreator for large scale C++ dev
11:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> yeah it's really good too
11:26 <@deen> ChillerDragon: Thanks for updating. About the flag, it's just needed for win32 right now, so you could comment it out locally. I'm not sure what the best approach is here
11:26 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> uhm cant cmake check which os its buliding on and adjust the flags?
11:26 <@deen> map releases: this happens to the nimda script when the website is unreachable for it for some time, then it forgets the already released maps and lists everything. happens at least once a year :)
11:26 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> lul
11:27 <@deen> well, generally it could be a problem everywhere, we just noticed on win32
11:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> heinrich is who edits cmake things
11:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> he is missing üëÅ
11:27 <@deen> i made this cmake change
11:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> oke^^
11:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> oh
11:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ye ill better be quiet
11:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i never even compiled with cmake xd
11:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> this new flag makes trvbis fail
11:27 <@deen> floating point numbers are evil and we want them to be the exact same on every platform
11:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> cause trests warnings as errors
11:27 <@deen> then we could have perfect teehistorian replayability
11:28 <@deen> maybe we should only have a whitelist of floating point operations
11:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> so no moderators list?
11:28 <@deen> and use flags to make them consistent among platforms
11:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i strongly advice to implement the moderators list. It is in the interest of the users. And we should do all for the useres i guess...
11:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> u will have to discuss that with heinrich
11:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> @deen ?? its 5 on each side ~
11:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> or do you mean top and bottom?
11:39 <@deen> but it's 7 if there are mods
11:40 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> OH

15:24 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> I have no idea why it cant load your settings. Maybe it has something to do with your username. Maybe it is better to use letters instead of questionmarks...

17:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Because Github is not open source? probably
17:11 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> GiThub gives you possibility to host private repos
17:11 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> with a lot of features, plugins

19:58 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Yea
19:58 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> finally, i run my own git service (y)
19:58 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> for private projects, uff
19:58 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> it was quite simple
20:00 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> gitolite?
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Gogs
20:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> written in golang
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> gogs was a little too painless for me üòÑ
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> not enough configuration options
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Huh
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> tbh, I just need private repos with good performance
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> and code on my own server
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> and it looks like github, so i have everything
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> what i needed üòÑ
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> Yeah I'd really love the github like interface without it being a black box
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> double click the executable and it works is not my drift
20:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> you can compile by yourself
20:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> if you really want
20:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> :d
20:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> with additional flags
20:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> still yields one executable
20:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> And there's rather big configuration, which you can override üòõ
20:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> I'm very much for having seperate stuff
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I have no opinion. I prefer to get rid of useless stuff, and configurations
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> especially when I don't understand what all of this things does
20:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> and literally, i don't want to learn them. It's not a part of my interests
