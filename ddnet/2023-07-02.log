01:27 < bridge_> <chairn> lol, nice one
01:57 < bridge_> <chairn> https://theconversation.com/twitter-is-refusing-to-pay-google-for-cloud-services-heres-why-it-matters-and-what-the-fallout-could-be-for-users-207718
01:58 < bridge_> <chairn> that also explains some things ðŸ˜„
02:48 < bridge_> <learath2> I knew most of these, nice to see
02:49 < bridge_> <learath2> The compile time checks thru enums were cool tho
11:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you can implement the same logic as `Pin` does, however `Pin` doesn't actually implement any logic at all
11:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's the `Unpin` trait doing the work
11:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but you could also re-implement the `Unpin` trait in user code
11:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> AFAICT
11:35 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1688290488.png
11:35 < ChillerDragon> why is that called crc?
11:35 < ChillerDragon> i thought crc was more sophisticated than just adding up all the data in a unsigned int?
11:35 < ChillerDragon> looks like an intentional overflow
11:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> crc just means "cyclic redundancy check"
11:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> there are concrete crcs that are also called crc though
11:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check
11:39 < ChillerDragon> i just scimmed that very wiki page
11:39 < ChillerDragon> which made me think its more than just adding stuff up
11:40 < ChillerDragon> they mention fancy words such as polynominal long division
11:40 < ChillerDragon> > The concept of the CRC as an error-detecting code gets complicated when an implementer or standards committee uses it to design a practical system. Here are some of the complications: 
11:40 < ChillerDragon> they even make use of the word "complicated"
11:41 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I have not understood the article well enough to know whether simply summing the contents modulo 2**32 is a CRC or not
11:41 < ChillerDragon> is all crc in tw so also for maps just adding up all data and then representing it as one unsigned int that might have overflown multiple times?
11:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no, map CRC (which is outdated, we use SHA256 these days) is a variant of the CRC that zlib implements
11:42 < ChillerDragon> so tw uses a diff crc for snaps than for maps o.O
11:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yep
11:42 < ChillerDragon> cant complain
11:42 < ChillerDragon> i really like this crc algo
11:42 < ChillerDragon> it makes sense to me
11:43 < ChillerDragon> helps me debug
11:43 < ChillerDragon> is a overflow undefined behavior in c++?
11:44 < bridge_> <robyt3> For signed integer types yes, for unsigned types no
11:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not of `unsigned` integers
11:44 < ChillerDragon> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ub
11:44 < ChillerDragon> yea just came to the same conclusion
11:45 < ChillerDragon> interesting
11:45 < ChillerDragon> i always thought all kinds of overflow are bad
11:45 < ChillerDragon> this is epic
11:45 < ChillerDragon> thats the most simple hashing code i ever saw
11:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> all overflows _can_ be bad if not intended
11:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> also newer c++ versions make it not undefined anymore
11:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> integer overflow? ðŸ˜®
11:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> as far as i remember yes
11:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> let me find
11:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> "Out-of-range cast to int is legal starting from C++20"
11:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> mh i see only when casting
11:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> so not for calculations
11:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion#Integral_conversions
11:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i guess they dont know what they want
11:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i wonder what arch blocks them to make it defined behavior, or unexpected result or smth
11:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> the word undefined behavior is always so unspecified
11:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> left shifting is now defined
11:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think they just want `int i = 0; i <= limit + 1; i++` to be equivalent to `int i = 0; i < limit; i++`
12:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and `a + b > a + c` equivalent to `b > c`
12:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and so on
12:04 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> ```

12:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> did u try a clean build dir
12:07 < ChillerDragon> yes
12:07 < ChillerDragon> but even if it wasnt clean
12:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> try `strace`
12:07 < ChillerDragon> the error makes no sense does it?
12:07 < ChillerDragon> alr
12:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> ah yeah u starting an exec lel

12:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's the printing of the error message
12:08 < ChillerDragon> ah wait
12:08 < ChillerDragon> ye
12:08 < ChillerDragon> i saw above the juicy part
12:09 < ChillerDragon> its looking everywhere
12:09 < ChillerDragon> but not at the location ldd shows
12:09 < ChillerDragon> how is that possible
12:09 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> apparently ldd and the dynamic linker have different search paths
12:09 < ChillerDragon> woah
12:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> maybe check which dynamic linker was selected for your executable
12:10 < ChillerDragon> there is no fix for that in ddnet is there?
12:10 < ChillerDragon> so i must have messed soemthing up in my fork
12:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I have not seen the problem before
12:10 < ChillerDragon> how ever i managed to achive that
12:11 < ChillerDragon> im using gold linker
12:11 < ChillerDragon> the same that works for ddnet
12:11 < ChillerDragon> time to diff cmakelists i guess
12:11 < ChillerDragon> also its debian 12 only issue
12:11 < ChillerDragon> on archlinux it works
12:12 < ChillerDragon> my laptop only issue*
12:12 < ChillerDragon> on my deb12 vps it works too xd
12:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> how did u compile the binary?
12:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> on same machine?
12:13 < ChillerDragon> ye
12:13 < ChillerDragon> time to buy new laptop
12:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> yeah
12:13 < ChillerDragon> xd
12:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> its bcs u dont have rtx 4090
12:13 < ChillerDragon> are those even in laptops?
12:13 < ChillerDragon> my laptop has a 2080 mobile o.O
12:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> if not, spam nvidia
12:14 < ChillerDragon> dear mr nvidia, can i has pls gaming laptop thank
12:14 < ChillerDragon> for better ddnet linking
12:14 < ChillerDragon> omg what a side quest i just wanted to debug crc issues
12:16 < bridge_> <deen> Maybe it's a symlink to a non-existing file?
12:16 < ChillerDragon> no
12:16 < ChillerDragon> the ls -lah would have catched that
12:16 < bridge_> <deen> No execute permissions for your user?
12:16 < ChillerDragon> o
12:17 < ChillerDragon> OMG
12:17 < ChillerDragon> deen u so smart
12:17 < ChillerDragon> yes indeed
12:17 < bridge_> <deen> I didn't even see the `ls -lha` output ðŸ˜„
12:17 < bridge_> <deen> Should've scrolled up a bit, then would've been obvious
12:17 < ChillerDragon> nah its my apparmor profile
12:17 < ChillerDragon> that broke on debian 12 update xd
12:17 < ChillerDragon> i forgot it still active
12:17 < bridge_> <deen> aah
12:17 < ChillerDragon> i was testing with my fork
12:17 < ChillerDragon> good idea deen!
12:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> nice error msg from linux xd
12:17 < ChillerDragon> yes
12:18 < ChillerDragon> sudo dmesg
12:18 < ChillerDragon> bae
12:18 < bridge_> <deen> That makes sense now, you don't need +x
12:18 < ChillerDragon> [ 2293.564473] audit: type=1400 audit(1688292479.405:126): apparmor="DENIED" operation="open" profile="ddpp" name="/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.3" pid=30229 comm="DDNetPP" requested_mask="r" denied_mask="r" fsuid=1000 ouid=0
12:18 < bridge_> <deen> Well, apparmor is probably implemented in a hacky way that uses the existing interfaces, and then it looks to the linker like the file doesn't exist
12:18 < ChillerDragon> apparmor pog
12:18 < ChillerDragon> i just gotta not forget i have it on
12:24 < ChillerDragon> omg jopsti
12:24 < ChillerDragon> new ddnet emotes
12:24 < ChillerDragon> slow af
12:25 < ChillerDragon> unplayable
12:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> on kog?
12:25 < ChillerDragon> on ddnet
12:25 < ChillerDragon> i just merged my fork w master
12:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> they are slow again?
12:25 < ChillerDragon> or i broke merge idk
12:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> ah
12:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i renamed vars. they behave differently now
12:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> sry
12:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> didnt see a better way
12:26 < ChillerDragon> wait so is ddnet supposed to be fast?
12:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> ddnet is fast, but u can do whatever u want
12:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno what ddnets current config is
12:26 < ChillerDragon> omg how did i manage to get it slow then xd
12:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> as said
12:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> var is renamed
12:27 < ChillerDragon> delay var?
12:27 < ChillerDragon> in config
12:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> sv_emoticon_ms_delay
12:27 < ChillerDragon> sv_emoticon_ms_delay
12:27 < ChillerDragon> bru
12:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> sv_emoticon_ms_delay 20
12:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 
12:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> is basically per tick
12:28 < ChillerDragon> no deprecation warning
12:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> it was in seconds before xd
12:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> that sucked
12:28 < ChillerDragon> changelog
12:28 < ChillerDragon> breaking version
12:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> xd
12:28 < ChillerDragon> you broke the internet
12:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i mean slow emotes are a deal breaker
12:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> not gonna deny
12:29 < ChillerDragon> renaming config without deprecation warnings or major changelog announcement
12:29 < ChillerDragon> is rude
12:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> its a good way to find out if the downstream maintainers are still active
12:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ˜‰
12:30 < ChillerDragon> trol
12:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> break compat
12:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> without warnings
12:30 < ChillerDragon> ima break ur spine
12:30 < ChillerDragon> without warnings
12:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rood
12:33 < ChillerDragon> over-head emoticon
12:33 < ChillerDragon> xd
12:33 < ChillerDragon> lyrical genius
12:38 < ChillerDragon> jopsti u had those in school?
12:38 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1688294275.png
12:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Tageslichtprojektoren?
12:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> or whatever they were called xd
12:42 < ChillerDragon> OVERHEAD PROJEKTOR
12:42 < ChillerDragon> we called em
12:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> i remember in a latin class the teacher once destroyed one when moving the board down hitting it and then falling down on the ground xD
12:42 < ChillerDragon> lol
12:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> never again where all students awake so much
12:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> true, overhead projektor
12:42 < ChillerDragon> ye latin is low enegery
12:43 < ChillerDragon> overhead emoticons
12:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> pls dont tag inside a commit chiller. i get notified every time u change the commit or merge it or whatever
12:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 
12:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> huge troll
12:54 < ChillerDragon> i know
12:54 < ChillerDragon> u break api
12:54 < ChillerDragon> u suffer
12:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ¥¹
12:55 < ChillerDragon> but dw pushed straight to master
12:55 < ChillerDragon> wont rebase it
12:55 < ChillerDragon> i get hughe warning message now evertime i start a server
12:56 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1688295370.png
12:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> deserved
12:57 < ChillerDragon> -.-
12:57 < ChillerDragon> toxic developers
12:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> warning: bin/backup is measured in gigabytes
12:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> wtf is that warning xD
12:58 < ChillerDragon> hehe
12:58 < ChillerDragon> leak
12:59 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1688295544.png
12:59 < ChillerDragon> ye i should clean that
12:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> xd
12:59 < ChillerDragon> i keep server binaries on update
13:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> in case u want to downgrade 2 years?
13:00 < ChillerDragon> yes
13:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> clever
13:00 < ChillerDragon> never happend
13:00 < ChillerDragon> mostly to debug crashes
13:00 < ChillerDragon> to have the exact binary that crashed
13:01 < ChillerDragon> or revert to last working version when there is a bug that crashes server on launch
13:11 < bridge_> <robyt3> GitHub search for relevant issues: `is:issue sort:updated-desc is:open -label:needs-discussion -label:to-reproduce -label:incomplete -label:"3rd party" -label:meta-discussion -label:question`
13:16 < ChillerDragon> 382
13:18 < bridge_> <robyt3> (Chiller got the edit to my old pin)
13:18 < ChillerDragon> a lol
13:18 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5466
13:18 < ChillerDragon> this should be closed
13:18 < ChillerDragon> @faulty
13:18 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> @0xfaulty
13:20 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6189
13:20 < ChillerDragon> also this is missing lables
13:20 < ChillerDragon> thats not a relevant issue
13:20 < bridge_> <robyt3> yeah, I was looking for that
13:21 < bridge_> <robyt3> I added a label "question" for issues like this
14:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks i think they advanced baldurs gate release
14:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> GOAT
14:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > We will be releasing the game in order of platform readiness. Baldurâ€™s Gate 3 will first come to PC on August 3rd, before launching on PlayStation 5 a few weeks later on September 6th.
14:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dude
14:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this game will be a true GOTY
14:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > More on those new heights: Baldurâ€™s Gate 3 has more cinematic dialogue than three times all three Lord of the Rings novels combined. It has 174 hours of cinematics, making it more than twice the length of every season of Game of Thrones combined.
14:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> yeah
14:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> even the EA is insane xd
14:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> sadly im on holidays then

16:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2
16:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
19:49 < bridge_> <vy0x2> what does this flag in variables say? CFGFLAG_INSENSITIVE
19:52 < bridge_> <robyt3> It determines which client variables are factored into the client checksum
19:53 < bridge_> <robyt3> For example the `password` client config is not used for checksum of course
19:53 < bridge_> <vy0x2> so should i use it when i introduce a new client variable :justatest:
19:53 < bridge_> <vy0x2> so i should use it when i introduce a new client variable? :justatest:
19:54 < bridge_> <robyt3> Depends on what it's used for
19:54 < bridge_> <teero777> i dont know whats wrong with me but i just read the flag in your message as if you were screaming in my head :justatest:
19:54 < bridge_> <robyt3> Seems like all gameplay and tee related variables are used for the checksum
19:55 < bridge_> <vy0x2> ah i got it,  "insensitive" says its non sensitive data.. I thought it had something todo with case sensitive
19:56 < bridge_> <vy0x2> ah i got it,  "insensitive" says its non sensitive data.. I thought it has something todo with case sensitive
21:50 < bridge_> <steinchen99> how do i update ddnet client to newest version? im not on steam (arch linux + downloaded client) and whenever i do yay it says everything is updated tho
21:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> why dont u install from AUR?
21:53 < bridge_> <steinchen99> thats pretty much aur, right?
21:53 < bridge_> <steinchen99> i did yay ddnet and chose 1 now, lets see..
21:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> mh ok thought u meant "downloaded client" = downloaded manually
21:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ddnet-git
21:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> did u use ddnet-git
21:55 < bridge_> <steinchen99> yes
21:55 < bridge_> <steinchen99> and just ddnet
21:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> well seems like the packet is simply not updated yet
21:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> u can ping the maintainer rafaelff
21:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> he is here
21:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this depends on whoever  updates the aur
21:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i used to do it
21:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but i upgraded to gentoo
21:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so im now maintaining the gentoo ebuild
22:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a good way to update ur ddnet is to upgrade to gentoo
22:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
22:00 < bridge_> <steinchen99> i downloaded this one and its on 17.03
22:00 < bridge_> <steinchen99> for now

22:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk who even maintains it
22:01 < bridge_> <steinchen99> ;-:
23:44 < bridge_> <teero777> hey where is this litte sht drawn?
23:44 < bridge_> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1125180319675469834/image.png
23:47 < bridge_> <teero777> i nvm i found it its in hud.cpp
23:47 < bridge_> <teero777> ah nvm i found it its in hud.cpp
