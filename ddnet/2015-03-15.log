02:06 < Duck_> Hallo :) For some reason I can't connect to the test servers. I was wondering if you changed the pw?

09:42 < eeeee> damn
09:42 < eeeee> google completely broke ptr lock in chrome
09:43 < eeeee> now if you have non-default dpi it just doesnt work at all
09:43 < eeeee> so looks like js client release will have to wait for chrome 43 release
09:55 <@deen> ouch
10:02 < eeeee> other than that seems to work
10:02 < eeeee> although you have to press esc twice to get to the menu
10:02 < eeeee> gonna try to fix that
10:04 < eeeee> if you have time you can check d.html to see if it works better for you than the last time
10:08 <@deen> the menu works great, but connecting to a server takes about 15 seconds?
10:09 <@deen> ingame is also great
10:09 <@deen> seems to work perfectly in firefox
10:09 <@deen> i don't dislike the double esc
10:10 <@deen> map download is fast now, no idea what happened before
10:11 <@deen> spectator mode is a bit weird, isn't it?
10:11 <@deen> it just scrolls around while I move the mouse, even slightly
10:11 <@deen> but when I stop moving the mouse it suddenly stops
10:13 <@deen> how to change spectator mode?
10:14 <@deen> teamchat should be on z instead of y on some keyboards, maybe just bind it on both? =/
10:15 <@deen> in chat i can't write anything with a shift, like /pause

11:08 < eeeee> 15 seconds for connecting to a server is still that too many concurrent connections issue
11:09 < eeeee> Learath2 made a prototype for serverinfo preloading from .json, i'll see if it works tomorrow
11:09 < eeeee> if it's good then 15 seconds thing will be solved for goot
11:09 < eeeee> good*
11:11 < eeeee> map download used to be the usual tw udp download tunneled over websockets, now it uses Learath2's http download code path (hacked to use native browser stuff instead of curl)
11:12 < eeeee> gonna take a look into spectator mode. i couldn't exactly repro but i think i know what's the issue
11:12 < eeeee> some keys don't work, yeah. i noticed that shift and up arent working for me, didnt have time to debug yet.
11:46 <@deen> eeeee: ddnet server doesn't work on windows anymore

12:21 < Learath2> deen: did that fix it ?
12:21 <@deen> yes
12:21 <@deen> it didn't work on windows 7 and wine for me
12:21 <@deen> now both work
12:22 <@deen> ddnet client in wine works beautifully btw
12:23 <@deen> can't tell the difference to regular client
13:12 < Mahdi> hello everyone 
13:12 < Mahdi> I tried updating from 7.3.3 to 7.3.4 on debian jessie
13:13 < Mahdi> it failed
13:13 < Mahdi> and failed
13:13 < Mahdi> and failed once more
13:15 < Mahdi> interesting 
13:15 < Mahdi> it worked when I launched from the default launcher
13:15 < Mahdi> anyway, thanks

16:54 < WolfAlex> deen: is it possible to fix that bug with prediction when you shoot a (for example)grenade in one tune zone and walk with the tee into antother zone? (speed difference for grenade in the two zones)

17:42 < WolfAlex> deen: i've activated the fifo-input of my client: if i send +fire into it, my client fires, but jetpack does not work (jetpack is active)
17:43 < EastByte> afaik you cannot use +cmds properly in console
17:43 < EastByte> +fire will call its callback twice at once
17:44 < EastByte> press and release

17:47 <@deen> WolfAlex: i don't think so
17:47 <@deen> and for jetpack, you would need to hold down the key, which doesn't work with fifo
17:48 < EastByte> would require an additional command for holding keys
17:49 < WolfAlex> hm
17:50 < WolfAlex> deen: delta compression is also done on prjectiles? would it help to disable the compression if a projectile is in another tune zone?
17:50 <@deen> no idea, wouldn't help
18:18 < Lady> Learath2?
18:22 < Lady> Learath2: updating is even worse now :(
18:24 < Learath2> Lady: last commit by me should have fixed it 
18:24 < Lady> deen told me in 7.3.4 it should be fixed
18:24 < Lady> so I downlaoded it ye
18:24 < Learath2> yeah personally tested it on winxp
18:24 < Lady> from the website
18:25 < Lady> and now I can't update to 7.3.5 :P
18:25 < Learath2> well what seems to be the problem ? 
18:25 < Learath2> any error messages ?
18:25 < Lady> Learath2 I click update now and there is this downloading bar, cleint restarts and that's all
18:27 < Learath2> if you are around for a couple of minutes i can give you another version you can test which i actually tried on windows xp
18:27 < Lady> yes
18:31 < Learath2> uploading it should take a second
18:32 < Learath2> deen: im thinking the storage stuff you did broke it for winxp again somehow :D
18:36 < Learath2> Lady: https://mega.co.nz/#!p0kwRQBJ!QxwGIg8tqygGiUJp1vRmIgt-jRd3AWGNL1VhJDlcAvs
18:36 < Lady> let's see
18:36 < Learath2> its directly from commit b1044647f9127f49c34b2d602b9b8710159bb2f5 if anyone is wondering what i sent :P
18:39 < Lady> 7.3.1?
18:39 < Learath2> the version number is probably wrong
18:39 < Lady> so should I try to update?
18:39 < Learath2> yep
18:40 < Learath2> it should update all the way to 7.3.5
18:40 < Lady> now I had to click "Restart" :P
18:40 < Lady> but it's still red 7.3.5 is out
18:40 < Learath2> it restarted and it still says 7.3.5 is out ? 
18:41 < Lady> yep
18:41  * Learath2 is confused
18:44 < Lady> brb
18:48 < Lady> Learath2 so I have to download it from the website always? :c
18:48 < Learath2> Lady: could you test one more thing for me ?
18:48 < Lady> sure
18:49 < Learath2> https://mega.co.nz/#!Ek1znSCQ!uqEeQx3xm_juwbNScVg-igfTyAbJMT0PGqSek8HantU
18:49 < Lady> hm but the update changed my entities_clear file :(
18:49 < Learath2> download this one to the desktop and double click it 
18:49 < Learath2> see if it changes name
18:50 < Learath2> Its exactly what ddnet client does but without the client :D
18:51 < Lady> kek :P
18:52 < Lady> ye it changed is it good?
18:52 < Learath2> yeah so that small program works 
18:53 < Learath2> but ddnet client doesnt :/
18:53 < Learath2> atleast its possible just give me like 20 mins and i should be able to get it working
18:54 < Lady> I wonder if this other guy with XP has the same problem
18:57 < Learath2> deen: i have two builds from the same exact source one can self rename the other cant 
19:08 < Learath2> EastByte: iirc you had ida pro could you help me figure out whats different between two executables ?
19:10 < EastByte> Learath2: sry, rly busy right now
19:20 < Learath2> Lady: https://mega.co.nz/#!YhUUXbzR!qtlVuSeQyy0nfIjyfTm5NPDx9hIWCNHb9l_k0SlRj30
19:20 < Learath2> this one should work
19:20 < Learath2> but i have no idea how
19:20 < Lady> ok
19:24 < Lady> Learath2 it worked, thanks
19:25 < Learath2> now i just need to see how that one works and fix it on the real client :D
19:46 < WolfAlex_pc> deen: 
19:46 < WolfAlex_pc> autoupdater does not work
19:46 < WolfAlex_pc> [15-03-15 19:43:28][fetcher]: Downloading update.json [xcb] Unknown request in queue while dequeuing [xcb] Most likely this is a multi-threaded client and XInitThreads has not been called [xcb] Aborting, sorry about that.

19:47 < Learath2> pffffffftttt
19:47 < WolfAlex_pc> huh?
19:47 < Learath2> WolfAlex_pc: linux ?
19:47 < WolfAlex_pc> yeah
19:49 < Learath2> that error message makes no sense
19:54 < Learath2> sry dont quite have the linux knowledge to say whats wrong
19:55 < WolfAlex> hm
19:56 < WolfAlex> the old updater worked :/
19:58 < Learath2> WolfAlex: idk why but the new one just doesnt seem to work for like 2-3 people
19:59 < WolfAlex> just linux?
19:59 < Learath2> no the others are just windows xp being a bitch
20:02 < WolfAlex> EastByte: does the updater work for you?
20:06 < Learath2> WolfAlex: is this always reproducible ?
20:06 < WolfAlex> yes
20:06 < Learath2> can you compile code ?
20:06 < WolfAlex> yes
20:09 < WolfAlex> what file do i have to change, so that the updater thinks a update is required?
20:11 < Learath2> WolfAlex: client.cpp:L591
20:11 < Learath2> return "
20:11 < Learath2> should make it always think there is an update
20:11 < Learath2> and https://github.com/Learath2/ddnet/commit/496c16aeebb6cd3d956e47f528c7c8c038f744ae i think should fix your problem
20:12 < Learath2> not sure tho 
20:16 < WolfAlex> it is stuck @ Downloading update.json (in the client)
20:16 < WolfAlex> and in stdout it says parsing update.json
20:16 < WolfAlex> (without the last patch) <Learath2> and https://github.com/Learath2/ddnet/commit/496c16aeebb6cd3d956e47f528c7c8c038f744ae i think should fix your problem
20:16 < WolfAlex> but it does not crash
20:17 < WolfAlex> i just changed the linie to return "";
20:18 < Learath2> WolfAlex: did it download update.json before getting stuck on parsing ?
20:18 < Learath2> [fetcher] Task done update.json 
20:18 < WolfAlex> yes
20:18 < Learath2> and can you verify that update.json is actually filled 
20:18 < WolfAlex> it is
20:19 < WolfAlex> 6 versions are inside
20:20 < Learath2> thats correct 
20:20 < Learath2> well only way i can think of to find where it actually gets stuck is a debugger
20:21 < WolfAlex> ah now stdout says ALSA lib pcm.c:7905:(snd_pcm_recover) underrun occurred 
20:21 < WolfAlex> >10 times
20:21 < WolfAlex> ._.
20:21 < WolfAlex> no idea if that is relevant
20:21 < Learath2> seems to be smth about sound which prolly happens because the client is stuck
20:22 <@heinrich5991> WolfAlex: that's just a symptom of a different problem
20:23 < WolfAlex> Learath2: the client is not freezed, i can still play/navigate in menues
20:23 < Learath2> oh so its just autoupdate stuck on parsing 
20:24 < Learath2> could add a dbg_msg right below autoupdate.cpp:L188 to see if the parsing is ever done
20:26 < WolfAlex> Learath2:

20:37 < WolfAlex> omg Learath2 
20:38 < WolfAlex> it does not work because i deleted the $USERDIR in storage.cfg
20:40 < Learath2> im sry WolfAlex :/
20:40 < Learath2> deen told me this might happen :D
20:40 < WolfAlex> ._.
20:41 < Learath2> think ill get rid of storage support in fetcher and let the user pass a file handle instead :/
20:43 < WolfAlex> Learath2: are you able to reproduce the error on windows?
20:43 < Learath2> testing that right now 
20:45 < Learath2> yep removing $USERDIR kills the updater right off WolfAlex
22:04 < Learath2> Two executables exact same assembly different behaviour explain that and i kid you not you will be the proud owner of 10 whopping dollars
22:08 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: does it have to do with where the executables are located?
22:15 < Learath2> nope
22:15 <@heinrich5991> or how they're named?
22:18 < Learath2> also nope
