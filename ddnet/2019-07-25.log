08:54 <+Android> Hey guys, is there any android version for smartphones ?
08:55 <+Android> Im searching for ddnet android version
08:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> discontinued
09:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes, but old
09:04 <@deen> Android: https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-9.3.1.apk
09:04 <@deen> If you want to maintain it, you could
09:04 <@deen> But in general it's mostly useful for watching, not playing
09:38 <+Android> Is there any download link and why old ?
09:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> As deen sent
09:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-9.3.1.apk
09:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> We dont support Android anymore
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/603950722534604812/image0.jpg
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> probably wont read anything of it xd
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but at least i tried xd
16:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> is this printed links?
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why does ddnet list closed source servers now in the ddnet tab?
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª cuz kog asked deen and deen accepted
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i know its sad
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was against
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª oh, or u mean mods?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which one is closed source?
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the blockz
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and onbgy fng
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> also football?
18:20 <+coffee> Blockz was meant to be exclusive to ddnet
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it should not be exclusive
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats not ddnet spirit
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @onby https://github.com/unique-clan/football
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ooh
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we got a football patched mod
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> someone told me football was closed source
18:22 <+coffee> Well, I guess it's better for the community to keep people playing together
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> or, at least some of the ball mods
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what you talking about
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet shares the database, and nearly everything
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i do see the logic of keeping small mods closed source so as to not fragment their already small playerbases even further
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it should share the source of blockz too
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ddnet ddrace isnt small tho
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> teesmash best
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ya i like teesmash lol
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/timazuki/TeeSmash
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ddnet should host it
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
18:24 <+coffee> But the playerbase is, as onby said, really small..
18:24 <+coffee> Blockz should stay closed source for this specific reason
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> also i think theres good reason to keep mods with anticheat systems closed source so that they are a bit harder to bypass
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no it shouldnt
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> players will go to most populated server
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> open sourcing this wont split anything trust me
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://freeopensourcesoftware.org/index.php/Main_Page
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> go read the blible
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Ryozuki timazuki:GWatproHyperPoggers:
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well idc about kog tab, but not ddnet tab <.<
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> timakro+ryozuki
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I got the reference
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> But thanks for clarifying
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :twintri:
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.fsf.org/
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> TimaZuki TeeZmash
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> make verified server tab for all closed source stuff xd
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yeah that would be cool
18:29 <+coffee> Still better than open sourcing the mod :)
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> then i guess all the stuff like kog/blockz/my server/maybe a few other popular servers could go there
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> well open sourcing antibot systems just makes it less effective
18:30 <+coffee> True
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what's bad about open sourcing it?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then people could add cool new features and suddenly popularity might explode
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> fng is as popular as it gets
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and the anticheat works better if the bot creators dont know hwo its implemented
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but ye it would be awesome if only the antibot is gitignored and the rest would be public
20:17 <+coffee> When I sent you the mod several years ago, the point was to make it exclusive to ddnet deen 
20:18 <+coffee> I could be wrong but Fokkonaut and myself are currently working on the next updates
20:18 <+coffee> I have a specific vision of the next updates for now, at some point it will be open sourced probably.
20:22 <+coffee> But I understand if it's not compatible with the ddnet philosphy.
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> exclusivity is always cancer
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look at epic store
20:28 <+coffee> I swear the code will be available at some point
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats not how it should work
20:30 <+coffee> For the moment I won't agree with that, and maybe ddnet should remove blockz from its servers then.
20:31 <+coffee> You hosted the mod for the last several years and I am really thankful for that :)
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its my opinion, i dont talk on behalf of ddnet
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, we can still keep hosting it even if I disagree with you ðŸ˜„
20:41 <+coffee> Thanks also, will you agree to update the mod in the next few days?
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sure
20:41 <+coffee> Thanks, you're the most kind dev that I know ! :p
20:42 <+coffee> I plan to make additional new maps for infectz too, we can upload them to ddnet too ?
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "non free propietary user subjugating program"
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
21:03 <+coffee> As I said, it will be open sourced at some point
21:03 <+coffee> I think I got your opinion.
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the antibot thing you can do a closed source module with hooks
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> only that part of the code has to be closed source then and everyone else can use the mod without the antibot features
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^
