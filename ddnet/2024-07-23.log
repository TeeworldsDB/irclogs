00:01 < bridge> <BlackHole> ok it works now thank you
00:24 < bridge> <BlackHole> and we found new mini visual bug XD
00:25 < bridge> <BlackHole> when he use hook collision i didnt see his hook colision if he dont touching his aim stick
00:25 < bridge> <BlackHole> when he(steamdeck) use hook collision i didnt see his hook colision if he dont touching his aim stick
00:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @learath2 you don't like the idea of a basic xml parser that ignores every tag except `<span style="color:#c00000"></span>`? ^^
00:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we could require a flag to be set so we interpret these tags, we could ignore the whole broadcast on parse error
00:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it'd give us a clear, well-defined format that can also be extended should we ever feel the need to
00:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I agree though that ANSI escape codes are also a good possibility
00:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> less typable though, maybe
00:34 < bridge> <learath2> I don‚Äôt want to overcomplicate it, there is no hierarchy to broadcasts for us to benefit from something like xml in
00:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @isegrin  @headshotnoby
00:39 < bridge> <headshotnoby> huh
00:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> isegrin was interested in your ddnet ports
00:40 < bridge> <isegrin> ps3 port
00:40 < bridge> <headshotnoby> ohh
00:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i told him you did some, as he asked me to port it
00:40 < bridge> <isegrin> haii
00:41 < bridge> <headshotnoby> i'm currently working on the 3DS port so i'll still be posting here in the future
00:41 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i cant recall all the ports you did
00:41 < bridge> <fokkonaut> which was it again ?
00:41 < bridge> <headshotnoby> ds, wii, ps2 and 3ds, in that order
00:41 < bridge> <isegrin> ty

10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 curl is not a pinned version in the android script right?:
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> build-android-libs/compile_libs/curl/lib/idn.c:37:10: fatal error: 'idn2.h' file not found
10:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
10:58 < bridge> <robyt3> No, I think most Android libs are build on latest master. Should probably pin some versions that work, or the same that the client uses on other platforms
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah manually switched the branch now and works
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> even tho i agree with pinning, i mostly didnt do it back then, bcs then deen would need to update the scripts too when updating libs xd
10:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but if we get ddnet-libs integration that should be fine i guess
11:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
11:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mold: error: undefined symbol: __res_init

11:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
11:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh interesting:
11:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 1. interesting that it uses mold to compile
11:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 2. not so interesting that i get a compile time error that i dont understand xD
11:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i assume u've never seen that before
11:03 < bridge> <robyt3> No, haven't seen it before. Google has various potential fixes for it though
11:04 < bridge> <robyt3> No, haven't seen it before. Google has various potential fixes/reports for it though
11:04 < bridge> <robyt3> Did you maybe miss running a configure script that exists now?
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what? what is that
11:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Some repos might still have separate `autogen.sh` or other scripts to generate additional source/header files
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'll first try without mold now.. i find it bit annoying that our cmake script changes linker priority anyway
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> doesnt seem like it should be manually done
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh didnt help rip
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but it really sounds like a rust bug
11:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well related to our rust code
11:09 < bridge> <robyt3> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73426
11:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i try nightly
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 32bit gives even weirder errors:
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ld.lld: error: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/libddnet_engine_shared.a(ddnet_engine_shared-a432234d37677268.05k6yrd7x6qeo8lukhce6gc2o.rcgu.o) is incompatible with elf_i386
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like why does it even choose x86_64
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> same on arm
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and arm64
11:13 < bridge> <robyt3> I'll try, haven't rebuild my libraries since I got it working
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah this is already ddnet building
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the libs worked fine
11:14 < bridge> <robyt3> hm, that's odd
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah i used `git checkout curl-8_8_0   ` for curl
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rest worked
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah super odd:
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mold: fatal: ddnet_engine_shared-a432234d37677268.05k6yrd7x6qeo8lukhce6gc2o.rcgu.o: incompatible file type: arm64 is expected but got x86_64
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mold is a bit clearer
11:15 < bridge> <robyt3> Did you setup cargo-ndk and add the rustup targets?
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i followed the android readme
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
11:16 < bridge> <robyt3> weird, so seems related to some default settings being used differently for you
11:17 < bridge> <robyt3> It's always using lld linker for me
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> apparently i was on rust nightly before
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i switched to stable again, now it at least goes into creating the apk
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> where it fails too xd
11:18 < bridge> <robyt3> How does that step fail?
11:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> apparently it searches for java17 for whatever reason
11:19 < bridge> <robyt3> hmm, should work it can find java 21 as well though
11:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does it only work with 21?
11:19 < bridge> <robyt3> it always prints some warnings about the java location for me but those can be ignored (that's the recommended solution from the internet)
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah now it works, i use java 21 default now
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> perfect
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so rust stable it is for now.. i wonder why tho
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do we manually check some stuff about rust in our cmake or whatever?
11:21 < bridge> <robyt3> `list(APPEND PLATFORM_LIBS dl) # for Rust` this line seems to apply to linux+rust but not to Android due to the `elseif`
11:22 < bridge> <robyt3> maybe adding it to the block above would help, maybe it's included in `TW_ANDROID_LIBS` which is defined somewhere else though
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mold: error: duplicate symbol: /home/jupeyy/Android/Sdk/ndk/26.3.11579264/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/lib/clang/17/lib/linux/libclang_rt.builtins-arm-android.a(fixunssfdi.c.o): armv7-linux-androideabi/release/libddnet_engine_shared.a(compiler_builtins-33541d770eea3a97.compiler_builtins.de41643f9cd834e3-cgu.033.rcgu.o): __fixunssfdi
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> arm still fails btw
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but different issue
11:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can try that after linking finished
11:24 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe also the other `list(APPEND PLATFORM_LIBS rt) # clock_gettime for glibc < 2.17` since your error message seems to contain `rt`
11:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice, the game and touch controls generally work
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 so the x86_64 still fails
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rt lib doesnt even exist
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> removed that line, get the old errors
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> arm64 still says that it detects the runtime wrongly
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno if that is a nightly thing, but we can also add a warning to the android build script to use stable rust
11:34 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, could be added to the readme
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mobile is so hard üò¨

11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but nice
11:41 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, it takes some times
11:41 < bridge> <robyt3> also, hide the extra buttons to see more
11:42 < bridge> <robyt3> I much prefer the direct touch input though
11:42 < bridge> <robyt3> at least for a phone sized device
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i trust forgottencat, he said arms in the way, now i see that they are in the way xdd
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have a phone with 120hz, that is quite nice.. looks really smooth
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> input delay seems okish too
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> feels better on most laptops i played on yet

12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i used the joystick touch tho
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> much harder to aim xd
12:05 < bridge> <soulyvevo> time to play noby fng with that :troll:
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no joke
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u'll get banned
12:05 < bridge> <soulyvevo> it was kinda hard to move tbh
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs of aimbot
12:05 < bridge> <soulyvevo> ye ik
12:06 < bridge> <soulyvevo> so ye i thought its gonna be something like the old android version that we had
12:06 < bridge> <soulyvevo> but this
12:06 < bridge> <soulyvevo> is just so much better
12:06 < bridge> <soulyvevo> seems to run smooth
12:06 < bridge> <bumm.> is it going to be for iphone and android?
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> guess
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> apple closed ecosystem
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or android open source

12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i doubt the interest in that app is huge enough
12:07 < bridge> <bumm.> ye i know that :cammostripes:
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is that a debug build
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why is it so giant
12:07 < bridge> <robyt3> It's release
12:08 < bridge> <robyt3> Debug is almost twice as large
12:08 < bridge> <murpi> Since we're mobile now, lets go full pay2win
12:08 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe my linker is not so good at merging the libs
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 5$ per hook
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 10$ per shot
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else finish without those, nobo
12:09 < bridge> <murpi> Say goodbye to Raid Shadow Legends, and hello to DDraceNetwork!
12:09 < bridge> <robyt3> The PR adds touch for all platforms that support it, so now it the time to port this to PS Vita :justatest:
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you need LTO
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it should decrease
12:10 < bridge> <soulyvevo> we gotta find someone to sponsor it

12:12 < bridge> <bumm.> no
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 play store would have the advantage that the apks are split again
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so not 130mb to download lmao
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 have you seen that our curl impl currently loads a ca certificate?
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> back when i first did the port, curl didnt get android system certs, i dunno if that changed.. but that is defs a small problem, bcs then the certs get expire i think
12:15 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, I think it should be possible without copying the cert: https://stackoverflow.com/a/52305133

12:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
12:19 < bridge> <soulyvevo> idk how to throw people with this
12:19 < bridge> <manikoo> :gigachad:
12:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sus
12:21 < bridge> <soulyvevo> it took really long to get banned tho
12:21 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i expected it to ban instantly
12:21 < bridge> <soulyvevo> @jupeyy_keks how do i switch to that funny aiming wheel thing
12:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i did it in f1 console, but maybe robyte also has gui for it
12:22 < bridge> <robyt3> #8632
12:22 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8632
12:22 < bridge> <soulyvevo> ooh oke
12:22 < bridge> <robyt3> There are some more buttons in the ingame menu when you have touch controls enabled
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @soulyvevo press ESC
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then there is a checkbox
12:22 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1265252697620217920/351091220-66588501-3b38-46cb-889d-70be0cd0e9fa.png?ex=66a0d5e6&is=669f8466&hm=89808a24c96598069b7339e8076a46db1c5cce7444e8465b184a554f599b0b97&
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ESC = return btn
12:22 < bridge> <robyt3> you can also long press the menu button to open the menu
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 the Active: hook button has a weird hitbox btw.. almost as if i have to hit the text instead of btn xd
12:24 < bridge> <soulyvevo> got it
12:25 < bridge> <robyt3> should be the same as the other buttons though. only the joystick hitbox itself is weird since it's a square around the rendered circle
12:25 < bridge> <robyt3> maybe it's some OS function interfering with you
12:26 < bridge> <robyt3> you can change the fullscreen mode to windowed to status bar and system menu are always shown, maybe that prevents it from detecting something as a gesture
12:26 < bridge> <robyt3> you can change the fullscreen mode to windowed so status bar and system menu are always shown, maybe that prevents it from detecting something as a gesture
12:27 < bridge> <teero777> Yea I often accidentally click outside it and miss the hook. Would be nice to be able to adjust the size and position.
12:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @soulyvevo 0.7 hand support is going well <:justatest:572499997178986510>
12:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1721730425.png
12:28 < bridge> <teero777> Also a kill button would be nice. Having to go ESC->kill is annoying xd
12:28 < bridge> <robyt3> I didn't want to make it too easy to do it accidentally though
12:29 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe the margins at the top and sides should be removed so the button are all flush with the screen edges
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sry for the epyc noises :lol:
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1265254687490314290/VID_20240723_122630.mp4?ex=66a0d7c0&is=669f8640&hm=45b6a9c5a0f6cad9c5d07d419290d340f09b0e238569e0923253dfbf12e8e1d6&
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> micro must be really sensitive
12:30 < bridge> <soulyvevo> BRO NO WAY THIS IS THAT HARD TO CODE üò≠üò≠üò≠
12:31 < bridge> <teero777> Skill issue xxdd
12:31 < bridge> <teero777> jk
12:31 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i couldnt do a single throw on fng
12:31 < bridge> <soulyvevo> thats a real skill issue
12:31 < bridge> <robyt3> Hmm, and it only happens for this one button? Does something similar happen in other games as well in that corner? Maybe try windowed mode
12:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh yeah dunno maybe it's my phone xd
12:33 < bridge> <teero777> Btw @robyt3 are configs not saved yet or is there something wrong on my end?
12:33 < bridge> <robyt3> General notice: If you have a 3-finger swipe gesture (for screenshots or multi tasking) then disable it, or pressing down 3 or more fingers doesn't work
12:33 < bridge> <robyt3> Only if you quit the client manually
12:33 < bridge> <robyt3> Not if you leave it in the background to die
12:33 < bridge> <teero777> Ah ok
12:33 < bridge> <teero777> xd
12:34 < bridge> <robyt3> You can also quickly press the back button three times to quit cleanly, but maybe we should remove that again if it's too easy to do accidentally, now that the UI works
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> windowed mode works.. so i assume it has to do with the android overlay somehow
12:35 < bridge> <teero777> Hitting the UI sliders is pretty hard. Is a swipe gesture for the server browser plausible?
12:35 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, I assume it handles the touch as activating the menu bar with the gesture
12:35 < bridge> <robyt3> yes, it's already implemented, use two fingers
12:36 < bridge> <teero777> Oh mb xdd
12:36 < bridge> <teero777> Woah cool
12:37 < bridge> <teero777> It still moves the mouse cursor with one of the fingers if you want to fix that xd
12:38 < bridge> <robyt3> It needs to, otherwise it can't know which UI element to activate with the scroll
12:38 < bridge> <teero777> Ah okay
12:38 < bridge> <teero777> Is there a way to tab player names in chat?
12:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Would be better if UI elements wouldn't be activated while scrolling, but that's caused by the two fingers not being pressed down exactly at the same time, might be fixable by adding some delay in the UI
12:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Not without keyboard
12:39 < bridge> <robyt3> Unless your virtual keyboard can enter tab maybe
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my screen cuts off, but the reported res is my "real" screen res
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1265257802935439392/image.png?ex=66a0daa7&is=669f8927&hm=8f885be1e4eb303a362edf9bb2a970b874525a0680040d90f5c8700d6b69a3a7&
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that kinda sucks.. but probs nothing we can do
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when i resize in windowed mode it changes the res.. then changes it back but ddnet still assumes the changed res
12:43 < bridge> <robyt3> Also kinda annoying on newer phones with round screen corners, that's why I also play on windowed mode
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that kinda looks like a bug
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but maybe SDL fails to report the change, dunno
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or we don't check for an SDL error here
13:02 < bridge> <teero777> @robyt3 is there a readme for compiling to android?
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> scripts/android
13:02 < bridge> <teero777> thx
13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ndk27 is broken for libogg, so better do exactly what the readme says xd
13:04 < bridge> <teero777> :justatest:
13:04 < bridge> <teero777> ok
13:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think it could be epic to train some llm on this channel. Imagine you can ask chat.ddnet.org ‚Äûhow to compile ddnet android‚Äú and it replies with ‚Äûscripts/android‚Äú
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> go ahead
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
13:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There is so much unsorted knowledge in here
13:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Busy doing 0.7 stuff right now. Souly found so many bugs -.-
13:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also doing llms sounds hard
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> better learn rust
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and help
13:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> help what
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> twgame integration
13:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Aren‚Äôt you done with that forever?
13:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also what about licenses?
13:07 < bridge> <soulyvevo> just finished #üë∂easyright_3
13:07 < bridge> <soulyvevo> im so good at this
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah i am mostly waiting for zwelfs decision on license xd
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> huge blocker
13:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Speaking of licenses @heinrich5991 what license should I use for a tw protocol project that contains a 1:1 packet translation into another language and a bunch of other code that‚Äôs totally clean room
13:08 < bridge> <soulyvevo> true i could barely hit quit button
13:08 < bridge> <louis> discord is already doing it ^^
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> first EU mobile player, nice
13:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes?
13:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> discord has a llm search?
13:08 < bridge> <louis> how do u harvest data? is there an irc log database?
13:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
13:09 < bridge> <louis> no, i was joking that they harvest the data for llm purpose anyways
13:09 < bridge> <soulyvevo> @jupeyy_keks how are binds handled with this
13:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes but it‚Äôs not accessible to us :(
13:09 < bridge> <louis> where link
13:09 < bridge> <soulyvevo> how do i bind deepfly for example lol
13:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> unfinished
13:09 < bridge> <robyt3> There's no way to bind anything unless you use a keyboard
13:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think the plan is to allow custom buttons
13:10 < bridge> <soulyvevo> ahh i was thinking that screentouch was treated as mouse1 or something
13:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @louis.place: https://lmddgtfy.net/?q=ddnet%20irclogs
13:11 < bridge> <robyt3> No, all buttons and touches directly execute console commands like `+fire`
13:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Speaking of licenses @heinrich5991 what license should I use for a tw protocol project that contains a 1:1 Int and packet header packer translation into another language and a bunch of other code that‚Äôs totally clean room
13:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 btw is the touch controls logic 1 frame delayed?
13:12 < bridge> <robyt3> I'd like to have a default layout that works. Then we could make some of it adjustable, e.g. enable/disable predefined buttons, change their size and position. Lastly, we could support adding additional buttons that execute any console command
13:13 < bridge> <robyt3> No, the ingame controls should be immediate
13:13 < bridge> <robyt3> UI input is delayed by two frame
13:13 < bridge> <robyt3> First frame the mouse needs to move over the element, second tick it can activate it
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so there is a update function that runs independent of rendering?
13:14 < bridge> <robyt3> No it's still coupled to the rendering code
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you mean menu UI? üòÖ
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but isnt it then 1 frame delayed?
13:15 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, menu UI always has to be delayed because of our design
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah that is fine
13:15 < bridge> <robyt3> Not sure, first the client inputs are updated, which includes the touch states, then rendering uses the touch states
13:15 < bridge> <teero777> Chiller you recently made some prototype to support live map editing maps right? Or atleast some packets that syncs the game tiles of the server to the client.
13:16 < bridge> <teero777> Chiller you recently made some prototype to support live map editing maps right? Or atleast some packets that syncs the game tiles of the server to the client to support minetee-like servermods
13:16 < bridge> <louis> yes its a pr on the ddnet github i think
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh i thought it's coupled to rendering xdd
13:16 < bridge> <sans._.> it looks better than my first try at rendering 0.7 tees lol
13:17 < bridge> <robyt3> hmm, I don't really understand the question, what's different from normal controls?
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean like that
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> SDL sends input -> we directly handle this input (in touch control's case hitting a touch btn) -> the input is already handled even a render frame is skipped (fps capped)
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 are you aware of virtual keyboard bugs?
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1245758914448851045/1265266215773798400/Screenrecorder-2024-07-23-19-03-19-228.mp4?ex=66a0e27d&is=669f90fd&hm=cdca7ebb6aed488239baf5db967dbb2f5882a7a2912d58241d8e96c2a2002397&
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> apparently only buggy in english
13:20 < bridge> <robyt3> eh, no, I decided against an event based system...
13:20 < bridge> <sans._.> Can I also play around with the mobile version to test it?
13:20 < bridge> <robyt3> but I guess it's still possible to do without it
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok
13:21 < bridge> <robyt3> yes, see download above
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can download it somewhere above

13:21 < bridge> <sans._.> neat
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the DNet version :nouis:
13:22 < bridge> <teero777> Does the server know it is handling an android client?
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dont think so, why
13:23 < bridge> <teero777> I don't know it might be useful. Some server mods might want to send different data to mobile players for the sake of playability or block mobile players entirely.
13:23 < bridge> <sans._.> Quick question, I fat fingered the editor button instead of the play button and my curved screen corners dont allow me to press the close button, what now?
13:24 < bridge> <artok_.> Why did I get banned for VPN if I never used it?
13:24 < bridge> <teero777> #‚úâ-create-a-ticket
13:24 < bridge> <sans._.> If you use a proxy like the cloudflare 1.1.1.1 app that also triggers it
13:24 < bridge> <sans._.> done it before
13:24 < bridge> <robyt3> The back-button should work like Escape, to exit the editor
13:25 < bridge> <sans._.> oh thank god
13:27 < bridge> <robyt3> Doesn't happen to me, maybe randomly also fixed by the PR above
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> possible
13:29 < bridge> <sans._.> chatting seems fine for me as well
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> will later try
13:35 < bridge> <sans._.> weird, I somehow have better ping on mobile even though im using the same network on both pc and mobile
13:35 < bridge> <sans._.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1265271123550142600/image.png?ex=66a0e70f&is=669f958f&hm=43be4083f7d2e2d941b525c2a100999f253d4fb67bd78e90c855f1e16df25a67&
13:36 < bridge> <sans._.> it doesnt look like it's just a spike, it's constantly like this, about 15ms lower
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you use wifi on both?
13:42 < bridge> <sans._.> pc is cable to router and my phone is on wifi
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then the ping might simply be wrong bcs wifi is less stable
13:42 < bridge> <sans._.> if anything pc should have lower ping
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> even if it's lower
13:42 < bridge> <sans._.> hm
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also as stupid as it sounds. cl_prediction_margin can alter the ping xD
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. cl_prediction_margin 18 on a local server gives ping 0 xD
13:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @teero777: yes I did basic mintee stuff
13:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also live map editor that‚Äôs fun
14:19 < bridge> <teero777> i was thinking of doing live map generation for gores so you can play while it is generating the map. is the pr already merged?
14:19 < bridge> <teero777> could you link it i can't find it
14:19 < bridge> <teero777> could you link it? I can't find it
14:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There is no pr yet only an issue. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna land in ddnet any time soon. Heinrich wants full demo support for it.
14:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I would just generate the map before players join.
14:26 < bridge> <teero777> the generator relies on inputs from the players. thats the unique thing about it :D
14:28 < bridge> <teero777> just pack it into a snap and handle it normally no? when someone joins all the changes to the layers could be sent at once
14:28 < bridge> <teero777> pack it into a snap and handle it normally no? when someone joins all the changes to the layers could be sent at once
14:33 < bridge> <soulyvevo> actually same for me lol
14:33 < bridge> <soulyvevo> and also better ping
14:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can‚Äôt store entire maps in the snapshot it‚Äôs too big
14:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The issue in demos is mostly the demo seek feature which also you to skip forwards and backwards in the demo to any time stamp. Joining players is something the server side can implement somehow yea that‚Äôs a bit of work but should be fine.
14:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am currently working on that a bit. I am trying to generate the full actual map and server new players a full map download instead of a diff. This way it‚Äôs also backwards compatible. But not sure if I will manage to finish it. It‚Äôs not too easy to generate full maps on the fly on the server side.
14:42 < bridge> <robo9693> you guys know where's good tutorial videos are?
14:42 < bridge> <robo9693> oops off-top

15:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @robyt3 is it assured that accessing server variables on the client works? will they get set from loading the map file, due to CFGFLAG_GAME? No variable, or modifyable way? Modders have to add it to the map? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/fe2843bb31a8acb57af2579a6983c2e06b422dc1/src/game/client/components/scoreboard.cpp#L325

17:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> getting worse every day
17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i need kde6.. my current version is beyond brocken.. if i disable compositor i have worse FPS than with compositor on xd
17:13 < bridge> <learath2> I get about 1.5k
17:13 < bridge> <learath2> That's more than I expected on an igpu
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that isnt bad for an igpu
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what is that?
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> which
17:14 < bridge> <learath2> I get 2.2k with ogl3.3 damn
17:14 < bridge> <learath2> Radeon 780M
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> APU?
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also what screen resolution do you have?
17:17 < bridge> <learath2> I think these things are considered APUs yeah it's a Ryzen 7 7840U
17:17 < bridge> <learath2> 2256x1504
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah nice not bad. can you read the power consumption?
17:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> would highly interest me
17:19 < bridge> <learath2> hm, I know how to read it but I don't have a tool that would show it to me live
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> which OS?
17:19 < bridge> <learath2> linux, gentoo
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `watch -n 1 sensors`
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> normally amd gpus have built in power meters
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno for APUs tho
17:23 < bridge> <learath2> mh sensors won't work, it's acpi on this laptop
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just tried out
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Umio-Yasuno/amdgpu_top
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i am not sure if the gpu metrics thing also uses sensors internally

17:33 < bridge> <learath2> ```
17:33 < bridge> <learath2> #!/bin/bash
17:33 < bridge> <learath2> voltage=$(cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/voltage_now)
17:33 < bridge> <learath2> current=$(cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/current_now)
17:33 < bridge> <learath2> 
17:33 < bridge> <learath2> power=$(("$voltage" * "$current"))
17:33 < bridge> <learath2> power=$(("$power" / 1000000000000))
17:33 < bridge> <learath2> 
17:33 < bridge> <learath2> echo "$power"
17:33 < bridge> <learath2> ```
17:33 < bridge> <learath2> I wrote a smol script
17:34 < bridge> <learath2> but it's total power usage not just gpu
17:39 < bridge> <learath2> ah amdgpu-top works
17:39 < bridge> <learath2> lets see
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki it's also written in rust
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just noticed lmao
17:39 < bridge> <learath2> Which one are you interested in? total power or only gpu?
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> gpu mostly
17:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> at max fps
17:42 < bridge> <learath2> about 31W
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with the gl3.3 backend?
17:42 < bridge> <learath2> same for vk and ogl
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 20W more efficient than my GPU on ~2200 fps
17:45 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder why gl is better on this machine, perhaps it's RADV being shit
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the difference is defs very huge.
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> generally i also saw that on purely GPU bound scenarios that opengl beat vulkan for me too.
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You could join a 64p server and open the scoreboard
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and see how FPS compares then
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it's much more CPU bound
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> generally speaking vulkan is not rendering faster. it just removes driver overhead (mostly CPU bound)
21:28 < bridge> <robyt3> Doesn't seem to work. Looks like we either have to patch OpenSSL to work on Android (https://stackoverflow.com/a/66926685) or wait for an upstream patch (https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/24002).
21:29 < bridge> <archimede67> @murpi (or other admins) any news on the saves being disabled?
