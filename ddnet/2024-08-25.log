01:59 < bridge_> <animepdf> generetes pretty much the same demo
01:59 < bridge_> <animepdf> a little bugged and a lot of warnings
04:49 < bridge_> <c0d3d3v> Since https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5032   automatic weapons can fire every tick instead of every 2. 
04:49 < bridge_> <c0d3d3v> here some random tries on fireball map https://streamable.com/10a6qi (as comparison with 15.9.1)  can also be seen on every fly map
04:49 < bridge_> <c0d3d3v> 
04:49 < bridge_> <c0d3d3v> Do we want to add a limit to automatic weapons so they can only fire every second tick? to get the old behaviour back?

09:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yeah it was by far the hardest tw client implementation i did so far xd
10:03 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> now finish tutorial with it
10:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yikes
10:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would need to add hook and jump and rotate aim support
10:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and also make walking smoother
10:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> all these things seem possible. But im not sure if tutorial has some tricky moves that require some fast inputs xd
10:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I probably would do other stuff first like input for chat and rcon and maybe some way to control it externally like fifo
10:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat do u trust me? xd
10:17 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> yes, please don't hack me :justatest:

10:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does it firewall russia or what?
10:20 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> ye
10:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> woah didnt know that
10:21 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> ukrainians can't connect to russians servers and vice versa

10:31 < bridge_> <jxsl13> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds-asmr
10:43 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @learath2 what's the name of the `byte [label]` operand in `mov al, byte [label]`. There're registers, immediates and dis 3rd type
10:50 < bridge_> <learath2> Memory
10:52 < bridge_> <cute_lamb_01180> And what does memory have to do with it
11:50 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Any assembly enjoyers? How the actual fuck can I use a label in instructions. For example gcc gives this code, I tried to use it and it segfaults anyway -.-

12:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> finally more players than servers in teeworlds
12:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
12:05 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> lol
12:05 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> didnt have to do the game like that
12:52 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @milkeeycat: never seen that syntax. What do you want to do? Write to the label?
12:52 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon it was segfaulting because i didn't push values first :kek:
12:53 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> and `[label]` syntax works for writing and reading
12:53 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> it has weird syntax if you need an address of a label
12:53 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> `offset label`
12:53 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> What‚Äôs label[register] syntax
12:54 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> it's rip relative access or something
12:54 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> but it works without, so why use it xd
12:54 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Xd
13:19 < bridge_> <learath2> Rip relative addressing results in smaller instructions and thus reduced code size

15:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i coded this feature almost one year ago.
15:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> today was the first time i ever tested it üòÑ
15:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1277262139140083723/image.png?ex=66cc8690&is=66cb3510&hm=88f3d813bb980a267449997ac285fd3cb8df3f3a02dedb96dc3000f901379a09&
15:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> feelsamazing
15:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> should pickups show the texture of the nearest character, or should it simply show the texture of what you picked? üòÑ
15:50 < bridge_> <louis> is that splitscreen?
15:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no that are two clients
15:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> splitscreen works too, but i dont have controller support
15:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so it's useless rn xD
15:51 < bridge_> <louis> oh okay üòπ wdym pickups?
15:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah my left char has a different texture for the weapon
15:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> question now is
15:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1277264183594844270/image.png?ex=66cc8877&is=66cb36f7&hm=8d73e933eeeccd9a9231e30ea7eed9c16f71c7c99829fa0fcfdf95b827ddf468&
15:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> will it take the local one
15:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or the closest character üòÑ
15:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> basically game.png customization is send to the server too, similar to how it works for skins
15:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if the other client has it too, then he sees it
15:52 < bridge_> <louis> ahhh weapon skins
15:52 < bridge_> <louis> i thought that was a new weapon or smth idk why
15:53 < bridge_> <louis> shouldnt it show default nade or at least local skin
15:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sure that is one option. another would be the texture of the closest character
15:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i kinda like that too üòÑ
15:53 < bridge_> <louis> also do you think game.png should to be split up into individual images?
15:53 < bridge_> <louis> imagine some weird tele setup making a seizure nade
15:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah true xD
15:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh very very hard question.
15:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in dd-pg it will probably allow both, but for a different reason
15:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> audio customization is not global anymore, but per weapon
15:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so audio can sound different too
15:54 < bridge_> <louis> or it shows the texture of the last person to pick it up, would be cool but a little gimmicky
15:54 < bridge_> <louis> dope
15:54 < bridge_> <louis> hire me as sound designed
15:54 < bridge_> <louis> hire me as sound designer
15:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you are hired
15:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
15:55 < bridge_> <louis> need custom particles at that point too though
15:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @louis.place you are the only person to have ever tested dd-pg besides chiller i think xD
15:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 4 months left until first release üò¨
15:58 < bridge_> <louis> will u reign as overlord maintainer
15:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao, in best case other maintainers like the project.
15:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i need to slow down at some point again xd
16:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> takes insane amount of time
16:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in worst case nobody likes it and it dies and everything was wasted xDDD
16:00 < bridge_> <louis> is strong fixed in ur version?
16:01 < bridge_> <louis> fix strong/weak, allow unranked map pool, custom weapon assets, and there will be a community üòπ
16:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my version allows to modify the physics as a WASM module. so in my vanilla version i actually think about removing weak hook.
16:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but for the ddnet part, it will probably stay for compatibility
16:01 < bridge_> <louis> and add sandevistan powerup (free idea)
16:11 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: my refactor went a little bit wrong(those numbers are errors count)
16:11 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1277269148128252015/image.png?ex=66cc8d17&is=66cb3b97&hm=bc443c0cb5a48009df7efb3d4ef70982d7441c852198d8e14d5ff28e40ef34d2&

16:38 < bridge_> <jxsl13> kinda wondering why restarting my server takes forever for the master server to register. Restart -> search -> not finding it at all üòÆ
16:39 < bridge_> <matodor> tee pets? :poggers:
16:39 < bridge_> <jxsl13> weird caching going on?

16:41 < bridge_> <Peakies> that screenshot is for 5 or 6 years ago
16:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just breaking backcompat must feel great
16:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
16:42 < bridge_> <matodor> this server has 0.7 support?
16:43 < bridge_> <Peakies> no it's ddnet based
16:43 < bridge_> <Peakies> I never work on 0.7
16:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet supports 0.7
16:46 < bridge_> <jxsl13> weird issues on my side
16:46 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> yikes errors catto
16:46 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> now it's better, not 68 & 61  but 22 & 75
16:47 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> imagine if it's not just showing other errors because there're a lot of them already
16:47 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> ?? wdym does the compiler count as dependency now? You can also just download the release then you dont depend on the compiler anymore
16:48 < bridge_> <Peakies> yeah but I meant that my server isn't pure 0.7 it's implemented on ddnet 0.6

18:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> lag setup
18:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> maybe it can just be a setting
19:20 < bridge_> <0xdeen> We have some mechanism for moving players to another server, right? I haven't looked into it, but could we move people there who want to play Linear instead of having them take up all empty servers?
19:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> Not as far as I know
19:22 < bridge_> <0xdeen> Too bad, not sure what an easy technical solution to this would be
19:22 < bridge_> <0xdeen> @texnonik Make a video to show players how to find existing servers with their map please
19:22 < bridge_> <_gwendal> I'm pretty sure there were some block servers that were moving players to other servers ?
19:24 < bridge_> <robyt3> Redirecting works for servers with the same IP. If we host some servers with only Linear we could redirect clients to those when they vote the map, we just don't have any way to redirect from votes yet.
19:24 < bridge_> <hynne2_44238> can anyone tell me why ger10 isin't working for me
19:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> I think it would be cool if ddnet servers could just fork themselves when voting (up until a defined maximum). add a new type of map vote that will move anyone who presses f3 to the new server, and a command to join the last detached vote if u missed it
19:44 < bridge_> <texnonik> I have done it already.
19:44 < bridge_> <texnonik> They just look for one video linear with rocket video . :kek:
19:45 < bridge_> <texnonik> I have done it already.
19:45 < bridge_> <texnonik> They just look for one video linear with rocket . :kek:
19:54 < bridge_> <zhn> its possible but what if player wants to join empty server and change map :justatest:
19:56 < bridge_> <melo∆û> annoying popup "a server with this map already exists - do you want to go there?"
20:05 < bridge_> <Pepsicola_o0> will be better to have more servers but with less limit of players? Idk what with server performance in that case.
20:07 < bridge_> <Pepsicola_o0> For ex 10 servers with 63 limit, 20 servers with 32 limit
20:07 < bridge_> <Pepsicola_o0> And if map is popular (linear) dynamically increase max limit
20:22 < bridge_> <reitw> there's a tile on ddnet for that
20:22 < bridge_> <reitw> asked for it and I think ChillerDragon did it
20:23 < bridge_> <reitw> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6914
20:26 < bridge_> <reitw> Ah prob not a tile, forgot how it has been implemented
20:53 < bridge_> <jxsl13> @ChillerDragin: https://github.com/ddnet-insta/ddnet-insta/issues/114
20:54 < bridge_> <jxsl13> might make sense to test that on ddnet as well, whether the latest master branch can successully register with the master servers
20:58 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> ok now there're 150 errors in one file :poggers2:

21:01 < bridge_> <robyt3> # New Android beta version!
21:01 < bridge_> <robyt3> 
21:01 < bridge_> <robyt3> See https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8632 for details. The controls are now adjustable, although you will need to use an external text editor for it:
21:02 < bridge_> <robyt3> 
21:02 < bridge_> <robyt3> 1. Export the touch configuration to the clipboard.
21:02 < bridge_> <robyt3> 2. Save the clipboard to a file so you can easily edit it (you should also do this to have a backup of your configuration in case you need to reinstall the app!).

21:02 < bridge_> <robyt3> 
21:02 < bridge_> <.puch> did you test it?
21:02 < bridge_> <.puch> cause im experiencing the same too
21:03 < bridge_> <jxsl13> I updated today to the latest ddnet-insta master version
21:03 < bridge_> <.puch> ok nice üôÇ
21:03 < bridge_> <jxsl13> and my servers were not able to register
21:03 < bridge_> <.puch> when I relaunch the server it works
21:03 < bridge_> <.puch> but then few hours later it's not working
21:03 < bridge_> <.puch> or the next day
21:03 < bridge_> <jxsl13> I relaunched them multiple times
21:04 < bridge_> <jxsl13> did not work for me
21:04 < bridge_> <jxsl13> might be master server caching
21:04 < bridge_> <jxsl13> of the previous version
21:04 < bridge_> <.puch> strange cause on 0.7 I see them
21:04 < bridge_> <.puch> on ddnet I don't see
21:04 < bridge_> <jxsl13> yeah, 0.7 seems not to be affected
21:04 < bridge_> <jxsl13> 0.6 only
21:05 < bridge_> <.puch> and it does that with other normal ddnet servers?
21:05 < bridge_> <jxsl13> dunno
21:05 < bridge_> <jxsl13> did not test
21:10 < bridge_> <.puch> i tlooks like chillerdragon bridge servers are working now
21:12 < bridge_> <jxsl13> ddnet deems to be unaffected
21:13 < bridge_> <jxsl13> does not seem to be the case
21:13 < bridge_> <jxsl13> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1277345146148753498/Bildschirmfoto_2024-08-25_um_21.12.55.png?ex=66ccd3de&is=66cb825e&hm=60336664ea23b801055305469245f39999031c33c49401d8de9b7ac1a1e02c37&
21:13 < bridge_> <jxsl13> 0.6 is clickable
21:14 < bridge_> <jxsl13> chiller's servers seem to only be visible via 0.7 master servers
21:14 < bridge_> <jxsl13> ddnet deems to be unaffected - tested it just now
21:15 < bridge_> <jxsl13> hm, I can find them ingame with ddnet client üòÆ
21:18 < bridge_> <jxsl13> if you want to fix your servers @.puch , you can go into the ddnet-insta source code folder
21:18 < bridge_> <jxsl13> execute `git checkout 44666c21f76cfe6a9cbee16f5ab44ab592662bcd`

21:20 < bridge_> <jxsl13> ddnet seems to be unaffected - tested it just now
21:20 < bridge_> <.puch> ty
21:21 < bridge_> <.puch> i put back an old branch infact
21:21 < bridge_> <RedRay32> I think he uses whitelist as opposed to blacklist
21:21 < bridge_> <.puch> could I keep my old build?
21:22 < bridge_> <.puch> i will move it somewhere else
21:22 < bridge_> <jxsl13> you can do whatever you want
21:22 < bridge_> <jxsl13> x)
21:22 < bridge_> <jxsl13> I deleted mine
21:22 < bridge_> <jxsl13> so I had to find a working version
21:22 < bridge_> <melo∆û> @_noby stop gatekeeping mobile users!
21:22 < bridge_> <.puch> but you know @jxsl13 the build was working perfectly
21:22 < bridge_> <.puch> something changed with the master
21:23 < bridge_> <.puch> or the way we address the master idk
21:23 < bridge_> <.puch> idk how chiller build it
21:23 < bridge_> <.puch> idk how chiller built it
21:23 < bridge_> <jxsl13> the 0.7 compatibility prs of chiller might have broken something, dunno ._.
21:23 < bridge_> <melo∆û> <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
21:28 < bridge_> <jxsl13> don't do that xD
21:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> LET'S GO
21:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u don't do x86 & x64 build, does it fit into one upload?
21:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 7z sounds hard on mobile xD
21:35 < bridge_> <jxsl13> one correct cmmit hash might be 8462149c26ae3a60d74e621dd8f20490f99a9a91 the other one was pointing to ddrace source, not gctf/insta
21:35 < bridge_> <jxsl13> one correct commit hash might be 8462149c26ae3a60d74e621dd8f20490f99a9a91 the other one was pointing to ddrace source, not gctf/insta
21:36 < bridge_> <.puch> i was compiling rn
21:36 < bridge_> <.puch> xd
21:36 < bridge_> <.puch> üò™
21:36 < bridge_> <Peakies> work fine on A55 64 but temperature is a bit higher than I expected for DDNet don't know maybe it's normal
21:37 < bridge_> <robyt3> You could try setting the client update rate lower I guess, the default uses maximum power
21:37 < bridge_> <„ÇÄ„Åé> how do i extract apk? why both files? more details in the tutorial please
21:37 < bridge_> <jxsl13> sometimes it's good not to be on the bleeding edge latest version üòÑ
21:38 < bridge_> <Peakies> oh right didn't check that I'll check later
21:38 < bridge_> <robyt3> It's a 7z file split into two because discord does not allow uploading files larger than ~75MiB
21:38 < bridge_> <„ÇÄ„Åé> ah i see
21:38 < bridge_> <.puch> @jxsl13 wtf my server is on again
21:38 < bridge_> <.puch> I didn't launch it
21:38 < bridge_> <.puch> i did nothing
21:38 < bridge_> <.puch> wtf is that
21:39 < bridge_> <jxsl13> :o?
21:39 < bridge_> <jxsl13> caching?
21:39 < bridge_> <jxsl13> restart client?
21:39 < bridge_> <.puch> nothing i was just compiling the first branch
21:39 < bridge_> <.puch> nothing i was just compiling the first commit
21:39 < bridge_> <.puch> nothing i was just compiling the first commit you sent
21:40 < bridge_> <.puch> and I moved the build folder to another place
21:40 < bridge_> <.puch> this is master sorcery
21:41 < bridge_> <.puch> writing to a log file was the bug? xd
21:42 < bridge_> <„ÇÄ„Åé> oh so u meant just extract first archive, cuz i didnt understand "use 7zip on the first file" :justatest:
21:42 < bridge_> <robyt3> yeah, these are ARM and ARM64 only
21:42 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1277352378357518367/DDNet-arm-arm64.apk?ex=66ccda9b&is=66cb891b&hm=2bfd6b3ddab8e9bc406d3b8adc457e4e0b84ef0d3976a551a05fc758b77abada&
21:42 < bridge_> <jxsl13> that commit is one month old
21:42 < bridge_> <jxsl13> it's just one commit before chiller merged ddnet into ddnet-insta
21:43 < bridge_> <robyt3> You need to download both, then instruct 7z to extract the first file, it will find the second file automatically
21:43 < bridge_> <Peakies> last file was fine on arm-v8a
21:43 < bridge_> <„ÇÄ„Åé> yes i got it, no need for 7z tho?
21:43 < bridge_> <„ÇÄ„Åé> i just used my explorer
21:43 < bridge_> <robyt3> yeah, the 7z archive above contains all 4 arches, the APK above is only for ARM
21:43 < bridge_> <Peakies> oh okey
21:44 < bridge_> <robyt3> all 4 arches are too large for discord upload though
21:44 < bridge_> <Peakies> yeah it is
21:44 < bridge_> <robyt3> depends on your OS I guess, I don't think Windows has native 7z support
21:45 < bridge_> <„ÇÄ„Åé> not native explorer :ML_meme_facepalm:
21:45 < bridge_> <„ÇÄ„Åé> im on android using mixplorer
21:45 < bridge_> <Peakies> is it possible to add two button ? one for quick access to kill/respawn on in game view and a button to reopen keyboard when chat or console is open
21:46 < bridge_> <robyt3> yes, you can edit the buttons now, export to json, edit and import again
21:46 < bridge_> <Peakies> it's mean we can add any kind of bind that we want to main screen right ?
21:46 < bridge_> <robyt3> I also thought about this for keyboard but I haven't found a convenient way to reopen the keyboard with SDL
21:47 < bridge_> <robyt3> yeah, you can add any kind of bind to the ingame touch controls now
21:48 < bridge_> <Peakies> hmm if there isn't any kind of way to reopen keyboard with SDL then by reponing for example chat keyboard will show up again ?
21:48 < bridge_> <Peakies> nice thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
21:49 < bridge_> <robyt3> I guess stopping and immediately restarting text input could be a workaround
21:51 < bridge_> <Peakies> yeah I was thinking about that stopping and refresh last clicked input(chat, console, etc)
21:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice add to your original msg üòÑ
21:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a link
21:53 < bridge_> <robyt3> # New Android beta version!
21:53 < bridge_> <robyt3> 
21:53 < bridge_> <robyt3> See https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8632 for details. The controls are now adjustable, although you will need to use an external text editor for it:
21:54 < bridge_> <robyt3> 
21:54 < bridge_> <robyt3> 1. Export the touch configuration to the clipboard.
21:54 < bridge_> <robyt3> 2. Save the clipboard to a file so you can easily edit it (you should also do this to have a backup of your configuration in case you need to reinstall the app!).
21:54 < bridge_> <robyt3> 3. Edit the configuration (see link above for details about the format).
21:54 < bridge_> <robyt3> 4. Copy it to the clipboard and import it in the client again. If the configuration could not be loaded, check the local console for error messages containing `touch_controls` and fix it accordingly.
21:54 < bridge_> <robyt3> 5. Save the changes in the client when you are done. You can also discard your changes or revert to the default if you messed up.

22:56 < bridge_> <0xdeen> Is there a dump file? Upload it here

22:56 < bridge_> <k1tblyaat> Mobile
22:58 < bridge_> <k1tblyaat> What should I do if the new version of ddnet mobile crashes?
22:59 < bridge_> <jxsl13> ddnet mobile
23:09 < bridge_> <zhn> watafak, 86 mbytes
23:09 < bridge_> <zhn> current linux release is 46 mbytes afair
23:15 < bridge_> <robyt3> The assets alone are around 45 MiB packed. Every arch also contains the respective libraries. I tried different linkers but that didn't make any difference on the size. The default APK zip compression is also pretty bad.
23:16 < bridge_> <zhn> wait but its arm(64) only build
23:16 < bridge_> <robyt3> ARM and ARM64
23:16 < bridge_> <zhn> yeah but do assets replicate?
23:17 < bridge_> <robyt3> Assets are not replicated, every arch adds around 22 MiB to the packed size
23:17 < bridge_> <zhn> woah
23:17 < bridge_> <zhn> sounds fair, android development sucks ig :justatest:
23:18 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1277376476618035270/image.png?ex=66ccf10c&is=66cb9f8c&hm=6a76b809f3877ded43cf55a39430a2f163ad275840ea3e0eb0e71884f2fc24a1&
23:18 < bridge_> <zhn> do they contain ddnet-client + libs only?
23:18 < bridge_> <zhn> its way too heavy to imagine :justatest:
23:19 < bridge_> <robyt3> yeah, no server, no video recorder
23:20 < bridge_> <zhn> fatty.apk
