01:29 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> man I install a whole lot of packages to use virt-manager (with qemu) and stuff and the performance is awful (running ubuntu guest). I should've just installed ubuntu baremetal to begin with :(
01:31 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> welp time to do that while deleting all the previously installed packages xD
01:39 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym awful
01:39 < bridge> <Ewan> is your host configured properly
01:40 < bridge> <Ewan> and what is the guest
01:40 < bridge> <kekomonter> $sh sudo xd sure chillerbot.png is lyfe
01:40 < chillerbot> sudo: a password is required
01:40 < bridge> <kekomonter> :(
01:43 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I mean it lagged on mouse movement. It couldn't run UE5 as I had hoped it would. Yeah the host was configured via virt-manager. and the guest was ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS
01:46 < bridge> <Ewan> well did u install guest drivers? lol
01:46 < bridge> <Ewan> you sorta need those
01:46 < bridge> <Ewan> also what protocol are u using
01:46 < bridge> <Ewan> spice or qemu
01:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> spice
01:47 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> is qemu a protocol? I didn't find any info on it
01:47 < bridge> <Ewan> no but it’s a different pipeline to graphics output
01:47 < bridge> <Ewan> anyway get spice guest tools
01:48 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds like it’s software rendering rn if the mouse is slow and unreal engine won’t even start
01:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I didn't try UE5 as it would require further configuration and I felt like I could just install it baremetal
01:49 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> also I wanted to troubleshoot a problem another person had on ubuntu so ig running it in a vm wouldn't reproduce it very well
01:49 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s just installing drivers like you’d have to do on a real system too
01:50 < bridge> <Ewan> as far as the guest is concerned it has no gpu
01:52 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> welp, I already uninstalled most of the packages 😅. I appreciate the help and hints. I'll be sure to remember them next time I try out vm :)
01:55 < bridge> <Ewan> :what:
01:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I rq-ed too fast after trying virt-manager/qemu for 2 days
02:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> did voxel rq
02:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah :(
02:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> why

07:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> would look weird I think. Might look like 3 different lines then
08:11 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hi, i have a question. what snapping means in programing and in ddnet code, i see it in every header, but i don't understand it
08:13 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> which snap and why , i don't get the snapping in general
08:19 < bridge> <sedonya> It seems to be what the server transmits to the client and vice versa
08:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is this all it's doing ?
08:25 < bridge> <sedonya> In theory
08:25 < bridge> <sedonya> For example, a client’s snap sends its nickname, clan tag, skin, etc. to the server
08:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually i think thats a simple packet not a snap
08:27 < bridge> <sedonya> I don’t know, if I said something wrong, please correct me
08:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> in ddnet u "send" always a packet for a given value, but the server will only send the packet if the value changes
08:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> snap means snapshot
08:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> a snaphot of the given moment
08:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> for example in the character code
08:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> you always "snap" aka "snapshot" the tee position, but there are underlying mechanisms to that a packet is only sent if the position changed
08:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> thanka for coming to my ted talk
08:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> (mobile suxs)
08:38 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and the snapping client is the client who have changed ?
08:38 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
08:38 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> void CPlayer::Snap(int SnappingClient)
08:38 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
08:39 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> this is smart
08:39 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> makes sense
08:41 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and the SnappingClient is the client who have changed or need to be shown the changes?
08:41 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
08:41 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> void CPlayer::Snap(int SnappingClient)
08:41 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
08:43 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> snapping is smart
08:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Nice vote channel
08:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Didn't know u can do such things in discord xd
09:18 < ChillerDragon> `SnappingClient` is the client that receives the snap not what changed
09:19 < ChillerDragon> the snap is basically a net message like all the others sending state about the game. The special thing about the snap is that it is sent super frequently but not in full. So if an item in the snap did not change it is not being resend
09:20 < ChillerDragon> thats why a bunch of moving tees is much more bandwidth than a bunch of ideling tees
09:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Snapchat 👻
09:21 < ChillerDragon> but thats me nerding out on the protocol level. What you need to know as a server dev is. ``SnappingClient`` is whoever gets the snap so you can craft a custom snap for that player and you can basically inset snap items from all over the codebase and the engine will bundle and send it for you magically
09:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
09:21 < ChillerDragon> @mamad_melanin
09:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> chiller, are you free today at some point?
09:23 < ChillerDragon> @sedonya only the server sends snaps. The way the client sends data is via other net messages
09:23 < ChillerDragon> i got 5min now fokko
09:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> still in a meeting
09:24 < bridge> <sedonya> Thx, but there's a snap function in the client too
09:24 < ChillerDragon> i guess to read the data
09:24 < ChillerDragon> idk which code u mean
09:24 < bridge> <sedonya> client.cpp
09:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @sedonya there is a OnSnap
09:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i think
09:25 < bridge> <sedonya> Ah, ty
09:25 < ChillerDragon> sedoyna sure the client is full of snap code to read it but not to send it
09:25 < ChillerDragon> and it also has to keep track of the deltas and shit
09:25 < bridge> <sedonya> Got it, thanks
09:26 < ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut we should rename Tick to Tik then we have snapchat and tiktok memes
09:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> OnTik
09:26 < ChillerDragon> xd
09:26 < ChillerDragon> looks funny af
09:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ```
09:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut> OnTik() {
09:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut>   Tok();
09:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut> }```
09:27 < ChillerDragon> ok 5min over dragon bak to work -.-

09:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> enjoy holding your pee
09:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ye
09:36 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i kinda get the snapping now
09:44 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> maybe
09:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ask questions, if you need

10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
10:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> wot xd
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> i discovered u can use distcc on windows but only with msys shell

10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> with posix wrapper runtime
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
10:13 < bridge> <Ewan> or cygwin obv but that shit sux
10:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> that sounds unholy
10:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://tenor.com/view/cyberfigther-smoker-cybsmoker-ddnet-cybop-gif-25893630
10:13 < bridge> <Ewan> means i cant use it for mingw64 or ucrt64 shell builds
10:13 < bridge> <Ewan> cant choose runtime
10:13 < bridge> <Ewan> but it’s better than nothing if the other compilers in the network can also target it
10:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn its cold
10:14 < bridge> <Ewan> can also static link the msys runtime iirc
10:14 < bridge> <Ewan> no more za for u?
10:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> si
10:14 < bridge> <Ewan> y quit
10:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> wanted to
10:14 < bridge> <Ewan> fair enough
10:14 < bridge> <Ewan> gets expensive
10:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xdxd
10:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i dont care about the money
10:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i care about myself thats why
10:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> and no matter what you say, it's simply better to do breaks, every day u dont consume anything is a good day xD So... But nicotine is tough one
10:15 < bridge> <Ewan> true
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> never rly done nic long term because that shit sucks
10:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i think there is a study on why intelligent people consume nicotine
10:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> brain stimulating and shit
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s a stim yea
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> ulant
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> clarity
10:16 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> just get a lung infection like me and you're forced to quit - works 7/10 times :justatest:
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> how
10:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i think i'd like to avoid that
10:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i doubt highly
10:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i'd recommend you do
10:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think they consume the one that makes u hyper focus
10:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> how is it called
10:17 < bridge> <Ewan> adderall?
10:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> adderall
10:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
10:17 < bridge> <Ewan> nicotine is not the same by any means but it behaves similarly for most ppl
10:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> well, it's amphe
10:18 < bridge> <learath2> Just don’t smoke cigarettes, 0/10 high, not worth rolling the dice for
10:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ofc, its always better to not put anything besides air into your lungs
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> u have effectively deterred me from stepping out onto the balcony rn
10:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> but your statement "0/10 high" is subjective. i personally like the rush
10:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye dont smoke
10:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> u will lose teeth
10:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> heart issues
10:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> pulmonary cancer
10:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> its all bad
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> respiratory issues mainly
10:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u dont look cool
10:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> u smell bad
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> copd and lung cancer
10:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft my father lost teeth to smoking
10:19 < bridge> <learath2> There is only one reason to smoke cigarettes. It looks cool and it’s the best social lubricant known to man
10:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ryo vs lerato
10:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> looks not cool vs looks cool
10:20 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> since i stopped smoking (obv. withdrawals are mentally, no physically) nicotine pouches helped me a fuckton
10:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> good job stopping!
10:20 < bridge> <Ewan> https://youtu.be/90y9m0OGr4s?si=H7ZyqGlFYEuIrGT_
10:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> how old are u btw?
10:20 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> me? something between 20-30 :justatest:
10:20 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i can imagine, but tbh that's your physical addiction
10:20 < bridge> <Ewan> do u chew them
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> why u shy xd we all 20-30 here
10:21 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:

10:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Who of you drinks coffee?
10:24 < bridge> <learath2> I tried nicotine gum at various strengths to see if there is any reason to smoke and I’ve concluded that it linearly increases my dizziness and gives me a faint caffeine like effect. Easily the most pointless thing I ever tried 😄
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i coffee
10:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> smoke more
10:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i personally dont drink coffee, for example
10:25 < bridge> <Ewan> y not
10:25 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Jupstar is the kind of person who did these
10:25 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
10:25 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 1 5 3 x 5 = find x
10:25 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> puzzles
10:25 < bridge> <learath2> I love covfefe
10:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> my caffeine tolerance is low, one energy is too much for me. I drink a small can of cola and it's perfect for me. plus a cigarette: forcus
10:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> focus
10:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i c
10:25 < bridge> <Ewan> soda sucks
10:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> im drinking coffee
10:25 < bridge> <Ewan> and u can increase ur tolerance in a matter of days and as long as you keep it in control then it’s good
10:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i'm one of the few in the office to not drink coffee
10:26 < bridge> <learath2> Na, tobacco in general makes me nauseous and I don’t like nicotines effect. Literally 0 reason for me to except maybe as social lubricant
10:26 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> im enjoying my cappuccino right now
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 🍵 🚰
10:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i c
10:26 < bridge> <Ewan> all we have rn is shitty hotel room coffee
10:26 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i would love to have a lower tolerance, im drinking more coffee than water
10:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> why u in hotel
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :banhammer: ☕
10:26 < bridge> <Ewan> mom’s idea of vacation
10:26 < bridge> <Ewan> 5 ppl in a hotel room for 2 days
10:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i didn’t want to hurt her feelings so i went
10:27 < bridge> <louis> why not alcohol instead
10:27 < bridge> <learath2> In another country atleast?
10:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut> friend of mine drinks like a few coffee a day, then like 2-3 energy, some iced tea, and some normal tea in the evening haha. And smokes weed xD
10:27 < bridge> <Ewan> no it’s 1 hour away in a worse part of the state
10:27 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> this guy basically runs on stimulants lol
10:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut> this guy basically is stupid
10:27 < bridge> <Ewan> but hey there’s a water park….
10:27 < bridge> <Ewan> i have little brothers
10:27 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> fair enough
10:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut> like not stupid stupid, but his behaviour
10:27 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds like me before a few months ago
10:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> i kicked the caffeine
10:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> good for you
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> :owo:
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> never quit anything else so can’t compare
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> but it sucked
10:28 < bridge> <learath2> I do do alcoholism sometimes
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> at that level at least
10:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> btw guys, i am currently working on a small website as a birthday present for my soon to be girlfriend c:
10:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> VueJS
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> not awesome
10:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i like vue
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> didnt u have a gf already
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> vanilla ftw
10:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> we use it at work, so i am used to it
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> or u mean wife
10:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i broke up with her like 4 months ago haha
10:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
10:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> she was... toxic
10:29 < bridge> <learath2> Normal humans get them every other day
10:29 < bridge> <Ewan> y
10:29 < bridge> <learath2> It’s the cycle
10:29 < bridge> <louis> no
10:29 < bridge> <Ewan> i have not had gf for yrs at this point
10:29 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont get out
10:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> actually, in the meantime i didnt have anyone (and didnt want)
10:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> but i feel very secured with this person
10:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> and so does she
10:29 < bridge> <learath2> Do you watch anime?
10:29 < bridge> <Ewan> no
10:30 < bridge> <Ewan> nowhere to meet ppl
10:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> you guys just need to step outside a little more. Get a tinder profile, simply meet up, drink a coffee, take a walk, and get to know. it's literally not as hard as it sounds
10:30 < bridge> <learath2> Ok you have to make sure you never do that one. Software development and anime is impossible to recover from
10:30 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> tinder intimidating
10:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yea, there is a lot of bullshit going on
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> im too fresh
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> they will make rugs out of me
10:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> and i had to wait quite some time to find her
10:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> but its possible
10:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> you can actually find really genuine persons there
10:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> *can
10:31 < bridge> <learath2> In the last 3 weeks, I have only spent 3 days inside my home and 4 nights. It’s not a quantity thing. Seems other people are wired different
10:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> You introverted?
10:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I'm positive there are girls who'd like you
10:32 < bridge> <Ewan> i probably spend 14 of every 15 days and nights at home
10:32 < bridge> <Ewan> in the bedroom on the computer
10:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> besides that i'll always believe that a person will always find the perfect match. no matter how long it takes
10:33 < bridge> <learath2> Depends on how you define that word. I won’t go up to random people and try to interact with them, so I guess yes?
10:33 < bridge> <learath2> Oh wait, this is #developer LOL
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i do not like the introverted/extroverted thing
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i have traits from both
10:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> same
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i like being around other ppl
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> most of the time
10:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> pigeonhole thinking is always bad
10:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> but it's good to get a first view and to sort your brain a little
10:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> im shy at first but i open
10:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
10:34 < bridge> <learath2> You have big arms now, you need to replace your personality
10:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> nah
10:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> girls dfont care
10:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> (h*es)
10:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> women do
10:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> what does h*es mean
10:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
10:35 < bridge> <Ewan> hoes
10:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> o
10:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> why u censor thats stupid
10:35 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
10:35 < bridge> <learath2> LOL
10:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> for heino
10:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> idk
10:36 < bridge> <Ewan> heinrich asleep post unrelated awesome media
10:36 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1193850595266797638/Screenshot_20240107_035356_Firefox.jpg?ex=65ae3702&is=659bc202&hm=200b3e1be131847d53945d581179daa2738a57fbc43d1cca391d55dc3a781e32&
10:36 < bridge> <learath2> No need to bother with that. When heinrich shows up we are all toast anyway for making this channel into #off-topic
10:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ha ha
10:36 < bridge> <louis> "please don't refer to groups of people using derogatory terms."
10:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> literally made ma laugh a little @learath2
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> dev is the true offtopic anyway
10:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ye
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> hein will ban me for showing arm :justatest::owo:
10:36 < bridge> <Ewan> ryo why tela doesn’t have wiki role if he wrote the binds page
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can say its just my "arm" processor kek
10:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> nudity @ryozuki
10:37 < bridge> <learath2> But yes, ngl that sounds a little bigoted
10:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it's simply. there's girls who are serious and who are genuine, and there's the other ones.
10:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it's not easy in this fucked world to find real women
10:38 < bridge> <Ewan> prob takes them a while to chill out I wouldn’t say they’re not real just not serious yet
10:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> they all have brain damage from instagram
10:38 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
10:38 < bridge> <learath2> We all have brain damage from all social media
10:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> true
10:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i experienced talking to a 19y girl, and she definitly had weird worldviews
10:38 < bridge> <louis> cap
10:38 < bridge> <louis> u could say the exact same about men
10:38 < bridge> <louis> ngl
10:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
10:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i was about to type that out
10:39 < bridge> <Ewan> depends on ur exposure
10:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> like working for a boss was smth weak ppl do or shit like that
10:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> but i didnt
10:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> and ur a sheep
10:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think she was toxic af
10:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ye
10:39 < bridge> <louis> lmfao
10:39 < bridge> <learath2> Interacting with true zoomers is bizarre, truly an experience
10:39 < bridge> <Ewan> if u a dude u usually talk to dudes and vice versa. not like they are scarce but a romantic partner is not always gonna jump out at u
10:39 < bridge> <louis> i cant count the amount of online course selling fake entrepreneurs on instagram
10:40 < bridge> <learath2> It is though. You need to hustle and make passive income and get a lambo
10:40 < bridge> <Ewan> was finna say it’s a little sussy ong
10:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> what i find really funny and interesting about other people is, that no matter whether someone is older or younger than another person you compare them to, they can be like 100 times further cognitively. There are so many differences in persons and matureness etc. Keep looking out for those, don't waste your time
10:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> but lately im talking to one my age and it feels like a normal convo xd
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think i wouldnt go out with someone who isnt working and knowing how to live by themselves
10:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> it changes u and makes u a better person
10:41 < bridge> <Ewan> i talk to u and don’t feel much of an age gap unless we are talking about life
10:41 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :D
10:41 < bridge> <learath2> I would go out with a bowl of pebbles if it asked me out first
10:42 < bridge> <Ewan> respect yourself
10:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> fr learath, you have some issues
10:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i mean you know it
10:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> but its obvious to others
10:42 < bridge> <learath2> Ofc I have issues. I actually enjoy writing C99
10:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> note that going out and a hookup is different xd
10:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> XD
10:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
10:43 < bridge> <fokkonaut> me personally i dont really like hookups
10:43 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1193852393637560341/image.png?ex=65ae38af&is=659bc3af&hm=4064b86ebebc783efd6241fde430b778f85b4733a3130b18610e628c40d22984&
10:43 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i want to get to know a person a little
10:43 < bridge> <fokkonaut> before jumping straight into it
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeye same
10:43 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> oi man i go take a shower for 10 minutes and come back to 130 new messages °-°
10:43 < bridge> <Ewan> fast shower
10:43 < bridge> <fokkonaut> dont shower
10:43 < bridge> <Ewan> are ur ears clean
10:43 < bridge> <learath2> Being picky is a privilege reserved for people that don’t know the sections of the c99 standard by heart
10:43 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ofc!
10:43 < bridge> <Ewan> difference between being picky and not having standards
10:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> but the trick to getting them is having self respect too
10:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> nobody likes desperate ppl
10:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> so its a self losing thing
10:44 < bridge> <Ewan> mostly only abusers and otherwise emotionally unsavory or manipulative people date desperate ppl
10:44 < bridge> <Ewan> bcs they will just sit there and take it
10:44 < bridge> <Ewan> bcs they think it’s better than being single
10:44 < bridge> <louis> pro tip: smile more
10:45 < bridge> <Ewan> bro how
10:45 < bridge> <Ewan> only thing i can do for that is get high
10:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> what
10:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Also, people tend to choose their partners based on what they know from childhood for example. Because that's what their brain recognizes. Bad patterns, etc.
10:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not that hard
10:45 < bridge> <learath2> Just do it. That one is simple, even I know that
10:45 < bridge> <Ewan> I can not force a smile without it being painfully obvious and awkward
10:46 < bridge> <Ewan> obv i will naturally smile as my neurons activate in public which happens all the time when ur talking to ppl but making urself smile more isn’t easy
10:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> just think about rust
10:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> then u will smile
10:47 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> friend of mine once told me not to force a smile, but dont stop one when its coming
10:47 < bridge> <learath2> Think of how memory safe it is
10:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
10:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> 😄
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> good advice
10:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> BLAZINGLY FAST
10:47 < bridge> <learath2> How fearlessly you can do concurrency
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> voxel is rolling in his grave
10:47 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i used the sqlx crate today - i am in love
10:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> epyc
10:47 < bridge> <learath2> Ngl it is a 10/10 crate
10:48 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> its SOOO good
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr sqlx + axum + tokio
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> + mako
10:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> dats what im doing rm :santatrollet:
10:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> When will he come back? His blood pressure is falling too much without this awesome chat
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> wait not mako
10:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> dats what im doing rn :santatrollet:
10:48 < bridge> <learath2> I’m boycotting tokio until they get condvars

10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> for cache
10:48 < bridge> <Ewan> i hope he doesn’t come back until he regulates his brain chemicals
10:48 < bridge> <learath2> Sorry, that gif was giving me the creeps
10:48 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
10:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xD
10:49 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> did you know professional cyclists have to wake up in the middle of the night and go cycling a bit to circle blood through their heart, becuase otherwise they just die? - yeah thats voxel without that chat
10:49 < bridge> <Ewan> I should leave the hotel room…
10:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I should smoke a cigarette
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> go out and run
10:50 < bridge> <learath2> What is the point, you are in a worse part of the same state 😄
10:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> but this chat too entertaining
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> americans will be amazed
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> at u
10:50 < bridge> <Ewan> it is 16 degrees
10:50 < bridge> <Ewan> fahrenheit
10:50 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it's fucking -1°C here
10:50 < bridge> <Ewan> sweet
10:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> its 4C here
10:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> please we do only logical units here
10:51 < bridge> <learath2> Not worth it. Overdose on how dysfunctional I am instead
10:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i used rocket isntead of axum, but other than that - yess
10:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> use axum
10:51 < bridge> <Ewan> 16f is approx -9c
10:51 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Nah man
10:51 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I mean yea
10:51 < bridge> <fokkonaut> but nah
10:51 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i dont make fun of it
10:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> eh eh - yes chef!
10:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> do it my way <a:AngerShake:434855387523710976>
10:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :BRUHH:
10:51 < bridge> <Ewan> u ever run in -9c
10:51 < bridge> <Ewan> while it’s snowing
10:52 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i love to do that sometimes actually
10:52 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @learath2 it'd actually make me happy see you getting out of your hole. But it all starts within yourself.
10:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> excuses for the weak
10:53 < bridge> <learath2> Funniest part is I’m only in a metaphorical hole

10:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i can enjoy my home office day rn
10:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> what time is it there ewan
10:55 < bridge> <learath2> I’m NEET now
10:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> drink mountain dew
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> 3 am
10:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i'm actually allowed to work on my private project today @ryozuki
10:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> im working on making a compiler for a language my company is making
10:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> so yeah all im doing is wasting my paid time by chatting here
10:56 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
10:56 < bridge> <learath2> I need to start looking for jobs sometime
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
10:56 < bridge> <Ewan> this is big chilling but im big shivering even w my coat
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> they want to make a mix of go and rust, rust but more simple even if it trade offs some perf, and with a runtime like erlang for concurrency
10:56 < bridge> <Ewan> i could go run
10:57 < bridge> <cipy29> Chad company living like it's the 80s
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> smth related to this https://verdagon.dev/blog/fearless-ffi
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> too
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually rly chad i dont care if it doesnt take off but its a rly rly interesting project to work on while getting paid
10:58 < bridge> <learath2> I was chatting with a friend lately and mentioned that you were working on a compiler for a custom language and he was like why would a profit seeking entity waste money on such a low yield endeavor such as creating their own language
10:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> to get the chat a little more developer-y here: did anyone of you see spaceX starlink satellites that can communicate with stock 4G phones ? No more people being lost on the oceans or in deserts
10:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> (in the future)
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> im inside
10:59 < bridge> <learath2> Did they actually include the hardware in the already launched satellites or will they be adding it to the next batches?
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk but i think my company, while it seeks profit also seeks interesting projects to do, it does so by balancing profit making projects and more experimental projects like this
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> back in the think blanket twin size pull out couch mattress bed
10:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> to the next, im pretty sure it's gonna be on V2 shipped with Starship
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> back in the thin blanket twin size pull out couch mattress bed
10:59 < bridge> <fokkonaut> once Starship is ready
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> the CEO/CTO is a dev that likes erlang, rust, hates c++ and haskell, likes lisp too
11:00 < bridge> <learath2> What is the point to your project e.g.? Why would one want to use your language instead of any of the ones it’s inspired by?
11:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @learath2 2024: SMS, 2025: internet and calls
11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> he also likes go, and says its like a rly nice simple language to teach to interns
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> would be awesome but few of elon’s promises have come through as a company
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> or it takes an absurdly long time
11:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> well, regulatory processes
11:00 < bridge> <learath2> @fokkonaut are you an Elon fan?
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> by the time it rolls out in starlink we will have standard 4g compatible towers that can reach these deserts and oceans lol

11:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is the language idea
11:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hm. hard to say. i definitely like what he's aiming for and that he tries to bring humanity forward by using his insane amount of money and business skills to achieve what government agencies couldnt for decades.
11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> let me code it ryo
11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> then i can be a rust master
11:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u know about linear types?
11:02 < bridge> <Ewan> in 5000 years
11:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @learath2 besides that: i'm definitely a fan of SpaceX
11:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Linear types corresponds to linear logic and ensures that objects are used exactly once. This allows the system to safely deallocate an object after its use, or to design software interfaces that guarantee a resource cannot be used once it has been closed or transitioned to a different state.
11:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> engineers at SpaceX do excellent work.
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill share the language here when its usable xd
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> 3-6 months probs
11:03 < bridge> <learath2> Yep, so you are planning to only have linear types?
11:03 < bridge> <learath2> I see, I was just curious

11:11 < bridge> <learath2> Mostly only because of the social aspect really

11:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i mean smoked it
11:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> never had kne

11:12 < bridge> <Ewan> i can not get quite the crisp photo as fokko could
11:12 < bridge> <Ewan> damn dark
11:12 < bridge> <learath2> I've been thinking of making a website for a portfolio, just in case I have to move to estonia to become a web dev maybe I'll do that
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> make it
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> and blog

11:13 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, idk what I would blog about
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> C obviously
11:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @mpft but my music taste is wide
11:14 < bridge> <learath2> My vast ocean of C knowledge is just facts. Not very interesting to blog about
11:14 < bridge> <Ewan> 496th in the world and u would think i had heard of them
11:14 < bridge> <Ewan> good
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> it is interesting for ppl who dont know them
11:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I also love rap/hiphop and shit, I like rock, I like a lot
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also thought like that
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> but ppl do read
11:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i also like a lot fokko
11:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thats good
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 for example do u remember ur hand writte state machine solution for aoc?
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats a interesting blog
11:15 < bridge> <Ewan> today in the car i listened to tiesto followed by the smiths followed by steve hackett of genesis
11:15 < bridge> <Ewan> too different music
11:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> the smiths !!!
11:15 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
11:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> very nice choice
11:15 < bridge> <Ewan> they were great
11:15 < bridge> <learath2> That was by far the nastiest piece of C I have ever produced 😄
11:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://open.spotify.com/intl-de/track/69Kzq3FMkDwiSFBQzRckFD?si=a76bd074eeed4c98
11:15 < bridge> <Ewan> good one
11:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> indeed
11:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> u know Scar Tissue, by red hot chilli peppers?
11:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> also a very nice song
11:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i always instinctually avoided rhcp thanks to my moms hatred of them
11:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> well, thats really sad
11:16 < bridge> <Ewan> even john frusciante whose successful solo career i would usually approve of
11:16 < bridge> <Ewan> every time I don’t hate but can only imagine my mom shaking her head
11:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I mean, it's the same for me. I've avoided Rap for a good time of my life until I developed my own brain
11:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> my dad would shake his head
11:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> over what i listen to sometimes
11:17 < bridge> <Ewan> yea as a white boy that took a while for me too
11:17 < bridge> <Ewan> my neo nazi dad would also shake his head
11:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> that escalated quickly
11:17 < bridge> <Ewan> but i listened almost exclusively to rap in my sophomore year of high school
11:17 < bridge> <louis> :justatest:
11:18 < bridge> <louis> crazy lore drop
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> he’s a silly fellow
11:18 < bridge> <learath2> I'll go do some well adjusted human things. Move this conversation to #off-topic if you don't want to get bonked by mods
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> :monkaS:
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> did not mean to drop that so hard
11:19 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> just text in assembly - mods wont understand and we're safe !

12:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> any CSS pro here?
12:12 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> sir this is a wendy's
12:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thought so

12:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://css-tricks.com/animate-to-an-inline-style/
12:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> solved my issue
12:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i am programatically setting an inline style and need to animate that property
12:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> shit
12:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it didnt fix it entirely
12:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> wow. i found a really neat way. creating a CSS var which i'll then modify from inline style
12:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> aka programatically
12:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> amazing.
12:33 < bridge> <Ewan> excellent
12:35 < bridge> <Ewan> holy shit apparently those awesome pastries are 600 calories a piece

13:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Who is windows registry pro?
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I wonder if without any permissions problems, and/or detect as virus, we could read 
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\ImplicitLayers`
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> from it
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That could maybe show installed overlays, e.g. discord, steam, razor, logitech.
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Whatever uses them.
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Would be interesting ^^

15:52 < ws-client> <fokkonaut> i love how chillerdragon casually created his own discord
15:52 < ws-client> <fokkonaut> just to avoid discord
15:52 < ws-client> <fokkonaut> but to interact with people on discord
15:52 < ws-client> <Scrumplex2> Why not Matrix with Cinny though? :O
15:53 < bridge> <davide55> Thanks

15:53 < bridge> <fokkonaut> chiller u dont have responds over there tho
15:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea hm
15:53 < ws-client> <Scrumplex2> Cinny is a Discord-like client for Matrix
15:53 < ws-client> <Scrumplex2> https://cinny.in/
15:53 < bridge> <davide55> Feel free to share my DS username
15:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is cinny smooth?
15:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i might switch from element
15:54 < ws-client> <Scrumplex2> Depends
15:54 < ws-client> <Scrumplex2> it uses Tauri instead of Electron
15:54 < ws-client> <Scrumplex2> So Rust backend 🚀🚀🚀🚀
15:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> woah no electron?????
15:54 < ws-client> <Scrumplex2> But GTK WebKit frontend
15:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i waited 20s for this to load and my attention span already ended xd https://app.cinny.in/
15:55 < ws-client> <Scrumplex2> Huh? Loaded instantly for me :O
15:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lucky u

15:59 < bridge> <Chiller Dragon> yea doesnt look too bad but not sure if ill use it :D
16:00 < bridge> <Sefa> Cinny is one of the matrix clients that allow you to create custom emoji packs
16:01 < bridge> <Sefa> And they work no matter the client
16:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wowo
16:01 < bridge> <Scrumplex> Honestly I might switch back to Cinny again
16:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can do the same on chat.zillyhuhn.com :p 
16:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> creating aliases for text wrapped in colons to any discord nitro emoji or img url :D 
16:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i only use matrix when i have to
16:03 < bridge> <_aiae> What the heck is going on
16:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i occasionally boot a tui matrix client to understand discord replies or use one on the phone because there is no good iOS irc client

17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i looked on gpuinfo.org
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it mentions quite a few
17:45 < bridge> <robyt3> I thought about a `gfx_dump` command before that dumps all relevant graphics related information and settings into a text file in the dumps folder and then opens the dumps folder
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/listinstancelayers.php
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u sort after most used
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so many weird ones xD
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> VK_LAYER_ROCKSTAR_GAMES_social_club
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the one u mentioned xd
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i should try  this now
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can u show a good graph as comparasion?
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else i cant judge how huge u expect the drops to be
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also DEBUG or release?
17:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Happens in both
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ingame or menu?
17:49 < bridge> <robyt3> Also both
17:50 < bridge> <robyt3> Normal graph
17:50 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1193959914784174150/image.png?ex=65ae9cd2&is=659c27d2&hm=54ea5efeaa6d297c0c7a513b8c3f4604e6e72907d0304e0010da6e5856a9e16b&
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also when holding the key or only the moment u press it?
17:51 < bridge> <robyt3> If you press it once it sometimes causes an immediate spike. If you hole it causes spikes randomly
17:51 < bridge> <robyt3> If you press it once it sometimes causes an immediate spike. If you hold it causes spikes randomly
17:51 < bridge> <robyt3> Only happens when you have high FPS, like > 1000 I guess
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> without any key
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1193960370646290522/image.png?ex=65ae9d3f&is=659c283f&hm=3404b248fb54f7908308572a995bd2c7974a7788d5affc37d7c658073ff8f4c0&
17:52 < bridge> <robyt3> Might be hard to notice with current FPS graph because it scrolls so fast
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> LMAO
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when i press SHIFT + PRINT then it makes a fullscreen screenshot
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and i was like, why is it not woprking
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now i created like 500 screenshots
17:52 < bridge> <robyt3> But if I hold a modifier then the maximum value in the FPS graph goes up by 50%-100%
17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> holding, shift + ctrl + alt at the same time
17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1193960765380636822/image.png?ex=65ae9d9d&is=659c289d&hm=36105f1e7c948b62c945a52b6c486cd55c0a2daa4d4819bac8f29f021575efae&
17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so no difference for me
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so u have no fps limit?
17:55 < bridge> <robyt3> It looks like the spikes go above what I set as the `gfx_refresh_rate` (1500)
17:55 < bridge> <robyt3> I only set 1500 to avoid coil while of my GPU :/
17:55 < bridge> <robyt3> I only set 1500 to avoid coil whine of my GPU :/
17:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well unclamped my fps generally jump a lot, but i'd say it jumps consistently
17:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i cannot reproduce it

17:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 already tried to replace SDL2.dll?
17:59 < bridge> <robyt3> Good idea, I'll try. Here is a video where I hold alt for a few seconds then let go for a few second and hold again
17:59 < bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1193962263980290180/DDNet_2024.01.08_-_17.57.30.01-1.mp4?ex=65ae9f02&is=659c2a02&hm=9e0e6bfe1a6d6fbb2fc521c1f262d2bada616630a522d13eadf06d3f8ad492a5&
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well what's interesting is, that it makes the max value jump to 9k
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how should that even be possible
18:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 what is the value of `gfx_asyncrender_old`
18:01 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah
18:01 < bridge> <robyt3> That's it
18:01 < bridge> <robyt3> `gfx_asyncrender_old 1` is the cause
18:02 < bridge> <robyt3> SDL 2.20 and 2.28 make no difference
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that just "proves" that it's input related i guess
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i probably spends more time in the SDL call or smth
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it probably spends more time in the SDL call or smth
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wait u mean with 1 it's happening?
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and with 0 not?
18:03 < bridge> <robyt3> Yes
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then i take it back
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that makes 0 sense xD
18:04 < bridge> <robyt3> `gfx_asyncrender_old` makes the FPS graph look very different in general
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's maybe not surprising
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 0 = CPU waits for GPU to finish
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but mixing 0 with gfx_refresh_rate is kinda weird
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it sometimes skips frames anyway then
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least afair
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> (!AsyncRenderOld || m_pGraphics->IsIdle()) &&

18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `no gfx_refresh_rate is set` | `we can render`
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so u set it to 0
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so first is always true
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and u have refresh rate set
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so 2nd is not always true
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so sometimes it still skips frames
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so if it's 1
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> => graphics is not idle is the cause
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the other check just makes the FPS consistent, but only the first check is different
18:10 < bridge> <robyt3> So holding a modifier key has an influence on the graphics being idle? Seems like the only factor that is influence by modifier keys
18:10 < bridge> <robyt3> So holding a modifier key has an influence on the graphics being idle? Seems like the only factor that could be influenced by modifier keys
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you have forced tripple buffering active?
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or in other words, does when you start the client any vulkan warning popup that IMMEDIATE rendering is not supported?
18:11 < bridge> <robyt3> Where would I see the vulkan warning? I don't see one
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> WTF is that xD
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1193965342230319174/image.png?ex=65aea1e0&is=659c2ce0&hm=e3a341d4df357c5e0ed467b663c29f4550fbe7d61fc650e05c4e8553c8b6b062&
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well it would pop up in F1
18:12 < bridge> <robyt3> No graphics warning in the console, with maximum output levels
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `dbg_msg("vulkan", "warning: requested presentation mode was not available. falling back to mailbox / fifo relaxed.");`
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in backend_vulkan
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mailbox is basically vsync but with unlimited VPS
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mailbox is basically vsync but with unlimited FPS
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well it's really weird
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that would imply that some vulkan call would take longer, if you hold a modifier
18:14 < bridge> <robyt3> Tripple buffering is also off in my NVIDIA settings globally so it shouldn't have an influence
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but vulkan calls never read any keyboard input 😂
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for mailbox i could at least still imagine it's the OS that blocks the call
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for whatever reason
18:15 < bridge> <robyt3> We need more Windows testers, maybe it's something else on my PC
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but still
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this is randomness
18:26 < ChillerDragon> :q
18:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i found a bug in my server :), when a player go to spectator and come out, the server shutdowns 🙂
18:35 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> segmentation fault 🙂
18:35 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> a bug
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which version is your server based on?
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did u check if it's your modifications?
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or was this just a random sentence?
18:37 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 17.4 i think
18:37 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> not yet
18:40 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> this is 1.4.2 original client when attempting to run a server

18:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you have a 32-bit version of windows?
18:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what did u do, install linux version or what
18:42 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> no, 64
18:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you have an ARM CPU?
18:42 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i have intel
18:43 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i never had this issue on this pc before

18:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> let it be sad then :pepeW:
18:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but i built a 17.4 version on my windows and the server runs without any problem
18:46 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i downloaded this version from the ddnet.org
18:46 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and update it, if i remember
18:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
18:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps redownload it then

18:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah u want to use TSAN?
18:51 < bridge> <Bota> I would preffer an arch server over an windows server
18:51 < bridge> <teeworlds_man> people spamming
18:52 < bridge> <Bota> Also me
18:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> try with env var:

18:53 < bridge> <Bota> You tried bribing it with candy?
18:53 < bridge> <Bota> :kek:
18:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> let me just install a fresh 17.4.2
18:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> portable sry
18:58 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 54 mb game waste me 9 years
18:59 < bridge> <Bota> Thats how you know you’re doing it correctly
18:59 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> with fresh 17.4.2 version downloaded, the server runs without proble
18:59 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> m
19:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> maybe it's gonna do something with update the client ?
19:01 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> or i changed something in the folder that i wont remember 😂
19:02 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ye, you wasting it right
19:02 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ye, it's my modification :feelsamazingman:

19:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: the idea is that the whole score kind thing can go away from the serverside again. you already did the info json, now you can move the game info snap stuff into the mod controller so you can do what you like from inside a mod
19:22 < bridge> <learath2> I don't particularly want to but it's in our codebase now and I need to atleast not introduce new warnings
19:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but we don't need special code for handling that in ddnet
19:23 < bridge> <learath2> If it's not lying to me the code I wrote must be completely broken. It can statically even determine that the lock is held it seems when I can't find any way it can be held
19:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe it's lying to you?
19:23 < bridge> <robyt3> You mean clang thread safety analysis? I don't think that's the same as ThreadSanitizer
19:24 < bridge> <learath2> Oh yeah, not tsan. Thread safety analysis
19:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah
19:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> use it with libc++
19:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u either use full clang ecosystem
19:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or u dont use clang tools xd
19:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess the problem is that we're currently using thread safety analysis
19:25 < bridge> <learath2> It's in compile time, so it shouldn't matter my libc++. But I did try with all possible configurations
19:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then change the CI
19:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps it needs special annotations for smart pointers from the libc++
19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to use libc++ xd
19:26 < bridge> <learath2> It's failing locally too
19:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> real men talking
19:26 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i see. sad
19:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why sad? it does everything you need, no? ChillerDragon
19:27 < ChillerDragon> now i am forced to overwrite the snap
19:27 < ChillerDragon> as a modder
19:27 < bridge> <learath2> unique_ptr works completely fine though ;/ and I did try with libc++ and libstdc++
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rest in peace

19:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 22.11.2023
19:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> uff
19:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i should update my system
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1626 packets available
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> uff
19:29 < bridge> <4ipset> But you are bot
19:29 < bridge> <learath2> But it's not even the shared_ptr thing. My changes in updater are the ones that concern me
19:29 < bridge> <learath2> Whatever. I went outside for a bit. I'll think more when I get back
19:30 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 so i can keep chainging the snap but not with id arg=
19:31 < ChillerDragon> its not even additional maintenance or complexity to have an id arg is it?
19:31 < ChillerDragon> so your only argument against is that it is not correct enough?
19:32 < bridge> <gerdoe> https://tenor.com/view/alvin-and-the-chipmunks-alvin-whoops-my-bad-oops-gif-21789210
19:32 < bridge> <gerdoe> got alvincanceled
19:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> generally, I dislike adding code that isn't correct enough
19:34 < ChillerDragon> -.-
19:34 < ChillerDragon> makes my life harder
19:34 < bridge> <4ipset> :justatest:
19:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think we need to ahve a discussion about how much moddability we want in ddnet
19:34 < ChillerDragon> i think so too
19:34 < ChillerDragon> where and how?
19:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't like adding piecemeal stuff where I can't even see whether it helps with moddability or not
19:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but for this particular usecase, it'd be enough to make the info json moddable plus the game info stuff
19:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so why not just do that?
19:35 < ChillerDragon> well i did do everything now
19:36 < ChillerDragon> check latest commits
19:36 < ChillerDragon> but i still think that the additional clientid arg gives modders more flexibility without having to touch code that might change upstream
19:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, it still has a function `ScoreKind`
19:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd like to see that gone
19:36 < ChillerDragon> replaced how?
19:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> instead, the mod can add stuff to the snap directly
19:37 < ChillerDragon> by reimplementing the whole gamecontroller snap?
19:37 < ChillerDragon> adding points score should be smooth
19:37 < ChillerDragon> otherwise you can not call ddnet the community fork of teeworlds
19:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> [citation needed]
19:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this is stuff that would be discussed in a moddability discussion
19:38 < ChillerDragon> yes
19:38 < ChillerDragon> maybe we need it before #7770
19:38 < chillerbot> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7770
19:39 < ChillerDragon> so where how when with how do we discuss?
19:39 < ChillerDragon> im all in
19:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> open an issue
19:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hi heino
19:39 < ChillerDragon> can be held in so many directions i hope it doesnt go all over the place
19:39 < bridge> <4ipset> Why all people’s in this channel with default avatars
19:40 < ChillerDragon> if you do not agree with the defaults, you use the wrong software
19:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> he doesnt have my skin in his skins folder
19:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thats why it's default
19:40 < ChillerDragon> xd
19:40 < bridge> <4ipset> Default avatar is looks strange
19:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but for the current pull request, it suffice to make the game object snappable
19:40 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ~is~
19:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (but for the current pull request, it suffice to make the game info object snappable)
19:41 < bridge> <fokkonaut> wtf whats discords markup for crossed out
19:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ~~s~~
19:41 < bridge> <fokkonaut> fakiu
19:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> two tildes
19:41 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ah
19:41 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i gtg we need another round before this pr is finished
19:41 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ~~is~~
19:41 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> cus they know how to code
19:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> no front @learath2
19:44 < bridge> <4ipset> Now I too pro coder? xD
19:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> color is invalid
19:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> sorry
19:51 < bridge> <4ipset> What colors is not invalid
19:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i disallow players to join spectators ?
19:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> im talking about the icon on the client when you press Esc
19:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 @learath2 does musl support dns over tcp yet?
19:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think so
19:54 < bridge> <gerdoe> check code somewhere in gamecontroller, afair there is some hook/wrapper like function
19:55 < bridge> <gerdoe> btw you can global search in any ide to check any code part you want
19:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/browsers-biggest-tls-mistake
19:56 < bridge> <learath2> I don't remember haven't needed musl for anything in a while
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDD
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we have like 20 mod issues now

19:58 < ChillerDragon> omg

19:59 < bridge> <4ipset> Wtf kaffeine is spamming issues
19:59 < bridge> <kimmchtr_> hi how are u
19:59 < bridge> <kimmchtr_> stop pls
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fragezeichen
20:00 < bridge> <kimmchtr_> ?
20:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the issues opened by Kaffeine are about protocol-level support
20:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not source-level support
20:01 < bridge> <gerdoe> these are for people that have both time and wish to write code xd
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wat
20:06 < bridge> <gerdoe> ddnet 2
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u doing it? thanks 😏
20:16 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> bug fixed, now players can't join spectator or any team
20:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so, who are those ppl xdd
20:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @heinrich5991: did you see this? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7769
20:32 < bridge> <gerdoe> wanna make something dd-pg based, messing around with exams and procrastination instead

23:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> hey, what settings do i have to set to use custom skins url, i tried to do as written on https://skins.scrumplex.net/ but it doest work xd
23:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do you have community skins on?
23:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> this?
23:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1194045457563918356/image.png?ex=65aeec7d&is=659c777d&hm=db907df606d874c85ac7da3b0928b38575835c637743994bdd49cf12ad5bf82f&
23:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then it's a different config var
23:31 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 #7779 s/Would me/Would be/
23:31 < chillerbot> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7779
23:32 < ChillerDragon> wait wot i cant read
23:32 < ChillerDragon> you want to do that?! xd
23:32 < ChillerDragon> u got nothing todo? xd
23:32 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> @jupeyy_keks what window manager/compositor is good on wayland?
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno. I use KDE xd
23:33 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD
23:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But I don't use Wayland yet
23:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's for ever unstable
23:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ic ty :)
23:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I like that Wayland doesn't require to turn the compositor off. It simply doesn't render it if a full screen app is active
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I wonder If that will also work if tearing is on
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Else it's useless for me xd
23:37 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ^^ I'm sticking to x11 then (I was gonna try wayland out with a new system but now I lost interest) and stop delaying learning ue5
23:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'll try it out when plasma 6 comes out
23:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They claim to have proper support
23:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
23:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ok, i clicked same checkbox 10 times and it started working
