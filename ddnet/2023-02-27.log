02:31 < bridge> <DefaultO> that is rather old
02:31 < bridge> <DefaultO> i've seen the post if this is the original one
02:32 < bridge> <DefaultO> i've seen the post when it was posted if this is the original one
06:58 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Update on my Godot 4 extension:
06:58 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> made new functions to access them across all classes and not make duplicated code
06:58 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> made character class having a proper input system, where with a boolean, it either automatically detects input (mouse, keyboard or joystick) and changes actions depending on the input pressed, or it's not automatic and it only detects one type of input
06:58 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> expended data for dashing, walljumping, wallsliding, gliding and game knowledge (hp, mana, stanima)
06:59 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I think I'm in a good direction, I don't feel overwhelmed, because of how I organize my code, it's insane
11:20 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> where will ddnet work possibly better: linux or windows?
11:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> linux
11:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> if you are planning to host a server - use linux probably
11:23 < bridge> <Learath2> Funnily enough ddnet might be the only game that has a client that works better on linux too üòÑ
11:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> üòÑ
11:31 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> factorio?
11:31 < bridge> <Learath2> I haven't tried but wouldn't be surprised if it did work very well. Those guys know how to write good code
11:32 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> in fact they support asynchronous autosaving in linux
11:32 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> but not in windows
11:32 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> but thats not big problem
11:32 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> what does exactly "fifo" mean? i mean ddnet 16.8 will support "fifo" on windows
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Funnily enough for me many games work better simply because dxvk is better written then dx9 drivers and default on Linux
11:33 < bridge> <ReiTW> first in first out
11:33 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> i have read it, but whats exactly it will do
11:33 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> is it working with packets or what
11:33 < bridge> <ReiTW> You can echo commands in a fifo file that will get executed
11:34 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> oh
11:34 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> so thats why named pipe was used
11:34 < bridge> <—Å—É–¥–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.> i guess
11:37 < bridge> <ReiTW> technically named pipe == fifo
11:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Best
11:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Ddnet is linux first
11:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Windows is an afterthought
11:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
11:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> First in first out
11:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Oh should have red
12:07 < bridge> <ReiTW> I use windows
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Windows uses you
12:11 < bridge> <ReiTW> i'll switch to linux when I can play current games I do like to play alot
12:12 < bridge> <ReiTW> i'll switch to linux when I can play current games that I do like to play alot
12:12 < bridge> <ReiTW> like Escape From Tarkov, which is playable but the biggest problem = Battleye
12:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Give up on that game. It's not worth it xd
12:23 < bridge> <ReiTW> 6k hours
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 6k hours u could have spent into teeworlds
12:37 < bridge> <Learath2> Why do you not appreciate Nikita's work?
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I appreciate teeworlds work more;)

16:38 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I have a question and an Idea: What do you think of removing height and width from the mapper and doing it automatically (adjusting shift/width/height when placing the map)?
16:38 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I have a question and an Idea: What do you think of removing height and width from the mapper and doing it automatically (adjusting shift/width/height when saving the map/placing tiles)?
16:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> interesting
16:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how do you handle the edge tiles?
16:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> those that replicate endlessly
16:40 < bridge> <AssassinTee> exactly like before, you could add a button showing the current borders of the selected layer
16:41 < bridge> <AssassinTee> this would allow playing tiles outside the current borders while mapping, because before placing the map would auto adjust to the new size
16:41 < bridge> <AssassinTee> this would allow playing tiles outside the current borders while mapping, because before placing, the map would auto adjust to the new size
16:42 < bridge> <AssassinTee> this would also allow for automatically make layers smaller and shrinking the map filesize
16:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> definitely sounds good
16:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but I don't understand your solution for edge tiles
16:43 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I now understand your issues, imagining a floating island ü§î
16:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And then u zoom out accidentally place a tile and now?
16:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Should it always reduce width and height every time a tile is placed?
16:44 < bridge> <AssassinTee> now you delete it again
16:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is removed*
16:45 < bridge> <AssassinTee> on the borders, yes, should be rare
16:46 < bridge> <AssassinTee> you could also set the start background layer to 200/200 or something, since it's dynamically adjusted anyhow
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But could create quite some lag
16:46 < bridge> <AssassinTee> you could also set the start layer size to 200/200 or something, since it's dynamically adjusted anyhow
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Checking border. Or if border is empty, find new border
16:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I doubt it happens that rarely if everything is automatic
16:47 < bridge> <AssassinTee> you can be relaxed with it
16:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> A mapper often adds and removes tiles when creating a new map
16:47 < bridge> <AssassinTee> like doubeling/halfing it
16:47 < bridge> <AssassinTee> as long as you adjust it while saving
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But then u cannot only rely on border again
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Which makes the calculation even shower
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Slower
16:48 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I don't get this one
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> How do u know the current border is u doubled the size
16:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If
16:49 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> Perfect ide theme found
16:49 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1079792481060794429/VID_20230227_174809_939.mp4
16:49 < bridge> <AssassinTee> if I double the border, the new border coordinates are twice as large?
16:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok let's say I place a tile somewhere outside... U would double width or height right?
16:50 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yes, I double until it's inside
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What if u remove the tile again?
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's not part of the border
16:53 < bridge> <AssassinTee> slowly checking the last col/row and reducing the size one by one so that it's now cpu heavy could be an option. The size only matters for the editor itself, as I said saving could rearrange it anyway. Also maybe not making it smaller at all could be an option, too
16:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> A decrease means copy all tiles that exists
16:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And increase
16:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's not a two dim array
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean it's certainly somehow possible. But if u implement it, you might end up having to rewrite the rendering
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And use a different date structure to save the tiles in editor
16:57 < bridge> <AssassinTee> sounds like a quadtree, now that you say it
16:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yup
16:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also thought that üòÑ
16:57 < bridge> <AssassinTee> how do I decrease? The leaf is empty
16:58 < bridge> <AssassinTee> how do I save? Making a quadtree into an array
16:58 < bridge> <AssassinTee> how do I increase? adding nodes
17:00 < bridge> <AssassinTee> still the issue of @heinrich5991 remains, the only thing I can think of is placing invisible tiles, but that's bad
17:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This can make the rendering much slower than it already is tho
17:01 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I don't think it's that much if you have a good leaf size
17:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Depends on the data structure itself
17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> A continues array is very fast in accessing and irritating
17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Iterating
17:04 < bridge> <AssassinTee> A quadtree is faster if you only need to access parts of it
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dunno. I'd say it's much much slower
17:06 < bridge> <AssassinTee> we have a render limit and a zoom limit, you don't need to render the full map, just the part that you are looking at
17:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Qquadtrees are good if u want to find a specific region
17:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That's not my point
17:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Explain to me how do u render each tile after each other in a quadtree efficient
17:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U have a x start y start. X end y end
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Array access is basicaly 2-3 instructions
17:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Y * width+x
17:09 < bridge> <AssassinTee> first you only need to render the leafes inside the FOV, each leave can be an array too?
17:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> How do u find the required leafs
17:10 < bridge> <AssassinTee> x, y, w, h inside a node
17:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And then go over all leafs
17:11 < bridge> <AssassinTee> no
17:11 < bridge> <AssassinTee> you go from the root of the tree
17:11 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> not removing but adding auto-scale
17:11 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> i still need my borders :<
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Anyway, implement it. Now I'm interested
17:12 < bridge> <AssassinTee> is there a quadtree already in ddnet accessible? For player collisions or somethign
17:12 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> nah
17:13 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Entity collision and interaction is THE usecase of a quadtree üòÆ
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It is yes
17:13 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> tried to implement it on 07, broke whole protocol xd
17:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we just do the O(n¬≤) thing
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> BCS u go from a specific point ^^
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But even here. For 64 players it's maybe already worth. For 16 players it's maybe already slower
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U also have to maintain the quad tree^^
17:15 < bridge> <AssassinTee> here is a working version: https://github.com/AssassinTee/teeworlds/blob/feature/quad-tree-test2/src/game/server/worldtree.h
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Any benchmarks?
17:16 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> huuuh
17:16 < bridge> <Ravie> the idea is good but moving the top or left border can break some parts
17:16 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I had some other issues with it: the update order!
17:17 < bridge> <AssassinTee> for example?
17:17 < bridge> <Ravie> any part that relies on some specific floating point behavior like kill edges or freezejumps
17:17 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Maybe simple adding an autoscale tool would do just ü§î
17:18 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbbvMb7G8HQ
17:18 < bridge> <AssassinTee> this is true, arguments could be made that this is ... bad mapping
17:18 < bridge> <Ravie> I agree that it is but it's far too common to ignore
17:18 < bridge> <Ravie> it's also the reason why our discord bot doesn't automatically resize physics layers
17:19 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I already had the same problem creating an insanely hard jump map
17:20 < bridge> <AssassinTee> So, okay, I think the old proposal is out of the window, but here is a new one: adding autoscale and (only) expanding when klicking outside the map borders?
17:21 < bridge> <AssassinTee> So, okay, I think the old proposal is out of the window, but here is a new one: adding autoscale and (only) expanding when clicking outside the map borders?
17:21 < bridge> <AssassinTee> does this also happen when changing the map height/width or only when shifting?
17:22 < bridge> <Ravie> it happens when the position of tiles relative to world origin changes
17:22 < bridge> <AssassinTee> so when shifting
17:22 < bridge> <Patiga> I think the automatic resizing sounds like a good idea. I think a fine workaround for now would be to be generous with the map size until the map is finished (increasing it a lot whenever you need new space), at which point you optimize it
17:24 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I think this could be done with an additional tool, there is already a tool to remove envelops
17:25 < bridge> <AssassinTee> at least the resizeing
17:25 < bridge> <Ravie> that's a good idea
17:25 < bridge> <Patiga> both of those functionalities are already in the ddnet discordbot
17:25 < bridge> <Ravie> it could also warn in a tooltip or something that it can change behavior of some parts
17:26 < bridge> <Patiga> (but should probably be in the client at some point)
17:26 < bridge> <AssassinTee> but it doesn't, because the relation to the origin doesn't change?
17:26 < bridge> <AssassinTee> just adjusting width and height, not touching shift
17:26 < bridge> <Ravie> not all maps are submitted to ddnet and this can still be useful to mappers for other mods
17:27 < bridge> <AssassinTee> jupstar would argue, it might, because it's a 1 d array ü§î
17:29 < bridge> <Patiga> I don't know what you mean by 'shift'. on `$optimize`, only the tiles layers are touched. but with the `$edit` command it can optimize physics layers as well. it can also `$edit --extend-<direction> <number>` where direction is one of up, down, left, right, to extend all tilemap layers (including physics layers) by the specified amount of tiles. (this does change physics, but this is point of this command)
17:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> you can offset a layer, (even for half blocks), it can be really usefull
17:30 < bridge> <Patiga> you can only do that for entire groups, and not on the game/physics group
17:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yes, but you could use that to make file sizes smaller, too
17:31 < bridge> <AssassinTee> when the first 20 rows of a tileset are empty, you can remove the first 19 and add a shift instead
17:32 < bridge> <AssassinTee> but as @Ravie pointed out, this could change physics
17:32 < bridge> <Patiga> ah yes, the tool does exactly that
17:32 < bridge> <Patiga> but that cannot be done with physics layers and can't affect physics because of that
17:32 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yes, which makes sense
17:32 < bridge> <AssassinTee> my point is, that a tool is missing inside the editor
17:33 < bridge> <Patiga> physics are affected when you change where the top-left corner of the physics layers is, so if you extend the map upwards or to the left, the physics change
17:33 < bridge> <ReiTW> damn wtf :justatest:
17:34 < bridge> <Patiga> yes, I agree that it would be handy for the client. I could also see if I can make the tool simply more accessible. the `$edit` command is a pretty direct frontend to the twmap tools
17:38 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Can somebody tell me, where the "remove unused envelopes" tool is hidden?
17:38 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Can somebody tell me, where the "remove unused envelopes" tool is hidden on Github?
17:38 < bridge> <Patiga> that one is actually also in the editor now
17:39 < bridge> <Patiga> top left next to `File` is a `Tools` dropdown
17:39 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yes I know, I mean the sourcecode, I hoped it has an entry point for other tools
17:39 < bridge> <Patiga> apart from that, the discordbot uses https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap/-/tree/master/twmap-tools , in particular `twmap-edit`
17:40 < bridge> <Patiga> oh yea I misread your message, oop
17:40 < bridge> <Robyt3> The popup menu is created by `PopupMenuTools`
17:40 < bridge> <Robyt3> This shows a confirmation popup and calls `RemoveUnusedEnvelopes` when confirmed
17:41 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Thank you
17:42 < bridge> <Patiga> this function does the shrinking of the tilemaps, including the physics layers https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap/-/blob/3a99b5d821536bb5a25b11ea752db715f3588c87/twmap/src/map/edit/shrink.rs#L33
18:02 < bridge> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 you've been talking about a proxy/well split backwards compatibility layer for a while now, how feasible do you think that actually is?
18:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I have one for 0.5/0.6
18:03 < bridge> <Learath2> While working on the 0.7 bridge I encountered many places where I had a lot of trouble splitting off the compatibility stuff due to the sheer amount of information that is lost as you go down the stack
18:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, you mean 0.7 is sufficiently different?
18:04 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, especially the things that moved from snaps to netmsgs and vice versa
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you shouldnt compare 0.6 to 0.7 anyway
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u should compare whatever we have now with whatever is possible
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and then every single backward compability sucks
18:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you're talking about breaking backward compatibility old client ‚Üí new server, right?
18:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or also new client ‚Üí old server?
18:05 < bridge> <Learath2> A translation layer between `CServer` and `CGameContext` just didn't have enough information to construct the stuff necessary to feed a 0.7 client. I can't imagine it being any easier further down you go. I can't even think how to do it between `CServer` and `CNetwork` e.g.
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah why would we need this?
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> even without adding new stuff to network we have so much useless branches to supports some features the client does not support
18:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> these things specifically seem fine if the proxy can keep state
18:06 < bridge> <Learath2> I'd love to move to a new protocol and keep the backwards compatibility if it doesn't have to have this very invasive approach we currently have
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why btw, serious question, why?
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> name me one game that does this stupidy
18:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> compatibility with existing content
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nobody except you wants it
18:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I doubt you'd be satisfied if we named one ^^
18:07 < bridge> <Learath2> This was the approach I was going with early on, but it just felt so wrong to double the state
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i also dont say break it every week
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we could break all clients older than ddnet 16 without any problem today
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and all vanilla clients
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then we can start to see what we can refactor with just that information already
18:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> tbf you could do that with the proxy approach as well, but you also seem to be against that hypothetical approach
18:09 < bridge> <Learath2> Well, if it's not invasive it doesn't lead to ugly code and it means less drama. Let's be realistic we get a temper tantrum in here everytime we break a decade old version, do you think actually breaking compatibility we'll get people to follow us? They'll just use old versions and host their own
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen https://ddnet.tw/ down
18:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hm, probably broken by me or so
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> see i understand what u mean
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but someone is always mad, 99% of the players wont care
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what we do is listen to the 1%
18:10 < bridge> <Learath2> Fixed
18:11 < bridge> <Learath2> Well not sure which one of us fixed, I assumed nginx didn't reload after renewing the certificate so I gave it a reload but someone else might have done something too üòÑ
18:12 < bridge> <Learath2> The 1% gets very mean, then I feel bad, then I don't sleep well
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the 1% dont even give bad steam review, bcs they clearly dont use the steam version xDDD
18:14 < bridge> <Learath2> Instead they voice their concerns in dms telling you that you are a sea slug for removing their favourite bug
18:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I turned of certificate verification on cloudflare
18:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> for ddnet.tw
18:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that probably fixed it
18:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I turned off certificate verification on cloudflare
18:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> "fixed"
18:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> IOW someone‚Ñ¢ should check why the certificate for ddnet.tw wasn't valid
18:17 < bridge> <Learath2> I swear to god certbot is the worst piece of software ever engineered. It's so horrible that I knew it was made in python before I ever checked
18:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> üòÑ
18:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's acme_tiny.py
18:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I use it
18:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's really good (despite being python?)
18:17 < bridge> <Learath2> I put all my money on certbot being stuck on.... something
18:18 < bridge> <Learath2> I use acme.sh, mostly because that's the one I found first when looking for a certbot alternative

18:20 < bridge> <Learath2> Ah this one doesn't generate the csrs for you, that's probably why I never bothered
18:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `exec openssl req -new -sha256 -key domain.key -subj "/" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:heinr    ich5991.de,DNS:www.heinrich5991.de,DNS:cd.heinrich5991.de,DNS:grafana.heinrich5991.de,DNS    :hc.heinrich5991.de,DNS:kaiser.heinrich5991.de,DNS:teeworlds-friends.heinrich5991.de,DNS:    yadam.heinrich5991.de" > domain.csr`

18:22 < bridge> <Learath2> It is good that it just does one thing and does it well. I approve üòÑ
18:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not rocket science :p
18:23 < bridge> <Learath2> Like just do one thing, is it really so hard?
18:43 < bridge> <ReiTW> No need to check, just to know you have to use snap to install the current maintained version proves it's shit ad
18:43 < bridge> <ReiTW> Af*
18:49 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I asked chatgpt to create a quadtree c++ template and it did it flawlessly
18:54 < bridge> <Learath2> There are lots of implementations of it out there, it shouldn't be that hard üòõ
18:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> might wanna check if it copied some implementation
18:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> due to licensing
18:54 < bridge> <AssassinTee> there are different types of them, if you want one that automatically expands/shrinks itself it's a bit harder üòâ
18:56 < bridge> <Learath2> I meant hard for the gpt model. It was probably trained on enough implementations of it
19:07 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yeah probably
20:03 < bridge> <Teero> eyo where is `CNetObj_Character` defined?
20:03 < bridge> <Teero> eyo where is the defenition of`CNetObj_Character` ?
20:03 < bridge> <Teero> eyo where is the definition of`CNetObj_Character` ?
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> protocol.h
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> which is generated
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> so idk where the original def comes from
20:04 < bridge> <Ewan> but for linkage purposes u want that
20:20 < bridge> <Teero> kk

20:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Gpt is just a function with a billion parameters
20:24 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
21:03 < bridge> <~Myata> Good evening everyone, can you explain what I need to do to remove these errors and successfully complete the compilation?

21:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how did you download the ddnet source code?
21:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> did you use the built-in method to clone a git repository?
21:07 < bridge> <~Myata> No, I just downloaded the repository from github
21:07 < bridge> <~Myata> https://github.com/DDNet/DDNet
21:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try this from step 20: https://forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?t=5765
