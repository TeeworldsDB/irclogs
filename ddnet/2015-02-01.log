12:09 < heinrich5991> yea
12:11 <@deen> I don't like localization anyway :P
12:23 < heinrich5991> yea, but it is a big part of a software's success :/

17:04 <@EastByte> laxa: could you simply let nimda ignore chile plx? :)
17:09 <@deen> that's china
17:09 <@EastByte> screw that <.<
17:10 <@EastByte> Chile and China :)
17:29 < laxadedi> hummmm
17:29 <@deen> would make sense, laxadedi 
17:30 <@deen> china has always been flaky
17:30 <@EastByte> hummmmmmmm
17:30 < laxadedi> yeah well, I can't do that right now
17:30 <@deen> connection is actually fine in china though, so i don't care
17:30 < laxadedi> and it would be quite ugly in the code
17:30 <@deen> maybe quakenet can do filtering based on bad words? :P
17:30 < laxadedi> no :D
17:30 <@deen> too bad, could tell the channel to filter "DDNet CHN" haha
17:31 <@EastByte> laxadedi: so your code can even be uglier?
17:31 < laxadedi> EastByte: ...
17:31 < laxadedi> Fu :D
17:31 <@EastByte> :)
17:32 < laxadedi> Well, if you dont wanna have ugly code, you can just make a simple pull request ;p
17:33 < laxadedi> https://github.com/Laxa/Nimda3
17:34 <@EastByte> if I didn't want ugly code I would simply replace nimda with a new python based irc bot
17:34 <@deen> Nim based!
17:34 <@EastByte> yea, maybe
17:34 <@deen> and call it Nimda
17:34 <@EastByte> xd
17:34 <@EastByte> good idea actually
17:34 < laxadedi> ok folks
17:34 <@EastByte> because Nimda isn't even an Admin
17:35 <@deen> and there's an IRC module for Nim already in the stdlib
17:35 < laxadedi> I'll go to eat now, see ya tomorrow
17:35 <@deen> bye laxadedi 
17:35 <@EastByte> cya :)

22:22 <@deen> ddos on chile
22:23 < eeeee> oh noes
22:24 <@deen> looks like a tw protocol attack, hm
22:24 <@deen> now not anymore
22:24 <@EastByte> hmm
22:24 <@deen> i guess they're trying all attacks they have
22:25 <@deen> the main problem with ddosing chile is probably that you don't get much traffic to chile from europe or usa
22:25 <@deen> max they got through so far was 6 MB/s
22:25 <@EastByte> hehe
