06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf, i think i just found a quite critical bug, and i wonder how it could never been found
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> rendertools were never initialized in the gameclient, but that is required, else the tee quad containers arent initialized
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it probs only worked if the variable was initialized with 0, bcs the editor initializes its rendertools
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont get why valgrind didnt see it, insanly confused rn

10:31 < Obiwan> helo developers
10:32 <+Obiwan> i have error with openfng server by fstd: i running server and after 3-5 (seconds after joining) in console i geting this message: [assert]: src/engine/server/server.cpp<446>: client_id is not valid
10:34 <+Obiwan> Mine client version of ddnet is 10.6.5 and i wont update it! wtf is going on?! Earlier i played on my openfng server normally, it was few months ago
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> openfng is outdated and ur client is outdated
10:39 <+Obiwan> jupstar, thanks cap!
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes np
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so update both
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> problems solved
10:41 <+Obiwan> imagine, i didnt knew... ok, i try to update but if it will no work, you will get ban on all ddnet ^^
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> why would ddnet ban the newest client xD
10:48 <+Obiwan> it not helped
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Jupeyy/teeworlds-fng2-mod/tree/fng_06
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that is a current fng mod
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i use it on my server and it works
10:49 <+Obiwan> jupeey its you...?
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
10:49 <+Obiwan> But what about noby? who builded fng2?
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i invented fng2, and noby rewrote it for ddnet code base
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and he also added bot protection and stuff
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but its closed source
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and he also added bot detection and stuff
11:18 <+Obiwan> why i should download fng2 mode with noby's spy scripts
11:18 <+Obiwan> Also i dislike fng2 mode for gold spikes ~_~
11:19 <+Obiwan> 3 months ago i can play normally on openfng server from fstd and had no errors
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u dont need to use maps with golden spikes
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> openfng beat works just fine
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and btw my mod has no spy scripts xD
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its open source
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can see the full source code
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> `https://github.com/Jupeyy/teeworlds-fng2-mod/tree/fng_06`
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is without any of nobys modifications
11:20 <+Obiwan> ye but you said that noby rewrote it for ddnet code base
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes but he kept it secret
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont have access to it
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> noby did it for himself
11:20 <+Obiwan> oh, seems i understood: noby added he's features in your code, i right?
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> he added his features to his code
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> which is private
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mine has nothing todo with nobys
11:20 <+Obiwan> Why he did so?
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well he is open todo what he likes
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> he wanted it based on ddnet with bot detection
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wanted it based on vanilla without further things
11:22 <+Obiwan> oh, i understood... soo you advice me to use fng2 mode? But what about some old fng maps, they will work on your mode?
11:22 <+Obiwan> all of them?
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> puh, i dunno what u mean with old.. all 0.6 maps should work
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i only play since 0.6
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if a map does not work its probably the spikes, but in ddnet editor u can select the fng entities, and it should be easy to replace the old spikes with the new ones
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 @Jupstar ‚ú™ @Learath2 anyone want to review the last 3 changes so I can push another RC for 15.1? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/milestone/2
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll do them
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, the popup stuff is really so ugly
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> planning a rework?
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> waay too much on my plate for now
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm finishing up the data integrity thing, needs a popup
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> suggestion
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> puting sign or something special with names friends here
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/763020524078891048/54c8b479b7e2a7c4.png
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> suggestion
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> putting sign or something special with names friends here
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm having a small brainfart, I have a const pointer to a vector. I have a function that takes an rvalue reference to a vector
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dereference the pointer and `std::move` it, right?
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> std move requires the object to be invalidable
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That sounds wrong though, hm, maybe I should just do const pointers for all of them and use temporaries
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i doubt a const will work
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just wanted to make it look pretty üò¶
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can modify all calls to the vector to std::vector<>&&
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then u can move it around as u want xd
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> went with lvalue references and ditched the pointer
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nice pretty function signatures and no copying around
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> guys choice f3 or f4 to my suggestion
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> make the kill tile auto-rescue you if practice is on instead of killing
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> github bot on fire
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @deen  what your opinion about my suggestion ?
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> I  am feel be sad if no one gives me an opinions  about my suggestions
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @hussainx3 sorry about that. Seems not so important, every interface is already pretty overloaded. friends feature feels mostly important to find servers with your friends. once you're on server, they're easy enough to see.
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> This true unless be in server more 30 players
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm thinking of adding a command like `dbg_gather_info` to help us help people with issues. It would generate an "info card" of sorts which they can paste so we don't have to ask dozens of questions.
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> show_info
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well showing it is not that useful, we'd have to read it off of a screenshot
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> This is true if there are no more than 30 players
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> they can paste it
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 just write it to a file I guess?
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to write it to a file, but currently I actually have no idea where tf the files we write go
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> config_directory
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure? I keep telling people to use `logfile ddnet.log` and never find the log anywhere üòõ
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> isn't that logfile set by default?
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No logging by default
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> would it slow down everything or why is it disabled then?
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> meh
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen oh, should we do a trial of re enabling aio for windows for the next patch?
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was the only one with the issue that caused it to be disabled and I can't reproduce it anymore
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tried a windows 7 VM but it wouldn't happen there either
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, can do
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Is there any "reload" hotkey which reloads client without restarting manually
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> To reimport new entities texture
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in 15.1-rc4 yes, in 15.0.5 no
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è ^
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just dont live in china 4Head
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> too big?
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/763096379513765888/crp.png
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would say text to small
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> too*
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Really? In fullscreen the popup title and extra text look huge to me, that's why I went with smaller text
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in discord preview it looked small
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but it looks ok
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 check in 5:4 btw
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i think the text could be a bit bigger and add a scroll bar if it doesn't fit
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Scrollbars üò¶
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll finish up the functional part, then I'll get `CScrollRegion` from 0.7 so scrollbars aren't so painful anymore
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `find data -type f | wc -l` tells me 685, so that definitely won't fit on a single screen üòÑ
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> colombia :monkalaugh: drug cartels playing ddnet :monkalaugh:
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was hoping no one would destroy their data directory that much üòÑ
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki i tried to use escobarvps.com but they went out of business unfortunately
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> curiosly im watching narcos in netflix
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and then there are interesting rumours as well: https://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/comment/2239921/#Comment_2239921
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol, actually a decent idea
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean if I was looking to become a scammer
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 oh, do you also plan to detect newly introduced files and deleted files?
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It already does all that
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant save porn in ddnet folder anymore :troll:
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> great
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The data directory is ours, it really shouldn't be messed around with
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We modify it all the time in updates
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now to the part where I need to move the modified and extra files to the config directory and fetch the missing/modified files from the update server
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> UX Q: Should I use the menu bar to display progress and let the user play while I'm fixing, or should I keep them on the popup?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if it doesnt take long just popup
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, also I'll have to rely on `CUpdater` for getting the files, hopefully that's not a problem on platforms we don't enable auto updater for
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I'm voting for special "/practice" logic for dummy maps
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> because now it's impossible to practice dummy maps
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 well, on mac osx you can't fix the data dir i guess
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @hussainx3 you can also just write /spec 'friends name'
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen websocket is still not stable right? when it is i would like to know so i can reenable it in the AUR
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @n000b  this nice
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @n000b  this is nice
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> can you suggest skins to the ddnet skins db? or how does that work
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki nope, crashes when i open lan tab
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @NeXus yes
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> usually you'd post them on the forum
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @hussainx3 we already have many options for friends, cl_nameplates_friendmark, cl_show_chat_friends, cl_message_friend cl_message_friend_color. Seems like a bit overkill to me üòÑ
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> this why this weird.
