08:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tip for any arch user, add `ParallelDownloads = 5` to pacman.conf to actually use parallel downloads
09:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes
09:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Actually for the players page the finishes only update ~once per hour
12:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Or just choose a better mirror? I've never had trouble downloading at full speed, maybe only relevant if you have really fast internet ðŸ˜„
12:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i tried all mirrors
12:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they dont go above 11mb/s
12:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so having parallel helps
12:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> mbit or MB?
12:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i can download aty 70mb/s
12:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aka 600mbs
12:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
12:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the one divided by 8
12:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Mbit*
12:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen even with low speeds, i think it helps when u download lots of small packages
15:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> seems like the new master server ping estimates are a bit off?
15:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean its still decent but CHN shows up as orange in the same range of GER which was previously not the case
15:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> beforehand china would be consistently 200-300+ while ger was around 150
15:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wondering if its something that could be fixed or not due to the new master server feature
15:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> maybe. or we can just force CHN down a range for anywhere other than china :kek:
15:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> hi Freddie
17:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, I'd be ok with just adding a fixed +50/100 to China
18:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <dotqw> is ddnet discord bot open source?
18:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-discordbot
19:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though this is probably not the exact version running right now.... I've been asking to get it deployed on a ddnet server and keep the running bot tracking github master for about a year now
19:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always want to rewrite that bot in rust unironically but im so lazy
19:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure what rust would gain you there
19:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would gain fun for me
19:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you don't need low-level control over memory layout etc.
19:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess
19:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> enough reason for me xd
19:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i wonder if the rust would have had that out of memory problem
19:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we had in the past
19:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also the bot should use the discord provided command api
19:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when you start typing / u can select commands from bots
19:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like a feature request. would be nice if it did, yes
19:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
19:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.wsj.com/articles/software-developer-community-stack-overflow-sold-to-tech-giant-prosus-for-1-8-billion-11622648400
19:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omaigat
19:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stackoverflow was sold
19:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for 1.8 billion dollars
19:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would remake the bot but seeing as I have no hope focusing on anything I doubt I'd be able to do that either even if I actually took the time for it
19:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Deal is Prosusâ€™ biggest investment in online learning and comes weeks after it sold a chunk from its massive Tencent holding
19:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Prosus invests globally across a range of online platforms focused on areas such as food delivery, classifieds and fintech. It also maintains a more than $200 billion holding in Tencent.
19:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a tencent related company
19:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> china is everywhere
19:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that company has udemy and codeacademy too

23:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lmao wtf matrix
23:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but i guess its cool that it merges it all together instead of the spammy version irc has in some channels
23:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i dont see why would it even show the nickname changes
23:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> thats weird
