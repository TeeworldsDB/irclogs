00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> -1 that's 3
00:00 <+jxsl13> noby do you know about std::thread ?
00:00 <+jxsl13> you must :O
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> who doesn't know about `std::thread`?
00:01 <+jxsl13> ok, how to delete the allocated memory without joining the threads to the main thread?
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should be called something like `detach`
00:02 <+jxsl13> that was my thought as well, after reading some stackoverflow etc
00:02 <+jxsl13> how does detach exactly work? the thread is simply executed and then it's done? and I can delete the memory in the main thread?
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, what memory are you talking about?
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe you should use a `shared_ptr` ^^
00:03 <+jxsl13> ._. what's a shared_ptr?
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok, what are you doing? passing a chunk of memory fro mthe main thread to the started thread?
00:04 <+jxsl13> I have threads being spawned and accessing a sqlite db and then they are done, but keep on filling my memory with crap :c
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> irrc after `detach` your thread object no longer "owns" the thread and the thread is free to execute after the parent dies
00:05 <+jxsl13> ah, ok
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it has nothing to do with passed memory
00:05 <+jxsl13> if it's done, it's done then
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
00:06 <+jxsl13> tinkering on the zcatch source :)
00:08 <+jxsl13> it's got a memory leak, where on every db access a thread is spawned but only deleted in the destructor of CGameContext with a join, which fills the memory with the thread handles/pointers
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah yea
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then do `detach`
00:08 <+jxsl13> k thx
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/detach
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can only recommend this website 🙂
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 `sizeof aBuf` → `sizeof(aBuf)`. maybe a colon after between `Kicked (your name is banned` and `%s`?
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> damn, keep getting my good habits sneak in
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ;P
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> done
00:16 <+jxsl13> btw the ddnet client has quite the weird behaviour on macOS :c
00:18 <+jxsl13> first start after deleting the config in Application Support/ fresh install -> works fine -> restart -> this: https://i.imgur.com/VdzSzsF.png
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm apparently I can't fake discord into thinking im github
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Github[bot]> Test
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah now you display it asshat...
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Github> [Test](https://www.ddnet.tw)
01:04 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: apparently that bridge doesn't have a filter for bots?
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> neither does ddnet
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> badumm tss
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I propose banning @noby for roasting me
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> fv
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah if we want to keep the pretty commit format sadly we can't haz bors filter
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GitHub> [Test](https://www.ddnet.tw)
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GitHub> Multiple lines?
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now you need to find out how to write these boxes
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can't
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sadly
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we can just not use bors \o/
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think actual bots unlike webhooks can write that box
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh maybe I can send an embeds from the hook
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye thats why the old webhook always sent embeds
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> cute
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I might drop a couple of these until I get it right, so pls no h8
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> when unban
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> close?
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> meh
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> shouldn't these be backslashes?
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> instead of forward ones?
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh stupid
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually no I did make them \
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm discord takes them and turns them into /
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "[https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/commit/238b0bf9e28e8cc6f2fff4a9357decd5874905e1](\\[ddnet:master\\] 1 new commit)\n`2ef3bc1` Some commit - Learath2"

01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so close 😛
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I removed push events from the normal github hook and am pushing them through a filter
02:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and It does filter out bors
02:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ping me a couple million times if it blows up please 🙂
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> \o/
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Oh
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I see:salt:
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I see
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> completely faked the github hook formatting 😛
14:44 <+jxsl13> any coders online :O?
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes!
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> came online just now
14:46 <+jxsl13> :O
14:47 <+jxsl13> hello :D
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hi 🙂
14:51 <+jxsl13> I'm trying to collect some player input data for analysis purposes and thinking about, what to add to each snapshot struct object.
15:04 <@deen> jxsl13: sounds like teehistorian
15:05 <+jxsl13> whats that?
15:05 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/871
15:06 <@deen> So we have recordings of all player inputs on DDNet
15:08 <+jxsl13> looks more complicated than what I had in mind :D but thanks.
15:08 <@deen> and you can use heinrich5991's rust libtw2 with teehistorian files: https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/
15:10 <@deen> just set sv_tee_historian 1
15:14 <+jxsl13> hm, I'm on vanilla source sadly. 
15:14 <@deen> well, then you'd have to port the teehistorian stuff. it's mostly contained in one class I think, so that might be possible (but no guarantees)
15:15 <@deen> Easy solution is to just record serverside demos, but they have performance problems
15:15 <@deen> and are huge on the disk
15:16 <+jxsl13> I would like to use an sqlite db, but wondering if it would keep up with the amout of data
15:16 <@deen> depends on how you use it
15:16 <@deen> and how many players you expect
15:17 <+jxsl13> max 16
15:17 <@deen> https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html
15:17 <@deen> and there are a lot of commands that can make sqlite faster, for example:
15:17 <+jxsl13> well, it would be stupid to push every action a player takes directly
15:17 <@deen> pragma journal_mode=off
15:17 <@deen> > The OFF journaling mode disables the atomic commit and rollback capabilities of SQLite. The ROLLBACK command no longer works; it behaves in an undefined way. Applications must avoid using the ROLLBACK command when the journal mode is OFF. If the application crashes in the middle of a transaction when the OFF journaling mode is set, then the database file will very likely go corrupt.
15:17 <@deen> pragma SYNCHRONOUS=off
15:17 <@deen> > With synchronous OFF (0), SQLite continues without syncing as soon as it has handed data off to the operating system. If the application running SQLite crashes, the data will be safe, but the database might become corrupted if the operating system crashes or the computer loses power before that data has been written to the disk surface. On the other hand, commits can be orders of magnitude faster with 
15:17 <@deen> synchronous OFF.
15:17 <@deen> pragma LOCKING_MODE=exclusive
15:17 <@deen> > When the locking-mode is set to EXCLUSIVE, the database connection never releases file-locks.
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what are u trying to do with player inputs
15:18 <+jxsl13> same as you, noby :D
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :D
15:18 <@deen> maybe you two should work together and start analyzing ddnet teehistorian data for botting and how to detect it
15:19 <@deen> we can provide you with 100 GB of compressed player inputs :D
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think hes making it for zcatch and im making it for fng
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> neither of which would be too helpful for ddnet
15:19 <@deen> too bad
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> this data could be helpful if u can already point to people in it who are confirmed botters
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> otherwise im not sure
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @noby you should invest your knowledge in ddnet
15:20 <@deen> well, we have a few known botters, people are writing lists on ddnet forum
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i thought i remembered reading one of the ddnet admins saying they didnt want automatic bot detection because it would just encourage people to try to make better bots
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Well the Jacky balance bot would be easily detected I guess
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Hacky*
15:21 <@deen> But scanning recordings afterwards to find botters is easier, since we have player input recordings
15:22 <@deen> They can't change their behaviour retrospectively
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> true..
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> hmm i realized my fng server must have teehistorian too because its based on ddnet
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how do i turn this on
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if i was going to detect bots based on this data id start there
15:23 <@deen> sv_tee_historian 1
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ty xd
15:23 <+jxsl13> [15:10:23] @deen:	just set sv_tee_historian 1
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> where does the data get saved to
15:24 <@deen> teehistorian/
15:24 <+jxsl13> I think sqlit ecould be easier to anylayze
15:25 <@deen> jxsl13: we periodically prune them by date, and keep backups, so having files is more convenient for us
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> jxsl13: noby: I'd like to help you integrate teehistorian into your mods if you want
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> teehistorian is already in my fng mod
15:25 <@deen> Or maybe make a Vanilla mod based on DDNet :D
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's one info missing that might be nice for bot detection
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sonix> lol
15:25 <+jxsl13> that could be quite cool, heinrich5991 as I'm quite new to c++ x)
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> namely re-sent inputs
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they only get saved when they change
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yeah that might help
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why is this info ignored
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @noby but that can be added if you want it
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> jxsl13: where does the source code for your mod live?
15:26 <+jxsl13> on my server 
15:27 <@deen> push it to github ;)
15:27 <+jxsl13> do you want an account to the gitea repo?
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> jxsl13: is the git repository public?
15:29 <+jxsl13> ehm, looking for the config x) which could make it open
15:29 <+jxsl13> ls
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (by putting it on github, you'd make sure that it stays open even after you cancel your server ^^)
15:32 <@deen> jxsl13: where did you get the mod from? or you wrote it yourself?
15:32 <+jxsl13> it's teelevision's version of zcatch
15:32 <+jxsl13> with some features added
15:32 <+jxsl13> for now small features
15:58 <+jxsl13> did you get the pm, heinrich5991 ._.?
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eh. wait. let me start the computer with the IRC client
16:13 <+jxsl13> is the teehistorian data formated in JSON ?
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we only have a json header for it, the rest of the data is prolly raw
16:22 <+jxsl13> hm k
16:22 <+jxsl13> ty
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/
16:27 <+jxsl13> ._. why do you ppl hate documenting your stuff xD
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://prntscr.com/iqnp87
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lel
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> jxsl13 what i do most of the time is looking at how other things are done in the code, that will be ur best documentation in ddnet/teeworlds xD
16:28 <+jxsl13> should be more detailed, what gender those transgender ppl now have like transgender, now female :D
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it is detailed already
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 93% are male
16:29 <+jxsl13> would be cool to have more women in tech
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://prntscr.com/iqnrzr
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> smart people don't like children? ^^
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they don't filter by those that usually don't have children by their age I guess?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is a comment after explaining further
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 60% of people with 10+ years of experience have children
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and younger devs not
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://prntscr.com/iqnu5g damn js, when it will die?
16:37 <+jxsl13> it's sad that there is no real alternative to JS :c
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> webasm
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> \o/
16:38 <+jxsl13> it's quite new, tho.. but let's hope
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Paradigm     Imperative, unstructured, expression-oriented
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
16:39 <+jxsl13> xD ok
16:39 <+jxsl13> I just hate weak typing ._. -> JS sucks
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also like more statically typed langs
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> use typescript I think?
16:40 <+jxsl13> that weminds me of WAT
16:40 <+jxsl13> reminds*
16:40 <+jxsl13> classic video from tw channel

16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> most loved language: rust ❤
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://prntscr.com/iqnx4x
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thanks got that linux won
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thanks god that linux won
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 python is the most wanted :D
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ❤
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i should learn rust :O
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 👍
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Rust is a systems programming language"
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what means this?
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> read "like C/C++" 😉
16:42 <+jxsl13> you can code OS 
16:43 <+jxsl13> with it
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Rust is an iron oxide
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is rust as portable as C then?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can click links on wikipedia btw 😄 – systems programming language is linked
16:43 <+jxsl13> rust is hard to learn
16:43 <+jxsl13> :D
16:43 <+jxsl13> but is quit einteresting
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rust probably runs on everything you have programmed far so far
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the logo reminds me of bitcoins
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.rust-lang.org/logos/rust-logo-blk.svg
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
16:46 <+jxsl13> find the mascot
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would be cool if rust (the game) would have been made with rust
16:47 <+jxsl13> crap game :D?
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i had fun with friends time ago
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> now abandoned
16:48 <+jxsl13> full of hackers?
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> didnt see any
16:48 <+jxsl13> hm k
16:48 <+jxsl13> thankfully haven't bought it :D... missing dayz :(
17:04 <@heinrich5991> deen: are you running apt-get on ddnet.tw ATM?
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> as portable as C probably doens't exist 😛
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> C runs on some real weird stuff
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. because hardware producers port C to their platform
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if someone ressurected the LLVM C backend again, we'd have a lot of programming languages that are "as portable as C"
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if someone resurrected the LLVM C backend again, we'd have a lot of programming languages that are "as portable as C"
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heh nim is technically as portable as C
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> doubt some of the more exotic platforms have the entire libc tho
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Question of the day: What does it take to become a developer with triple certification in cloud tchnlg?
17:25 <+jxsl13> a debian vps 
17:33 <+jxsl13> anyone doing anything interesting ?
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looking at rust RFCs
17:34 <+Learath2> imagining a microservice architecture for a cloud project
17:38 <@deen> heinrich5991: nope, but I think it got stuck when I ran it last time, now that you say it :D
17:38 <@deen> also on CHN I think
17:39 <@heinrich5991> I think on all servers
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh damn
17:39 <@heinrich5991> ok, not on all, only on those I checked
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 Nim is NOT as portable as C. They have a defined list of archs and supported C compilers
17:39 <@heinrich5991> ddnet.tw, ger2
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah yeah, it was ger2, not chn
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the last one in my list 😄
17:40 <@heinrich5991> ^^
17:40 <@heinrich5991> it seems they're stuck in a dialog or sth
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nim does not produce standard compliant C code that you can just compile on any platform
17:40 <@heinrich5991> the process names sound like that
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I entered yes and it just hung
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I ctrl-ced, but apparently it kept running
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah forgot that nim uses some interesting stuff
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> should prolly run weekly in a named screen btw

19:08 <@heinrich5991> deen: can I kill the apt process?
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sure
19:10 <@heinrich5991> E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem. 
19:10 <@heinrich5991> I'm doing that now
19:11 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] bors[bot] merged staging into master: https://git.io/vxUAR
19:11 <@heinrich5991> ah, that helped
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 look at thsi 😉

20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> gfx_noclip
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ayyy thx
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ I don't care much about my gpu, sorry for making you worry about that. I think the Linux driver is just broken for it, even 2D terminals render visibly slowly
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well as long its hardware rendered
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its my code
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> now i made the full new font manager
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> want to test it <.<
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, nice
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, I can't test it for some time, probably
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Don't have access to that computer a lot
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 😩
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just merge it and it's ok 😄
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yewah but the pr uses stuff from my current pr
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so i cant create it now
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i also added support for cursor and text marking, but the text input, so if smbd wants to redo the textinput taht can be used too 😄
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i also added support for cursor and text marking, so if smbd wants to redo the textinput taht can be used too 😄
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ it seems to have merge conflicts
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you rebase?
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 fixed :3
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sorta
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 really? github says This branch has no conflicts with the base branch
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but ok
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh true
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nvm
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ stop 😉
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok 😄
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> perfect
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 apparently my cron died for a while, could you check that my teehistorian backups are complete?
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have teehistorian_index deployed?
21:11 <+jxsl13> heinrich5991 , got some time ?
21:11 <@heinrich5991> yes
21:12 <+jxsl13> I have most of the stuff added, not I would like to get that uuid stuff running, but can't compile, because the UUid stuff is unknown, even tho included.
21:13 <+jxsl13> I've got a teehistorian branch in my repo, where the actual snapshot is
21:13 <+jxsl13> could also upload compiler errors 
21:15 <@heinrich5991> show the compiler errors
21:17 <+jxsl13> https://pastebin.com/RrpHx2tK
21:19 <@heinrich5991> you should fix the warnings, too, btw
21:19 <@heinrich5991> they indicate actual problems
21:19 <@heinrich5991> the sizeof ones at least
21:19 <@heinrich5991> jxsl13: you need part of the uuid manager apparently
21:21 <+jxsl13> I have the uuid_manager files in the specific directories
21:31 <@heinrich5991> mh k
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah @heinrich5991 probs my client is crashing since sound loading is not threadsafe when using mem_alloc_debug?
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs the header when it crashes always says sound.cpp
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> gnerally i wonder why this is also used in the graphic thread
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but maybe im blind
21:35 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] bors[bot] merged staging into master: https://git.io/vxTsE
21:37 <@heinrich5991> jxsl13: I first have to get bam 0.4 from somewhere :/
21:38 <+jxsl13> http://matricks.github.io/bam/
21:38 <+jxsl13> 0.4.0 zip
21:44 <+jxsl13> need to fix the system.c/.h stuff first tho x), could not guess that ddnet changed much and droping the ddnet file would break everything
21:44 <+jxsl13> dropping*
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 no don't have th_index
21:57 <@heinrich5991> run it and check whether you have a gap in the dates
22:04 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Jupeyy opened pull request #1081: New buffer system and text renderer to support buffering of hud, text and map components, that are displayed ingame (master...master) https://git.io/vxTck
22:06 <+jxsl13> rip Wofflex q.q
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ^ deffs not thread safe
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 what freetype version does the ci use?
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it says it doesnt know the flag i use
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i appearently need freetype 2.7.1
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does this still happen? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/259
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ why u changed the if () style?
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> because @heinrich5991 wants it so
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i havent changed anything about the process of how chat is build
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> only how its displayed sry :/
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ oh the issue i sent here wasn't meant to have a relation with ur pr xD, nice work btw
23:45 <+jxsl13> heinrich5991 , mind helping :D?
23:45 <+jxsl13> https://i.imgur.com/DP2dNQq.png
23:45 <@heinrich5991> what about MACRO_TUNING_PARAM?
23:45 <+jxsl13> there are two definitions
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is OK
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the file is included multiple times
23:46 <+jxsl13> one in teehistorion.cpp, which takes 4 arguments and mine, which takes 3 arguments
23:46 <+jxsl13> compiler says no :D
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just remove Description in teehistorian
23:46 <+jxsl13> hm k :O
23:51 <+jxsl13> I think the exact same name of macros causes a conflict, where the zCatch macro is needed and the teehistorian macro is actually used. ._.
23:52 <@heinrich5991> this is a case of an X macro
23:52 <@heinrich5991> I think that was the name
23:52 <+jxsl13> if I'm not mistaken, the teehistarian macro is not used anywhere, so maybe change its name?
23:52 <@heinrich5991> anyway, the point is exactly that you can define the same macro several times
23:52 <@heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Macro
23:53 <@heinrich5991> what error does it cause?
23:54 <+jxsl13> https://pastebin.com/QHExJjbA
23:55 <@heinrich5991> this sounds like MACRO_CONFIG_STR_ACCESSLEVEL is causing problems
23:55 <@heinrich5991> wait
23:57 <+jxsl13> so x-macro meaning that it is undefined after usage?
23:59 <@heinrich5991> #define MACRO_CONFIG_INT_ACCESSLEVEL(Name,ScriptName,Def,Min,Max,Flags,Desc,AccessLevel) MACRO_CONFIG_INT(Name,ScriptName,Def,Min,Max,Flags,Desc)
23:59 <@heinrich5991> #define MACRO_CONFIG_STR_ACCESSLEVEL(Name,ScriptName,Len,Def,Flags,Desc,AccessLevel) MACRO_CONFIG_STR(Name,ScriptName,Len,Def,Flags,Desc)
23:59 <@heinrich5991> put these before `#include <engine/shared/config_variables.h>` in teehistorian.cpp
23:59 <@heinrich5991> jxsl13: ^
