00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Zwelf: (if you are still around in freenode) I had an idea yesterday, do you think maybe we could pause teams while saving, instead of killing them and reloading them?
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The reloading seems to be a great place for our resident pentesters to find "features" in
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> pause as in /spec where the tees disappear? or what kind of pause?
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the old kind, as in when pause was first developed
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> freeze in place, no hooks no jumps
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen how did we handle the case when someone used an old save code?
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> right now?
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or before all my reverts?
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> right now you get a new random save code
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> before
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you get saved and instantly reloaded?
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean before the entire rework
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You were in an inbetween-state until the save gets written
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think you could even get a finish and a save from just before the finish
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and if the code exists nothing happened
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah we didn't handle the asynchronous nature of the query at all
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I guess reloading should work as long as we reload everything correctly
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki ^
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 the thing is, the other bug could also be abused before
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 is this performant?
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is performant?
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> evaluating a cubic polynomial?
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> more performant than evaluating an exponential function I guess
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but yes
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's like 32 floating point operations that happen on each render while the smooth zoom is in progress
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's some beautiful code 🙂
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 32 floating point ops doesn't sound bad
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :O
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I like how cubic beziers connect so nicely
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://ddnet.tw/ranks/moderate/3/ the map "Silk Touch" is incorrectly labeled as a 3-player-map
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks, fixing
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 you could overload () instead of Evaluate if you want to be a cool hip C++man
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think I'm good without syntax 😛
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 what controls the curves timescale?
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's always between 0 and 1
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we calculate the float between 0 and 1 in progress
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why? I remember that only being the case because CSS fixed 2 points of the curve
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you also fix those?
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, I use a "bezier curve" in R, not R²
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. I don't have a separate time scale
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just fit a cubic polynomial in a way that matches the current zooming speed, current zoom level, target zoom level and target zoom speed=0
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, I should read more about bezier curves
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't see any definition on wikipedia for cubic bezier curves other than the one that defined the curve using 4 points
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, I use that
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the four points lie in R, not R^2 for me
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I sometimes have trouble visualising these, if the 4 points lie on a line (R) how does it still define a curve?
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in R^2, they are also parametrized using a time
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bernstein_polynomial&oldid=965314973 @Learath2
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you see the four basis vectors b_03, b_13, b_23, b_33?
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> basis vectors of what?
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When did we get to 4 dimensions? 😕
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> basis vectors of polynomials of degree at most 4
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> four other basis vectors would e.g. be 1, x, x², x³
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, didn't know those were called basis vectors
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay sure, we have 1, x, x^2 and x^3 in our cubic
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but we use the bernstein polynomial basis instead
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I see what you mean
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So what property does bernstein polynomial bases have that help us?
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> b_03 is 1 at 0 and 0 at 1
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> b_33 is 0 at 0 and 1 at 1
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so by doing `a * b_03 + d * b_33`
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we get a polynomial that is a at 0 and b at 1
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, so we don't care what happens outside [0,1]?
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah yes
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but you seem to have used more than b_03 and b_33
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for influencing the derivatives at 0 and 1
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's probably a better basis for this than the bernstein basis and I probably even learned about it in numerics
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't remember its name
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=B%C3%A9zier_curve&oldid=962470172#Cubic_B%C3%A9zier_curves
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> here you can see that B is precisely a linear combination of that bernstein basis
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and then you can see the derivative below that
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> plug in 0 and 1 to see how you have to manipulate b and c to get the derivatives yo uwant
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, I see that now, is it a property of bernstein bases to have nice values at 0 and 1?
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's definitely a basis for even nicer values at 0 and 1
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> honestly I don't see what else you could want
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll read up on bernstein polynomials, I wonder what the intent was when coming up with them and how they are generated
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is better I guess
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh we are in a sense fitting a polynomial to data
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
10:59 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> @Learath2 Freezing the tees during the /save operation sounds good (apart from the risk in introducing other bugs). Currently in-air weapon projectiles and laser aren't saved and disappear when loading. I doubt that it can be abused, as it is the same as not firing the weapon at all, but maybe a cheat can be constructed with this mechanic.
11:01 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Maybe we should add a penalty of ~10sec (or even 60sec) for each failed save to reduce the benefit of instant reloading.
11:02 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> And allow saving only every 10 or 60 sec.
11:08 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> I am building a tool to filter out ranks, which abused the "Switches don't reset on solo server"-bug (with my Teehistorian parser and Patiga's Map parser). Maybe we can delete just ranks which abused this bug afterwards.

11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (i believe)
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut check the times, it was broken before
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> tru
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this was an attempt to fix it
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did it fix it?
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seems so but there's still a lot of stuff in our queue
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which is stuck
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I contacted github support

12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Which OS do you want?
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll be much more busy starting tomorrow until probably the end of September
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll still stick around and keep an eye out for questions and bugs but likely not much more than an hour a day
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> :o
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Synonym' | Val We already have `inp_mousesens`
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Synonym' | Val> @Learath2 can i use it in binds ?
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Definitely
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Synonym' | Val> ok thx
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> i want Windows first for test it local on my PC ^^
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> @Trafalgar Law i want Windows first for test it local on my PC ^^ | But for the Server i need it for Linux
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Well, I dont know how it works on windows
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> But on linux download cmake and build it with that
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Mikan I can try to walk you through building it on windows
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You'll have to be a little patient with me though as I don't have access to a windows computer and thus I'd be doing it blind
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> o_
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> o_O by windows i used Virtual Studios 😮
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> u want to try it? via remote o_O?
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh it should be trivial with Visual Studio
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Mikan https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5765 this should still be working
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> though I'm not sure if savanders zcatch is based on ddnet
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> ich wollte zCatch kompilieren this dosnt work or X'D?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> I wanted to compile zCatch, it doesn't work
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> I wanted to compile zCatch, it doesn't work or X'D?
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> i can ddnet copile but how can i import the zCatch gamemode ? the folders and files replace? from the zCatch 'Script'? ^^
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> i can ddnet compile but how can i import the zCatch gamemode ? the folders and files replace? from the zCatch 'Script'? ^^
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can you send me a link to what you are trying to compile, so I can check how it's compiled?
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> sure via pm?
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> https://github.com/savander/teeworlds/tree/zCatch
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah as I suspected this compiles with bam
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can't compile in visual studio like that, try https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything_windows
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> ok i use x64 native tools command promp from visual studio now ^^ it works and now o_O?
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> @Mikan now compile it on linux with the same instruction > https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything_windows
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> but i cant run the server idk what i do :c
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> 
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> Changes to the teeworlds source directory
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> .\bam\bam release

15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> 
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> 
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> idk this
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> its compiles server
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> then u can run by command prompt or whatever else
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/727881987200778240/unknown.png
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> oh nooo
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> i see X'D i have to make a new folder in the directory of teeworlds O_O
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> i put all in the main folder of teeworlds X'D
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> so you can cd <path> and then run ./bam server_release
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> or ./bam conf=release server if first doesnt work
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> with server rls is mean: DDNet-14.0.2-win64
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> wut
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> only serve_release? or i have to replace this?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> only server_release? or i have to replace this?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> no
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> only server_release
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> oki i try my best ^-^ thanks for helping me my english skills are very bad -.-' x'D
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> if you are compilin 0.6 sources you are running it by "./bam server_release"
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> if 0.7 then run by "./bam conf=release server"
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> [string "src/base.lua"]:62: this file for version 0.4.x of bam. you are running 0.5.x.
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> bam: script error (-t for more detail) o_O
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you'll need bam 0.4
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> download bam 0.4.0 huh
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> can who send a URL? google find only ground construction on my langauge x'D
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> os?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Mikan https://matricks.github.io/bam/
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> fast @Soreu xd
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> lovely thanks ❤️
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Mikan Actually, there https://github.com/matricks/bam/releases are more recent versions.
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ^ that profile pic tho
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> X'D
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> it works thanks ❤️ next step: Compiles teeworlds (Client and Server) huh?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you happen to know whether an stl container can pretend to store it's value_type?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wdym, pretend to store its value type?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> @Mikan if it works so you compiled it lol
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can access the value type(?)
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> but i havent svr or client XD
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> wtf
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 say I have a specialization for vector when storing `std::pair`s. `myvector::value_type` would be `std::pair` but can I instead store `pair::first` in one vector and `pair::second` in another vector and have my iterators combine them back?
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> vector can't do that
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because you can get references to elements within
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is such an X, Y question, what I'm really doing is storing the address of a `std::pair` that I got from an `std::unordered_map`
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was wondering the lifetime of the pair the iterator returns
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If the container has to store it's value_type and can't break it up, it's implied that the pair has the same lifetime as the map itself
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm scared that on some implementations the iterator is crafting the pair in some internal memory and returning that, which would be invalidated when I increment the iterator
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> see iterator invalidation
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. no, should not be invalidated
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, your question was slightly different
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but no, I don't think they can be invalidated, the pairs gotten from iterators
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I've looked at this, but wasn't sure if the rules for the iterators getting invalidated applied to what they point to
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> i see by try again, it dont work ;/ | bam: error: a build step failed
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I'm cancelling all the github actions on the staging.tmp branch
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's very laborious
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can do it if you want
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not with a script
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can cancel all builds if that's easier
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not particularly
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and tell me how you did it
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I contacted github support to do that, but they didn't answer yet)
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We probably should add check for [ci skip] in our workflow
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not really supported by github, but I blacklisted staging.tmp now
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `curl -s -H "Authorization: token  OAUTH_TOKEN" "https://api.github.com/repos/ddnet/ddnet/actions/workflows/430159/runs?status=queued&branch=staging.tmp" | jq ".workflow_runs[] | .cancel_url" | xargs -I{} curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: token  OAUTH_TOKEN" {} > /dev/null`
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 in progress?
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Done, also cancelled the in_progress ones
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 how did this happen in the firs place anyway?
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have no clue
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think bors was buggy(?)
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> staging.tmp has never been an issue and [ci skip] was never respected by github actions
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> were we just building those for no reason at all all this time?
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/actions?page=20&query=branch%3Astaging.tmp
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> seems so
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 😄 I love how we both went for page 20
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was also checking the same tihng
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> thing*
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> page 10 was too early
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I remembered the queued stuff being approximately 10 pages long
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hence 20
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should probably add a check for `[ci skip]` in the workflow instead
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> bors faq tells us to ignore the branches
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, that's fine then
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://bors.tech/documentation/getting-started/
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > Your CI system should build the “staging” and “trying” branches, but should not build the “staging.tmp”, “trying.tmp”, or “staging-squash-merge.tmp” branches.
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh that might be why our merges always take so long
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but for some reason the builds got stuck
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in "testing debug"
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it was slowly making it's way through
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean before
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> uhm
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think someone broke it 😄
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see masterserver output
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm all these builds are stuck in debug test
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think the shutdown of the server isn't coming through
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I remember someone "fixing" some console stuff 😄
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> deen touched something about the early startup
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2422 ah here
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 😄 when it failed to build, it got merged by hand
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> seems problematic that our CI is so bad that we think it's the CI and not the commit ^^
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, I can see how this breaks it
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wait how?
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't 😄
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sets m_Running to true in the beginning of CServer::Run
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> shutdown probably sets it to false before that
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, uhm
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can have this one, if you have any idea how to fix it 😄
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess I'll revert it for now so we fix CI & `shutdown`
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll cancel all the builds
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 could you "review" that? ^
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this also reintroduces the uninitialized use btw
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I'm aware
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that UB sounded less bad for the moment than CI pipeline not workign
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, especially since most sane implementations wouldn't completely break
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 can you explain what the issue was?
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well it was deen who debugged it, but I think it was that CacheServerInfo happened before max client being initialized
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `m_NetServer.MaxClients()` isn't set before `m_NetServer.Open()`
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> What's with the GER servers? :justatest:
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> and RUS
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> try $ddos in #bot-cmds
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk, is it lagging for anyone else
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 can you re r+ #2434 ? I missed the `-DANTIBOT=OFF` case
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2434
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Moon> Videorecorder crash while rim rendering
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> CI catched a mistake 🙂
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Moon> 14.1 ver
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Moon> Videorecorder crash while im rendering
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 know a good hex editor?
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> on linux?\
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think I've used any tbh
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The one time I needed it, I used vim and xxd
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I want to run a script as some other user, how2?
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sudo -u user script
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no sudo on the server and I'm running it from php
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (the www-data user can't `sudo -u teeworlds` even if there was sudo)
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is the goal?
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could still use sudo if you have root
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then you can specify that the www-data can only execute that particular script
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a script `~/servers/execute-all.sh` and `~/servers/git-update-files-only.sh` both need to be run as `teeworlds` because that user has access to the ssh key
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like a perfect case for sudo
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh that's how django does it aswell
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (and apparently there is sudo on ddnet.tw)
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> TIL
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, these are all the bugs I'm aware of in sixup. I wont be here much starting tomorrow, so if anyone has anything they want fixed, submit ur request before midnight
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ❤️
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Theres a weird bug with the automated messages, everytime you connect a dummy you get the"Do you know someone who uses a bot?...." sent to you. 
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> only happens on some servers
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> known
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ok
19:54 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 how is the skin support progressing? :)
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mikan> thanks for helping me ❤️ it worked now, special thanks to @Learath2  and @barsik ❤️
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> This bug is super old kek
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Would he funnier if everyone could see it
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah why is that evne a bu
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> even a bug*
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Some dev asked for botter and accidently pasted it in the code
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: #2435
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2435
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 can I get another r+ on #2434? 🤦‍♂️
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2434
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> wtf with languages
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> all words just shuffled
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> now cant to merge translation huh
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why is it so hard to get a non springform cake tin?
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> We should make kill immunity an actual gametile
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @vNikyu / murpi only player id 16 gets this message:troll:
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @n000b hm, no id 15 sends it. but I get this message even on low pop servers with like 5 or 6 players in it
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Ah yeah that is what i meant:pepeH:
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Well that is possible of course
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Well that is possible ofcourse
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> not a big deal 😄 people reported it to me and I just redirected it here
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> because the ddnet server always sends the message from id 15 everytime you connect but before sending players info so your client doesnt render it
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> unless its a dummy and ur client has playerinfos for id 15
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @murpi does that also appear with newest ddnet?
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @heinrich5991 yes it appears since the big replay bot abuse
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the messages appearing might have been fixed with some recent ddnet release (less than a week ago)
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> what client even renders messages with no player info
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> is the message still relevant
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @heinrich5991 just randomly did with latest client
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/727970892595855420/screenshot_2020-07-01_21-35-52.png
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> and as always he has id 15
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> time/rank requests can be spammed without penalty :feelsbadman:
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> you can't even mute them with muteid
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :Trollet:
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @vNikyu / murpi probably because of Zwelfs threadsafe SQL interaction
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen @Learath2 you might want to fix it? Just pass the caller client id to SendChatTarget for /rank and /time (and the others like /rankteam etc)
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/727984114027724850/image0-5.jpg
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut if you even know the fix, why not just commit it lmeo
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not on the pc
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wait, isn't /rank supposed to go out to everyone?
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/21c338ad4ae46e7f35d12f38f18a76b2d9e442fa/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L2146
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `if (i != ClientID && Server()->IsSixup(ClientID))`
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> yes, you can flood the entire chat without penalty
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> IsSixup(i) i mean*
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doesn't matter @fokkonaut it's a protocol7 message, template magic makes sure it only goes to sixup clients
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> really?
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then please remove all other checks for protocol7 msgs xd
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I removed all the ones I could find that were simple to remove
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @murpi but before the changes Zwelf made, wasn't /rank going out to everyone?
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao I think we should require all maps to be licensed under CC-BY-SA or similar going forward
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 it always went to everyone
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> CC-BY should also be fine for us, no?
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao yes jao we should
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or similar
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also CC0
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes CC0 public domain best
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but CC-BY-SA would also be fine by DDNet
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> IMO
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut so what's missing is a rate limit, not the target being wrong
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 yeah definitely, if the author wants it to be sharealike, it's his decision
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i did not talk about the target
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 the last arg for SendChat is SpamprotectionClientID
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which is -1 by default
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You said `SendChatTarget` which has no SpamProtection 😄
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was confused
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Sorry :D
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Under German law, if there is any kind of creativity involved, however minimal, then the photograph produced enjoys protection as a "Lichtbildwerk" -- literally, a "light image work" -- and is not in the public domain.
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170612/09194237572/multiple-german-courts-rule-photos-public-domain-works-are-not-public-domain.shtml
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> germany dislikes public domain
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, can't you give up your rights on it?
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can license as CC0
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you just can't claim that you didn't make it
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/727989754913882162/unknown.png
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is so stupid
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> german law
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "you just can't claim that you didn't make it"
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why i dont have the right to claim its not made by me
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kinda defeats the purpose of public domain
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or @heinrich5991 ^^, you can also approve it 😛
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki hm, I think the photograph thing makes sense.
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> HMM
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/727994618863681546/screenshot_2020-07-01_23-10-06.png
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like if I take a cool photograph of a public domain statue in the sunset, just because the statue is public it shouldn't make my photograph the property of the public
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have an idea, lets ban the people who abuse it
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That should stop the spam
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> U
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> it was a test
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> just a test :troll:
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> its ok as long as your name is "test"
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> Teeworlds is opening in resolution too big so can't see settings, is there anyway someone could help me please ?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ImJustANobody wait what? 😄
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how is this any differnt than people just spamming chat normally without commands
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> u get muted for spamming normally
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby you can't spam fast enough without getting muted
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> normally u get mute for too many sql commands with chatprint
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ddnet mutes u for spamming commands too fast too?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ofc
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby only for commands that output to all
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and for some reason, /lock
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> no it doesnt
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> see screen
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :troll:
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> never understood that one
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah I guess it goes out to your whole team
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @Learath2 cuz SP Zombietroll used to use /lock to spam people somehow
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ZombieTurtle ruining the fun for everyone
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> no hes making big fun
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> wasnt me
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @ImJustANobody remove your settings_ddnet.cfg or copy paste gfx_screen_width 800 & gfx_screen_height 600 in f1
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> for everyone that isnt athe one whos been annoyed
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it works lol
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/727995526712262776/Screen_Shot_2020-07-01_at_4.13.50_PM.png
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How many different troll emojis do you even
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> zombieturtle
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> did i spam /lock
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> i cant remember
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> i remember /invite
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can always spam if you are not ranked, "not ranked" only goes out to you
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> too much :feelsbad:
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> @onby if they have no rank it doesnt get sent to everyone
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh xd
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> ive helped find so many bugs i cant remember them all :pepe:
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> troll
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If someone could give #2437 a quick review I can deploy it before I fall asleep 😄
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2437
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> zombietroll reported the ; abuse in forum and ddnet didnt care
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> then he started to make people suicide with 200 minutes and it was fixed quick
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> not just /rank
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> also other commands like /points
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> no proof that was me
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> can confirm zombietroll is the reason why various bugs are fixed on fng too
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> i would never kill people on purpose
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> big proof
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u didnt
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> they killed themsleves
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :troll:

23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao is there a way to run python code on @DDNet through a chat command?
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "can I have rce pls"
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well there is already RCE, what's a little more
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> send RCE pls
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> i promise i wont tell it to anyone
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Only people with supreme leader jao permissions can use $exec
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> exec banall.txt
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> exec /dev/random
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ZombieToad noob
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> u
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> saying noob to u is like pinging
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> exec rm -rf --no-preserve-root /
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good joke
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I noticed there's an updated version of DejaVuSans (the font tw uses) from 2016, the one currently in the client is from 2011 so maybe it could be updated
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ^ superior

23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `:(){ :|:& };:`
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 there is $eval but it’s for me only since u can do anything with it
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> $exec wget https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/zipbomb/zbxl.zip && unzip zbxl.zip
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> now that I think about it, leaving that link out in the open isn't the best of ideas
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I noticed there's an updated version of DejaVuSans (the font tw uses) from 2016, the one currently in the client is from 2011 so maybe it could be updated https://github.com/dejavu-fonts/dejavu-fonts/releases
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ravie we could if anyone remembers by which process we embedded our glyphs into the PUA
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> can't you just replace the font file? The license seems to have stayed exactly the same
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> from what I can see there are some new symbols and small fixes, mostly on letters from weird languages
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ravie but we have our own symbols in the Private Use Area, I don't remember how we put them there
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> > also other commands like /points
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut they are handled at the same place
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh ok
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Havent checked the new codr
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> also, if we add more symbols we lose compat with 0.6 vanilla
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen really?
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought we were the ones that inserted the new glyphs, not vanilla
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in the sense that server sends a symbol, shows up fine in ddnet
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I see
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for gui only it's probably fine
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I don't think any of the new symbols are really useful, but there are some small improvements and corrections on other symbols too
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think I also saw some emoji was added
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> generally sounds fine to me
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> `we have our own symbols in the Private Use Area, I don't remember how we put them there` probably with a font editing program like FontForge, I don't have much experience with making fonts but I've dabbled in it before
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would be nice if we could automate this tbh
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but we can definitely do it with a font editor too
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's also possible to make svg symbols and put them in a font file if that could ever be useful, maybe for some gui elements
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, we needed one actually recently
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think I've seen someone suggesting svg icons before but there's no svg support or whatever
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a globe for the learn tab
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> only /points still needs spam protection, /saytimeall has spam protection already applied
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> globe should be for internet tab imo
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> forearn maybe a book
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A book with a bookmark inside for the learn tab?
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for learn
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> @murpi Thank you so much, much appreciated 🙂
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> you're welcome 😄
