02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @nuborn do you have an idea on how to fix this problem? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4654#issuecomment-1029543059
05:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Auxias> Hey guys, I'm new to this dev part, I was wondering if we have an API to get player/map data, guessing that one exists for all the data I can see on the website itself but is that data public in any way? Would love to use data just as a personal project
05:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <furo> The data is available in both csv and sql. 
05:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <furo>

05:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <furo> https://ddnet.tw/stats/ddnet-sql.zip
05:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <furo> https://ddnet.tw/stats/ddnet.sqlite.zip
05:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <furo> (@Auxias)
05:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Auxias> Awesome! Thanks
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eeetadam 2> ji
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eeetadam 2> hi
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eeetadam 2> add 4 team
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eeetadam 2> 4 team fng
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eeetadam 2> 4 team vanila
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eeetadam 2> 4 team ctf and 4 team DM
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 4 team fng exists
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eeetadam 2> ok
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> ^
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> would make testing / mapping easier
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> Maybe the client is doing something with the number of jumps, I can try to take a look later today
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> who with intel opengl bug wants to test if vulkan runs without the bug, i think it was ez to reproduce by joining Multeasymap and jump around
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> I remember an isGrounded() method exist somewhere. It could help about disabling air jump maybe.
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Ye IsGrounded() is a CCharacter function
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <esk> guys does anyone know why when i execute this it doesnt hook or switch to weapon 1
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <esk> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/939108369103454268/unknown.png
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> weapon switch has delay
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> and hook cant be really executed from files
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> you need a standard bind for hook to work
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <esk> thx

14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://ddnet.tw/players/?json2=deen , for /maps/ I wanted to create it but have not yet. But there is https://api.teeworlds.cn/ddnet/maps/Fiji which translates the website into json I believe?
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and also for ranks: https://api.teeworlds.cn/ddnet/players/?server=chn

14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> i like watching factorio but i hate playing it
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> my brain is too smooth
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> :(
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> does the client receive other information when someone else joined the game? besides the "x entered and joined the game" message
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> maybe some information with the ClientID of whoever entered?
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> does the client receive other information when someone else joined the game? besides the "x entered and joined the game" system message
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it can notice that a new player appeared in the snapshot @Cipy29
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> but is there also some sort of last_joined/last_left variable too? or would i have to figure that out by checking the snapshot
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think you have to keep track of that yourself
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> ah ok, i'll probably just use the system message
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> How to make Tees free zoom-in zoom-out on my Gamemode?

17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> uh that looks cool Jupstar ✪
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Some of you is testing with Windows 11?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no why?
18:05 <+ChillerDragon> @deen did you change anything else than the build.yaml file to get the new vs? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/1199fd6aa39d0dca3b3568a29167ea925d06db37

18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> strawhat deen again xd
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he fixed your client name for you
20:00 <+ChillerDragon> thats 
20:01 <+ChillerDragon> aaa lag
20:01 <+ChillerDragon> thats diff to upstream i only changed the client name thats all so i wonder why my pipeline cant find the vs version
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> the download skin option is on the client or server side? (maybe both?)
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <furo> If it's checked, the client will contact the server defiened by cl\_skin\_download\_url (https://skin.ddnet.tw/skin/) to see if it has it and download it from there.

21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> ok, i guess that's why @RuF0 has a problem, he's playing on a server which maybe dont has this feature
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <furo> It's all client side... What's the problem?
