23:36 < goo> taking a quick break, was compiling the server on windows, but had 1 error, 
23:36 < goo> thanks :D
23:36 < goo> making minesweeper game
23:36 <@deen> Sounds like a university project
23:36 < goo> it is
23:37 < goo> in the laser.cpp, what round function was used? not a teeworlds built one?
23:38 <@deen> Aaaah
23:38 <@deen> That problem
23:38 <@deen> Well, I had to rename the round function
23:38 <@deen> So it would work with VS2013
23:38 <@deen> or something
23:38 <@deen> I don't know exactly, but I did the same as they did in vanilla teeworlds
23:39 < goo> aha, so it doesnt work with 2010, but with 2013?
23:39 <@deen> I don't know!
23:39 <@deen> I don't have either
23:39 < goo> lol
23:39 <@deen> I compile using gcc on Windows, haha
23:40 <@deen> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10769
23:40 <@deen> That was the issue
23:41 <@deen> Or not
23:41 < goo> then i will try rename the function back
23:41 <@deen> ok
23:41 < goo> i use vs2010 still
23:41 <@deen> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1170
23:53 < goo_> somehow i timed
23:53 <@deen> i see
23:53 < goo_> didnt get anything anything after i said im renaming
23:53 <@deen> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1170
23:54 < goo_> so yes, just those few in laser.cpp needs to be renamed
23:54 <@deen> Oh wait
23:54 <@deen> I forgot to rename them?
23:54 <@deen> Yeah!
23:54 <@deen> My bad
23:56 < goo_> well, bug fixed xD
23:56 < goo_> not sure if build failed on linux though?
23:56 <@deen> Nope, didn't
23:57 <@deen> compiling on many systems every few days
23:57 <@deen> and it always worked with gcc
23:59 < goo_> but its odd that it worked
23:59 < goo_> maybe it used built in c++ round
