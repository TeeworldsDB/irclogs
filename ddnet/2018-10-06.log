01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> client crashes while mapping. im pissed
03:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A bug is reported without context or a way to reproduce. I'm pissed
03:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does it just randomly crash?
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Learath2 just ask them to run their client in debug mode with a bt when crashing to be sure to get something
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum the problem is probably that you lost some work due to this, right?
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe we could make sure that one doesn't lose work even if the client crashed and one hasn't saved in a while
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yes thats right. and i can activate that thing that it automaticly saves every second or so but i wa told thats buggy and could possibilly cause more damage to a map
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we have such a thing? ^^
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yes
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> and there was a menu so you could go back in case you made a mistake
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> idk remember what it was called or in which version it was
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, undo probably
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, I can guess that that might be buggy
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it still exists. cl_editorundo 1    but its not activated by defalut
14:19 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/compare/0.6...heinrich5991:fix-0.6
14:20 <@heinrich5991> I tried adding tokens in a clean way, ddnet handshake can be supported in parallel to this
14:20 <@heinrich5991> I tried keeping reflectability of the handshake and the legacy handshake to a minimum
14:22 <@heinrich5991> deen: Learath2: eeeee: I'd be interested in opinions about "Add tokens to the protocol", "Add a backward compatible handshake" and especially "Add ratelimits for the legacy handshake "
14:22 <@heinrich5991> I'm not sure about the default rate limits I put in place, I put the reasoning for them in the commit message
14:27 <@heinrich5991> maybe also fstd: ^ :)
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> Does someone knows the cling project
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> Yute
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this one? https://github.com/root-project/cling? no I don't
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> Sure
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @heinrich5991 yeah this one, looks cool
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> https://root.cern.ch/cling
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds cool
16:55 <@heinrich5991> oh god, centos 6 (still maintained) only has cmake 2.8.12…
16:57 <@heinrich5991> slackware 14.0 (also still maintained…) only has 2.8.8
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> just cheat :v)
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> use centos7 repo & install the latest :v)
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> CentOS sucks  hard
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> No u just too noob for that distro
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> u use ubungay :v)
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> help, ive got weird freezes of my teeworlds client: if im ingame and update the serverbrowser using the menu in the esc menu the client freezes for 4 times (about 1 sec each time)
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> help, ive got weird freezes of my teeworlds client: if im ingame and update the serverbrowser using the menu in the esc menu the client freezes for 4 times (about 1 sec each time)
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> edit: also in the browser itself, not just ingame. (only appears at about 97%)
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ye expected that once
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i thought my pc gonna have blue death
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Cellegen blue SCREEN OF death
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> client crash on win7
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> when there's an unsaved map in the editor
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and you quit from server
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> can reproduce it 100%
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> go to a server, load current map, change few tiles on game layer
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> quit directly, client will crash
