16:40 <+xandaros> So, I started doing some mapping recently and, frankly, the editor is shit. It's not really specific to ddnet, but would you be interested if I improved the editor a bit?
16:43 <+xandaros> Features I am thinking of in particular: Undo+redo, editing multiple layers at once, editing properties of multiple layers at once (esp. resizing), deleting what's currently under the brush or maybe delete it while selecting and holding a key or something. (Point being to move stuff, not copy it)
16:47 <@EastByte> I guess every ddnet mapper would be interested in such features, but you should probably create a topic in the forums since there aren't many mappers in this irc channel
16:51 <+xandaros> Alright, guess I shall do that, then. I found some info on an undo function on the website, but I can't actually find it. Information on the editor is actually pretty sparse, I find
16:53 <+ochristi> please no dos, I am playing
17:01 <+ochristi> is all traffic to GER nullrouted, for how long?
17:04 <@EastByte> it's about 5 minutes per filter
