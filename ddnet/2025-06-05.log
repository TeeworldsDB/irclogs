00:01 < bridge> <gorp_tw> or we can just put an ID on the main website body tag, either works
00:02 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i just cant do any markup changes without every template
00:05 < bridge> <gorp_tw> index.php can be drastically simplified as well, there's a lot of duplication
00:15 < bridge> <gorp_tw> afaict skins/index.php does not need to be a PHP template
00:15 < bridge> <gorp_tw> it's HTML/JS with some inline CSS
00:17 < bridge> <gorp_tw> ah it's an include
00:22 < bridge> <gorp_tw> _assets or _uploads for the name of included images in posts?
00:22 < bridge> <gorp_tw> _assets or _uploads for the directory name of included images in posts?
00:23 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i think _uploads is more correct, since they are only used in per-post pages
00:32 < bridge> <gorp_tw> facebook page hasnt been used since 2022, are we still supporting the link to this?

03:50 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i barely use rust idk how it works properly
03:51 < bridge> <Ewan> it should error but cmake in visual studio is hard to navigate
03:51 < bridge> <Ewan> it may be easier to weed out on the command line

03:51 < bridge> <Ewan> if u went into tools>developer cmd and did cmake ‚Äîbuild i think it‚Äôd be clearer
03:51 < bridge> <Ewan> oh weird
03:51 < bridge> <Ewan> are you on 32 bit windows
03:52 < bridge> <12944qwerty> no
03:52 < bridge> <12944qwerty> lemme double chekc
03:52 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i shouldn't bee
03:52 < bridge> <Ewan> it might just be the target arch in the top dropdown
03:52 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i shouldn't be
03:52 < bridge> <Ewan> ur on x86 instead of 64
03:52 < bridge> <Ewan> wherever it says run whatever
03:53 < bridge> <12944qwerty> nope i'm on 64 bit
03:53 < bridge> <12944qwerty> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1380001480827867257/image.png?ex=68424a08&is=6840f888&hm=20f2bf4f226b5be94cb758d97d01894a75d43d5071fafe734c7256dab2ac1501&
03:53 < bridge> <Ewan> both os and target?
03:53 < bridge> <12944qwerty> oh you mean config
03:53 < bridge> <12944qwerty> uh
03:54 < bridge> <Ewan> vs under cmake is a multi-config generator you should be able to change the target arch without reconfiguring if you have multiple options there
03:54 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i'm doing vsc not vs btw
03:54 < bridge> <Ewan> oh
03:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i‚Äôd recommend msys2 ngl
03:55 < bridge> <Ewan> same deal in vscode tho edit ur launch config json or whatever
03:57 < bridge> <12944qwerty> now i've got other unresolved symbosl
03:57 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i didn't want to use vs lmao
04:03 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs not great
04:03 < bridge> <Ewan> but you are using the visual studio generator under cmake
04:04 < bridge> <Ewan> for msbuild
04:08 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yeah
04:08 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i've never done c stuff on windows before
04:08 < bridge> <12944qwerty> but i don't feel like using my mac since i play ddnet on my desktop
04:34 < bridge> <12944qwerty> anyone recognize this/why it keeps happening
04:34 < bridge> <12944qwerty> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1380011901026832434/image.png?ex=684253bc&is=6841023c&hm=75a30e85143ac87d4e3cec951a9d2358ca4400a4b2447bfcbde352e5ad5e172a&
04:50 < bridge> <Ewan> i could explain the semantics of the issue but not the specific cause
04:51 < bridge> <Ewan> in principle the symbols that are unresolved come from a .obj or .rlib file which is intended to be in the build directory at the time the linker is run
04:52 < bridge> <Ewan> those mangled names are from headers generated by rust code for the FFI and indicate the build for that portion has failed, if you‚Äôre missing those symbols
05:06 < bridge> <12944qwerty> rust why you be like this
05:07 < bridge> <Ewan> it rly doesn't say?
05:07 < bridge> <Ewan> cmake can find rust, right?
05:07 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yeah
05:07 < bridge> <12944qwerty> it should
05:07 < bridge> <12944qwerty> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1380020290028830790/image.png?ex=68425b8c&is=68410a0c&hm=70efc726848068a2a3e523198b3404defe13cbdc9d61bd45fbe97ee5f131fe9a&
05:07 < bridge> <12944qwerty> could this be something
05:10 < bridge> <Ewan> Yes
05:10 < bridge> <Ewan> can you see the cmake output
05:10 < bridge> <Ewan> can you see the rust compiler output at all?
05:10 < bridge> <Ewan> cant u cd into the location you're building it from and run cmake just to scroll through and see the process chronologically
05:17 < bridge> <12944qwerty> uh
05:19 < bridge> <12944qwerty> it just shows me the same thing
05:20 < bridge> <12944qwerty> that is the cmake output
05:23 < bridge> <12944qwerty> what is cmake suposed to be because I don't have a cmake command and the cmake extension uses `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin\cmake.exe`
05:24 < bridge> <Ewan> bcs youre using visual studio build tools all your commands are in there
05:24 < bridge> <Ewan> you have to run the rigbt right vcvars script
05:25 < bridge> <Ewan> on msys2 u can just use pacman and it integrates very well with vscode
05:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i think those are the default build instructions anyway
05:26 < bridge> <12944qwerty> have you tried wsl?
05:26 < bridge> <Ewan> yes but it accomplishes something else
05:27 < bridge> <Ewan> that doesnt make windows binaries
05:27 < bridge> <Ewan> that makes linux binaries that run under wsl
05:27 < bridge> <Ewan> msys2 offers a similar emulation layer for linux apis through cygwin but mostly only the build tools that really need it are the ones using it
05:28 < bridge> <Ewan> but most packages are in the ucrt64 environment which uses the windows universal c runtime and it's just as if it was compiled with visual studio in that respect
05:28 < bridge> <Ewan> the only difference is the compiler
05:41 < bridge> <12944qwerty> hm, so i can now install linux binaries and it will compile ddnet to windows instead?

06:23 < bridge> <pioooooo> looks correct idk.. I encountered a similar issue before and I forgot how I solved it
06:23 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I have to push it down piggybacking on elements that come before it
06:25 < bridge> <gorp_tw> kinda funny/misc thing, on the live site this image has so much dead space on the right side of it that in order for it to appear "flush" with the main container it overlaps the page, that's why in my examples (and in this screenshot showing the border) it seems farther left
06:25 < bridge> <gorp_tw> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1380039865579864084/image.png?ex=68426dc7&is=68411c47&hm=8fd9a291807bca7c1b19564ce3cac83b73885497cb601fc532e7180ab0ed0c6c&
06:26 < bridge> <gorp_tw> it was making some elements of some pages hard to click
06:28 < bridge> <gorp_tw> oh and i styled this tiny little thing on the corner of the Points Calculation explanation, it's a pretty nice button, we should use it in more blocks like this

06:30 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I had the idea also to colorize some stuff like stats but, imo it's outside of the scope of this PR, i just wanted to change the look of things without introducing extra logic

06:33 < bridge> <pioooooo> what command did you use to configure cmake
06:34 < bridge> <pioooooo> have you tried ninja as generator? since it seems you are currently using msbuild
06:37 < bridge> <12944qwerty> just used the extension cmake tools and then cmake configure cmmmand
06:37 < bridge> <12944qwerty> and now cmake build
06:37 < bridge> <12944qwerty> and now cmake build/run w/o debug
06:38 < bridge> <pioooooo> use cmake show configure command
06:38 < bridge> <aliaxy> !
06:40 < bridge> <gorp_tw> alternate row colors like the finished maps list would be nice here
06:40 < bridge> <gorp_tw> everywhere really
06:42 < bridge> <aliaxy> oh wait this actually work rn?
06:42 < bridge> <gorp_tw> These are examples of what it would look like after I merge everything
06:42 < bridge> <12944qwerty> what am i looking for (apparently no command, but I can look at this CmakeCache file)
06:44 < bridge> <pioooooo> uh i have this tho..

06:44 < bridge> <gorp_tw> if anyone wants to preview themselves: https://userstyles.world/style/22669
06:44 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i don't see that
06:44 < bridge> <12944qwerty> nvm
06:45 < bridge> <aliaxy> I really want that highlighted and borders
06:45 < bridge> <rootjie> thats cute i like that :owo:
06:45 < bridge> <gorp_tw> you think the contrast is alright? i was messing with it for a long time
06:46 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i kept getting "jumpscared" by it trying to scroll down and not expecting it
06:46 < bridge> <12944qwerty> ok using the command it gave, this is the output:

06:46 < bridge> <gorp_tw> but then it was too low to even be noticable
06:46 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I should probably add borders to the sides of tables too

06:47 < bridge> <gorp_tw> feels like now half the site is abiding by this "bubble box container" style and some places aren't
06:48 < bridge> <pioooooo> i actually just wanted to check what is the command.. can you try change `-G ""` to `-G "Ninja"` and run again
06:50 < bridge> <rootjie> probably bcs most of everything else has kind of a darker tone and this with the text is more lighter, but i honestly think it looks nice when its standing out

07:51 < bridge> <louis> the acyual headers could probably be stylized a bit tbf
08:15 < bridge> <pioooooo> for me i have these, with the ddnet one specified in file `/other/vscode/ddnet-cmake-tools-kits.json`. you can try create a preset with MSVC and change preferredGenerator to Ninja. after that you can try to see what command does the build system actually fails at
08:18 < bridge> <12944qwerty> I'm not at my computer anymore but is the other folder something you made?
08:18 < bridge> <12944qwerty> Oh is ddnet-cmake-tools-kit your preset location or smth else
08:37 < bridge> <pioooooo> it's something preset provided by ddnet
08:37 < bridge> <pioooooo> it's some preset comes with the source code
08:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki Hello mr llvm pro, I hve a quston, is this https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/3172c618956c0523846a98c3c5044df5a4b551b2/llvm/lib/Target/X86/GISel/X86InstructionSelector.cpp#L629-L683 the function which turns generic `G_STORE` instruction into machine specific one(using Global Isel)?
08:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> For example:
08:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```llvm
08:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     %0:gpr(p0) = G_FRAME_INDEX %stack.0.b
08:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     G_STORE %1(s64), %0(p0) :: (store (s64) into %ir.b)
08:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
08:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
08:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> into
08:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
08:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```llvm
08:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     MOV64mr %stack.0.b, 1, $noreg, 0, $noreg, %1 :: (store (s64) into %ir.b)
08:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
09:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @patiga: how does peer to peer even work? How do clients know who to contact and how can they talk to each other if both are behind NAT like many households
09:53 < bridge> <patiga> its not a serious project, it only needs to work in a local network. also for discovery its alright to need to know a peer that's already in the network
10:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why would you wrap TcpStream into an arc anyway?
10:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'd split them into read & write.
10:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Now the question would be do you like to have a single write _thread_ or can multiple tasks call to write?
10:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then you'd need to think about using a mpsc or a mutex from tokio.
10:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But in any way you need mutable access to the write stream
10:06 < bridge> <patiga> I wasn't aware of split, but yea that one sounds right. Yesterday I created those beautiful types
10:06 < bridge> <patiga> ```rs
10:06 < bridge> <patiga> type TcpReceiver = SymmetricallyFramed<FramedRead<OwnedReadHalf, LengthDelimitedCodec>, Event, SymmetricalJson<Event>>;
10:06 < bridge> <patiga> type TcpSender = Arc<Mutex<SymmetricallyFramed<FramedWrite<OwnedWriteHalf, LengthDelimitedCodec>, Event, SymmetricalJson<Event>>>>;
10:06 < bridge> <patiga> ```
10:06 < bridge> <patiga> Not sure if those will continue to work or if I have to modify them some time
10:06 < bridge> <patiga> I think multiple tasks being able to write makes the code less complex
10:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Apparently tokio even has an example for a immutable write stream:
10:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/net/struct.TcpStream.html#examples-12
10:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Doesn't look fancy but might save you a mutex
10:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Question is anyway if you need your packets in order etc.
10:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I honestly didn't read your requirements exactly xd
10:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Looks hot üòâ
10:08 < bridge> <patiga> if its immutable, wouldn't it also cause writes to interleave?
10:08 < bridge> <Assa> can tcp pakets come out of order in the first place? AFAIK not
10:08 < bridge> <Assa> only if your protocol allows for this, but not tcp itself
10:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It returns how many bytes were written, so yes, it might only send a part
10:09 < bridge> <patiga> user space programs are not aware of the concept of packets in tcp, afaik
10:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ig you need a mutex or a mpsc somewhere.. true
10:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah it's only about when you send them in your own program
10:10 < bridge> <Assa> ok fair
10:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @patiga but sounds interesting. Do you create something like a VPN peer-to-peer? 
10:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or something teeworlds related?
10:33 < bridge> <Assa> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10313> might also 'fix' the demo rendering bug. It doesn't fix the issue, that the rendering might crash on invalid data, but may be the cause of invalid data on some systems (while windows was running fine)
10:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> #10313
10:34 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10313
10:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> All systems we use are little endian
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> big endian is like super exotic nowadays
10:39 < bridge> <Assa> huh turns out I have no clue. I know that a lot of network stuff needs to be converted into big endian, because this caused a lot of problems for me, but this shouldn't cause the issue here
10:55 < bridge> <Assa> Tested the demo on 19.2.1, and now also windows crashes ü§î
11:03 < bridge> <patiga> nah not that exciting, its a rather simple peer-to-peer group chat
11:21 < bridge> <Assa> This doesn't make sense. Why does 19.2.1 crash on windows with the demo while 19.2 doesn't, when I am on little endian and the change should have no effect?
11:22 < bridge> <Assa> There is no other commit that should be causing this: <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/compare/19.2...19.2.1>
11:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Different memory layout maybe, crashes are random. Test both versions with ASAN.
13:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Hey, I have a C++ project which uses 3DiVi library(https://docs.3divi.ai), to use it you need to install SDK using their installer. I want to make a github workflow which will deploy new versions of the project, my question is how do I get this SDK in a github action runner?
14:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> anything i can do to help progress #9787 ?
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If the installer supports nogui mode, download & install.
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else check if you can use an extractor
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else extract it locally upload it somewhere and download that extracted version
14:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i tried to open the installer in tty, it crashed
14:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the lib is in no package manager??
14:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yea... with only a few components it's 7 gb üò¨
14:23 < bridge> <robyt3> Try an extractor like https://github.com/Bioruebe/UniExtract2

15:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> where did you place 131?
15:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i checked the spot you shared in the screenshot there is none

17:35 < bridge> <robyt3> Does 19.2 even contain your maplayer rendering changes yet? :thonk:
17:39 < bridge> <Assa> no it doesn't
17:39 < bridge> <Assa> wait which ones do you mean?
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But assa also means the invalid demo
17:39 < bridge> <Assa> pipeline? no, rest, yes
17:39 < bridge> <Assa> pipeline? no. Rest, yes
17:39 < bridge> <Assa> pipeline? no. rest? yes
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The question is, do we need to patch this
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Does the crash cause invalid reads that cause further dmg somewhere?
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> E.g. does a draw call depend on it
17:47 < bridge> <robyt3> Have you tried ASAN yet?
17:51 < bridge> <Assa> nope :justatest:
17:52 < bridge> <Assa> The only point in following this is, if we figure out how or why the map data is invalid and detecting/fixing this. And I am not sure we can do this
17:54 < bridge> <robyt3> Why are we doing `TileLayerCounter - X` anyway in the `RenderTilelayerWithTileBuffer` function? Of course that can go into the negative of the number of tile layers is low
17:55 < bridge> <robyt3> Why are we doing `TileLayerCounter - X` anyway in the `RenderTilelayerWithTileBuffer` function? Of course that can go into the negative if the number of tile layers is low
17:55 < bridge> <Assa> it stores the tile layer counter from the vector after `OnMap`, which is 0 if the data is invalid, and then goes into the negative, yes
17:56 < bridge> <robyt3> So `m_vvLayerCount[g][l]` already contains the invalid value?
17:56 < bridge> <Assa> yes, it contains 0
17:57 < bridge> <Assa> I already posted a solution for this in the issue
17:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Then I guess you should `continue` at the beginning of the `for` loop for `l`
17:57 < bridge> <Assa> the vector is resized before the loop with 0 as value
17:58 < bridge> <Assa> so we never put a 0 there, it was already present, because we NEVER put a value there
17:58 < bridge> <robyt3> I mean in `OnRender` before you try to use the invalid value
17:58 < bridge> <robyt3> Then you should skip the entire layer
17:59 < bridge> <Assa> oh yeah, that'd be even smarter üòÑ
17:59 < bridge> <Assa> oh yeah, that'd be even smarter üòÑ doesn't fix OpenGL 1 tho
18:00 < bridge> <Assa> can't work for opengl 1, because this vector is never initialized for it
18:01 < bridge> <robyt3> Then it should never be used?
18:01 < bridge> <Assa> Instead I would actually go with the pipeline, it doesn't do render counting and early detects, that there is an invalid layer and doesn't put it into the pipeline

19:48 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i installed clang with llvm to get clang
19:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Generally, google "MSYS2 (toolname)"
19:49 < bridge> <12944qwerty> right sorry
19:51 < bridge> <12944qwerty> looking good so far
19:52 < bridge> <12944qwerty> nooo it failed on the last few steps
19:52 < bridge> <12944qwerty> configuring worked, building didn't
19:53 < bridge> <12944qwerty> msys2/bin/windres.exe preprocessing failed
19:56 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, you can't use ninja with msys2
19:56 < bridge> <robyt3> need to use make
19:57 < bridge> <robyt3> because the window resource compiler is a mess
19:57 < bridge> <robyt3> because the windows resource compiler is a mess

19:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> absolute troll
19:58 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> second time now
19:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> didnt u say use discord
19:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> previous time
19:59 < bridge> <qxdfoxy> someone did
19:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> k
19:59 < bridge> <12944qwerty> going in circles rn omg. so if not ninja, then what?
19:59 < bridge> <robyt3> `Unix Makefiles`
20:00 < bridge> <robyt3> Delete the build folder and regenerate with makefiles
20:00 < bridge> <robyt3> Unfortunately, ninja doesn't work with windres. Would be great to fix it though, because make is significantly slower
20:00 < bridge> <12944qwerty> what's ddnet-mingw for
20:01 < bridge> <robyt3> Where do you see that?
20:01 < bridge> <12944qwerty> other\vscode\ddnet-cmake-tools-kits.json
20:02 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i named it that when moving that file to cmakepresets.json
20:02 < bridge> <12944qwerty> `[DDNet] Crosscompile for Windows using MinGW`
20:02 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't know. I use cmake-gui and and command line to build
20:04 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i can't find unix makefiles... I've found msys and mingw makefiles but not unix makefiles
20:06 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i'm probably blind
20:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Are you using cmake-gui?
20:07 < bridge> <12944qwerty> no
20:07 < bridge> <12944qwerty> vscode cmake tools
20:09 < bridge> <robyt3> Either use cmake-gui https://packages.msys2.org/packages/mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake-gui or just use cmake from the command line
20:11 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yeah installing cmake cli
20:13 < bridge> <pioooooo> You can edit your cmakepresets.json in t project root
20:13 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yeah i am
20:13 < bridge> <Ewan> you can for sure
20:14 < bridge> <robyt3> Not if you use windres AFAICT #9129
20:14 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9129
20:14 < bridge> <Ewan> im gonna investigate
20:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i recently ran into issues where windres and llvm rc expect slightly different syntax of the resources
20:14 < bridge> <Ewan> certain things need to be quoted that don't on MSVC
20:15 < bridge> <robyt3> It also works with make+gcc though, but somehow ninja doesn't escape something correctly I guess
20:16 < bridge> <Ewan> u can prob modify the rc file
20:16 < bridge> <Ewan> lmc
20:16 < bridge> <Ewan> fwiw i build with ninja and gcc all the time
20:16 < bridge> <Ewan> im gonna try and repro but if i can't do u know the versions of each which caused the prob
20:16 < bridge> <12944qwerty> what does your preset and configuration look like on the gui
20:16 < bridge> <Ewan> just use cli broski -DSECURITY_COMPILER_FLAGS=off and ur golden
20:17 < bridge> <robyt3> MSYS2 doesn't really support staying on old versions, should still happen with the latest available
20:20 < bridge> <Ewan> idk man
20:20 < bridge> <Ewan> works for me
20:21 < bridge> <robyt3> Still the same error, but it was easy to pinpoint
20:21 < bridge> <robyt3> ```

20:22 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
20:22 < bridge> <Ewan> where is that var even set/why don't i run into it
20:22 < bridge> <Ewan> strange
20:23 < bridge> <12944qwerty> I did cmake-gui configure then generate, doesn't seem like there's any errors, but I can't find the ddnet.exe anywhere
20:23 < bridge> <robyt3> cmake sets the variable based on the values in `version.h` I think
20:23 < bridge> <Ewan> cmake is a 2 step build process, cmake gui will generate platform-dependent makefiles for you (in this case visual studio projects like .vcxproj) and then building them is a second step
20:24 < bridge> <robyt3> You need to build separately now, for example by running `make` inside the build folder
20:24 < bridge> <12944qwerty> oh
20:24 < bridge> <12944qwerty> so configure->generate->make
20:25 < bridge> <12944qwerty> for every change reallyu?
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> configure is generate
20:25 < bridge> <12944qwerty> for every change really?
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> you shouldnt have to regenerate typically unless you add sources or smth
20:25 < bridge> <12944qwerty> not according to the gui, it's two buttons on it
20:25 < bridge> <robyt3> You should only need to configure when you change the configuration
20:25 < bridge> <robyt3> But running `make` should also do the cmake configuration automatically to detect added files
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess it's 2 steps in the gui but that's because it's a damn gui and it prompts you before generating lol
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> if u do it on the cli with config flags it's one step
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> and it is one step as far as the build process is concerned
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> there are also explicit instructions above to get a working build using the cli
20:26 < bridge> <12944qwerty> you're right this is extremely slow wow
20:27 < bridge> <Ewan> yea but i mean
20:27 < bridge> <Ewan> u see the commands i run above
20:28 < bridge> <Ewan> what's different from what you're doing? why would it not happen for me if the version i just cloned supposedly has the bad config var too
20:28 < bridge> <Ewan> weird stuff
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> are you on the build step? `-j` should help
20:31 < bridge> <Ewan> if you just run `make` it's gonna go single threaded
20:31 < bridge> <12944qwerty> wtf
20:31 < bridge> <12944qwerty> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1380252639492706515/image.png?ex=684333f1&is=6841e271&hm=4de7ed189894ba788820e78b89b0aac548cb915ee30cb1fc7915980538cfbbcd&
20:31 < bridge> <Ewan> `cmake --build` is the standard way to invoke the build command btw
20:31 < bridge> <Ewan> you're on clang?
20:31 < bridge> <12944qwerty> ?
20:31 < bridge> <Ewan> clang's using gnu windres?
20:31 < bridge> <Ewan> wtf ur config is strange
20:32 < bridge> <Ewan> what cmds did u run
20:33 < bridge> <12944qwerty> after installing way too many things for mingw like clang and rust and cmake-gui, I selected the preset, pressed configure then generate. 
20:33 < bridge> <12944qwerty> Then i just ran make
20:33 < bridge> <12944qwerty> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1380253322581250230/image.png?ex=68433493&is=6841e313&hm=b4ea342f8384b741b1051459702a600bff2d07ab64e55b06a30882019c2e76f7&
20:34 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i might just do a clean reinstall and run this
20:34 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i might just do a clean reinstall and run this to see if that works
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> clean reinstall of what
20:35 < bridge> <12944qwerty> everything
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> overkill
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> for sure
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> `pacman -Syu`
20:35 < bridge> <12944qwerty> ü§∑ i'm pretty sure all the wacky patches and everything i've done have broken something
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> patches
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> if they did break something it's not related to the resources
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> did you change the cmakelists.txt a lot
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> oh... what environment are you in? that's kinda important
20:36 < bridge> <12944qwerty> mingw64
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> ok, ucrt64 is preferred now but you should still be fine with that
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> dont try clean reinstall just run my commands
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean u can if u want but im not gonna wait around for it
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> üòÉ
20:37 < bridge> <robyt3> I think might have to run the build command in `cmd` and not in bash terminal or whatever this is
20:37 < bridge> <12944qwerty> am i not supposed to do it in the mingw shell?
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> it should work. idk what robyt does
20:38 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe not his way
20:38 < bridge> <robyt3> I think that has caused issues before :pepeW:
20:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> Using your environment's shell is preferred no? I mean
20:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> It's not exported to path by default
20:39 < bridge> <robyt3> Ninja uses gcc for me, so doesn't seem caused by using clang
20:39 < bridge> <Ewan> he's getting a different error
20:39 < bridge> <Ewan> windres doesn't know what to make of -E followed by -D args
20:39 < bridge> <Ewan> as if `CMAKE_RC_COMPILE_OBJECT` has been changed
20:40 < bridge> <Ewan> it looks like the args are being lumped together as one string by the time it gets windres
20:40 < bridge> <Ewan> it should be a list
20:40 < bridge> <Ewan> or not quoted
20:40 < bridge> <robyt3> `CMAKE_RC_COMPILER:FILEPATH=D:/path-to/msys64/usr/bin/windres.exe` in my CMakeCache
20:41 < bridge> <Ewan> yea the var i posted is the command it runs alongside the info of that var, the binary location
20:41 < bridge> <12944qwerty> ran the cmake command and it fails on building. it doesn't say why though just that a few subcommands failed
20:41 < bridge> <Ewan> then send the output so i can at least read it
20:41 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yeah gimme a sec to censor
20:41 < bridge> <Ewan> np
20:43 < bridge> <12944qwerty> pasted the entire command output just in case
20:43 < bridge> <12944qwerty> line 170 is when it starts erroring
20:43 < bridge> <12944qwerty> <https://pastebin.com/QWUzUy73>
20:43 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i gtg but i'll be back in a bit
20:44 < bridge> <Ewan> `git submodule update --init`
20:45 < bridge> <Ewan> or `-DSTEAM=off` in your generate command
20:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe you are running into the next weird issue, #10203
20:45 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10203
20:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Delete `libwinpthread-1.dll` before running make :pepeW:
20:45 < bridge> <Ewan> that reeks of outdated ddnet-libs
20:45 < bridge> <robyt3> yes
20:45 < bridge> <Ewan> who updates
20:46 < bridge> <robyt3> but I suspect if we upgrade it might break for old systems
20:46 < bridge> <Ewan> the bundled libs are hardly required
20:46 < bridge> <Ewan> on msys2
20:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i just deleted the folder and it still builds with my cmds
20:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i just already have the libs installed & accessible by cmake and pkg-config
20:48 < bridge> <Assa> can sb explain what `Client()->PredIntraGameTick(g_Config.m_ClDummy);` means and does?
20:49 < bridge> <Assa> I know it's some kind of float
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> based on context and nothing else i'd assume it's what predicts your dummy as well when u play
20:49 < bridge> <teero777> it's how far along you are inbetween ticks.
20:50 < bridge> <Assa> and `Client()->IntraGameTick(g_Config.m_ClDummy)`?
20:50 < bridge> <teero777> it's the same thing but for the not-predicted world
20:51 < bridge> <Assa> so both return a float between 0 and 1
20:51 < bridge> <Assa> at least from my understanding
20:54 < bridge> <robyt3> We actually have ancient documentation for this in `src/engine/docs/client_time.txt`
20:54 < bridge> <Assa> seems to work, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
20:55 < bridge> <Assa> ```
20:55 < bridge> <Assa> Title: Time on the client

20:55 < bridge> <Assa> ```
20:55 < bridge> <Assa> I am not so sure this is so helpful, I guess the middle is "now" ?
20:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> the german error message literally says 'internal compiler error' üëÄ
20:56 < bridge> <Assa> asking different, I want to know precisly when "now" is, in one case it's just ticktime, in another it's ticktime + preintratrick and in another it's ticktime + intratick -1 then?
20:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> Internal compileerror IN C!
20:57 < bridge> <Assa> rebooting worked :justatest:
20:57 < bridge> <Ewan> msvc moment
20:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> literally wtf
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> you know how many simple windows APIs intrinsically hook into stateful system things
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> it's bound to happen
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> like if you create a mutex with an invalid handle windows will keep track of that for you on an application scope via. paging
20:59 < bridge> <Ewan> but if you don't deal with it correctly it could prevent anyone from ever locking on that mutex until you reboot
20:59 < bridge> <Ewan> idk the specific bug here but yea
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry not a mutex but a file mapping i misremembered
21:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> What is the -1?
21:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> I'm pretty sure to get "now", all you'd do is calculate ticktime + intratick
21:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> You don't calculate the "now" by addition with a predicted time
21:03 < bridge> <Assa> @blaiszephyr can you double check this? I just orientated at the body ticks :justatest:
21:03 < bridge> <Assa> also @louis.place did not forgor :3
21:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> Lgtm :owo:
21:09 < bridge> <12944qwerty> didn't change anything
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> try the pacman & pacboy commands here
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> also try ucrt64 not bcs i think mingw64 is problematic but because it will help me be on the same page in testing this stuff
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> there should be no difference for you except it uses a newer c runtime basically
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> and the package names are different but that's what pacboy is for
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> i have no idea why zlib would fail like that after the steam api but i suspect it's an underlying issue in the packages you do/don't have installed. or your cmake gui config, if you're still using that, but those commands should use a new config
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> like... you should not have clang by default
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> it should prefer gcc
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> unless you set it to use clang
21:13 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i did
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> wherefore
21:14 < bridge> <12944qwerty> ```      "name": "ddnet-dev",
21:14 < bridge> <12944qwerty>       "displayName": "[DDNet] (recommended) Clang + mold + ninja for fastest compiling (and dev modus)",

21:14 < bridge> <12944qwerty>         "DEV": "ON"
21:14 < bridge> <12944qwerty>       }```
21:14 < bridge> <12944qwerty> my preset
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> mold doesn't work on windows
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> well it does but it can't make windows binaries
21:14 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yeah it automatically detects and uses lld
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> ok i don't wanna knock that config bcs i believe it works but for troubleshooting's sake try gcc?
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> but really tho just try the commands?? which should trump all of this json stuff
21:15 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yeah it's installing pacboy stuff rn
21:15 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
21:15 < bridge> <12944qwerty> that command you had lets me delete the ddnet-libs now right
21:15 < bridge> <12944qwerty> installs all of them standalone
21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> in theory, the commands there are a little old so maybe there's a new dep in use idk about but we can install it if need be
21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> msys2's got a great packaging team
21:17 < bridge> <12944qwerty> on mingw still got same error on
21:17 < bridge> <12944qwerty> cmake --build build --config Release --parallel
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> still using clang?
21:17 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i just ran the commands you had
21:17 < bridge> <12944qwerty> idk if it still using clang
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> can you add --fresh to the first cmake command
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> and try again
21:18 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i'd already deleted the build dir
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> yea there's more to it
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> cmakecache and cmakefiles
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> which should exist in build dir but

21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> if cmakecache is in the source folder it'd cause issues

21:21 < bridge> <Ewan> yea sorry
21:21 < bridge> <Ewan> it's all new packages
21:26 < bridge> <12944qwerty> do you know how to properly delete the mingw libraries i installed
21:26 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i need the space
21:28 < bridge> <12944qwerty> it worked lets go
21:28 < bridge> <12944qwerty> goddammit
21:28 < bridge> <12944qwerty> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1380267066333859980/image.png?ex=68434160&is=6841efe0&hm=8b9bc7de1c3c8d573f88281c47b3bc70d078d5f46a0fb696f8c2c53b8a5d3055&
21:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> Just delete the contents of /msys2/mingw64/
21:29 < bridge> <Ewan> bruh
21:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> Look through your entire folders contents and see if the .dll is in a subfolder or Smth, I remember msvc having these issues, ü§∑
21:31 < bridge> <12944qwerty> ... no items match my search lol
21:31 < bridge> <robyt3> Did you install ffmpeg?
21:31 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yes
21:31 < bridge> <Ewan> if you're trying to double click it to run it prob won't work
21:32 < bridge> <12944qwerty> oh
21:32 < bridge> <Ewan> gotta run it from the env where the dynamic lib search paths are different
21:32 < bridge> <Ewan> or move the dlls
21:32 < bridge> <Ewan> i have a script
21:32 < bridge> <Ewan> https://gist.github.com/ewancg/de0b47f55b9894b9dc5a7b8609150186
21:32 < bridge> <Ewan> run that in the build dir
21:32 < bridge> <Ewan> then u can cliccc from explorer
21:32 < bridge> <robyt3> Type `which avcodec-61.dll`, it should tell you where the DLL is
21:32 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i ran through the cli and it launched but vulkan didn't
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> btw
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> `pacman -R $(pacman -Qqs mingw-w64)`
21:33 < bridge> <robyt3> If you installed ffmpeg you should have the dll in your bin folder already
21:33 < bridge> <12944qwerty> it's running tho from cli
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> exe needs to find data dir containing shaders for vulkan
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> ogl backends can run w/o
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> depends on ur cwd but i usually just can reset it to vulkan and it stics
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> depends on ur cwd but i usually just can reset it to vulkan and it sticks
21:34 < bridge> <12944qwerty> ogl?
21:34 < bridge> <Ewan> opengl
21:34 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i didn't even know there were shaders in this game
21:35 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not what  you're thinking
21:35 < bridge> <Ewan> baseline explanation is that shaders are just executables that run on the gpu
21:35 < bridge> <12944qwerty> ohhh
21:35 < bridge> <Ewan> there are loads of different types
21:37 < bridge> <12944qwerty> so now if I change something that isn't new deps or anything, i just run the last command and it will update everything?
21:40 < bridge> <12944qwerty> oh i love this

21:42 < bridge> <Ewan> that should be the case
22:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> what happened here
22:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1380276618769203251/image.png?ex=68434a46&is=6841f8c6&hm=7be89ff757932ae27dc7f37abaa4bb73e1a9c2b024c2eda4d821f01865bb3d00&

22:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> :D
22:36 < bridge> <Ewan> hey fwiw the SSP behavior for mingw in the CMakeLists is outdated. they changed it so SSP behavior is defined in `libmingwex.a` which should be automatically linked, a runtime dep shouldn't be required
22:36 < bridge> <Ewan> you should just be able to remove the `find_package(SSP)` and whatnot
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> it'd make it so we don't need that flag anymore üòÉ
22:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://veryl-lang.org/
23:05 < bridge> <zhn> huuh
23:08 < bridge> <chairn> the language doesn't seem to resolve any of the fundamental issues of HDL in general
23:12 < bridge> <12944qwerty> So I wanted to make a telecursor grid mode, (mini discussion here, https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/745926398140612678/1379574922078195743)
23:12 < bridge> <12944qwerty> However, the telecursor command, it turns out, already has an optional argument for player name.
23:12 < bridge> <12944qwerty> even weirder, there is another command called teleport that does exactly the same thing (it seems) under a different function.
23:12 < bridge> <12944qwerty> 
23:12 < bridge> <12944qwerty> How should I go about making a grid mode for telecursor? Should I make a new command or rework telecursor to only be cursor instead of player, or something else?
23:24 < bridge> <12944qwerty> this is insane...
23:24 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i changed nothing except pulling to a more recent commit
23:24 < bridge> <12944qwerty> and now rebuilding just fails completely
23:24 < bridge> <12944qwerty> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1380296177462935754/image.png?ex=68435c7d&is=68420afd&hm=39e7ceb7fed018b155de8b962532ca3bd1914f7ba2f0a4d2288a192d11281b60&
23:25 < bridge> <12944qwerty> still ucrt64
23:25 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i reinstalled all the pacman and pacboy just in case
23:26 < bridge> <12944qwerty> and trying to run the existing build fails for not finding a dll (not the av one)
23:26 < bridge> <12944qwerty> wtf
23:32 < bridge> <kebscs> i feel like its not a problem typing /tc twice if you tp into a wall by accident
23:32 < bridge> <kebscs> not sure if the grid mode is neccessary
23:33 < bridge> <12944qwerty> it's a qol change
23:34 < bridge> <kebscs> i think there was also an option for some tp command to tp to the block next you
23:34 < bridge> <kebscs> relative postion
23:34 < bridge> <kebscs> tp commands already have way too much hidden features imo
23:43 < bridge> <12944qwerty> do you type all of these commands manually or do you have them bound
23:52 < bridge> <12944qwerty> (i'm lazy and would rather have it on one command so that my bound key can do it easily)
