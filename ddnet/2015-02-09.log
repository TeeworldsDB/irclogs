03:16 < eeeee> imo supporting alterantive http download servers advertised from game server is not worth the effort
03:16 < eeeee> very few servers if any will use it
03:16 < eeeee> and it's gonna be quite a bit of work to get it right
03:17 < eeeee> e.g. what if game server advertises something that resolves to local network - could be a security concern
04:19 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] eeeee opened pull request #144: websockets for server (DDRace64...websockets_pullreq) http://git.io/bFrW
14:26 < xRoThx> Hello
14:27 < xRoThx> Any coder online? 
14:27 < xRoThx> Have a serious question
14:27 < laxadedi> xRoThx: hum ?
14:27 < xRoThx> ok
14:30 < BeaR_> just ask, maybe someone answers ^^
14:30 < xRoThx> Got it :)
14:30 < xRoThx> Thank you
15:50 <@EastByte> Any coder online?
15:51 <@EastByte> Have a serious question
15:57 <@deen> http://howistart.org/posts/nim/1
16:00 <@EastByte> cool
16:00 <@deen> oh wow, just checked HN and it's #2 already
16:03 <@EastByte> I'll put it on my ebookreader
16:03 <@deen> (it turned out pretty long)
16:16 <@deen> EastByte: why do you need a coder btw?
16:17 <@EastByte> just wanted to ape xrothx
16:18 <@deen> ape?
16:18 <@deen> oh
16:18 <@deen> ok^^
16:19 <@EastByte> well you didn't step into BeaR's role :P
16:19 <@deen> i didn't scroll up that far^^
16:19 <@EastByte> not even far^^
16:19 <@deen> i have 20 windows on a 1280x1024 screen, only have so much space^^
16:21 <@EastByte> haha
16:26 <@deen> Wooohoo, top post on HN
16:28 <@deen> o_be_one: btw: there you go, a picture of me online
16:40 < Nimda> Rocket Challenge by Juandissimo just released on Solo at 2015-02-09 16:38
17:06 <@EastByte> eeeee: does libwebsocket work without threads?
17:09 < laxadedi> question : what's the difference between doing that in object language
17:10 < laxadedi> private Object toto = new Object()
17:10 < laxadedi> and doing :
17:10 < laxadedi> private Object toto;
17:10 < laxadedi> and initializing it in Constructor
17:10 <@EastByte> depends on the language I guess
17:10 < laxadedi> Isnt there a good behavior for those things ?
17:11 < laxadedi> I used that : private Object toto = new Object() cause I think it's better performance than using a Constructor cause only 1 method need that property
17:11 <@EastByte> I think in C++ new always causes a heap allocation?
17:14 < laxadedi> Hum, I am not sure, but I think C# will generate a constructor to do that even if I don't make one
19:05 < o_be_one> hello :)
19:05 < o_be_one> deen, ahah 
19:06 < o_be_one> seen it at bot x)
19:07 < o_be_one> why Nimda is not made with nim x) ?
19:07 <@EastByte> haha
19:18 < eeeee> EastByte: i think it does, why else would it tell me to repeatedly call the network pump function
19:18 < eeeee> (called libwebsocket_service() )
19:22 < eeeee> and only way to not allocate heap in C# is to have a struct instead of a class in a local variable
19:22 < eeeee> well technically there are also things like stackalloc but those are for extreme circumstances

20:29 < Muttballs> Nimda, rampage
20:33 <@deen> nah, server actually had problems, couldn't reach it either
20:55 < o_be_one> is python needed to compile ddnet ?
20:55 < o_be_one> in windows
20:55 < o_be_one> can cant get down (i hope :p)
20:57 < eeeee> yes python is needed
20:57 < eeeee> whats the problem?
20:57 < o_be_one> thank you that explain my error
20:57 < o_be_one> just ive ignored when it asked for python, dont worry ive did it like a noob :
20:57 < o_be_one> :p
20:58 < o_be_one> ill google to find the python bin for windows :p
20:58 < eeeee> you can technically compile without python if you build on another computer (e.g. under linux) first and then copy the whole directory to windows and build again
20:59 < eeeee> but yeah just downloading python would be easier, just go to the official website
21:00 < o_be_one> thank you eeeee :)
21:20 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: can't c# a single escape analysis?
21:22 < eeeee> c# doesn't do that as it compiles to IL
21:22 < eeeee> the VM that runs the IL might optimize it that way but it's implementation defined
21:23 < eeeee> s/IL/bytecode for more clarity :)
21:25 <@heinrich5991> IR?
21:25 <@heinrich5991> intermediate representation?
21:25 < eeeee> yeah
21:26 < eeeee> called common intermediate language as per ecma 335
21:32 <@heinrich5991> k
22:11 <@EastByte> eeeee: have you already tested the llvm output of C# for native binaries?
22:11 <@EastByte> I read it was introduced some time ago
22:35 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
22:36 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
22:39 < eeeee> EastByte: nah, didn't have time for any c# for a while
22:39 <@EastByte> k
22:39 < eeeee> llvm isn't exactly new though, mono supported llvm backend for jit for ages
22:40 < eeeee> as well as native precompiled binaries
22:40 <@EastByte> afaik not on windows?
22:40 < eeeee> mono worked on windows but idk if those binaries or llvm were supported there
22:41 <@EastByte> hmm
22:41 < eeeee> nobody really used mono on windows anyway since .net was kinda faster and more stable
22:41 <@EastByte> yep, sure
