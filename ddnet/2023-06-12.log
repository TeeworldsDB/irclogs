01:24 <+bridge> <totar> Interesting VS "alternative" editor https://10xeditor.com/
01:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> Nice
01:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> Proprietary tho(?)
01:30 <+bridge> <totar> So is VS?
01:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> So what
03:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> open source would probably be the only thing compelling enough to make me use something other than VS when i need it
03:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> the only noteworthy thing here is the vs solution & project management, everything else seems like generic IDE features
03:33 <+bridge> <totar> Yeah I just realized it's not even free
03:33 <+bridge> <totar> Kinda trash lol
03:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea and the guy has game dev background
03:34 <+bridge> <totar> I thought it was being developed by Epic but actually they just added support for it
04:03 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i think we should just embrace steam integrations. steam account, steam networking etc
04:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> No
05:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's not apple specific. It's basically webgl implementation for browsers

09:06 <+bridge> <patiga> ah right its metal not angle
09:06 <+bridge> <patiga> but still no ^^
09:43 <+bridge> <murpi> Observeration:
09:43 <+bridge> <murpi> The favorites tab requires the master server to work or to timeout before IPs are shown, which is abit annoying.
09:48 <+bridge> <reitw> https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20230609005903.D6C632B02483E418@freevisitday.com/T/#u
10:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mh yeah. We had a relatively good up time yet, and showing ips sounds undesirable. Also we apparently removed the leak ip option inside the UI. So favorites are not as useful without master server anymore.
10:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think we once discussed saving a old master server list on disk all the time, but rejected the idea BCS of potentially old data, which might be unintuitive if the data is old enough(e.g. for ppl where firewall suddenly blocks data etc.)
10:32 <+bridge> <Alexander> Why not cache the server name for a certain amount of time like 1 week
10:33 <+bridge> <Alexander> Instead of ip show the cached server name, only players/max players wont be shown

13:17 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> hi, development gods
13:17 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> when translate clientsided
13:17 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> when chat translate clientsided
13:17 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> when chat translate clientsided feature
13:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If you buy an API key for 3k active users we can do that
13:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I hope u have a million over
13:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I hope u have a million left
13:19 <+bridge> <deen> I also don't know how it would work with everyone's chat being sent to an external translation provider, sounds like a privacy nightmare
13:19 <+bridge> <Avolicious> They charge you for characters üòÑ Atleast deepl and google translate. 500.000 are free, for 1 million characters a month you'll pay 20 bucks
13:19 <+bridge> <deen> Just force everyone to learn English üòÑ
13:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We could allow an API and stub for ddnet to load an own implementation. Then it's at least not our concern
13:20 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Like Antibot?
13:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> learn english
13:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its a valuable skill
13:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Basically yes
13:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks host a server with a LLM translating
13:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
13:21 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Just use OpenAI, what could possible go wrong :justatest:
13:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Gpt4 is og. A friend of my brother a doctor in Latin. He said gpt4 is basically native speaker üòÇ
13:23 <+bridge> <deen> I can now send my production crashes to OpenAI to tell me how to fix them: üòÑ https://docs.sentry.io/product/issues/issue-details/ai-suggested-solution/
13:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Did u actually try? ^^
13:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I always found it bad when it comes to such stuff xd
13:24 <+bridge> <deen> No, I'm waiting for approval before I potentially send customer data to another company
13:24 <+bridge> <deen> Backtrace could contain something interesting like table names
13:24 <+bridge> <Avolicious> The only main concern would be if you would use this service for humans below 16, GDPR needs parental consent
13:24 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> there are free translators in internet to use, why pay?
13:25 <+bridge> <deen> They will just rate-limit at any amount we'd require of course
13:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah they totally want our Traffic
13:25 <+bridge> <Avolicious> They are mostly fair use and automated access is in most cases against their ToS
13:25 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> well, i dont know
13:26 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> but i know surely translate inside the game would be neat
13:26 <+bridge> <Avolicious> There were clients offered this feature
13:26 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> there are already china brutal 4-5 players who play on ger with ping 320
13:26 <+bridge> <Avolicious> dont know if they still exists
13:26 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> and russian players meet ger players too
13:26 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> languige barrier is not cool
13:27 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Go for english
13:27 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> we should make it the way when you see original message and translation next to it( original message in chat and translated next to it, on the right)
13:28 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> if tw could help learn languges it would be cool
13:28 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> there also many new player that are kids and dont know even english
13:28 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> there also many new players that are kids and dont know even english
13:29 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> i know english as you can see my friend
13:29 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> but german players speak german with each other and im tired to alt tab to browser to translate
13:29 < ws-client> <Jupstar> its probably more likely that kids know english, with all their tiktok trash input üòÇ 
13:30 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> no, in russia there is english lang in schools, but the cool part is-even teacher sometimes dont know the subject of teaching
13:30 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Thats a nice feature for sure, but as you mentioned it also bring great responsability. In europe you'd, i guess, thankfully have the GDPR. So adding this feature would need every player to accept either the DDNet ToS & Privacy Policy or give their consent to allow DDNet send their data to Deepl or Google for example.
13:30 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> if its not moscow or saint-petersburg, teachers dont teach you eng at all
13:30 < ws-client> <Jupstar> well anyway. The only thing we could realistically do is an API. then u can load your free translator, until you get banned because what you do is breaking their TOS
13:31 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> why cant we make our own translator and use it?
13:31 < ws-client> <Jupstar> üòÇ 
13:31 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Because translation is complicated
13:31 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Its not like just use a dictionary
13:31 < ws-client> <Jupstar> if u explain to me how human languages work in 20 words, im ok with it üòÇ 
13:31 <+bridge> <Avolicious> In most cases you cant translate 1:1
13:31 <+bridge> <syrinok> Am I crazy, I swear 0.7 had some type of translator :justatest:
13:31 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> just make parsing one time from some google translate for popular lang
13:32 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> no
13:32 <+bridge> <syrinok> It didn't?
13:32 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> we dont need 1;1
13:32 <+bridge> <Avolicious> But it depends on the sentence, caching the result will lead to a HUGE database
13:32 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i dont know any game doing that.. as said it costs lot of money
13:32 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> just translate like you can, that would be very nice already
13:32 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Atleast the traffic will cost thousands of dollars
13:32 < ws-client> <Jupstar> if at all some game created by microsoft or other big players
13:33 <+bridge> <syrinok> Wtf am I remembering then
13:33 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Thats why rocket league removed their chat and used static chat stuff only üòÑ
13:33 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> there was xclient for 0.7
13:34 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> aimbot, endless drawing players at any distance bypassing the server max distance, and translator
13:34 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> it was closed source sadly
13:34 <+bridge> <Avolicious> But a client-side addon would be fun. So the user has to pay for the translation api on client-side
13:34 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> yeah
13:34 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> just some lua script
13:34 <+bridge> <syrinok> I didn't use a custom client afaik, besides fclient
13:35 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> me too, cheat clients are fun but they have reputation risks for u, so i use only no cheat clients
13:35 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Teeworlds Players dont pay for servers, but for translation apis. Thats gigachad
13:35 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> you want to make DLC "translator for messages" in steam? lmao
13:36 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> many players would buy it just to cheer up ddnet
13:36 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Even if you use Google Translate or Deepl or Yahoo Translate, you need an API access. Costs around 20 bucks per 1 million characters
13:36 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> we can do donation at main ddnet page for that
13:37 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> i remember there was donations for servers
13:37 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i think u dont understand smth critical: ppl will abuse the fact that there is a cost per characters
13:37 < ws-client> <Jupstar> and this will increase the cost
13:37 <+bridge> <Avolicious> I do understand, just trying to tell that it will be very pricy
13:38 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i didnt mean you
13:38 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i mean the guy thinking we could handle it over donations ^^
13:38 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Ah, yeah donations prob. wont cover this at all
13:39 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Not even cloudflare is covered by donations üòÑ
13:39 <+bridge> <Avolicious> They offered 3k/location/month and 1k setup fee. Sounds fair, huh?
13:58 < ws-client> <Jupstar> the reddit protest is extremely annoying. Many ppl use that instead of stack overflow <.<
13:58 < ws-client> <Jupstar> google cache also not there ;c
14:08 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> i dont think we can
14:08 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> the original idea was to pirate it
14:09 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> like, for free
14:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòÇüòÇüòÇ
14:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Let's just steal cloud flare severs
14:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Fixes all problems
14:10 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> nah bro
14:11 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> my idea is to make lua(or dll) translation script, make it unnoficial and easy to install
14:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yeah lets say you dont know what  you talking about :justatest:
14:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> got struct field reordering and padding pog
14:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1117791667802603611/image.png
14:30 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> guys can you make command in f1 "refresh ping for all servers"
14:30 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> everytime i want to update ping i need to go to server or leak_ip to all servers
14:31 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> not cool
14:31 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> yeah
14:31 <+bridge> <Smetanolub> :greenthing:
14:33 <+bridge> <louis> i think ath had it
14:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This is intentionally. Pinging a server means u leak ur ip to the server, which ultimately means an attacker can dos u
15:08 <+bridge> <Nyan> does any admin have how to take my desban?
15:10 <+bridge> <deen> One channel is enough for questions
15:11 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> :justatest: actually expensive shit
15:12 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I wouldn't imagine using Google Translate API for teeworlds, that would be too much of a hassle
15:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks why is the emote lag something recent?
15:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is this cuz some new troll
15:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar> yes, also its only if network is the limitation
15:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i doubt u could make it work on GER servers
15:22 <+bridge> <gerdoe> yup
15:26 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i dont have the server logs where it happened tho. from the analysis of the demo i'd actually think that should also not be enough to kill a server. But who knows
15:27 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ^ there could be more to it
15:30 <+bridge> <Robyt3> I noticed if you keep spamming emotes that eventually the send buffer fills up or something like that so you can't send anything in rcon anymore as well (only client side)
15:30 < ws-client> <Jupstar> how tall is our send buffer?
15:31 < ws-client> <Jupstar> spamming = change code or with keyboard?
15:32 <+bridge> <Robyt3> with a config file
15:32 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but now that you say it, another problem might be that emoticons are vital. so they might require a resend and are kept inside the buffer indeed
15:32 < ws-client> <Jupstar> that would also be solved if it would be part of the snapshot
15:32 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not on the client side
15:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @heina
15:33 < ws-client> <Jupstar> do you mean me or robyte?
15:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 also do u know why the outage  on ddnet.org? or u cant tell cuz security issues
15:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im curious
15:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> server was unreachable
15:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hoster shenanigans?
15:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's unclear what caused it
15:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I meant you Jupstar
15:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because it's also buffering on the client side
15:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (which is what @Robyt3 also referred to)
15:35 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ?
15:35 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i dont get it xD
15:37 < ws-client> <Jupstar> if robytes spams emotes it might be buffered in his client. when the server sends emotes it might buffer them on the server side
15:38 < ws-client> <Jupstar> and robytes analysis made me rethink that this could also be a problem
15:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
15:38 < ws-client> <Jupstar> and being part of the snapshot would fix it
15:38 < ws-client> <Jupstar> server side at least^^
15:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> fix that, yes
15:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not what Robyt3 referred to, though
15:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> he said something about his rcon commands not going through anymore
15:38 <+bridge> <Robyt3> 32kb
15:38 < ws-client> <Jupstar> when he spams emotes
15:38 < ws-client> <Jupstar> as far as i understod
15:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ye
15:39 <+bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, after I stop spamming emotes the rcon commands don't go through anymore
15:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @Robyt3 on which server btw, local?
15:39 <+bridge> <Robyt3> local
15:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> surprising tbh
15:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i mean 32kb is not a lot if its bytes and not bits xd
15:40 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but also for a local server more than enough i'd guess
15:40 <+bridge> <Robyt3> seems like that's the memory only for the lightweight `CNetChunkResend` data structure
15:41 <+bridge> <Robyt3> it doesn't include the data itself
15:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> nah, also the data, probably
15:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the resend mechanism is bad
15:41 < ws-client> <Jupstar> he meant that like u mean it xD
15:42 <+bridge> <Robyt3> ah, yes, I see how it is
15:42 <+bridge> <Robyt3> it has a pointer to the data but it allocs the data after the struct
15:42 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i mean double it and check if it fixes ur problem
15:42 < ws-client> <Jupstar> xd
15:43 <+bridge> <Robyt3> then it would just take longer to fill up, but the issue is that is doesn't empty fast enough, isn't it?
15:44 < ws-client> <Jupstar> yeah but a local server?
15:44 < ws-client> <Jupstar> on*
15:45 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i didnt read the network code, but the server simply acks it and its removed, isnt it?
15:45 < ws-client> <Jupstar> and the server wakes up when there is network activity
15:45 <+bridge> <Robyt3> if it was emptying the buffer fast enough then eventually the rcon messages should work again
15:45 < ws-client> <Jupstar> maybe they are completely dropped
15:45 < ws-client> <Jupstar> if there is no space in the buffer left
15:46 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @heinrich5991 tell us, u know^^
15:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, we did that bad thing at some point
15:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> to completely drop old messages that we might still need to resend
15:50 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> *we changed to doing that bad thing at some point
15:54 < ws-client> <Jupstar> mhh well for the server this resend struct is defs a problem. the emoticon packets itself are pretty small, with compression they probably end up in 2-3bytes + the header. but the struct already uses like 36 bytes
15:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> will be fixed by quic‚Ñ¢
15:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ^^
15:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> quic make it quick
15:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i should do benchmarks on my QUIC impl, see the throughput
16:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @heinrich5991 yours will not be async right? and also not in a seperate thread? does quiche offer a non blocking API similar to what we use now then?
16:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar> never really looked into that API
16:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> quiche is without IO
16:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> mine can be moved to a thread quite easily, I think
16:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but currently it's not
16:06 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure what you mean by async
16:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar> well if it has no runtime its also no async :D
16:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i meant the runtime
16:07 <+bridge> <deen> Why is there no default way of getting a core dump on panic in Rust? Best I found so far is https://gist.github.com/epilys/a6caba03cb02cfd2880fd80755cd08b8
16:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> coredump?
16:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> arent coredumps for segfaults only
16:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i found a crate but idk https://crates.io/crates/coredump
16:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:08 <+bridge> <deen> You can create a core file whenever you want, on panic it's interesting to figure out the state when something went terribly wrong
16:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> <https://github.com/d-e-s-o/coredump/blob/main/src/lib.rs>
16:09 <+bridge> <deen> I guess something like this would work in Cargo.toml too, but has to be done at compile time, not runtime:
16:09 <+bridge> <deen> ```
16:09 <+bridge> <deen> [profile.release]
16:09 <+bridge> <deen> panic = "abort"
16:09 <+bridge> <deen> ```
16:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> panic is not for terribly wrong tho
16:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> just wrong
16:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but thats just me being pedantic xd
16:09 <+bridge> <deen> Panic is terribly wrong, it means you can't recover. If you can recover throw an exception or bubble up an error, depending on language
16:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > 
16:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> >     If something might reasonably be absent, Option is used.
16:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> >     If something goes wrong and can reasonably be handled, Result is used.
16:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> >     If something goes wrong and cannot reasonably be handled, the thread panics.
16:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> >     If something catastrophic happens, the program aborts.
16:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yeye
16:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> maybe the crate i sent shows some hints
16:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but well i guess ppl didnt bother  because panic gives a backtrace
16:11 <+bridge> <deen> The repo does the same as the gist I think
16:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u can also run ur program with rust_backtrace=full always
16:11 <+bridge> <deen> Backtrace will not show me the state of all related data structures
16:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i see
16:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> well yeah no default way
16:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> do the gist xd
16:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i found a reddit link but
16:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> reddit is closed
16:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> maybe rust doesnt have  it byy default cuz its not portable  or smth
16:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the gist sounds like a good way to get a dump
16:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's not really a reason not to do it tbh
16:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> more like a reason to do it
16:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because the std lib is supposed to abstract away the different platform and get good behavior on all of them
16:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its weird cuz
16:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i dont see any rfc related to this
16:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> well core dump sadly gives lot of noise
16:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> when searching xd
16:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ^^
16:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> does windows have core dumps at all
16:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think so
16:42 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Core_dump&oldid=1157626885#User-mode_memory_dumps
16:53 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> mmmm Reddit won't load for me
17:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> rust reddit is down ^^
17:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @heinrich5991 you network pro right?
17:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what is a common packet size for benchmarks xd
17:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not a network pro
17:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what kind of benchmark do you mean?
17:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, teeworlds networking?
17:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well kind of xd
17:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my quic impl
17:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> idk, open teeworlds traffic in wireshark
17:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> and sample some of the packet sizes by hand
17:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> one way, it's INPUT packages mostly
17:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the other way is SNAPSHOTs
17:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok, lets try that out
17:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what do u think is the minimum it should reach? üòÇ
17:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> single client
17:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and server with 64 clients
17:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean packets per second send & recv
17:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess this üòÇ

18:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @deen did u set r/ddnet as private?
18:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ah yes u did
18:31 <+ChillerDragon> wot why
18:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> good moment for reddit to restart some infrastructure XD
18:32 <+ChillerDragon> ye
18:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> !c protests
18:32 < chillerbot1> ChillerDragon
18:32 <+ChillerDragon> ddnet is protesting?
18:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
18:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> against reddit
18:32 <+ChillerDragon> why
18:32 <+ChillerDragon> wat reddit do
18:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i removed the accept requests to join so we dont get spammed xd
18:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> reddit is putting a price to the API
18:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> !c apparently they destroy reddit for stackoverflow users
18:32 < chillerbot1> ChillerDragon
18:32 <+ChillerDragon> o
18:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> making 3rd party clients unusable
18:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
18:32 <+ChillerDragon> i see
18:33 <+ChillerDragon> you mean people that use reddit as SO alternative?
18:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the reddit app sucks hard
18:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ppl use alt clients
18:33 <+ChillerDragon> that makes sense

18:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the world knows
18:34 <+ChillerDragon> wait going private causes reddit to break?
18:34 <+ChillerDragon> i would assume it increases stability
18:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it causes nobody to see  the subreddit
18:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but reddit broke cuz probs someone ddosing, or they cant handle this idk why
18:34 <+ChillerDragon> a
18:35 <+ChillerDragon> > A significant number of subreddits shifting to private caused some expected stability issues
18:35 <+ChillerDragon> fake quote then
18:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no its true
18:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im just assuming
18:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for me it works

20:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @heinrich5991 i did some benchmarks now, i find the results really surprising and also unexpected  (maybe?)
20:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> **unordered lossless** packets:
20:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ~80k - ~100k pps on a single client to server connection depending on how i tune https://docs.rs/quinn/latest/quinn/struct.TransportConfig.html
20:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and 
20:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ~360k - ~390k pps on multiple clients (tested between 8-16 on my 16core CPU) to server with default transport config
20:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> packet size was always 64 bytes inner packet data size, unordered packets always open a new QUIC stream like 
20:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> **udp datagram** (it defs lost lots of packets ^^) (multi):
20:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ~370k - ~400k pps (there were about 740k packets tried to be sent tho, so insane packet loss üòÇ and CPU usage was also bit lower, so i wouldn't judge about this test too much, the benchmark was probably not well designed for this)
20:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> **ordered lossless** packets:
20:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> **now** the surprising part to me:
20:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ~210k pps (single client)
20:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ~960k - ~1.1 million pps (multi)
20:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The ordered packets use a single stream and are insanely much quicker.
20:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I surprised about this because i'd have thought it's better to create many streams as in:
20:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "Streams may be unidirectional or bidirectional, and are cheap to create and disposable. For example, a traditionally datagram-oriented application could use a new stream for every message it wants to send, no longer needing to worry about MTUs."
20:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> (https://docs.rs/quinn/latest/quinn/)
20:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But maybe the overhead of spawning tokio tasks is too much in these cases (defs need to check this)
20:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> since my CPU is probably faster than this, the results are probably still bad xD:

20:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-receive-a-million-packets/
20:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well in real world its always different tho, shouldnt be underestimated
20:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the packets block each other much more often than on a local socket
20:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> probably need 2 distant fast PCs with enough bandwidth üòÇ
20:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> can i get someone else to test code gen on the vs 2022 cmake generator
20:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lets invest 4k‚Ç¨ for ddnet
20:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> wdym?
20:57 <+bridge> <Ewan> cmake finds python and there is no error or warning while generating the cmake but `src/game/generated/` doesn't exist when i build
20:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> a single stream is less management overhead than separate streams
20:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so you get an error while building?
20:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> (empty) files are being placed in `build/src/game/generated/` and that's being added to the include path i guess so it doesn't fail as a global `<>` include
20:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> so it's expecting nonexistent symbols
20:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> many errors
21:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> maybe the build folder behavior stuff is intended but either way the files are empty lol
21:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the build folder behavior is intended
21:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> empty files sounds like python execution fails
21:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sure, but 3 times less throughput is rather disappointing for the unordered ones imho. It probably makes sense as said spawning tokio tasks costs time, storing all open streams somewhere (tho the max defaults to 100 streams)
21:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> to communicate how far you're on many unordered streams, you need much more ack data e.g.
21:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> for communicating how far you are on the ordered ones, you just need one integer
21:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so u don't ack seperately sent chunks individually?
21:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no need to, it's a stream
21:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's up to the quci implementation how clever it is
21:20 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> typical tcp implementations only ack it once
21:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh yeah makes sense, i mean most of the time no reordering happens even on UDP (at least for local socket)
21:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it it does happens sometimes xd
21:20 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, probably no reordering on local sockets
21:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok but i sent multiple individual packets over it, so it's defs "luck"
21:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there in fact is.. but not a lot üòÑ
21:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hmmm. I tried to logically reason about it
21:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> how the fuck does one get reordering there?!
21:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean it could have to do with different threads (even if the "send" itself was in order) writing to it
21:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
22:34 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> haha, i got a screen burn from the bottom right hud scores
22:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Pic or did not happen
