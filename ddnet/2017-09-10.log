01:34 <+Learath2> yes...
01:34 <+Learath2> i don't get it it worked fine for weeks
01:34 <+Learath2> now it breaks in one direction spontaneously
01:35 <+Learath2> o/
01:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> \o
03:52 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> ok, how is the state of macOS regarding deployment, I just wrote some script to copy all required shared libs to some target dir and fix searchspaths for them; I guess this will be quite useful
11:53 <@deen> @HMH well, i got the release version fixed, but i'm still using bam and it's messy
14:03 <@heinrich5991> deen: I've drafted a very simple demo format, roughly 1MB/player hour
14:03 <@heinrich5991> my goal would be to record all races so we can view them later
14:04 <@heinrich5991> (in case some map bug gets detected, etc.)
14:04 <@heinrich5991> are you fundamentally against the idea, or can I try to develop this furtherly
14:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> ?ouh how do you compress the data so much
14:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> ?
14:05 <@heinrich5991> I throw away everything
14:05 <@heinrich5991> basically
14:05 <@heinrich5991> best compression
14:05 <@heinrich5991> I only record player position and input
14:33 <@heinrich5991> (compresses to a fifth of that btw, so 0.2MB/player hour if compressed with xz or bz2)
14:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i like the idea
14:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> Disk: 15.35 GiB / 295.23 GiB
14:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ger doesnt have disk space problems :D
14:57 <@heinrich5991> well, it'd be >1gb per day
14:58 <@heinrich5991> uncompressed 6gb, compressed 2gb
14:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> hmm
14:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> what is the average finishes per day?
14:58 <@heinrich5991> but we can figure that part out
14:58 <@heinrich5991> the interesting question is whether deen would be okay with that idea in general
16:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> heinrich5991 are you okay with it even?
16:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> mass data collection
16:22 <@heinrich5991> it's game play data collection
16:22 <@heinrich5991> :)
16:23 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> does any1 know which file is "CNetServer" ?
16:24 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> src/engine/shared/network_server.cpp, src/engine/shared/network.h
16:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> network_server
16:24 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> hero
16:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> t:D\
16:24 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ty
16:24 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> heros*
16:24 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon what tools do you use to edit the Teeworlds source code?
16:25 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> visual studio
16:25 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> then you should be able to "go to definition"
16:25 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ye i should
16:25 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> xd
16:25 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> .. but?
16:25 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i broke everything
16:25 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> haha
16:25 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i good at breaking things
16:26 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> then you should still be able to do a full-text search
16:26 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> either search for "class CNetServer" or for "CNetServer::"
16:26 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> should find you header or implementation, respectively
16:26 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ye thats a good idea
16:26 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ty c:
16:27 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> im still a beginner hehe
16:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> remove visual studio and you suddenly jump up to intermediate
16:28 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ignore @Learath2 on that one
16:28 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜ƒ
16:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> garbage studio is not good for you
16:30 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> visual studio is a nice ide
16:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> just as a bulldozer is a good day to day vehicle
16:30 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> name a better IDE ðŸ˜ƒ
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> (not claiming that VS is the best one)
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> no ide is best ide
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> vs is defnetly trash
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> it just crashed agian
16:32 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> annoying to open all the files agian especially if you work with two sources
16:32 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> total chaos
16:32 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Learath2 yea see? then don't try to compare IDEs
16:32 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> no ide?
16:32 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> like using plain editor hehe?
16:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> see he is a beginner and even he knows its trash
16:32 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> if vs keeps crashing i switch to notepad
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> you get a nice editor that has nice coding plugins
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> sublime, vim
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> clion is nice i've heard
16:36 <+c0d3d3v> I thnk Vs is a creat tool. But every tool is as good as its user... 
16:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> you think that until you work on anything slightly bigger then tw
16:36 <+c0d3d3v> great*
16:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> and then it starts crashing, you search for sth it crashes, you disable a project it reindexes everything,  the shitpiler they call msvc links things so slowly i could link it faster by hand
16:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> overall great experience i had with that thing
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> clion
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> xd
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i also think its nice
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you couldn't get it to work and that's why you're saying "remove visual studio and you suddenly jump up to intermediate"? ^^
16:39 <+c0d3d3v> But to work effortlessly on some sources you dont need such big tools. So I also could recommend emacs. But at the end it is your choise... Atom is a easy to use IDE, and nearly as fast as a simple texteditor (sublime)...
16:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> sorry i'm not going to buy more ram to get an easily replacable product working
16:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you're free not to use any software
16:39 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ram is usefull everywhere
16:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> yep
16:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but why do you actively recommend against it?
16:39 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> clion is even more expensive lol
16:39 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> rofl Ram
16:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> atom takes minutes to load up, it's not an ide and it's orders of magnitude slower then sublime
16:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I don't want people to suffer
16:40 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> HMH answer me private chat -.-
16:41 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> even though this discussion amuses me I do not think it is the best idea to start a war about ides/editors here
16:41 <+c0d3d3v> I said "nealy" ... and Atom is a better choice then Vs...  But I use still emacs :S 
16:41 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> oke
16:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @HMH nothing of much importance going on anyways ðŸ˜ƒ
16:41 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes, the demo thing! ðŸ˜ƒ
16:42 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ye thats awesome
16:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> @heinrich5991, does that demo record you wrote, will store only finished runs? Or something?
16:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Just like on teerace
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> when you can download record of someone ru
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> teerace records demos?
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yes
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and ghosts
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> lal
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i like to spend atleast half my day doing missionary work, preventing people from making the same mistakes i made when i was young
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe, or i am wrong ðŸ˜„
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i thought, i saw demos
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i thought the ppls all uploaded manually haha
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but ye makes sense
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> no dudes upload their demos hehe
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Savander it will store all game data, not just from races
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> oh right, to better debuggin
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> also private whisper messages hehe
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but then, maybe it would be cool to save demos of races?
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe after finish, combine position data with map
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and make demo? ðŸ˜„
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i always send ascii nudes via whisper
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i dont want them to be recorded
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 can your demos be converted into normal demos to be watched in client?
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but, without chat Chiller
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> uff
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Learath2 it would take some work
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> theoretically, input data is all you need
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but then ddnet is not really reproducible
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what about changeing server_demo_record to save only inputs of players
16:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Anyway guys, i have to say that. In germany, you have best chicken i ever ate
16:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> DELICIOUS
16:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> u are in germany?
16:47 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> @heinrich5991 yes any thoughts on floatingpointimprecision especially across builds and systems
16:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i was, yesterday
16:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> hm
16:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> im still there
16:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> in Hamburg
16:47 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> floating point is not hte issue
16:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> too far away anyways
16:47 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @HMH random teleports are the main issue for now
16:48 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> ahh yes, we also got these, indeed they are a somewhat bigger problem then
16:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> should we make them predictable maybe?
16:48 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> one could do that any minute
16:48 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> we should update the maps in that case btw ðŸ˜ƒ
16:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well could do it with a prng
16:49 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> then we cando it without as well
16:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> so wouldn't need to do anything on maps
16:50 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> just choose the first teleporter you find
16:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> why would we need to update the maps tho?
16:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well actually in that case having multiple teleport targets would be useless
16:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> so the "load balancing" use of teleporters would be gone
16:53 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> we could also use spawn logic or something similar
16:53 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> spawnlogic would be kewl for tele but it would rip all the lucky minigames build with tele
16:54 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but i guess any system would do that
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> exactly
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> what kind of "cool minigames"?
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> random isn't "cool minigame"
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> xd
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> dont u know these?
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> no
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i only have the Pup or Pop map in mind where u can get an sg
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> prng doesn't really break the cool minigames
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> 2% chance
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> until someone creates a cheat client that is ðŸ˜„
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> or you die
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i only know png
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> 2% shotgun is not a cool minigame
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> yes it sucks
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> for a racing mod
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but maybe some1 build something better
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i guess spawn logic is the best
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> once chance is involved, the competitiveness is gone
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> or it encourages grinding
16:57 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> tru
16:57 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> "minigame"
16:57 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> not game
18:11 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: so what else has to go into these server-side demos?
18:11 <@heinrich5991> 1) player names
18:11 <@heinrich5991> 2) team commands
18:12 <@heinrich5991> can you think of anything else?
18:12 <@heinrich5991> or rather, team movement in general, not just team commands
18:26 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> possible to remove timeout protection from test servers?
18:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> heinrich5991 some initial state to properly simulate doors and bullets i guess
18:35 <@heinrich5991> jao: why?
18:37 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: shouldn't be necessary
18:38 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> @heinrich5991 if you timeout you can't rejoin often since test servers have limited slots; also you don't need to save any game progress since its just for testing
18:41 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: since the whole game is recorded, switch states should be obvious from play history
18:56 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> what about /load ?
18:59 <@heinrich5991> yes, load and save would be good
19:58 <@deen> heinrich5991: sounds great
19:58 <@deen> I'm just always sad that we didn't record 4 years ago :)
19:59 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> what happend back then?
19:59 <@heinrich5991> we'll probably have to save these records off-site though
20:00 <@heinrich5991> probably won't work on te servers directly
20:01 <@deen> about editors/ides: who cares? just try out a few and use whatever you like
20:02 <@heinrich5991> +1 :)
20:02 <@deen> people have different preferences, so there can't be an absolute best
20:02 <@deen> (typical religious wars)
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> sure a sluggish crashing editor is universally bad
20:03 <@deen> so if you don't like that don't use it
20:03 <@deen> if others notice that they don't like it and they google for "code editors" they will find other suggestions
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it's going to be a PITA for the majority of people so i do my best to steer them away from the beginning
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> so they dont get used to the cushy features and miss them when they have to leave VS
20:04 <@deen> heinrich5991: how would it work? can you convert them back to a serverside full demo?
20:05 <@heinrich5991> not with the current tools
20:05 <@heinrich5991> but yes
20:05 <@deen> ok
20:05 <@deen> so we could do that live and offer downloads
20:05 <@deen> Learath2: i think agressive stances scare off more people than bad editors
20:06 <@deen> like telling a new-comer "your programming language is bad, use a real programming language"
20:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it's for their best
20:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> For me, i don't care what people are using
20:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and i don't tell them to use something else
20:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if they don't ask
20:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's personal preference
20:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> So i suggest to use more than one environment
20:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> to just convince yourself, what best for you
20:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> exactly, i just help them remove one possiblity from the list faster ðŸ˜ƒ
20:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> But you can suggest instead of telling them it's bad (in your opinion)
20:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @deen && @heinrich5991 where would we store these? S3?
20:21 <@deen> no!
20:21 <@deen> just a normal server with a backup?
20:21 <@heinrich5991> I'd probably buy a hard drive and store them there
20:21 <@heinrich5991> mirrored or so
20:21 <@deen> for starters we can store them on ddnet.tw server
20:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well would need quite some storage on that server
20:21 <@heinrich5991> yes
20:21 <@deen> I can clean up some stuff there and make space, and need to increase it anyway
20:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> servers with a lot of storage seem more expensive then those storage clouds
20:22 <@deen> but initially probably just store them locally on each server?
20:22 <@heinrich5991> yes, but it'll be more than 1gb for all servers together, per day
20:22 <@deen> that's not so bad
20:22 <@heinrich5991> yes,
20:22 <@deen> let's say 1.5 GB?
20:22 <@deen> 500 GB / year
20:22 <@heinrich5991> upper estimate is 2GB, let's say that
20:23 <@deen> you want to keep all recordings forever?
20:23 <@heinrich5991> it's in the range of "I can buy hard drives faster"
20:23 <@deen> or filter them?
20:23 <@heinrich5991> all recordings forever
20:23 <@deen> so after saving all tw maps you now want to record all game play? :D
20:23 <@heinrich5991> (they'd btw also make great test cases for reproducible)
20:23 <@heinrich5991> *reproducibility
20:23 <@deen> yeah, true
20:23 <@heinrich5991> :D
20:24 <@deen> they'd also be great for teaching machine learning ;)
20:24 <@heinrich5991> :D
20:24 <@heinrich5991> anyway
20:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well if you keep the backups on cold storage can't really let users download them
20:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 2TB for 30$
20:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> sounds good or bad? xD
20:24 <@heinrich5991> where? what redundancy?
20:24 <@heinrich5991> 30$ per month?
20:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> just searching for
20:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> vps storage
20:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://servarica.com/special_offers/storage-vps-offers/
20:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it doesnt matter
20:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> which loc
20:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yes?
20:25 <@deen> Learath2: meh, i even have 40 mbit/s upload at home, even that would be enough
20:25 <@heinrich5991> heh, nice
20:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what about OVH backup
20:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?
20:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> whoa i get 10 here
20:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @deen well you could host it :)\
20:26 <@heinrich5991> I think this means that I can spend some more time on this feature :)
20:26 <@deen> heinrich5991: sure
20:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://www.ovh.co.uk/dedicated_servers/backup-storage.xml
20:26 <@deen> i wanted to make this myself before
20:26 <@deen> that's the stuff for not saving map inside demos
20:26 <@deen> and why i fixed server demo recording at some point
20:26 <@deen> but it was still pretty large
20:26 <@heinrich5991> demo has too much overhead though
20:26 <@deen> exactly
20:26 <@heinrich5991> I'm rolling my own format :/
20:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> RAID 1 should be good enough so cost not too bad
20:26 <@deen> So I gave a test run for a few days and then stopped it again
20:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i remember that
20:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it was like 2 years ago ?
20:27 <@deen> Learath2: raid 1 is never enough, everything needs an offline backup
20:27 <@deen> @Savander I guess
20:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @deen give it a backup each month \o/
20:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe you should try some of OVH for backups. Maybe they are good enough your your data
20:28 <@heinrich5991> I fear that storage by some providers is always going to be more expensive
20:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Can't be cheaper then deen hosting it at home tho
20:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it depends
20:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well could be actually
20:28 <@heinrich5991> mirroring it across two locations (my place! :P) would be fine, probably
20:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> how you calucalte costs
20:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> calculate *
20:28 <@heinrich5991> I recently bought two 4TB hdds, 130â‚¬ each, approx
20:29 <@deen> anyway, the data grows slowly enough that we can worry about all that later
20:29 <@deen> no hurry
20:29 <@heinrich5991> yes
20:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> electricity, bandwidth ?
20:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Yea, that's right. But it's good to think about such things eariler
20:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well we have 240 days atleast just if we store them on ger
20:30 <@deen> heinrich5991: that might also be a way to be able to offer official ddnet servers as a package that everyone can install
20:30 <@deen> heinrich5991: so we would get recordings along with the record for the database
20:31 <@deen> and then the server could simulate the recording and see if it's accurate before adding it
20:31 <@deen> (not sure we want that though)
20:32 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> but what about floatingpoint stuff then ?
20:32 <@deen> enforce some accurate float calculation and lose 5% performance
20:34 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> how do you enforce that ?
20:34 <@deen> weird compiler settings, dunno :D
20:34 <@deen> didn't look into it
20:35 <@deen> -mpc64 or sth: http://christian-seiler.de/projekte/fpmath/
20:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> guess could somehow force soft floats or sth
20:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> might be a big performance hit tho
20:45 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> the last time I read about this topic my result was that this is going to be quite complicated and that there is no simple compileroption to get deterministic floats across different platforms and hardware
20:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> apparently +,-,*,/,sqrt are deterministic
21:15 <@heinrich5991> no
21:15 <@heinrich5991> standard compiler settings should suffice
21:15 <@heinrich5991> at least for gcc, clang
21:15 <@heinrich5991> don't enable -ffast-math
21:16 <@deen> sounds good
21:16 <@heinrich5991> and TW goes out of its way to always convert back to ints after each tick
21:16 <@heinrich5991> deen: but that also needs determinism
21:16 <@heinrich5991> and I want that regardless
21:16 <@heinrich5991> (no random teleporters)
21:16 <@heinrich5991> otherwise you can cheat using non-official servers
21:16 <@deen> make them semi-random
21:17 <@deen> dependent on the current time of the player
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well our operations are limited to +,-,*,/,sqrt, so our math is all deterministic without fastmath
21:17 <@deen> that should be good enough
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> oh tick time and a prng should be fine
21:17 <@heinrich5991> I'd rather do away with that
21:17 <@deen> heinrich5991: so just iterate over them?
21:17 <@deen> heinrich5991: or always choose 1?
21:17 <@heinrich5991> no, just take the first one, and fix the maps
21:18 <@deen> yeah, that would be great too
21:18 <@deen> then we can have full prediction in client 
21:18 <@heinrich5991> yep
21:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well could auto fix maps to remove all extra teleport to tiles
21:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> but still teleports did some load balancing too how'd we fix that?
21:18 <@heinrich5991> well, I'm talking about those that need actual game play fixes
21:23 <@deen> there are some maps that use that fact to make the map harder
21:24 <@deen> so they would become easier now
21:24 <@heinrich5991> yes
21:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> given we shouldn't change map difficulty i guess we should use a prng
21:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i guess we could just make the map slightly easier and just call it a day
21:50 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> @Learath2 what do you mean with "well our operations are limited to +,-,*,/,sqrt" ?
21:51 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> or rather which operations, gamecore uses stuff like sinf cosf and also powf
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> oh true
23:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well idk, we could check a couple of common platforms, see how far we are off, we might be consistent afterall
23:23 <@heinrich5991> these must be the same on all platforms as well
23:24 <@heinrich5991> I think msvs might have a faulty math lib
23:24 <@heinrich5991> but it might just be handling of non-normal floats, I don't recall
23:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> IEEE doesn't guarantee trig functions no?
23:24 <@heinrich5991> it doesn't?
23:24 <@heinrich5991> I thought it does
23:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i think it only guarantees +,-,*,/,sqrt
23:25 <@heinrich5991> IEEE 754-2008, the most widely used standard for floating-point computation, does not address calculating trigonometric functions such as sine.
23:26 <@span> foobar</span>
23:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2013/07/16/floating-point-determinism/ this says it should be consistent for floats for most platforms
23:27 <@heinrich5991> (oh god)
23:28 <@heinrich5991> it seems that discord passes the chat messages unescaped to the notifications
23:28 <@heinrich5991> which interprets it as html
23:28 <@heinrich5991> I can never see the notifications because the IRC prepends a <> tag
23:28 <@heinrich5991> but when my name is span, I can see it again ._.
23:29 <+Learath2> :D
