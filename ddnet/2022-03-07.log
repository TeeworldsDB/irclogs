08:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Hehe nice finally the first rust code in ddnet code base. Good job heinrich5991#9827 the reverse proxy looks really cool!
08:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> So the proxy is a standalone binary written in rust? Does it have to be on the same machine? Or can one even trade latency to safe CPU on the main host by putting the proxy on a different server?
08:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg did what did i miss

10:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Something went wrong with my Steam upload, will try again
10:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Never seen it before that all files were uploaded empty, but I lost Internet connection around that time, so might be related to the network problem
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> tried it now works fine thx
12:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I downgraded the nightly, the issue is not fixed yet
12:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> :justatest:
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> :justatest: at least everyone that uses nightly can play again
13:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> `+showhookcoll; +toggle cl_show_hook_coll_other 2 1`
13:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> Why does this command takes 2 arguments ?
13:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> ( 2 1
13:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> ( 2 1 )
13:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> ```+showhookcoll; +toggle cl_show_hook_coll_other 2 1```
13:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> you used +toggle, which will use your second argument when you're holding the key it's bound to
13:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> you used +toggle, which will use your first argument when you're holding the key it's bound to
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> When not holding, it'll be reset to your second value
15:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> mmmr
15:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> mmmh
