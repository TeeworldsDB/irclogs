12:41 < Shishigami> Learath2: this is what I meant: http://i.imgur.com/nGEiiZJ.gifv
12:41 < Shishigami> I split the scrollbar with VSplit but it seems to extend all the way
12:42 < Learath2> hmm give me a second let me look at the code
12:47 < Learath2> Shishigami: can you debug?
12:47 < Learath2> dont have the dependencies for tw on this computer
12:51 < Learath2> well im guessing you are using the same pid for both
12:51 < Learath2> ill go get some breakfast
12:52 < Shishigami> I am
12:52 < Shishigami> can I not do that?
12:53 < Learath2> show me some code i havent touched ddnet for quite some time now
12:55 < Shishigami> Learath2: http://i.imgur.com/IL392PN.png 
12:56 < Learath2> ofc you can use a different pID
12:57 < Shishigami> then how do I bind both to InpMousesens?
13:00 < Learath2> iirc pID has nothing to do with what the ui element is bounded to
13:01 < Shishigami> oh, I think I get it now
13:01 < Shishigami> don't think its possible to achieve this then
13:02 < Learath2> sure it is why wouldnt it be
13:03 < Learath2> int t = 42; and then pass (void *)&t as the pID to one of them and keep this for the other
13:04 < Learath2> DoEditBox modifies the third argument so if you make that a pointer to inpmousesens that should make it modify mousesens but i'd probably first put it in a buffer then make sure there are no letters and suck
13:04 < Learath2> such*
13:04 < Learath2> you actually do need to put it in a buffer b/c inp_mousesens is a int
13:06 < Learath2> the return value of DoEditBox also gives you whether or not the input changed
13:08 < Learath2> the int needs to be static Shishigami 
13:08 < Learath2> forgot about that
13:12 < Shishigami> how come any changes in the editbox immediately revert? I think it might be better to print the actual sensitivity in the label like here: http://i.imgur.com/fQlWHNZ.png
13:13 < Learath2> its because before every render tick you reset the buffer to inp_mousesens but you dont change inp_mousesens after DoEditBox
13:13 < Learath2> so when the next tick comes it reverts
13:14 < Learath2> if(DoEditbox(blablablabla)){ inpmousesens = strtol(aBuf, NULL, 10); }
13:15 < Shishigami> ah, I didnt realize this is rendered every tick x)
13:15 < Shishigami> executed*
13:16 < Learath2> well its there every tick isnt it ? :)
13:16 < Learath2> should also make that text box smaller, i'd get the render width of a test numerical string like "0000" pad it a bit and call it a day
14:34 < Shishigami> "pad it a bit" you mean using HMargin? How come there is only ever 1.0f or 2.0f passed to it?
14:40 < Shishigami> I found a way to do it: http://i.imgur.com/lo4j9ou.png
14:46 < Learath2> Shishigami: I'd also center the text, pad it a lil bit more and call it a day
14:53 < Learath2> apparently DoEditBox is too cool for alignment or inside padding just forget what i said
14:53 < Learath2> push it and call it a day instead :P
15:10 < Learath2> apparently ddnet wont run on my laptop "[gfx]: unable to create window: No OpenGL support in video driver"
15:13 < Learath2> nvm forgot gentoo doesnt enable opengl in sdl by default
15:26 < Shishigami> dude I almost have centering working
15:27 < Shishigami> you can shove text inside DoEditBox to the right using a negative Offset
15:27 < Shishigami> now if only I had the math skills
15:28 < Learath2> thats just a hack, you cant center that way offset just keeps track of the cursor position
15:28 < Learath2> it needs to be handled in DoEditBox which i intend to do later today after im done studying
15:29 < Shishigami> oh
15:29 < Shishigami> alright then
15:29 < Learath2> you also need to pass a static int for offset btw if you arent doing so already
15:30 < Shishigami> I am
15:30 < Shishigami> I have it pretty much working, its just kinda awkward when the content is \0
15:30 < Learath2> what happens?
15:30 < Learath2> and how can content be \0
15:30 < Shishigami> i mean, if I remove everything
15:30 < Shishigami> i cant set InpMousesens = nothing after all
15:31 < Shishigami> so I just replace it with '1'
15:32 < Learath2> replace it with the default
15:32 < Shishigami> ideally Id expect it to not assign the editbox content to InpMousesens until its != '\0' but Im not sure howto do that
15:32 < Learath2> or refuse to assign
15:32 < Shishigami> if I simply dont assign it overrides with the previous value in the next tick
15:32 < Learath2> if(DoEditBox(blabla)) already should fix the problem
15:33 < Learath2> noooope nvm
15:33 < Shishigami> well, if I dont do anything it just automatically replaces it with 0
15:34 < Shishigami> but apparently then you cant move your mouse anymore
15:34 < Shishigami> which is interesting considering all other values dont influence mouse sensitivity in UI
15:34 < Learath2> well check if its \0 before passing it to strtol
15:35 < Learath2> if it is then dont assign the return of strtol
15:35 < Learath2> also for input containing letters
15:35 < Shishigami> I got that working
15:35 < Shishigami> Look, this is what I mean: http://i.imgur.com/G6ewXcA.gifv
15:36 < Shishigami> if I simply dont assign it it shows the previous value the next tick which is somewhat confusing as well
15:36 < Learath2> forgot editbox doesnt wait for an enter
15:37 < Shishigami> I mean, its probably not that big of a deal
15:37 < Learath2> doesnt look nice
15:37 < Learath2> if it goes \0 then assign the default it will give them an indication that they did sth wrong
15:38 < Learath2> and i dont think you should be able to assign values below 5 to inpmousesens
15:40 < Learath2> Oh or put the cursor to the last char
15:40 < Shishigami> yeah I had that idea as well
15:40 < Shishigami> (but not sure howto do that x))
15:43 < Learath2> well how would one input a new one digit sens like that
15:43 < Learath2> hmmmm
15:43 < Shishigami> left arrow
15:43 < Learath2> left arrow then input then delete
15:44 < Learath2> which is convoluted aswell
15:44 < Learath2> could have a static buffer and when one presses enter you try to assign. if invalid then put old value
15:44 < Learath2> BOOM
15:44 < Shishigami> that sounds genius
15:45 < Shishigami> now if only I knew how C I might be able to do that
15:45 < Learath2> well you got this far without knowing C
15:45 < Learath2> which is exactly how i started learning C btw
15:46 < Shishigami> do you happen to know Java
15:47 < Learath2> just like the static int you have get a static char aBuf[5]; if(LastActiveblabla && Keyheldidontremember == KEY_ENTER) str_copy;
15:48 < Learath2> i learned some java then i noticed its clearly inferior to C and its obsession with classes is clearly insane i decided not to continue on said adventure
15:49 < Shishigami> lmao
15:49 < Shishigami> yeah I have some long-term damage from that
15:49 < Learath2> s/insane/unhealthy/ could also work
15:50 < Shishigami> but it has some good points
15:50 < Learath2> like?
15:50 < Shishigami> but then you might as well python
15:50 < Learath2> well python is interpreted so no way it competes in performance. in syntax sure but then might aswell use nim.
15:51 < Shishigami> things that are simple to accomplish in Java are much more complicated in C imo but again, I dont know C
15:51 < Shishigami> i.e. standard library
15:51 < Learath2> yeah C doesnt do much hand holding or has much of a stdlib
15:52 < Learath2> clearly a great language to learn how things actually work
15:52 < Shishigami> aye
15:53 < Learath2> but after you know C most other languages are relatively easy to code in. any facility the stdlib provides you take and if it doesnt in most cases you know how to implement it yourself for you were forced to do so in C
15:57 < Shishigami> whats the point of casting to void*
15:58 < Shishigami> * btw? In some parts its with that cast and in some without
15:58 < Learath2> i simply dont remember if C++ allows implicit cast to void*
15:59 < Learath2> in C its allowed to pass any pointer if a function wants a void*
16:01 < Shishigami> Alright, I'll see about that static stuff sometime, for now this seems to work: https://github.com/marcelherd/ddnet/commit/4556ea4d031ac3c8a4bc61029907d21935ce1206
17:27 < Shishigami> Learath2: thanks, Ill take a look soon. Got exams in a few days x)
17:28 < Learath2> i have an exam tomorrow :/
17:30 < Shishigami> feelsbadman
17:30 < Shishigami> what exam is it
17:38 < Learath2> math analysis 1
17:39 < Shishigami> I wrote that on friday x)
17:39 < Learath2> im barely done with learning and have like 8 hours i can practice before getting too tired
20:45 < Shishigami> Learath2: in practice I find it rather confusing; I think it would be better to check every tick if input is valid and then apply it (i.e. like it is now, just without the editbox content reseting)
21:09 < Learath2> well i made quite a few variations of it and pushed the one I liked the most
21:09 < Learath2> ultimately we are not the ones with commit access so i guess upstream decides
21:27 < Ryozuki> http://stackoverflow.com/a/11629682/7310722
21:33 < Shishigami> I see
