11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Polar> anyone know where can i create my logo for a map ? (with colors)
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> you can use any image editor you like. then export the image as a png and put it into the `mapres` folder in your data_directory. then you can load it in the editor
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :ddnet: suggesting:ddnet: 
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> add thing like solo part but for two players (every two together alone)
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> And if you are a team of 3 you fail
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> hmm
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> Use of this can be made optional or the mapper can  writingwrit in beginning this map need 2 or double this than tee
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> if we  do this i not think this will be  big problem we can find    a lot solution
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> solve*
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> hi ðŸ‘€
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> @deen would it be tedious for you to set up multiple 5mbps servers
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nope, that's fine. I can set them up quickly
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> We can just buy more 5mbps servers since they are the cheapest, and some people are willing to get their one time student discount for us
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> They can get overloaded naturally because players congregate in one location
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nice
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> so maybe we can just open maybe 5 to 6 ddnetservers per server so we don't get overloaded if we get enough servers?
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes
17:05 <+ChillerDragon> longest commit message i have ever seen xxd @heinrich5991 also lol seems like github is censoring now https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1611936280.png
17:05 <+ChillerDragon> time to move to another git platform
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gitlab.ddnet.tw
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @deen you think this possible or impossible? if was possible i would open new issue maybe somebody like it and do it
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> most maps are designed to work with 2 ppl
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so its useless
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think it's a good idea. It increases complexity in playing, and most people don't like playing in team already
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and of course it would be hard to make work correctly without cheats, especially with switches
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @hussainx3 you can kinda fake this with multiple parts that look the same and switches so that 2 ppl go into the same part
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u really need it
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> but the problem usually Congestion occurs not just 2ppl
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> you right but i think with this become easier
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> anyway this just suggest
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> you right but i think with this will become easier
17:55 <+ChillerDragon> which variable stores how many times a character jumped already or how many jumps are left?
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> ah probably m_JumpedTotal
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> ye
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> always thought its m_Jumped and never realized its wrong xd
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: I think github always supported comment deletion, this thing is just transparency
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as a result you seem to complain because github started being more transparent about comment hiding
20:01 <+ChillerDragon> its from 2017 so idk how new this censor thing is but yea its nice that one can still read it i also do not know when it was introduced so it was no serious critic i guess
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-364
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good post
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it contains stuff about multithreading
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> omg
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> you can mirror blueprints in 1.1 o.o
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> almost all of factorio blogposts are a gem
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like the game itself
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they also have the policy to never go on sale
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> out of respect of ppl who purchased before
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw the post had a easter egg / rumor about an upcoming new project by wube
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (wube the company that develops factorio)
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > So I'm pretty thrilled to finally get to the point, where we actually have 0 known issues and 0 active bug reports on the forums. Its like cleaning the kitchen properly, so you can start cooking something fresh. More about that next week!
