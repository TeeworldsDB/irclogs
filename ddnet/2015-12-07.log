00:29 <@deen> Just saw what qqqq described, some guy who wants to blackmail me/ddnet
00:29 <@deen> if anyone wants to add the antispoofing stuff to all other mods, go ahead
00:33 < devnull> what does he want?
00:37 <@deen> don't know and don't care
12:30 < TwItCh_> Hi
12:30 < TwItCh_> Any coders here?
12:31 < laxa> TwItCh_: Hi, for what ?
12:32 < TwItCh_> Im running a ddnet server , but it saves the top5 , but when player gets a time and disconnects server and rejoins the time is gone
12:32 < laxa> Look your server's log
12:32 < TwItCh_> yes?
12:32 < laxa> How do you run the server ?
12:33 < TwItCh_> through a screen
12:33 < TwItCh_> on ubuntu
12:33 < laxa> Do you log the output of your server ?
12:33 < laxa> Are you using SQL base records ?
12:34 < TwItCh_> No but I want to
12:34 < laxa> Well
12:34 < TwItCh_> Ive installed mysql on server and created db
12:35 < laxa> have you configured the server settings to use the mysql instance then ?
12:35 < TwItCh_> nope xD
12:35 < laxa> Well
12:35 < laxa> Don't even know if there are document for that
12:35 < laxa> but look on settings starting or containing SQL inside
12:36 < laxa> need to set : adresse of db / name of user / password / name of database
12:36 < laxa> for teeworlds server
12:36 < laxa> but right now, if you are having no records saved
12:36 < laxa> that's probably cause of bad rights on your ubuntu
12:37 < TwItCh_> the records get saved in top5
12:37 < TwItCh_> just not the records on the player name
12:37 < laxa> by default
12:37 < laxa> server use a file to save records
12:37 < TwItCh_> whats the command to use sql in cfg file
12:38 < TwItCh_> ye
12:38 < laxa> check if that file has new records when someone finishes
12:38 < laxa> you can search the commands on ddnet.tw or teeworlds.com
12:38 < laxa> that has to be somewhere
12:40 < TwItCh_> ok thanks but the name and the time gets saved in a dtb file
12:40 < TwItCh_> under records folder
12:40 < laxa> yes
12:40 < laxa> But I don't understand the problem with your server not recording records
12:40 < laxa> if you tell me you have a file
12:41 < laxa> created
12:41 < laxa> check if your new record is inside it
12:41 < TwItCh_> thats why I don't understand
12:41 < TwItCh_> I just completed a map now and it saved it
12:41 < laxa> are you running the server with different accounts ?
12:41 < TwItCh_> nvm it works
12:42 < TwItCh_> sorry ...
12:42 < laxa> Np
12:42 < TwItCh_> It didn't seem to work last time 
12:42 < laxa> But if you wanna run ddnet with SQL based records
12:42 < laxa> you'll need maria db rather than mysql if I am correct
12:42 < TwItCh_> Don't know what iI changed
12:42 < laxa> and you shouldn't do that on your own computer
12:42 < TwItCh_> oh yeah I have that installed
12:42 < TwItCh_> yea its on a vps
12:42 < laxa> ok then
12:42 < TwItCh_> ubuntu based server
12:43 < TwItCh_> Oh thats weird
12:43 < TwItCh_> when I connect to the server with my TwItCh
12:43 < TwItCh_> it doesnt show a time
12:44 < TwItCh_> then when I change my name to TwItChs and back to TwItCh then it shows time again
12:44 < laxa> Is it vanilla teeworlds ? ddnet ?
12:44 < TwItCh_> ddnet
12:44 < laxa> what happens when you do /rank ?
12:44 < TwItCh_> shows the rank of TwItCh
12:44 < laxa> then it's a probably a client bug
12:45 < laxa> not a server bug
12:45 < TwItCh_> oh could be
12:45 < TwItCh_> When I connect to server with TwItCh I do rank and it shows rank
12:45 < TwItCh_> but when I hold tab to show times it doesn't show a time next to my name
12:47 < TwItCh_> oops
