08:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <üñ§Smetanolubüíé> for this you just have to fold all the finishes on all your finished maps
08:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <üñ§Smetanolubüíé> btw, why
09:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I'll start again with the http masters
09:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I keep ending up with a design I don't really like
10:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so what happend to the donation?
10:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can we get an official ddnet statment or can i blindly trust konstis statement?
10:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't even know what konsti said
10:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that jao convinced deen to not accept the money and ban konsti again
10:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because he is biggest troll
10:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It was @heinrich5991 who was against taking it and not @jao
10:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's a fair decision, paying for an unban shouldn't really be a thing
10:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways, I've been trying to link this god damn json library for the last 2 hours and i've had enough of it
10:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no paying for a unban is wrong. But you know what is also wrong. Banning konsti in the first place. He is a valuable member of the community. Also nobody forced you to unban him only because he paid.
10:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm replacing it with `nlohmann/json` or `Tencent/rapidjson` asap
10:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I knew you'd be like this @ChillerDragon, fortunately I don't care much for this "everyone should be able to do whateverthefuck they want"
10:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can't go around spouting racist bs and get away with it
10:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes it is unlucky that such a nice person doesnt fit the current anti racist mindset
10:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Well but i do agree with both of you guys here. But you didn't have to unban him.
10:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> anti racist mindset?
10:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you on drugs @ChillerDragon?
10:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> When was racism ever okay?
10:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> racism was nevre okay but hating against it is hmm
10:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Normal
10:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You consume way too much reddit
10:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i prefer to not exclude racist people and let them in their bubble. But rather see their good parts and then hang out with them and try to talk with them.
10:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm all for not making this a "safespace" doesn't mean I'll tolerate racism
10:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i spend like 20min on reddit...
10:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Each hour xd
10:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> some of his racism sounds like jokes and its not like 24/7
10:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We tolerated it for so long, because they seemed like jokes
10:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Didn't saw racist joke for a month
10:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rather improve ddnet bot and censor racist messages than excluding a person. Its not that konsti choose to be racist @Learath2
10:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but after banning the guy for what, 50 times now, he still didn't stop
10:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> True
10:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do you think he decided to become racist just to be evil
10:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon It's not a choice to be racist?
10:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont think so
10:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Hi, I have a way to fix Tune zones, so that the projectiles of players inside another tune zone dont look buggy to you anymore. The only disadvantage is, that the projectiles would disappear every 4th tick (not noticalbe in normal gameplay). Is it worht it? I guess no?
10:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i also dont think its a choice to be hompophoic etc
10:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It most definitely is a choice @ChillerDragon
10:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if you want to be really tolerant you have to tolerant the people who arent
10:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or you re not any better
10:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut hmm, maybe we could fix it properly with ddnet
10:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But only in ddnet
10:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon No, this is just insane, you don't tolerate things that are unacceptable
10:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> konsti excludes peopkle for being muslems and we exclude him for being racist
10:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> who says we are better now
10:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Chillerdragon would help an terrorist with blowing shit up because it was his legacyüò¨
10:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you all right @ChillerDragon?
10:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> did konsti harm any one on this discord?
10:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Would you support ISIS spreading their agenda just so they have "free speech"?
10:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont know i have no contact to ISIS
10:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i only hacve contact to konsti and i think things went wrong here
10:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah easy way out for the libertarian
10:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> "Idk that faction"
10:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon thats why you aint admin
10:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess
10:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't feel like escalating this right now, but I'll just say that I find your position completely insane and borderline the problem with society nowadays
10:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is necessary to draw lines in the sand on some things, not everything can be FREE
10:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sure
10:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> I still agree with banning this guy, but it should not be a lifetime.
10:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and i am happy you are against my position
10:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because you should be allowed to üòÉ
10:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @n000b what's the point of unbanning him every 10 days?
10:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKcWu0tsiZM @Learath2 this is also fucked tbh
10:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Well 10 days is too short, but what is the problem giving new chances even if it is already his 100th.
10:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon I'm very familiar with that video, while it is insane, I find it no surprise that you'd link me that
10:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i want say that i am not like this xd
10:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> He knows what is gonna happen and maybe he think that being able to talk is more worth than getting banned sooner or later.
10:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @n000b do you think he changed? @ChillerDragon thinks he shouldn't need to change, atleast he has a clear position on the issue
10:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you think he changed, you also have a valid position
10:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you think he didn't change then my argument is that "He will just get banned again thus there is no point of unbanning him"
10:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon you aren't like the guys in that video obv
10:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe the one with trhe glasses xd
10:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Point is, konsti got banned a handful of times and he didn't change, a donation shouldn't get him an unban
10:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i fully agree that money for unban is fucked
10:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> even if it could fill ddnet pockets xd
10:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> people also offer money for name change
10:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea no thats not the way to go i think
10:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's a little better than for an unban
10:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> as long as we can verify that a name belongs to someone, we can do a name change
10:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> paid namechanges could pay the admins time invloived in changing it
10:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but thats a different topic i guess
10:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's just some work, so the donation is like covering for the work
10:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> same thoughts @Learath2  ‚ù§
10:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> paying for an unban is like paying so the rules don't apply to you
10:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sounds like trump
10:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i think konsti is big trump fanboi
10:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> But why dont accept the gift and keep him banned?
10:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> agree on that
10:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and still honor him
10:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> But why dont we accept the gift and keep him banned?
10:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he told me he didnt donate for unban
10:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> He sent the donation with the expectation to be unbanned
10:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> we returned it because we didn't unban him
10:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he was already sponsoring chile while banned
10:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> he donated because he supports ddnet, where did he say it had anything to do with being unbanned..
10:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sure @deen and @heinrich5991 wouldn't have a problem with accepting it if he sends it again
10:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
10:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont think he expected a unban
10:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby he literally came up to me ingame and said 500e for unban lmao
10:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt mean he said it seriously
10:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that was probably a mix of jokje and hope but he cant expect that
10:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> im sure he wanted unban but that doesnt mean he actually seriously means its dependant on that
10:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you give him too much or too little credit
10:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the excuse of saying it attracts ddosers
10:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i find it a bit silly
10:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hey but its not my problem, i dont pay the servers, up to u
10:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @Learath2 if an unban isbworth so much money, don't you think he would care and try to follow the rules instead of getting banned within 2 weeks?
10:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways, I don't think anyone would have a problem with taking his money no strings attached
10:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there were n ostrings attached
10:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki it was implied that he wanted to pay 500e for an unban, then he paid the 500, there were implied strings imho
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nope
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/599882575330410497/unknown.png
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just assumed it
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he sent the money without u telling them ok
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he never expected
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a unban
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur just plain dumb
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The guy literally came up to me and asked if I'd unban if he donated 500
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> How much clearer can it get?
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> HE IS TROLL OFC HE WOULD DO THAT
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but did u ever agreed with him? NO
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> in #general deen just said that he asked right after the donation for unban
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> THERE ARE NO STRINGS ATTACHED
10:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> WHY ARE YOU DEFENDING HIS EVERY ACTION WTF?
10:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> only integers
10:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> (sorri)
10:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does he need to sign a fucking contract for things he says to be serious?
10:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not defending his action, im making evidence of how dumb of u for returing 500‚Ç¨
10:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @Ryozuki he is a troll so ofcourse he would say it wasn't for an inban
10:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Same logic
10:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> At this rate he was never racist, nor was he ever breaking any rules, it was just jokes and memes, so we should unban him anyway
10:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur making shit up now
10:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never said he is not a nazi
10:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if a nazi sent me money the last i would do is return it lmao
10:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are telling me what he said to me point blank was not serious
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> How am I supposed to ever verify what he says if even his words themselves can't be trusted?
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> why do u have to verify anything
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u shut up and take the money
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> to accept money
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> ye exactly
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> No he trolled ryozuki by saying it wasn't for an inban
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Look, it was courtesy to return his donation when he didn't get what we think he expected
10:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye courtesy
10:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more like looking ridiculous in front of everyone
10:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but its openly visible that he donated a lot of money. soy ou cant just tak eit and shut up about it
10:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it will still be visible that he doanted lot of money even if u return it
10:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And it was a reasonable assumption on our part that he expected an unban (given he literally told me that)
10:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @Im 'corneum finaly someone with a brain
10:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but u dont have to comply with that
10:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> So if he wants to send it regardless, atleast I wouldn't have a problem with it
10:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a donation is implied that there is nothing on retunr
10:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> eveyrone would be ok with that
10:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with u not unbaning
10:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I don't really want to talk for others
10:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Conclusion both side got good arguments, if he wants he can send the money again. Discussion closed.
10:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not that far stretched that after taking any money from him, people would think that if he ever gets unbanned it'd be because his money "made us relax the rules"
10:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I personally don't think that
10:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But I can see someone taking that position

10:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> more 300 but 500 would be funny

10:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> buying weapons on black market
10:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh wow it's actually a ddnet donation?
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> in case i get banned for supporting nazis :troll:
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to reject it
10:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess rejecting btc is waste of money cuz fees
10:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki are you being intentionally dense like always or are you just joking? I can't tell today
10:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how can he know its u chiller
10:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im just joking
10:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i donated with same adddress already
10:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon well since the network is very unbusy nowadays you can send with minimal fees :troll:
10:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do you know how much?
10:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is bitcoin ded?
10:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nah
10:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its increasing in price
10:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> probably stupid of me to give it away
10:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> where to buy bitcoin @Learath2
10:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ask my mom
10:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> she has sone
10:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think fstd even got a 3 spb transaction through
10:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon I usually put 5 satoshi per byte
10:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u chill with fstd still?
10:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> takes like half an hour to get through though
10:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk my wallet decides i guess
10:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> sometimes tho it's like 10 mins üòõ
10:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon wat wallet u using
10:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> exodus
10:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I usually get btc from coinbase or localbitcoins
10:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 and u?
10:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is exodus made with electron
10:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like
10:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i think so
10:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Electrum
10:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> looks slick
10:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
10:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nice light theme
10:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I used to have an entire node
10:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> exodus has more crypto currencies than bitcoin right
10:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then some patch broke syncing, I didnt have a backup and I didnt want to download all that shit again
10:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 whats bitcoin cash?
10:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a fork of btc

10:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i dont care anymore do whathever lmao
10:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i agree with him being banned if he is racist and a nazi
10:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but why remove the bitcoin address
10:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I want to know that one aswell :P
10:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Too much bitcoin?
10:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Because it's way too much work to pay out
10:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen might aswell keep it as btc?
10:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> might go down to 0 ‚Ç¨ though
10:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Might go up to 20k again \‚óã/
10:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Think of it as an investment for ddnets future
10:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could have proper ddos protection
10:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
11:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyways, I don't mind cashing it out if you don't want to bother
11:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or could remove the address I guess
11:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> lol i just realized you could buy a new laptop
11:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I went back and got my laptop @Im 'corneum
11:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ah
11:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It ended up cheaper then a new one :D
11:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> didnt u just say there is no need for a stable future @deen? So if you don rely on that money and you are too lazy. Then ye see it as an investment. Its not even your money.
11:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I'll host another GER2 experiment soon
11:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> btc was a nice dontation method :c
11:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon do you only have btc? or did you invest in other coins aswell?
11:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i invested in iota but i think i lost the coins in trhe void
11:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I keep some monero, ethereum and bitcoin
11:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> iota :((
11:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i was pretty early
11:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the money I lost on iota keeps me up at nights
11:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i never was able to sell it i think i lost my seed or the wallet was broken idk
11:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways, does anyone have a problem with me replacing the json library?
11:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what r u talkin about xd
11:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> in ddnet?
11:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah
11:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idc
11:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 damn coinbase wants to know all about me, nope
11:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki yeah no anonymity there
11:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you want to identify yourself as little as possible localbitcoins is the way to go
11:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but even there most sellers wont deal with you if you haven't done the id verification
11:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :cammostripes:
11:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll sell you bitcoins with a 10% markup if you want üòõ
11:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> great, so first I have to send the btcs to another address, wait a few hours and then I can pay them out
11:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i actually asked you if it is okay to donate btc but you keept ignoring me as mostly
11:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> nah, I was eating breakfast
11:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if you would communicate that and responde to any of the pms im sending you since 20.06.2019 that would be nice.
11:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and not ignore me in pms and complain in public abaut the donation.
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> there were no questions
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen wait a few hours?
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, first to verify my id, which takes 5 days apparently
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you don't already have an account at an exchange?
11:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and then wait a few hours for the blockchain to realize that I wanted to transfer money
11:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I have about 10 accounts but none of them can get out money immediately
11:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> always have to transfer to another address first
11:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well a block is out every 10 minutes, you usually get your transaction through in 3 blocks, so 30 mins to transfer to the exchange does sound reasonable
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, does actually take a while now that i think about it üòÑ
11:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and no exchange in their right minds would just accept confirmations and not wait for the transaction to actually get in a block
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Meh, spent nearly one hour trying to figure this out now
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> way too complicated, but sending the money back also doesn't work
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's usually just one bitcoin transaction to an exchange wallet
11:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes, but why am I supposed to that? It's expensive
11:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> even at 10 satoshi per byte that would come out to sth like 0.3$
11:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> go crazy and make it 50 satoshi per byte and you are still supposed to be paying less then 2$ on transaction fees
11:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's usually the exchanges rate that's worse then the average rate that gets you
11:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you'd rather not bother with the extra transaction you could always put up a bitcoin address to one of your exchange wallets
11:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can also always just send it to me and I'll redonate it through paypal üòõ
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have decided I don't like cmake
12:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 lets go back to bam pls
12:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> or maybe autohell
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
12:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> lets ddos paypal by sending money around
12:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> if you are going to switch buildsystems again, why not switch to something like meson or tup?
12:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we wont switch lol
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <BXLXR> i still can't connect to the ddnet servers, why lmao
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <BXLXR> even client switched
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #general
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u keep asking this everyday
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <BXLXR> is it still ddosing?
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <BXLXR> okay, shit
12:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I suggest running your own server and playing there with your friends
12:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and not making it public
12:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> who is ddosing nowadays I wonder
12:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its even save to make it public small servers usually dont get attacked
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it's a good time to run a GER2 while they are attacking
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is there a way to use a function from CServer inside of CConsole?
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut hmm, not really, doesn't sound like it'd be appropriate either
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> what are you trying to do?
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I added a paramter to command registration, which defines the access level. I only want to show specific commands in /cmdlist, not only USER accessables, if logged in to rcon, also chat commands that only admins can use
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Therefore I need GetAuthedState() from CServer :D
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut there is a reason we didn't add the access level as a parameter to register back in the day üòÑ
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why?
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because of this?
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It leads to this issue
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will find a way
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, probably noz
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not*
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ofc there is a way, it'll just create a  lot of spaghetti code
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I have an idea
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Tell me
12:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 well, then you probably pay paypal transaction fees additionally
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually no, the way we implemented chat commands doesn't allow it @fokkonaut :/
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> we set the console command level low before executing chat commands
12:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so the access level information is lost
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh actually that seems fixed
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut in `ConUserCommandStatus` instead of calling `access_status` with `IConsole::ACCESS_LEVEL_USER`, call it with `m_AccessLevel`
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> `CGameContext::OnMessage` seems to be setting it properly before executing chat commands
12:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Dope
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thanks, lol
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> doesitwork? üòõ
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes
12:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> one problem I see is that admins should be able to execute any rcon command from chat
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but I distinctly remember it not working üòÑ
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No, not working
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> only if I add the CFGFLAG_CHAT to the commands
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder where it gets stuck
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ^
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh we flag it
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> `Console()->SetFlagMask(CFGFLAG_CHAT);`
12:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `CONSOLE_COMMAND("super", "?v[id]", CFGFLAG_SERVER|CFGFLAG_CHAT|CMDFLAG_TEST, ConSuper, this, "Makes player v super", AUTHED_ADMIN)
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this would allow admins to use super as /super in chat
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you do add access level to register, make sure you set it properly as default
12:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wym
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if no access level is passed, set it to a reasonable default, like ACCESS_LEVEL_ADMIN
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I wont allow no argument
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well then you'd have to go and replace every call to `Register` without introducing any behavioral changes
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> might aswell let the compiler do the work üòõ
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i just did xD
12:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It is not too much
12:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't get anything to link for the life of me
12:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I give up, I'll fix another issue üòõ
12:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Or look at my pull requests
12:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :)

13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> @ChillerDragon ehre
13:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `errornous client id`
13:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> love it
13:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> trying to get dbg_dummies to work again without them crashing the server xD
13:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh i had that latley
13:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> when spamming too much helath and armor
13:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol
13:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
13:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> th erronous client id thing yy
13:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why should it come from too much armor
13:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk maybe the get ids
13:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
13:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that has nothing to do with client ids
13:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah nvm
13:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it was "id erro"
13:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/issues/256
13:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> mi nobo
13:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ya dbg dummies could be usefull for circleci
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if we had a sleep command as well ...
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/blob/master/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L137
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why are you gay
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> didnt u plan something there @Learath2
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just read log
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh no it was some await comnmand
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> who says im gay?
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you are gay
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xxxd
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> LOL
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> WTF
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I looked into it @ChillerDragon
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not too easy
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm sad
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what about good ol sleep
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The console is very much single threaded :D
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> imagien this in circleci
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ./DDNet-Server "gdb_dummies 32;sleep 20;shutdown"
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon if you spawn too many entities, it makes sense that there are no free ids xD
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> mimimi
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> issue is closed already onbo
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you are gay
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that nice
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol, you were literally trying to spawn 999999999999 hearts
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddnet bot no u xxxd
13:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then who is gay?
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `m_TrailProjs[i]->m_Pos += (m_TrailHistory[HistoryPos + 1].m_Pos - m_TrailProjs[i]->m_Pos)*(AdditionalLength / NextDist);` why does this line crash in latest ddnet but not in ddnet 9.0.2
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> whoknows
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea, i dont
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats why i am asking
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> depends on how it crashes
13:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> with a nice popup
13:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Debug Assertion Failed, deque subscript out of range
13:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well there are two subscripts there so either i or HistoryPos + 1 is going out of range üòÑ
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I wonder why it doesnt crash in 9.0.2
13:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've never hated anything as much as trying to work with json in c++
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 sorry for asking again, but why is string formatting not enough for building json?
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need to iterate over players
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it quickly leads to a very ugly format string
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm okay
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean I did have a workaround planned
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> still don't want to commit ugly code
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 send help, can't find the issue for my problem xd
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut use gdb
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I have another problem though, I'm having trouble designing a nice architecture in the code
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i am using visual studio
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> use its debugger
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and ignore @Learath2 next line
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üòõ
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> üòÑ
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I'm having trouble getting it clean, I have a class that maintains a connection to the masterservers
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like the old `CRegister`?
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I had another class to represent an HTTP server info
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with a serialize and unserialize function
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> like the old`IMasterServer`
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's hard to talk without a reference
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/compare/master...Learath2:dd_pr_http_masters2
13:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not very pleased about the interface to `GetServerList`
13:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And `RegisterUpdate` is borderline legal üòõ
13:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's code that shouldn't ever be on the client
13:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I don't actually think you need to share code between server/client beyond "get the contents of hmasters.cfg"
13:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on server side we have register.cpp, on client side we have serverbrowser.cpp
13:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wanted to have a `CHRegister` that handles that stuff, but then it'd need access to the internals of `CHMasterServer`
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think serverbrowser.cpp should be handling the specifics of the protocol tbh, even the current pieces look ugly
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, okay
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe a `CHClientMaster` and a `CHServerMaster` that implement the same interface?
13:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm.
13:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and a base class that implements the common part
13:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean `CMasterServer` before was just involved with doing a DNS lookup for the master servers
13:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if we'd keep things the same way, we could make it a pretty interface to a list of strings in hmasters.cfg
13:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Currently CHMasterserver reads a hmasters, checks that the masters are valid, and keeps checking a couple times
13:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if a master is live its marked with `STATE_LIVE`
13:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's all I want it to do tbh
13:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is that for?
13:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> So the other parts are simpler
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. Register knows for sure that the LIVE masters are working so it can just query those
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if a master dies otherwise we'd keep sending it messages
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think you should lower the interval in which you're sending updates to masters that 1) have banned you or 2) return errors on your requests
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. register has to deal with that anyway, it's just one of the failure cases(?)
13:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking of letting the client and the server parts mark the master servers ERROR, so the common part tries a couple times, and if they still wont respond mark them INVALID
13:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I basically want to keep all the code involved in new classes so that we can test it independently
13:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> So hooks into the existing code needs to be kept small
13:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yep, I'm in favor of that
13:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that doesn't imply sharing code between server and client
13:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's why I didnt really want to make serverbrowser.cpp aware of the protocol
13:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then let's maybe create a new file
13:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> call it foobar.cpp until we figure out a name üòõ
13:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But the problem is that the server and client need to share some code and definitely not share other code
13:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I feel like having another status endpoint just increases complexity)
13:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, so currently it's status endpoint and reading hmasters.cfg
13:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yed, the status endpoint can be removed, but I think it's nice to have
14:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can inagine using it
14:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even without that we still need it to read hmasters.cfg
14:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yep
14:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that can be nicely contained
14:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it'd essentially be a glorified list with a storage backend and a default üòÑ
14:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean even if we share that code there is some common part, as soon as you have a common part its not that hard to add more
14:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what common part is there beyond this?
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean if you leave it just handling hmasters its still a common part
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. but that's a nice clean interface, one can do the rest in the respective client/server source
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thats 2 more source files
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
14:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also its not that clean
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> As both the server part and the client part will need to keep a list of masters
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Essentially doubling up code
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't follow
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its what we have now
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cregister and cserverbrowser both keep states for the masters on their own
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> So I guess state handling should also be common code
14:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm
14:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe with a better interface it'd look acceptable, but the current interface is very much meh
14:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> All the getters and setters
14:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess you'd need to keep state per masterserver in the register code anyway
14:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You'd also need to keep state in the client code
14:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd keep the state in the client/server code then
14:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> since otherwise you'd share weird stuff
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll give it another go, but I dont see if itll fit together nicely
14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen @ano also seems to get the certificate thing, I wonder if its not isolated to china
14:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should be able to hook in with `CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION` and print the cert out
14:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 do they also see the correct certificate in the browser?
15:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> apparently on mac osx you get /usr/bin/openssl linked to libressl
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ...
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> why must everything be a struggle? can't get openssl linked on mac os without fiddling around forever
21:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon do you happen to know the proper solution?
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hombrew tells u even
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 i have this in my .bash_profile
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin:$PATH"
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/pkgconfig"
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> look at that mess üò¶
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I didn't ever think that'd be the "proper" solution
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> doesnt look mess to me at all
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i used to copy brew libs into xcode paths
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that was a mess
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I added OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR to my cmake arguments
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> atleast that's just one argument I need to bother with
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently dbg_curl, already prints the certificates :/
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> apparently not if the certificate verification fials
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> fails*
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> how stupid, you'd want to know the cert if it failed more then if it succeeded
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh I bet the windows build doesn't link to openssl...
21:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Please, for the sake of everything that's holy, can someone build this branch with openssl?
21:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1825
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ofc it doesn't link on linux, because fuck backwards compatible apis
21:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe I should just open a cafe somewhere
21:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cafe?
21:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> like a proper cafe, where one sells coffee
21:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I like coffee, it's simple, you put beans in coffee comes out
21:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> always
21:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet it's because curl is linked to an ancient version of openssl, that's causing the executable to link against an old af version of openssl
22:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and to no surprise the version of curl on circleci links to openssl 1.0.2s
22:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Imagine releasing a mission critical library, to be used by millions of people, by thousands of pieces of software that run critical cryptographic operations and having documentation worse then teeworlds with backwards compatibility of a cs students first attempt to write a library
22:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't know how to get this to link either, next project
22:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> even if I get it to link, curl on windows uses winapi crypto, and the hook i'm using doesn't support winapi crypto
22:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay I'm calling curl bug on that, I'm not sure why it only happens on some people
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/8996300 fixes a TODO, that says on windows only the first name would be checked on certs with alternative names
22:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I only see one name on the certificate on ddnet.tw
22:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see many
22:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 
22:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/600061521732567041/Screenshot_2019-07-14_at_23.30.03.png
22:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen any reason we aren't using a wildcard one btW?
22:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wildcard support is new for let's encrypt and needs programmatic support at the dns hoster to change records
22:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye it not good rn
22:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i tried it
22:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can also do the dns challenge iirc
22:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have it running quite smoothly for learath2.info
22:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 isn't that exactly what I said üò¶
22:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ooh, I never updated learath2.info
22:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had it running on some other project
22:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 well you can set a dns record on any hoster
22:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you just can't have it automatic
22:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea well
22:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> non-automatic ssl certificates are a bad idea
22:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> we could automate it if we hosted our own dns, we have enough servers for it
22:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> or we could use a dns hoster with support for an auto challange
22:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> challenge*
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, see above
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways, beside the point, I think the issue here is the libcurl bug
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yup
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> update libcurl and fix it?
22:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but I can't prove it, b/c it should be happening to everyone
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 we have version 7.65, and the fix seems to be in that version
22:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes, somehow on those two peoples computers curl ends up older maybe
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm perhaps
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe in windows directory or somewhere
22:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you know what takes precedence for ddls?
22:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dlls*
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the one next to the exe has the highest
22:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it might be the cwd aswell
22:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> >If a DLL with the same module name is already loaded in memory, the system checks only for redirection and a manifest before resolving to the loaded DLL, no matter which directory it is in. The system does not search for the DLL.
22:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wat
22:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> wait what?
22:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order
22:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so if an old dll is loaded, it just uses it if the module name matches?
22:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not entirely sure about the wording
22:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds very broken if it were true
22:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well we'll see as soon as appveyor compiles
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps they mean "if already loaded by the same program"
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hopefully
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which windows version were these people on?
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ano is on windows 7, idk about the other guy
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but If you were thinking some windows xp shenanigans I did so aswell üòõ
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üòÑ
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can imagine win xp older then sp3 not supporting SNI
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> indeed
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if anyone even uses xp sp2 nowadays that is üòõ
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ano seems to actually have gone offline, I guess we'll need to wait to know what it links to üò¶
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> windows xp sp3 still doesn't support sni apparently(?)
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> No, he is still here \o/
22:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> No, he is leaving rn /o\
23:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you windows?
23:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> watching msvc is like watching a cripple old man trying to build a house by hand
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> what an absolutely useless day, spent a quarter day trying to link json-builder, another quarter struggling with cmake, and another quarter with this stupid libcurl bug and not even getting an answer
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the first two quarters combine to a half of struggling with cmake
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wanna end it with struggling to finish a ddnet map?
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only have a laptop üò¶
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> no mouse no keyboard
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well a shitty keyboard
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> easy
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> trackpad
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and on mac ddnet runs like shit, turns my computer to a toaster owen
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oven*
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> y have macbook?
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and even then it runs at like 10fps
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 I did ios development for like 6-8 months
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ahh kk
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> then my thinkpad died
23:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well the battery
23:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> then I stuck with this b/c it'd be a waste to get a new one when I have a working laptop
23:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> yeah
23:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe I should hire a guy off of upwork to link the json library
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> you are rly struggling xd
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> alright time for me xd have a good night struggling with this xd
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> jeez do you have a used macbook air from 2012 @Learath2 ?
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> even my old macbook doent turn hot while playing tw
