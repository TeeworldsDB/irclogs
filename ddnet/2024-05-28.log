00:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I did not review PRs today
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> me neither
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> good morning üåû
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> if u i can even say that
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> 4:37 pm :feelsbadman:
01:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i think i will just use plasma :feelsbadman:
01:55 < bridge> <lukron55> i never got an answer before but is there a way i can somehow run this: https://uptime.lukron.xyz/api/push/rl3wv29Hds?status=up&msg=OK&ping= so that when my ddnet server is on it shows on uptime kuma
01:55 < bridge> <lukron55> is there anywhere i can just add it
02:02 < bridge> <lukron55> i tried nanoing into the DDNet-Server executable to add it and thats never gonna happen
02:45 < bridge> <Ewan> wha
02:45 < bridge> <Ewan> you can't text edit a compiled binary
04:12 < bridge> <louis> it might be easier to just run another script in parallel that pings your server ip and then queries that website if you don't want to mess with ddnet code
05:08 < bridge> <Ewan> teeworlds servers don‚Äôt implement ping
06:18 < bridge> <totar> Just send a packet that gets a response
06:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3a44u0DxCA
07:12 < bridge> <egyt> I just realised now: after the change they made to "Spectate" it will stay "Spectate" for English, and that's not what I want
07:13 < bridge> <egyt> I'll even compile from source once more
07:16 < bridge> <egyt> And, probably, make a commit reverting their change related to "Spectate"
07:35 < bridge> <Ewan> What are you doing again
07:51 < bridge> <egyt> \#8403
07:51 < bridge> <egyt> Urgh. https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8403
07:53 < bridge> <egyt> I did, and it practicly undid all changes I made: it again shows Name (the "—ñ–º'—è" one) and Spectate (instead of Spectating)
07:53 < bridge> <egyt> I did, and it practicaly undid all changes I made: it again shows Name (the "—ñ–º'—è" one) and Spectate (instead of Spectating)
07:53 < bridge> <egyt> I did, and it practically undid all changes I made: it again shows Name (the "—ñ–º'—è" one) and Spectate (instead of Spectating)
07:54 < bridge> <egyt> Now I can say "they broke what I've fixed"
07:55 < bridge> <egyt> I need help again...
08:09 < bridge> <egyt> So, to clarify myself again, I want two strings modified:
08:09 < bridge> <egyt> 
08:09 < bridge> <egyt> * `Spectate` in the Spectator UI (I want it to be changed to `Spectating` while leaving the `Spectate` button alone);
08:09 < bridge> <egyt> * `Name` in the server browser, so that it is different from `Name` in the scoreboard.
08:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> have u still not finished it
08:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i thought it was clear that you should simply use the context
08:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> Spectate is the String its looking for, If you add a context you want to add that to the translate String and translate `spectate` in the context of `SpectateIngame` 
08:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
08:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> So you'd "translate" `spectate` to `spectating` in the context of `SpectateIngame`
08:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
08:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> Already described in my previous comment
08:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> Here
08:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> That gives you what you want
08:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> Spectateingame might Not be a fitting Name tho, idk how one should call it
08:45 < bridge> <egyt> How it should look in the l10n file?
08:45 < bridge> <egyt> 
08:45 < bridge> <egyt> ```
08:46 < bridge> <egyt> [Spectator UI]
08:46 < bridge> <egyt> Spectate
08:46 < bridge> <egyt> == Spectating
08:46 < bridge> <egyt> ```
08:46 < bridge> <egyt> 
08:46 < bridge> <egyt> or what? How do I make it to show "Spectating" again where it was before they made the change?
08:46 < bridge> <egyt> I am really confused... that's why I said "I can't make a PR"...
08:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we have a script that generates translations
08:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can simply apply your patches. call the script and continue translating
09:06 < bridge> <egyt> and what's the script filename?
09:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno but it's in the scripts dir
09:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> scripts/languages/update_all.py
09:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this maybe
09:10 < bridge> <lukron55> thought of this and i might just have a script that runs permanently that checks the pid of DDNet-Server and if it‚Äôs up it then uses the push link
09:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> PID's arent static are they ?
09:11 < bridge> <mussa_yt> is there any good hoster?
09:12 < bridge> <lukron55> that‚Äôs why it checks for it as well
09:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> Forgot Pgrep exists :monkaStop:
09:14 < bridge> <lukron55> i tried doing it last night and instead of having one script run forever i tried making a wrapper script that if one ends the other ends
09:15 < bridge> <lukron55> i managed to remove my maps directory
09:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> üíÄ
09:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning

09:16 < bridge> <mussa_yt> @jupeyy_keks you are aa hoster?
09:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tripple a
09:16 < bridge> <lukron55> lmfao yeah. im just gonna write a shell script later and hope that a small portion of my python skills can help
09:17 < bridge> <lukron55> and not remove more directories by mistake
09:17 < bridge> <mussa_yt> @jupeyy_keks tell
09:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what should i host?
09:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i host fng servers
09:17 < bridge> <mussa_yt> a pakistan server
09:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah for that you have to ask deen
09:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and give him some money for it
09:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> Pgrep ddnet-servrr, and then Just while true: do
09:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
09:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> And then let IT sleep for Like 2 Minutes
09:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
09:17 < bridge> <mussa_yt> how much @jupeyy_keks
09:18 < bridge> <melo∆û> Yes.
09:22 < bridge> <mussa_yt> no he has 60hz
09:22 < bridge> <mussa_yt> i have 60hz too
09:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is computer expensive in pakistan?
09:22 < bridge> <mussa_yt> kinda
09:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well a good pc can defs improve game feeling
09:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> better latency etc.
09:22 < bridge> <louis> couldve also been difference in vsync settings or peripheral delay
09:23 < bridge> <mussa_yt> @jupeyy_keks margin cant fix 150ms
09:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u have above 300fps, that should be more than enough on 60hz monitors
09:23 < bridge> <mussa_yt> bro i have 1000
09:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe he also has more stable internet üòÑ
09:23 < bridge> <mussa_yt> no no no
09:24 < bridge> <mussa_yt> just tell me how much performance linux can get
09:24 < bridge> <mussa_yt> i have 1000 can he make like 2000
09:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it depends on your hardware
09:24 < bridge> <mussa_yt> ?
09:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with my gtx 760 + intel i7 3770k i got around 2000 FPS more
09:24 < bridge> <louis> linux wont fix ur problem unless u have hella spyware on ur os already
09:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when switching from windows to linux
09:25 < bridge> <mussa_yt> hm waht is best contribution for linux?
09:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but more important than fps is stable internet, good mouse, good keyboard (IMHO)
09:25 < bridge> <mussa_yt> i have good mouse good keybord and a good internet
09:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hard to say. i'd say Kubuntu is good for beginners
09:25 < bridge> <mussa_yt> waht is best for fps
09:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> most linux distros are similar
09:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u arent a super linux hacker and use gentoo
09:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> gentoo is hardcore best
09:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> really doesn't matter that much. don't listen to purple names
09:26 < bridge> <louis> i dont think u should switch üíÄ
09:26 < bridge> <louis> reinstall your current OS first
09:26 < bridge> <louis> then if you want to install a linux distro
09:26 < bridge> <mussa_yt> i have win 10
09:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can also try out linux on usb stick
09:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then if u like it install it, if not don't
09:26 < bridge> <egyt> or Linux Mint, that one worked for me too
09:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i compile kernel for zen4 and ddnet for zen4
09:27 < bridge> <mussa_yt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1244914875201749093/Screenshot_2024-05-28_122634.png?ex=6656d8d3&is=66558753&hm=5fb137665d6eb1de3520f9c9b9e921dfb6f5d2f1356a73df7ac7478646bfa800&
09:27 < bridge> <mussa_yt> @jupeyy_keks like i have a usb
09:27 < bridge> <mussa_yt> stick
09:27 < bridge> <mussa_yt> how it will work?
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u download ISO from here:
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and then follow this guide:
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview
09:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1244915097533546561/video_20240528_152731.mp4?ex=6656d908&is=66558788&hm=364d4791d7a6624c606a8df74c2d986ad832dbc5e1acdfd182067798a118be54&
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i haven't done that in like 3-4 years
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so dunno the exact steps
09:28 < bridge> <egyt> Compiling DDNet 10 times a day is a problem for my netbook
09:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> its not even ddnet
09:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview
09:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok this is for windows
09:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ^
09:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1244915541500629073/mmexport1716881388803.png?ex=6656d972&is=665587f2&hm=20ea74ab96910acd3537aa70d245841ecf114bdc04887a7d87052266796e39bd&
09:29 < bridge> <mussa_yt> i have a simple idea
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of settings that go into this tho
09:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> work pc is dying
09:30 < bridge> <Ewan> depending on if vsync is on, whether u have aa on, and which fullscreen mode you're using if any
09:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is your pc locale set to chinese?
09:30 < bridge> <egyt> I'm just saying
09:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks hmm my game only goes at 4k fps
09:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1244915727128068127/image.png?ex=6656d99e&is=6655881e&hm=a27bb452d09d077b2d8fa5a40cd4ff07ab9860f4bc9b7daf3c8f0d3ae7e7461b&
09:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> gentoo moment
09:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it was. i switched to english
09:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it came out of IT department in chinese
09:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have gfx_async_renderer old 1
09:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> is 0 better
09:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no 1
09:31 < bridge> <Ewan> why is 1 better
09:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs 1 means it's doing it async
09:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the old is just bit confusing
09:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in the name
09:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the old behavior is not doing it async xD
09:32 < bridge> <Ewan> wtf
09:32 < bridge> <Ewan> stupid name
09:32 < bridge> <Ewan> anyway i've had it on 1 for a long time
09:32 < bridge> <mussa_yt> i will go to a local computer shop and say pls install me linux os
09:32 < bridge> <Ewan> no
09:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i get 6k on the same map√º
09:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1244916229924454432/image.png?ex=6656da16&is=66558896&hm=030508cd601b71496df48498b82769ecf7fdddddb30d494522da754c8e515209&
09:32 < bridge> <Ewan> u can do it
09:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i get 6k on the same map
09:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1244916229924454432/image.png?ex=6656da16&is=66558896&hm=030508cd601b71496df48498b82769ecf7fdddddb30d494522da754c8e515209&
09:32 < bridge> <Ewan> for free
09:32 < bridge> <louis> my advice is dont install linux at all
09:32 < bridge> <louis> u are not someone who needs to install linux
09:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i had 10k fps in past
09:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> my game seems locked at like 5k
09:33 < bridge> <Ewan> windows pilled
09:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am sad
09:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> when i open menu it doesnt lower much
09:33 < bridge> <Ewan> everyone needs to install linux
09:33 < bridge> <egyt> :nouis:
09:33 < bridge> <Ewan> make the linux desktop mature faster
09:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> did ddnet lower perfomance?
09:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont think so..  at least not a lot
09:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks oh wait i think im not compiling o3
09:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also had to disable lto for ddnet
09:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> my advice is don't listen to purple names unless you are also purple or you want to be purple
09:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz it had warnings with some flags
09:34 < bridge> <mussa_yt> CAN
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :lol:
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> true
09:34 < bridge> <mussa_yt> anyone can give me best
09:34 < bridge> <mussa_yt> setting for
09:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok im with o3
09:34 < bridge> <Ewan> WDYM
09:34 < bridge> <mussa_yt> ddnet
09:34 < bridge> <mussa_yt> for good rly good fpx
09:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> get a ryzen threadripper epyc
09:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't understand why you need more fps than 1000
09:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and rtx 4090
09:35 < bridge> <louis> it matures when developers make and update software for it not when casual users install it and receive a bad experience
09:35 < bridge> <mussa_yt> i have doubt
09:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah tbh he doesnt need it
09:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he probably has other settings on
09:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> vsync or smth
09:35 < bridge> <mussa_yt> like when i started to play ddnet i was having 200ms in rus blocker but now i am having 400ms
09:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that has nothing to do with FPS
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> something like these settings will be good
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> gfx_fullscreen 1
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> gfx_vsync 0
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> gfx_fsaa_samples 0
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> cl_refresh_rate 0
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> gfx_refresh_rate 120
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> gfx_asyncrender_old 1
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> for fps
09:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that has nothing to do with your setup
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> ping is different
09:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> someone compiles a version with fps counter trippled and send it to him plz.
09:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that caps FPS to 120 lmao
09:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it's some declassified ufo files from 1960s, officially released from the AU gov.
09:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> unfortunately, I can't seem to find the highly detailed reddit post about this from yesterday anymore. it's not under my liked posts or to be found in any subreddit where it could've been
09:36 < bridge> <egyt> I remembered something
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> yep
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> 120 is too low
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> nope
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> he is on 60 hz monitor
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use 1000 on both
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> set to 0 to chew for no reason
09:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd go at least `monitor hz * 4`
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> but performance will be essentially the same

09:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i actually use 240 exactly
09:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah LTO causes warnings
09:37 < bridge> <Ewan> but seems overkill
09:37 < bridge> <mussa_yt> bro i have 120 now??
09:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't understand why godot's build system randomly sings
09:37 < bridge> <mussa_yt> @jupeyy_keks i ahve 120
09:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> what i mean by that is the disinformation campaign which is going on since about 80 years
09:37 < bridge> <mussa_yt> fix ittt
09:37 < bridge> <Ewan> if u want max frames
09:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is that my fault? XD
09:37 < bridge> <Ewan> then set gfx_refresh_rate to 0
09:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> XD
09:38 < bridge> <Ewan> but it's wasteful
09:38 < bridge> <Ewan> and latency is basically unaffected
09:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's set gfx_refresh_rate to 300 in your case
09:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1244917645749256192/mmexport1716881867795.png?ex=6656db68&is=665589e8&hm=977010f7f300c95b1f38ca4cf45893f3f5699e82743dd0ce13d73b67ae9e73d6&

09:39 < bridge> <mussa_yt> i have 1k
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> why

09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> u can only percieve 60
09:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Tee is a proper name
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> setting it higher just gives your monitor more opportunities to pick up on exactly when the buffer is updated basically
09:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Teeworlds
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> better for latency
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> but fps unaffected
09:39 < bridge> <mussa_yt> @jupeyy_keks you dosen clear my douby

09:43 < bridge> <Ewan> naw
09:43 < bridge> <0xdeen> india is easy to host in, pakistan hard
09:44 < bridge> <mussa_yt> hm how pakistan hard?
09:44 < bridge> <Ewan> hosting is probably expensive
09:44 < bridge> <Ewan> and/or scarce
09:45 < bridge> <mussa_yt> @0xdeen how it is expensive
09:45 < bridge> <mussa_yt> or hard
09:45 < bridge> <Ewan> you know it costs money to rent servers
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can you simply send a link to a pakistan VPS?
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then u can tell
09:46 < bridge> <mussa_yt> ok
09:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> is linking generally just slow?
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> use mold linker
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it's pretty fast
09:46 < bridge> <Ewan> he's windows

09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mhh that's weird too
09:52 < bridge> <egyt> (not an actual translation I use)
09:52 < bridge> <mussa_yt> bro my internet hoster is a vps
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> DDNet is a proper name to me too

09:53 < bridge> <mussa_yt> bro i msg him asking are you a vps he said yes i ddint ask for link
09:53 < bridge> <Ewan> nobody asked if you were a vps
09:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> is that didinet
09:54 < bridge> <Ewan> they were asking if you knew one because nobody else here does
09:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao, do u want access to ddnet databse
09:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao, do u want access to ddnet database
09:54 < bridge> <mussa_yt> let me send you better one
09:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just send a vps hoster
09:54 < bridge> <egyt> It's how we pronounce it
09:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> isn't it how everyone pronounce it as well
09:54 < bridge> <egyt> That's how we pronounce it
09:54 < bridge> <Ewan> ya
09:54 < bridge> <Ewan> but u don't spell it DiDiNet
09:54 < bridge> <egyt> I meant, that's how it would look like if you write down the pronounciation
09:54 < bridge> <mussa_yt> https://hostadvice.com/go/host/72108/?category_id=364
09:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i guess –î–î is literally unpronounceable
09:55 < bridge> <egyt> I mean, that's how it would look like if you write down the pronounciation
09:55 < bridge> <mussa_yt> you can go down
09:55 < bridge> <mussa_yt> and see
09:55 < bridge> <Ewan> 2 vCPU :justatest:
09:55 < bridge> <egyt> So, yeah...
09:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no pakistan location
09:55 < bridge> <mussa_yt> i t has
09:55 < bridge> <egyt> \#nobugs
09:55 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> Not everything should be translated
09:55 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> This just looks off
09:55 < bridge> <egyt> I know
09:56 < bridge> <egyt> It is a translatable string though
09:56 < bridge> <Ewan> so where is pakistan again
09:56 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1244922140311158824/image.png?ex=6656df97&is=66558e17&hm=25de8c2b22e765f61a8ebf80602fdf0f540d200ab98a359adb3c5f71c65922fa&
09:56 < bridge> <egyt> Might as well do some evil stuff
09:56 < bridge> <egyt> Unless you remove it, in that case "oh well"
09:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> That's how i say when i talk in Ukrainian xd
09:56 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> It mostly pronounced like english D but harder
09:56 < bridge> <mussa_yt> ahhaha
09:57 < bridge> <Ewan> just don't do a phonetic translation of smthing like that
09:57 < bridge> <Ewan> leave it as DDNet
09:57 < bridge> <Ewan> latin script
09:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably just translation issue, cuz we kept both DDNet and Tee in chinese
09:57 < bridge> <egyt> I know, that's why I said it's not an actual translation
09:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is "Rs.3,340/ month" a lot for you?

10:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
10:09 < bridge> <Ewan> first world = developed
10:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> are u sure
10:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> > The concept of the First World was originally one of the "Three Worlds" formed by the global political landscape of the Cold War, as it grouped together those countries that were aligned with the Western Bloc of the United States. This grouping was directly opposed to the Second World, which similarly grouped together those countries that were aligned with the Eastern Bloc of the Soviet Union. However, as the Cold War ended with the dissolution o
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> crazy
10:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> u knew this right
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> nope
10:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> or is it a true crazy
10:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
10:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> but yeah first world countries typically have democracy
10:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> in africa most places have dictatorships
10:11 < bridge> <Ewan> Today, the terms are slightly outdated and have no official definition. However, the "First World" is generally thought of as the capitalist, industrial, wealthy, and developed countries.
10:11 < bridge> <Ewan> one of those things
10:11 < bridge> <Ewan> that ppl like to say even when it's no longer socially relevant
10:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> > In colloquial usage, "First World" typically refers to "the highly developed industrialized nations often considered the Westernized countries of the world"
10:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we are rich bois
10:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> we are rich compared to others
10:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> but poor compared to others
10:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> such is life
10:12 < bridge> <Bota> :nouis:
10:13 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe if u think in a rly broad scope
10:13 < bridge> <Ewan> but compared to those around u is rly what matters lol
10:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> china will be the most interesting coutnry
10:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> china will be the most interesting country
10:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as rich as the democratic states, but will it also be demotratic?
10:14 < bridge> <Ewan> definitely not
10:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you never know
10:15 < bridge> <Ewan> not unless there is a revolution lol
10:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the cities are probably quite western-like
10:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> @tsfreddie tell us
10:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> are cities western like

10:18 < bridge> <reitw> well in my desk just a paper
10:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and be rich af
10:18 < bridge> <reitw> but enough tho
10:18 < bridge> <egyt> So, I compiled it.
10:18 < bridge> <egyt> The "Name" in server browser doesn't work at all, and "Spectate" in Spectator UI is still "Spectate" and not "Spectating" for English.
10:18 < bridge> <egyt> Awesome.
10:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not really?
10:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> egyt are u a dev?
10:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> or just a user
10:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> if so, do u use rust?
10:19 < bridge> <egyt> A translator
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> no he's a translator

10:19 < bridge> <egyt> I'm glad
10:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> who do you think is supposed to value personal freedom and such
10:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well the ppl ofc
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's not about the state ofc
10:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that really depends on the ppl i think
10:20 < bridge> <egyt> I'll write a comment

10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> this is satire
10:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes
10:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> are you seriously asking are there decent human beings in china
10:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> the reels always show chinese caring grandmas
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i think with the information age the only thing that differs so much about countries governments' is the history
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> most ppl share the same ideas
10:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao, that sounds rough. i guess it's more about if these ppl show it in some kind
10:22 < bridge> <Ewan> and that is, build urself up as much as possible regardless of the consequences

10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> > There are cases when you want to in-place initialize a struct. For example when it is very big and moving it from the stack is not an option, because it is bigger than the stack itself. Another reason would be that you need the address of the object to initialize it. This stands in direct conflict with Rust's normal process of first initializing an object and then moving it into it's final memory location.

10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> professional
10:54 < bridge> <egyt> Indeed
11:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> likely via IRC
11:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's so smart
11:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> make perfect sense

11:03 < bridge> <egyt> Compiling DDNet for, I think, 5th time in the last two days
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> weird flex
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> there have been days where i‚Äôve done it 100 times
11:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> weird flex
11:06 < bridge> <Ewan> and I can not imagine a real dev‚Äôs count
11:06 < bridge> <Ewan> probably lower
11:06 < bridge> <Ewan> more efficient devs
11:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> compiling ddnet is not that compiling
11:06 < bridge> <Ewan> what
11:06 < bridge> <zhn> :troll:
11:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> smart
11:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ~~com¬∑pel¬∑ling~~
11:07 < bridge> <Ewan> change something and instantly revert it

11:07 < bridge> <Ewan> because you forgot about something
11:07 < bridge> <nouaa> :pepeW:
11:09 < bridge> <egyt> I remembered that by heart:

11:16 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ping deen
11:16 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no pong ._.
11:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> (i need nothing deen was just a test xd)
11:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I was about to say: please don't ping people unnecessarily
11:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you said something about irc
11:18 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wanted to see if he has a bot
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he was just online in that moment
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no irc tricks xD
11:18 < bridge> <egyt> pong
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> he was on phone iirc
11:18 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omagawd it worked
11:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep
11:19 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> heinrich when stop ghost me on github
11:19 < bridge> <egyt> shocked
11:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ChillerDragon moment
11:30 < bridge> <egyt> Nope, it wasn't me. It just doesn't want to work that way, I don't know why...
11:30 < bridge> <egyt> Nope, it wasn't me. It just doesn't want to work that way, and I don't know why...
11:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> when I go through the PRs, I'll also respond to your
11:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> s
11:33 < bridge> <egyt> üëå
11:34 < bridge> <egyt> So, I correctly solved at least one part, `Spectating` in Spectator UI. How to deal with `Name` in server browser, though?
11:41 < bridge> <egyt> Also, what about this?
11:45 < bridge> <zhn> pls dont
11:49 < bridge> <egyt> I don't, that's just what I've found
12:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> Egyt you're trying to do Things you dont quite understand, i think it would be easier to make an issue and have someone implement what you want - we explained how multiple Times already, Heinrich even gave you suggested Changes on GitHub ^^
12:11 < bridge> <egyt> That's what I said first, then @furo said this
12:11 < bridge> <egyt> > https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1244553058495631390 @egyt
12:11 < bridge> <egyt> > Can't code :^(There isn't that much coding involved, try searching the code base for `"Spectate"` which should lead you to a line in `hud.cpp` that you can change.
12:12 < bridge> <egyt> that's where it all started
12:14 < bridge> <egyt> That's what I said first, then furo said this
12:16 < bridge> <egyt> It's hard to explain... I understand how to do that, but not the way to make it work...
12:17 < bridge> <egyt> It's hard to explain... I understand how to do that, but not the way to make it work... And changes by Heinrich - they didn't do what I wanted to do
12:19 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> Is changing spectate to spectating and name to server name even worth it?
12:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> It would require the Work around to add a context for every other String where spectate IS grammatically correct, you're thinking to complicated imho ü§î
12:23 < bridge> <melo∆û> It would require the Work around to add a context for the other String where spectate IS grammatically correct  ü§î
12:24 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> I think it's fine as is
12:24 < bridge> <egyt> Just compile yourself?
12:24 < bridge> <egyt> It isn't
12:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> lgtm
12:25 < bridge> <melo∆û> Also, If your Changes dont Display the right String in the Serverbrowser, you Made a mistake within the Context or the actual translationfile ü§î
12:26 < bridge> <egyt> stop throwing english at me >.\<
12:26 < bridge> <melo∆û> @gerdoe can you Help this poor App :kek:
12:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> Oh wait He stepped down from Moderator - rip
12:28 < bridge> <egyt> i now lost any confidence in my english skills :^(
12:28 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> It doesn't fix anything it was fine until you decided to fiz it
12:28 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> It doesn't fix anything it was fine until you decided to fix it
12:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> <a:catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
12:28 < bridge> <egyt> have you ever played with Ukrainian translation?
12:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> Having "spectating: player_name" does make Sense tho, even tho IT then Sounds weird in freeview or multiview
12:29 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> Nope
12:30 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> What it has to do with our conversation though?
12:30 < bridge> <egyt> ^
12:30 < bridge> <egyt> because I want to make it better, and that's part of my improvements
12:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> Escalate this to an issue, that can be fixed with one context and If statements:kek:
12:34 < bridge> <egyt> But did you ever read the issue?
12:35 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> Spectating would make awful translation to russian at least, i can't think of any good variant that would make sense
12:36 < bridge> <cyberFighter> what random words
12:37 < bridge> <egyt> "–ù–∞–±–ª—é–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ":
12:39 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> It sounds so wrong as noun
12:41 < bridge> <egyt> You can always keep the string translation the same as it was before
12:41 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> Actually, where is it? I can't find it
12:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> egypt: I'd prefer if you could separate the english string change from the translation change
12:42 < bridge> <egyt> ?
12:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so that we can discuss it separately from the need that the strings need to be different in ukrainian
12:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the need to treat them separately is obvious. but keep that to a PR and make the english string change in another
12:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (the former PR can be merged immediately, the latter might need discussion)
12:42 < bridge> <egyt> ü§¶
12:43 < bridge> <egyt> You were discussing the issue you didn't even read
12:43 < bridge> <egyt> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8403
12:43 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> That's a pull request not an issue
12:43 < bridge> <egyt> Whatever
12:43 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> Makes sense i haven't found it
12:45 < bridge> <egyt> so what do you want from me?
12:46 < bridge> <egyt> to close the PR, to make an issue, to change the commit??
12:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's obvious that the ukrainian translation needs a way to distinguish the two name/spectate fields
12:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so please use the context field for that
12:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you also want to change the english translation, please make a different PR for that
12:47 < bridge> <egyt> Not only Ukrainian needs a way to distinguish `spectate` field, if you misunderstood me
12:50 < bridge> <egyt> .....
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> BRO
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u talk about ur pr with 5 ppl since 2 days xD

12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs of 2 strings? xddd
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i don't understand what confuses you so much
12:52 < bridge> <egyt> everything
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u want a different word for server name.. add a context and u will get your different name
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just do it, wait for pr merged
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then someone can update the translation files with the script i mentioned
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> afterwards u can change ur ukrain text
12:52 < bridge> <egyt> i tried adding context - it didn't work
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how did it not work
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's in the cpp files
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nothing else

12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, that's a skill issue but unrelated
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> read exactly what i wrote
12:53 < bridge> <egyt> and that's after I added context
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "u want a different word for server name.. add a context and u will get your different name

12:54 < bridge> <robyt3> Adding context to Localizable doesn't work, you need to also add it to the Localize call
12:54 < bridge> <robyt3> The Localizable is only for the script
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it was explained to him 20 times
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he either doesnt want to understand, or really simply doesnt understand xD
12:55 < bridge> <egyt> why noone told me this?!
12:55 < bridge> <cyberFighter> this guy is confusing me
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u even posted it yourself
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Localize takes a second argument pContext
12:57 < bridge> <egyt> .....
12:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah sry
12:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it's there
12:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> white on black
12:57 < bridge> <egyt> yet it doesn't work
12:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok anyway
12:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just do it
12:57 < bridge> <egyt> do what?!
12:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> add the second argument
12:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then do nothing and wait
12:57 < bridge> <egyt> I ADDED IT
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
12:58 < bridge> <egyt> AND IT. DOES NOT. WORK.
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but u didnt push it to github
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there is nothing to work
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do it
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the rest u'll understand later
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as soon as someone starts the language script
12:58 < bridge> <egyt> ......
12:58 < bridge> <egyt> let me calm down and explain.
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just do what you are asked for. you will understand the rest
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in future
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why do you want US to explain why it's not working
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we know it's working
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u simply don't understand it
12:59 < bridge> <egyt> you don't even want to listen
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ofc i dont want to listen
12:59 < bridge> <egyt> it isn't because I added it, compiled it, and it didn't work
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i want to help you
12:59 < bridge> <egyt> why push nonworking code?
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Push it then i can tell you

14:37 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Wondering why the texts don't provide any context for translations, since context matters
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they do
14:38 < bridge> <AssassinTee> then I don't get the issue above
14:38 < bridge> <AssassinTee> ah now I get the issue xD
14:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> :poggers2:
15:00 < bridge> <louis> can anyone explain this? where are CNetEvent types defined?
15:00 < bridge> <louis> ```cpp

15:00 < bridge> <louis> {
15:00 < bridge> <louis>     // create the event
15:00 < bridge> <louis>     CNetEvent_Explosion *pEvent = m_Events.Create<CNetEvent_Explosion>(Mask); <--- ?
15:00 < bridge> <louis>     if(pEvent)

15:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that looks bad
15:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> just `if pgrep DDNet-Server` would probably be better. instead of the whole `check_ddnet_server` function
15:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what I also don't like about this (is that all chat-gpt-generated code?) are the useless comments
15:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > `# Run the check_ddnet_server function in an infinite loop`
15:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why say this? this doesn't add anything over the code
15:19 < bridge> <louis> when I add code with my new CNetEvent i get syntax errors, is that expected if i haven't done anything to generate the new events yet?
15:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's expected that you get errors, not sure if syntax errors
15:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try building one time to update the generated source files @louis.place
15:21 < bridge> <louis> okay yeah it all works good
15:22 < bridge> <louis> not exactly sure what the point of generated code for this stuff is maybe it's beyond my understanding as of now üòÖ
15:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the idea is that the generated code can automatically check data it gets from the network
15:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so that the programmer doesn't have to do it
15:24 < bridge> <louis> ok
15:24 < bridge> <louis> if I'm adding a pretty trivial ingame effect is using a netevent bad for it? (particle effect)
15:24 < bridge> <louis> not sure if it would break compatibility with anything
15:25 < bridge> <louis> or will older-versioned players simply not display the netevent due to the generated code
15:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> older clients will simply not see it
15:27 < bridge> <lukron55> 90% of it
15:29 < bridge> <lukron55> yeah ig i have no clue why im actually calling for the id and then checking the id
15:30 < bridge> <lukron55> and chatgpt is just a massive fan of generating these sort of comments
15:31 < bridge> <lukron55> i‚Äôll go about optimising it another time as it works just fine atm
15:58 < bridge> <zhn> aw?
16:01 < bridge> <kickerx> is it possible to exclude multiple words from search? i was trying some ways, but couldnt make it work

16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `;` does not work?
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also it might only work on a recent ddnet version
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yours looks bit outdated
16:03 < bridge> <kickerx> ye, i was hoping maybe it exist since long time, let me try updated one
16:09 < bridge> <kickerx> i tried ";" but used space after ";" for the next word, without spaces it works even on older one, thx :owo:
16:23 < bridge> <zhn> looks like 3 different colored death particles
16:24 < bridge> <louis> i wasn't really sure what other particle to use (limited selection)
16:27 < bridge> <zhn> nah i mean if we could just use death particles net event so old clients would be able to see it
16:28 < bridge> <lukron55> yeah idk what it does chatgpt did most of it
16:28 < bridge> <louis> ah i guess u could, altho not sure if coloring death particles would cause a bit of spaghetti code (also i don't think you can make 'confetti' physics with death netevent)
16:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> it just executes pgrep every 10 seconds and stops sending the curl request when no process is found
16:32 < bridge> <lukron55> yeah ik what the whole script does
16:32 < bridge> <lukron55> just not what you screenshotted
16:32 < bridge> <lukron55> wait nvm
16:32 < bridge> <lukron55> wtf is discord showing me you replied to
16:32 < bridge> <zhn> nono im not about full substitution im about supporting old clients with old net event
16:34 < bridge> <louis> ahh ye true

16:58 < bridge> <louis> furo: if you're here, could you quickly explain what the difference between NetEventEx and NetEvent is?
16:58 < bridge> <louis> 
16:59 < bridge> <louis> I changed network.py to add Confetti as a NetEventEx with confetti@netevent.ddnet.tw and m_X and m_Y variables, but now every particle spawn ingame becomes a damage indicator star
17:03 < bridge> <furo> You can take a look at the PR that added them, https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/615
17:15 < bridge> <egyt> no way
17:16 < bridge> <egyt> and because of that I had a breakdown
17:21 < bridge> <egyt> at least I "found" a bug, although had to pay a price of some mental health
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah sry, i gave u that mental health problem
17:22 < bridge> <egyt> as long as you don't give me anymore in the foreseeable future, I forgive you
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can't promise, but try :lol:

17:44 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 any news on community?
17:44 < bridge> <fokkonaut> random russian blmap server with F-ddrace and same map has 30-40players just due to being in their own community :)
17:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> (not a problem, just sad ddnet is "purposely" or knowingly killing a server/community by excluding it from smth "special")
18:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> kio didn't have my mod before the community thing.
18:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it's that i released my mod just a while ago, now they host it aswell and it's being visited by new players fast cuz its in the community tab.
18:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thats what im saying :)
18:30 < bridge> <murpi> Their server was popular before the community filter change
18:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Why does no one read
18:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ü§£
18:31 < bridge> <murpi> (more or less due to the spam we had on our servers, advertising the said server)
18:31 < bridge> <murpi> (more or less due to the spam we had on our servers, advertising said server)
18:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> a little reference, our server is visible to every person playing playground on multeasymap, our server is enjoying 0/63 players ^^
18:33 < bridge> <melo∆û> and we are in community aswell! - most of the time its just people preferring someone/something else
18:33 < bridge> <melo∆û> and we are in community - most of the time its just people preferring someone/something else
18:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> uncomparable
18:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> it is because you're referring visibility to player count?
18:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> false

18:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ah, u dont know the background
18:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yea, its new as i said
18:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> means im talking about growth

18:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Where did I do that?
18:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> "multeasy shit"?
18:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It's my personal opinion that multueasy map is shit and the concept is stupid for a plain ddrace server to have Block areas and what not.

18:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Did somebody say vulkan?
18:44 < bridge> <murpi> @fokkonaut Within the server browser context, what precise function does the community "status" (as you call it)  serve?
18:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 1. Authenticy, having a logo provided by the maintainer (DDNet) themselves
18:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 2. Seperate filter
18:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 3. Anti-fake server protection (used to happen a lot to gain IPs for DoS)
18:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can see 1 and 3 (they seem to be the same point though)
18:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 2. Filter = Accessiblity
18:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 2 doesn't seem particularly well-suited to the serverbrowser design with a single server
18:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 2 can also be achieved by using favorites
18:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> i agree with 2 - given i saw and checked out communities i didnt even know existed because i saw their community tag
18:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Anyways heinrich, u cant be picking the points you want to answer on and discard the whole other conversation about what I was asking you.
18:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It's the same as any time.
18:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 
18:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Are you a little narcissistic under there? Or you just dont have any answers to my concerns other than "something personal with me"? :)
18:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thanks
18:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thats what i meant
18:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> come on, please no psychoanalysis of others
18:48 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Come on, please valid conversations and responses and actual talking on the same level?
18:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> i agree with 2 - given i saw and checked out communities i didnt even know existed because i saw their community tag (e.G teesports)
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> with rust*
18:52 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I know I'm annoying, and you don't know you're unfair :)

19:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> gotta be more creative with naming
19:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> it fits you tho :(
19:04 < bridge> <murpi> and ..renamed üò¨
19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but leave ryo for the poster
19:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i got it from here https://coolforeignwords.com/ btw
19:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that's probably the place where ill be getting names for most of my projects üò¨
19:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> what is renamed?
19:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn that issue has 85 comments
19:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps adding a new issue would be better then
19:23 < bridge> <melo∆û> done

19:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> ooooh - cool!
19:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we are low on ddstats domains i feel
19:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
19:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> ooooh - cool! ( it didnt scroll all the way down so i didnt see it was open source)
19:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> cool to see its running
19:53 < bridge> <learath2> The fact that one server being in a community of it's own does not sound weird to you is insane to me
