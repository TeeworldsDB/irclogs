09:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> damn google
09:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> their monopoly
12:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yo @heinrich5991 how motivated are you to serve antibot as a api? where server owners can send their playerdata to and get back the bot detection result
12:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found an interesting software https://maddy.email/
12:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this probs makes setting up mail easier
12:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am against this, it would help bottery get around the detection
12:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> ah
13:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://david.li/paint/
13:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> impresive
14:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <T tee> What the heck this is so realistic :O
14:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> how
14:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ddos api?
14:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> they didn't say the API had to be public, it could easily be auth-only, and shared with very few people (DDNet admins, noby)
14:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> unless you're not saying that exposure is the reason? but just being an API makes it worse?
14:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not sure I guess
14:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but really how would you use such api for going around bot protection
14:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the issue is trusting others with it
15:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh problem is serving such an api would be incredibly expensive resource-wise
16:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> rly?
16:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i mean it should not be more traffic than a teeworlds server right?
16:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast all the inbound traffic + some internal calculated state + more inbound traffic from the antibot calling into the server code
16:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But that's not the biggest issue. It's latency. To compensate for it the server will need to keep a backlog of ticks because the callbacks need to happen in the same tick. And the server doing the antibot will need to hold onto data in transmission and a lot of state too
16:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hmm idk how antibot works and what kind of data it needs but that sounds like resumulationing a live running server i thought its more sending occasionally a big chunk of data that then quiqkcly gets checked
16:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah, it runs very much in sync with the server loop
16:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @fokkonaut u don't deserve to have it since u try to get it from leaked sources
16:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Grow up, I already talked to heinrich and noby about it. They know it, so don't try to leak any information here, kid
16:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Wasnt it someone from your old team who leaked it?
16:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have it already :)
16:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yea ik @fokkonaut that's why I hope ur srv dies
16:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Cool for you, leave your hate somewhere else
16:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> leavin' it here
16:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Enough of that
16:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Some people can't get over things
16:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ReiTW Doesnt it mean you shared it with multiple persons you didnt even know well enough?
16:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what a shame ^^
16:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> @fokkonaut Drop the topic
16:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Respond in DMs if you want to chat about it so much
16:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont want to chat with him privately, instead I wanna make obvious what kind of person he actually is and how its not fair how he treats people :)
16:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @fokkonaut lmao 1st of all Lickout worked with noby before I went into Bombay, so not my fault
16:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> - I kicked Lickout from his own team after he started to admin abuse, and after noby + other admins asked for it
16:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> - noby trusted him, stupid was the move he did
16:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 
16:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> That was my last message, afterall you don't deserve a shit from this leaked mod
16:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> @fokkonaut No more warnings
16:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Of course I am getting them warnings again
16:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> let them fight it's free entertainment for us
16:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ^
16:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I didnt even say anything to that topic after you warned me :)
16:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I just answered to your message
16:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Leave the drama off this discord, it's a simple rule to follow... If you have beef, DM each other.
16:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then finally kick or ban Rei, he started multiple times already in the past
16:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (also in official teeworlds discord)
16:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> can someone explain me what this all is about? some block modification got leaked?
17:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> omg rules .. cringe
17:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Skeith\:  are u some chat mod here enforcing rules or what?
17:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> are you on matrix chiller
17:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yes, I'm a discord mod.
17:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> chillerdead
17:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe there is some way for us to indicate discord roles for bridges
17:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sounds messy
17:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ye @gerdoe  come take the red pill and join me
17:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wait matrix is blue right?
17:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah ur too
17:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> no?
17:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> idk
17:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> idk
17:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ah deadnet
17:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lol colors dont work in this context xD
17:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i can but no one uses matrix or even discord that much
17:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> imagine using something like facebook that leaks everything to russian goverment
17:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> imagine using something like facebook that leaks everything to russian government
17:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> this chat here is also leaked to rus goverment
17:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> maybe
17:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> not maybe
17:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://ddnet.tw/irclogs/
17:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> that is accessible for rus government
17:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> also chinese
17:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> chinese modder be like
17:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> https://github.com/MageDelfador/DDNet-show-points-in-game/blob/main/ddnet.py
18:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> kernel gang
18:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hax
18:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wtf is this a py script that patches the running ddnet binary?!
18:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thats some hacker shit instead of simply using custom client haha
18:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> imagine making custom client only for one feature kekw
18:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and learning cpp in some way
18:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> see no issue in custom client for one feature
18:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> sounds more sane to me than a binary patch \:D
18:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> reverse engineering is the goal
18:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea no doubt its a cool skill and project i also starred it even tho its windows only
18:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I am so extremely annoyed with someone and to stop myself from actually responding to them I need to vent here
18:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Some goofball on the tokio discord is trying to tell me `The pthread_cond_signal() and pthread_cond_broadcast() functions have no effect if there are no threads currently blocked on cond.` doesn't imply that you can't just store permits and allow the next thread to block to fall through
18:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it too hard to understand "no effect", it's not in some alien language
18:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> NO EFFECT
18:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> These dunning kruger riddled newfangled coders that think they just know better than everyone piss me off so ridiculously much that I want to put my hand through the monitor at times
18:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes in the 50 damn years since Hoare invented condition variables not a single programmer thought about changing some of the requirements because they were all so stupid
19:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i joined just to read it
19:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would side with u but tbh i dont know much about posix and pthread, but i guess ur right
19:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the guy ending with "lol as usual" tells me he is not too smart
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd have bet you'd take his side, he is advocating that the shiny new abstraction makes the old one obsolete
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would side with whathever that paper said
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as long as i know the existence of such paper
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > dunning kruger riddled newfangled coders
19:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill keep this insult
19:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 looks like that guy is a zig fanboy too
19:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Programmer with a focus on server side optimization, compilers and all things close to hardware."
19:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> discord allows to stalk ppl so easily
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ppl literaly put all their socials here
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> myself included kek
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you know how much will power it takes to just not reply with "if people usually refuse to engage with you on these maybe the problem is you"
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he will not care
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt matter what u say
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know which is why I'm doing my very best to focus on something else
19:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I said "I don't care enough..." there but I actually do, I would talk for 5 hours if I don't stop myself
19:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> eat some ice cream
19:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only have lemon, lemon is not a calming flavour
19:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> eh
19:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> can you buy ice cream?
19:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you know what, good idea, I'll go have some strawberry ice cream outside
19:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah bro, best solution of this problem
19:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> "let's take this outside" they pull out brass knuckles and you just pull out a liter of ice cream
19:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> now that I spent an entire hour with that guy I need to order food because it's too late to cook, why must life be so annoying?
19:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> stalk me plz
19:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would be easier if i knew chinese social networks but im not good at that
19:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> :kek:
19:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I'm pretty sure I don't use any Chinese social networks other than messaging apps
19:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> They were equally toxic as Twitter so there's no point😇
20:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> huh
21:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Does anyone have issues with adding people to friendslist via server info?
21:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> (server browser info list)
21:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Yes I just tested it @murpi
21:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> name has the highlighted background in browser info tab but if I check the browser friends tab they're not there
21:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there's some weird desync with this
21:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> hm, after clicking on a name it doesn't even get the highlight for me
21:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> If I explicitly toggle the user's friend status in the info tab twice then it works
21:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's just that server info window
21:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> definitely create an issue for it since i could reproduce it
23:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> haha @Learath2  mad
23:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> learath weeb
23:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> :ayacri:
23:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't look, I'm embarrased
23:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <tela> Being forced to eat/cook is the root of all my problems lol
23:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @tela qtee
23:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <tela> No u
23:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> 😳
23:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> genshin is actually rly good but idk if i can play a game in that genre for very long
23:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i burn out so fast
23:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <tela> I played botw in 12-17 hour shifts until I beat it lol
23:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <tela> Scared to try genshin for what it might do to my life
23:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> botw >
23:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> genshin is just a grind
23:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but it's like, the most enjoyable grind possible
23:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> music and art in that game is just sogood
23:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> kekw >
