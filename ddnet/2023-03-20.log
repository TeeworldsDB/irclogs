10:31 < bridge> <ReiTW> is there anything implemented to detect dummies like
10:31 < bridge> <ReiTW> you have sv_max_clients_per_ip to 1 but still a brother can join the game
10:32 < bridge> <ReiTW> you have sv_max_clients_per_ip to 1 but still a brother can join the game (it's not happening, just asking if there's something that can be done for that)
10:32 < bridge> <ReiTW> so you can still disallow dummies but allow brothers etc..

10:43 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @ReiTW does your bw mod support ddnet ex msgs? if not you can still send this message by using the uuid directly
10:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> just send the msg as system with msgid 0 (netmsg_ex), then add the hex values as raw data and after that normal ints or strings

15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i downgraded to 6.1 and use a initramfs now
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont see the panic, but it will be a mistery what caused it
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> anyway 6.2 was masked btw
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i forgot i had a unmask
16:01 < bridge> <Learath2> Did you try just chaning your cmdline?
16:01 < bridge> <Learath2> Changing*
16:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no
16:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i checked the generated grub config
16:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and it set the correct partition as root
16:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i also ran grub install again just in case xD
16:08 < bridge> <Learath2> Does 6.1 and no initramfs work?
16:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk
16:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont wanna test it xd
16:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but i remember not having problems with 6.1
