02:09 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Nope, the awesome thing would be Marticks making a new project, that we can hop onto and help him. I don't wish him to be this community's main / side lead for the reasons of "getting rid of ddos", while ReiTW and other guys are already on track with that one.
02:12 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> And simon, they are right, you really don't know what they did in the previous year, they did help ddnet in their own ways, why not ask then about what they did so far.
02:12 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> And simon, they are right, you really don't know what Rei and Fokko did in the previous year, they did help ddnet in their own ways, why not ask then about what they did so far.

07:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That was a weird conversation from the start. I don‚Äôt see how it makes sense to celebrate 10 years ddnet by changing a block map on a block server that does not run the ddnet mod.
07:52 < bridge> <ReiTW> Well I laughed cuz I was the one responding to vali's attacks lmao, not fokkonaut. Was the time when vali targeted my srv to steal players
08:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Someone deleted some messages, glad there is irc log
08:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I remember between my last two messages was definitely another one
08:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Probs heinrich, he likes to do that
09:14 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki have you tried neovide? https://github.com/neovide/neovide
09:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no

10:37 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> damn, its actually very useful :poggers2:
10:37 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> i wonder why noone added this before
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> a fng stats shop?
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> wat u taking about
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> is this a discord reply?
10:38 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> its reply to pr
10:38 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> also shouldn't it be applied to server aswell?
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> ah we dont have github integration on irc side
10:38 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> also shouldn't it be applied to server as well?
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> yea server would make sense too it always has been half generic in the cmakelists :D
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> i usually only pr when i get a conflict
10:40 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> bruh üíÄ
10:40 <+ChillerDragon> ok ok ill force push server 
10:42 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> Thanks for contributing into ddnet repository and making it better as well as entire open source community :feelsCoolMan:
10:42 <+ChillerDragon> ok added server too and co authored you UwU

10:46 <+ChillerDragon> eww windows
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> yo ryo you need a github marketing manager?
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> you have dope paypal rust libs etc and still only 50 followers
10:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://tenor.com/view/dope-roblox-windows-background-waves-gif-25710255
10:50 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> They like your interest in open source :EbatTiLoh:
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> ye ryo is one of my top 10 fav githubbers
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> anyone with merged PRs to MS repos, run for your life
10:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 50 is probs already top 99%
10:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in github xd
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> u mean top 1
10:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
10:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> and yea it‚Äôs a lot but I wouldn‚Äôt say more than top 5%
10:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> percentiles are hard kek
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> the difference between ‚Äútop X%‚Äù and X% percentile‚Äù used to confuse me
10:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u underestimate the amount of github accounts with 1 project from a bootcamp or school
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> the difference between ‚Äútop X%‚Äù and ‚ÄúX% percentile‚Äù used to confuse me
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> true
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki and they all have their 60 friends from the school as followers xd
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> my profile is kinda boring
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> i need to public some stuff
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> fuck dude when my dad got a GH for his bootcamp he had more followers than my years old account in less than a day lol
11:00 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:19 < bridge> <elsaastrid> I have a legit online business earnings for everybody.
11:19 < bridge> <elsaastrid> Kindly dm me to know more about it if it interest you
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> LMAO
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> IRC bots invade the discord
11:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i judge by projects not followers
11:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> go to repos and filter by source
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> this dude not on irc
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> spammers only know how to launch bloated electron matrix app

13:38 < bridge> <murpi> Anyone interested in debugging this?

13:39 <+ChillerDragon> are windows backtraces always that ugly? i dont recognize a single thing from the ddnet code base
13:40 <+ChillerDragon> or is it just because it is build without debug symbols?
13:44 < bridge> <Robyt3> Yeah, if it's build with debug symbols, it would be readable
13:45 < bridge> <Robyt3> What version exactly is this? And is it steam or non-steam?
13:46 < bridge> <murpi> 16.8
13:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> 64 bit with Steam integration?
13:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> Or without?
13:48 < bridge> <Robyt3> Rather 32 bit I guess, because the addresses are only 4 bytes
13:49 < bridge> <murpi> Yes, 32 bit.
13:49 < bridge> <murpi> Non steam
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> roby can you map those addresses on code?
13:59 < bridge> <Robyt3> Yes
13:59 <+ChillerDragon> nice how?
13:59 < bridge> <Robyt3> Looks like it's caused by creating a too large tile array, probably a map being too large for 32 bit
13:59 <+ChillerDragon> oof
14:00 <+ChillerDragon> how do you know?
14:00 <+ChillerDragon> leak your process
14:01 < bridge> <murpi> > I enter the game, the game freezes when I press the play button
14:03 < bridge> <Robyt3> There is a script that works on Linux, but I use some tricks to do it on Windows instead:
14:03 < bridge> <Robyt3> 1. Download and unpack correct symbols from https://ddnet.org/downloads/symbols/
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> 2. Get module base address of the executable (`dumpbin` on from Visual Studio tools) --> for this it says "400000 image base" (hex)
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> 3. Open the executable with gdb
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> 4. Use `info symbol <address>` to find out the function for the lines in the backtrace
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> Where <address> is calculates as the number at the end of the line (e.g. 0x2f0cbc for the first line) plus the module base address.
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> And do this for some of the lines: 
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> ```
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> (gdb) info symbol 0x786ef0
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> typeinfo for std::bad_alloc in section .rdata
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> (gdb) info symbol 0x6f00d2
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> operator new(unsigned int) [clone .cold] + 42 in section .text
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> (gdb) info symbol 0x552654
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> CLayerTiles::CLayerTiles(int, int) + 260 in section .text
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> (gdb) info symbol 0x558cd1
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> CEditor::UiDoPopupMenu() + 385 in section .text
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> ```
14:08 < bridge> <Robyt3> The script doesn't use the numbers at the end of the stack trace lines but instead uses the AddrPC number and first subtracts the base address of the application (because of address space randomization), which end up being the same number:  01160CBC - 00E70000 = 0x2f0cbc
14:09 <+ChillerDragon> is there a tutorial on that on the forum or wiki? if not seems sane to add that
14:10 < bridge> <Robyt3> Yeah, would be a good idea if there was a script that works on Windows. Not sure if addr2line also works on Windows, so we could get the code lines as well.
14:11 < bridge> <Robyt3> It's a bit of a mix because dumpbin from Visual Studio is necessary, because the respective tool from MinGW gets an incorrect module base address for some reason
14:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just use Linux subsystem
14:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or Linux directly xd
14:26 < that_haiku_user> good afternoon, just wanted to say that the haiku port is in the process of being included in our app store soon: https://depot.haiku-os.org

14:47 < bridge> <shiro> does anyone knows how to fix this issue
15:01 <+ChillerDragon> shirowo
15:02 < bridge> <Shyzo> Is there a guide somewhere on how to install ddnet on Ubuntu? I downloaded Ubuntu version from ddnet.tw but I can't double click ddnet.exe
15:02 < bridge> <Shyzo> Send help pls xd
15:02 < bridge> <Shyzo> Linux too hard.
15:03 < bridge> <Shyzo> Ah im using Ubuntu 18.04
15:03 < bridge> <shiro> chillerdragon: nup
15:07 <+ChillerDragon> DDNet should be double clickable it has the executable flag by default right?
15:09 <+ChillerDragon> send screenshot @Shyzo
15:09 < bridge> <Shyzo> Well I can't screen it but I can take a photo XD scuffed
15:10 < bridge> <Shyzo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083391238595678270/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_cbe72219-8717-4a6d-9833-6f376643fbd4.jpg
15:10 < bridge> <Shyzo> I'm on live usb, maybe that's important.
15:10 <+ChillerDragon> and nothing happens if you double click DDNet ?
15:10 < bridge> <Shyzo> Yes, nothing
15:10 <+ChillerDragon> can you right click -> "open terminal here"
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> and then run ``./DDNet`` and share the output
15:11 < bridge> <Shyzo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083391586920058971/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_f4b0efae-2bdc-4610-86b0-62371c4fa462.jpg
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> ah rightlick the folder
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> not DDDNet

15:12 <+ChillerDragon> ``./DDNet``
15:12 <+ChillerDragon> not ``/DDNet``

15:13 <+ChillerDragon> interesting i thought the web download should just work seems like you need to install sdl
15:14 <+ChillerDragon> you can just run ``sudo apt install ddnet`` should install you all needed libs
15:14 < bridge> <Shyzo> I tried sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0-0
15:14 <+ChillerDragon> make sure to run  ``sudo apt update`` first
15:15 <+ChillerDragon> it would be ``sudo apt install libsdl2-dev`` i guess but other libs are potentially missing too
15:15 < bridge> <Shyzo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083392738281668719/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_a8e807b7-a919-4bf9-8fdd-96abf7e61572.jpg
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> and then install ddnet
15:16 < bridge> <Shyzo> Don't I need to upgrade now first?
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> no
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> ``sudo apt install ddnet``
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> and then yu should be able to double click it
15:17 < bridge> <Shyzo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083393065881960468/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_5607c12d-405f-4d6a-aac9-262669e24967.jpg
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> debian has it :p
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> ubuntu trash
15:17 < bridge> <Shyzo> Yes. But I have Ubuntu now, can't switch xd
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> then just bloat install all dev depdenys from ddnet readme :D
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> ``sudo apt install build-essential cargo cmake git glslang-tools google-mock libavcodec-extra libavdevice-dev libavfilter-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libfreetype6-dev libglew-dev libnotify-dev libogg-dev libopus-dev libopusfile-dev libpng-dev libsdl2-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libvulkan-dev libwavpack-dev libx264-dev python rustc spirv-tools``
15:18 < bridge> <Learath2> You shouldn't need all those just to run ddnet
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> most of the things you dont need if you 
15:18 < bridge> <Shyzo> How can I install the 325 things that popped up when I wrote sudo apt update ? Or is this not needed?
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> ye wat lerato said
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> not needed
15:18 < bridge> <Learath2> Do `ldd ./DDNet` let's see what is missing
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> but im too lazy to handpick what you need
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 how do you see what is missing?
15:19 < bridge> <Learath2> ldd
15:19 <+ChillerDragon> does it show errors?
15:19 <+ChillerDragon> i thought it only shows what it expects
15:19 < bridge> <Shyzo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083393647992647720/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_4c8903f3-246e-4612-b748-ce25a6606b27.jpg
15:19 <+ChillerDragon> ah indeed
15:19 <+ChillerDragon> cool i didnt know that
15:19 <+ChillerDragon> so just sdl curl and vulkan
15:20 < bridge> <Shyzo> Sudo apt install sdl curl?
15:20 < bridge> <Learath2> So `apt install libsdl2`
15:21 < bridge> <Shyzo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083394115217137694/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_8ea3e165-fc85-4a1d-a6ee-e97565959f0b.jpg
15:21 < bridge> <Learath2> Apparently it's called libsdl2-2.0
15:21 < bridge> <Learath2> Nice os this ubuntu
15:21 <+ChillerDragon> ubuntu is such a trol
15:21 < bridge> <Learath2> Apparently it's called libsdl2-2.0-0

15:22 < bridge> <Shyzo> Linux is easy they said. Don't use windows they daid
15:22 <+ChillerDragon> just install dev alr
15:22 <+ChillerDragon> ubuntu = windows
15:22 < bridge> <Learath2> You are missing the -0 at the end. I edited it quickly
15:23 < bridge> <Shyzo> Same @Learath2

15:23 <+ChillerDragon> no sane linux user downloads a archive from a website to install a program :D
15:23 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Also: don't use outdated distros. The folk forgot the downsides of a distro released five years ago.
15:23 <+ChillerDragon> ``sudo apt install libsdl2-dev``
15:23 < bridge> <Kaffeine> No dev! @Shyzo don't need to build ddnet.
15:23 <+ChillerDragon> idc
15:23 < bridge> <Learath2> `apt-cache search libsdl2`
15:23 <+ChillerDragon> its not that bad
15:24 < bridge> <Shyzo> Fair point. I had this on my usb stick so I thought I will give it a try
15:24 < bridge> <Learath2> What version of ubuntu is this even?
15:24 < bridge> <Shyzo> 18.04 x)
15:24 <+ChillerDragon> wtf
15:24 <+ChillerDragon> thats eol isnt it
15:24 <+ChillerDragon> maybe thats why ddnet is not in apt
15:24 < bridge> <Kaffeine> It brings all the dev tools / bloatware he does not need. Hundreds of MB. It might be acceptable for some installed OS but not for a USB stick :-D.
15:25 <+ChillerDragon> just install sdl dev already no need to spend 2hours on this if its just a temp usb stick
15:25 <+ChillerDragon> sdl dev is not big
15:25 < bridge> <Shyzo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083395175897890827/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_8aa88493-71ed-469b-9f33-58669d6751ac.jpg
15:25 <+ChillerDragon> holy
15:25 < bridge> <Learath2> Idk ubuntu website says it's called `libsdl2-2.0-0`
15:25 < bridge> <Shyzo> Doesn't work anyway :kek:
15:26 < bridge> <Shyzo> Maybe I need to update the package manager or smth idk? Apparently I can't find anything lol
15:26 <+ChillerDragon> https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/libsdl2-dev
15:27 < bridge> <Learath2> https://pimylifeup.com/ubuntu-universe-repository/#:~:text=To%20enable%20the%20universe%20repository%20on%20Ubuntu%2C%20find%20the%20%E2%80%9CCommunity,)%E2%80%9D%20option%20and%20click%20it.
15:27 < bridge> <Learath2> Try this?
15:27 <+ChillerDragon> libsdl2-dev is in bionic (18)
15:27 < bridge> <Learath2> Apparently sdl is in universe
15:27 <+ChillerDragon> leak ``cat /etc/apt/sources.list``
15:27 < bridge> <Learath2> `sudo add-apt-repository universe` in the terminal also works too apparently
15:27 < bridge> <Kaffeine> @Shyzo this version of DDNet won't work in your OS. It is just too outdated.
15:27 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Guys, there is  `GLIBC_2.28 not found` message in the `ldd` output. Please don't make @Shyzo also building his own glibc on a live USB system.
15:27 <+ChillerDragon> what lerato said
15:28 < bridge> <Learath2> Though I think last time I installed ubuntu was in 2010 so who knows
15:28 <+ChillerDragon> what even is your goal? @Shyzo?
15:29 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Modern commands do not work there. Compiled DDNet needs at least Ubuntu 20.04.
15:29 <+ChillerDragon> running a super old ubuntu on a usb doesnt seem like the best ddnet gaming environment
15:29 < bridge> <Learath2> Didn't even spot the ancient glibc, good catch
15:30 < bridge> <RafaelFF> '325 packages can be upgraded'. Please do upgrade, make your system happy
15:30 < bridge> <Learath2> Though I don't remember when we upped our glibc requirement
15:30 < bridge> <Shyzo> So just f it and get new ubuntu version?
15:30 <+ChillerDragon> its a stick who cares about happy system xd
15:30 <+ChillerDragon> ye f it and get a new ubuntu like 22 or better get debian :p or manjaro
15:30 < bridge> <Shyzo> I would, but I don't even know what command to use to say "yes, please upgrade" xd
15:31 <+ChillerDragon> sudo apt upgrade -y
15:31 < bridge> <Learath2> `apt upgrade`
15:31 < bridge> <Shyzo> I see
15:31 < bridge> <Learath2> But don't bother imo. I think glibc 2.28 isn't even in 18.04
15:31 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Stop. Raping. USB. Live. System.
15:31 < bridge> <Shyzo> Should I try this still or makes no sense?
15:31 <+ChillerDragon> no sense
15:31 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah max glibc version on 18.04 is 2.27
15:32 < bridge> <Shyzo> Okay I will get new ubuntu boys. Thanks for your help though! Appreciate it
15:32 < bridge> <Shyzo> Short trip back in time
15:32 < bridge> <Learath2> Backwards compatibility is always annoying on linux sadly :/
15:33 < bridge> <Shyzo> Ubuntu 18.04 it is
15:33 < bridge> <RafaelFF> FYI: `apt update` updates the packages database provided by the APT sources. Then `apt upgrade` install the updated packages based on that package database.
15:33 < bridge> <Shyzo> üëçüëç
15:34 < bridge> <Learath2> I guess bionics standard support will end in a month but still sadge that we broke compatibility with ubuntu LTS sometime without even noticing
15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ubuntu upgrade shoulod be more or less seamless right?
15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> as long as u dont skip a upgrade
15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 18 -> 20 -> 22
15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or smth idk
15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> havent used ubuntu since 2016
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im glad with my gentoo
15:43 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Haven't used Ubuntu before 2021 (ex. Gentoo user 2006-2021). Ubuntu broke on 2/2 upgrades for me :-D.
15:43 < bridge> <Learath2> Omg are you a convert? I was sure you'd go back to arch within the year
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lol no
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im converted
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and openrc is rly nice and easy
15:44 < bridge> <Learath2> Also did you stick with openrc or do you use systemd?
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but i use debian for my server tho
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> openrc ofc
15:44 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah gentoo on a server is annoying asf
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why wouldi try gentoo with systemd
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the only annoying thing is firefox getting updates every other week
15:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i just postpone firefox
15:45 < bridge> <Learath2> There is a stable channel too that gets less
15:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i like having a modern browser
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i dabbled a bit in gentoo bugzilla
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> someone wanted to statically link llvm for a rust package
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the gentoo maintainer said static linking is a "bug"
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and no one would ever want that
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they ship llvm without static linking support xdd
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so madman lol
15:46 < bridge> <Learath2> Static linking is a bug is the most gentoo thing I've ever heard
16:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> did not
16:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
16:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki do report progress when building your language üôÇ
16:21 < bridge> <Avolicious> opensuse tumbleweed every day sadge
16:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i will
16:25 <+ChillerDragon> if you send syntax highlight ill write hello world in ryo lang 
16:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i know how to make syntax highlight file for vim
16:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i made it for ddnet config files
16:25 <+ChillerDragon> i hope you add garbage collector
16:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> look at the ddnet repo
16:25 <+ChillerDragon> yes veri good vim is dope
16:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lol no, it will be native
16:25 <+ChillerDragon> id buy
16:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> chiller do u use my syntax for configs?
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> oh tru i need to install the cfg syntax hilita in ma vim config
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> no
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> i have to!
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> sec
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> ima do
16:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/other/vim
16:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> here
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> yes yes
16:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cp -R other/vim/* ~/.config/nvim/
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> neovim only?
16:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it works for vim too
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but im lazy
16:27 <+ChillerDragon> directly in vimrc?
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i just copy pasted the ddnet readme
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm no i think its under .vim/
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> where does it store files vim
16:27 <+ChillerDragon> ah vim folder
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i forgor
16:27 <+ChillerDragon> oke
16:27 <+ChillerDragon> yes .vim
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> thats the content of my .vim folder ``autoload  backup  bundle  plugged  swap  undo``
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> whats under autolod
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> viruses
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> mainly plug.vim the plugin manager
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it should be where there is a folder called ftdetect
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and syntax
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> and pathogen.vim which is actually virus i think idk what this is
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well try adding it to that dir
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> i guess i could create ftdetect
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> `autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile settings_ddnet.cfg set filetype=ddnet-cfg`
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it only sets the syntax to ddnet-cfg automatically for settings_ddnet.cfg, u can manually set it for other cfgs
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nono
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just cp then
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> like the command i sent
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it has the folder structure
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> oke ima try
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> `cp -R other/vim/* ~/.vim/`
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> yeye
16:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is on my neovim
16:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083411413860618400/200019975-823f322a-5099-4837-9551-c46171652db9.png
16:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> my CLion update crashed, then it wanted to revert the update, which crashed, and now it says i should reinstall the IDE üò¢
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just use vim
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or vscode
16:31 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait
16:31 <+ChillerDragon> its matching the filename
16:31 <+ChillerDragon> not .cfg?
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i told u
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz .cfg is too generic
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its used by other program configs maybe
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u can change the autocmd
16:31 <+ChillerDragon> oh no
16:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in the ftdetect file
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> ok
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> btw vim works too
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> just fine
16:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nice
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> so you can adapt readme
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> to have vim and neovim section
16:32 < bridge> <Shyzo> Ok I'm back. I downloaded Ubuntu 22, went on live usb. Updated, installed libsdl. Opened ddnet, it loads into the game and then I can't move mouse anymore. Any idea?
16:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> make the pr
16:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so u have a contribution xd
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> fakof
16:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> i pro contributor alr
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> i top10 ranked
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> i was farming a lot of xp with typo prs
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> because im pro stat githubber
16:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> true
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> @Shyzo why stick?
16:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im lower xd
16:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sadge
16:34 < that_haiku_user> do you get any power ups if you have more contributions
16:34 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yeah more lines = proer coder, air
16:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> actually some of my old commits are not attributed to me cuz a email change
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> that_haiku_user no i just gameify it to keep me motivated :D
16:34 < that_haiku_user> why cant you add ur old email
16:34 < bridge> <Shyzo> Don't want to install on disk atm. Only if I think it's cool xd
16:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think i dont have the domain anymore
16:35 < that_haiku_user> F.
16:35 <+ChillerDragon> im not sure if using a stick will ever be cool
16:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i had ryozuki.xyz but i wanted more exposure in the dev world and it was too weeby
16:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so i have edgarluque.com
16:35 <+ChillerDragon> UwU
16:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> boring
16:35 <+ChillerDragon> edg-l
16:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i should get a better domain
16:35 < bridge> <Shyzo> Prob not. But I can try it and if it works and I like it, then I can load it onto disk. I don't want to corrupt anything on my disk
16:35 < bridge> <Shyzo> By trolling
16:35 <+ChillerDragon> you can buy ryo.zillyhuhn.com for 20 bucks a month
16:36 <+ChillerDragon> @Shyzo i highly recommend using a disk that has nothing on it 
16:36 <+ChillerDragon> so you cant trol any data 
16:36 < bridge> <Shyzo> Yes. But I don't have that atm. That's why I use a stick ü§£
16:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083413125354766386/image.png
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> ok i see
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> then keep stickin
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> as for mouse issues idk you can try window mode or all the gfx options basically
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> installing drivers for your gpu etc 
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> switch render backend
16:37 < bridge> <Shyzo> :D so you got any idea why my game freezes?
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> try opengl instead of vulkan
16:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> traffic on my vps, most is from the wiki and a site i have
16:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083413479471456426/image.png
16:38 < bridge> <Shyzo> I would do that. But I really can't load into the game. It freezes at the first screen. And I can't find the appdata folder on Ubuntu. (Haven't look yet tho xd). To change it in the config directly
16:38 <+ChillerDragon> ``./DDNet "gfx_backend OpenGL"``
16:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh wait this is for just 9 days
16:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> here february
16:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083413605942304828/image.png
