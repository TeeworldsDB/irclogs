02:09 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Nope, the awesome thing would be Marticks making a new project, that we can hop onto and help him. I don't wish him to be this community's main / side lead for the reasons of "getting rid of ddos", while ReiTW and other guys are already on track with that one.
02:12 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> And simon, they are right, you really don't know what they did in the previous year, they did help ddnet in their own ways, why not ask then about what they did so far.
02:12 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> And simon, they are right, you really don't know what Rei and Fokko did in the previous year, they did help ddnet in their own ways, why not ask then about what they did so far.

07:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That was a weird conversation from the start. I don‚Äôt see how it makes sense to celebrate 10 years ddnet by changing a block map on a block server that does not run the ddnet mod.
07:52 < bridge> <ReiTW> Well I laughed cuz I was the one responding to vali's attacks lmao, not fokkonaut. Was the time when vali targeted my srv to steal players
08:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Someone deleted some messages, glad there is irc log
08:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I remember between my last two messages was definitely another one
08:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Probs heinrich, he likes to do that
09:14 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki have you tried neovide? https://github.com/neovide/neovide
09:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no

10:37 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> damn, its actually very useful :poggers2:
10:37 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> i wonder why noone added this before
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> a fng stats shop?
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> wat u taking about
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> is this a discord reply?
10:38 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> its reply to pr
10:38 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> also shouldn't it be applied to server aswell?
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> ah we dont have github integration on irc side
10:38 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> also shouldn't it be applied to server as well?
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> yea server would make sense too it always has been half generic in the cmakelists :D
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> i usually only pr when i get a conflict
10:40 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> bruh üíÄ
10:40 <+ChillerDragon> ok ok ill force push server 
10:42 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> Thanks for contributing into ddnet repository and making it better as well as entire open source community :feelsCoolMan:
10:42 <+ChillerDragon> ok added server too and co authored you UwU

10:46 <+ChillerDragon> eww windows
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> yo ryo you need a github marketing manager?
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> you have dope paypal rust libs etc and still only 50 followers
10:49 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://tenor.com/view/dope-roblox-windows-background-waves-gif-25710255
10:50 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> They like your interest in open source :EbatTiLoh:
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> ye ryo is one of my top 10 fav githubbers
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> anyone with merged PRs to MS repos, run for your life
10:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 50 is probs already top 99%
10:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in github xd
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> u mean top 1
10:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
10:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> and yea it‚Äôs a lot but I wouldn‚Äôt say more than top 5%
10:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> percentiles are hard kek
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> the difference between ‚Äútop X%‚Äù and X% percentile‚Äù used to confuse me
10:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u underestimate the amount of github accounts with 1 project from a bootcamp or school
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> the difference between ‚Äútop X%‚Äù and ‚ÄúX% percentile‚Äù used to confuse me
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> true
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki and they all have their 60 friends from the school as followers xd
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> my profile is kinda boring
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> i need to public some stuff
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> fuck dude when my dad got a GH for his bootcamp he had more followers than my years old account in less than a day lol
11:00 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:19 < bridge> <elsaastrid> I have a legit online business earnings for everybody.
11:19 < bridge> <elsaastrid> Kindly dm me to know more about it if it interest you
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> LMAO
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> IRC bots invade the discord
11:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i judge by projects not followers
11:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> go to repos and filter by source
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> this dude not on irc
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> spammers only know how to launch bloated electron matrix app

13:38 < bridge> <murpi> Anyone interested in debugging this?

13:39 <+ChillerDragon> are windows backtraces always that ugly? i dont recognize a single thing from the ddnet code base
13:40 <+ChillerDragon> or is it just because it is build without debug symbols?
13:44 < bridge> <Robyt3> Yeah, if it's build with debug symbols, it would be readable
13:45 < bridge> <Robyt3> What version exactly is this? And is it steam or non-steam?
13:46 < bridge> <murpi> 16.8
13:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> 64 bit with Steam integration?
13:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> Or without?
13:48 < bridge> <Robyt3> Rather 32 bit I guess, because the addresses are only 4 bytes
13:49 < bridge> <murpi> Yes, 32 bit.
13:49 < bridge> <murpi> Non steam
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> roby can you map those addresses on code?
13:59 < bridge> <Robyt3> Yes
13:59 <+ChillerDragon> nice how?
13:59 < bridge> <Robyt3> Looks like it's caused by creating a too large tile array, probably a map being too large for 32 bit
13:59 <+ChillerDragon> oof
14:00 <+ChillerDragon> how do you know?
14:00 <+ChillerDragon> leak your process
14:01 < bridge> <murpi> > I enter the game, the game freezes when I press the play button
14:03 < bridge> <Robyt3> There is a script that works on Linux, but I use some tricks to do it on Windows instead:
14:03 < bridge> <Robyt3> 1. Download and unpack correct symbols from https://ddnet.org/downloads/symbols/
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> 2. Get module base address of the executable (`dumpbin` on from Visual Studio tools) --> for this it says "400000 image base" (hex)
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> 3. Open the executable with gdb
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> 4. Use `info symbol <address>` to find out the function for the lines in the backtrace
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> Where <address> is calculates as the number at the end of the line (e.g. 0x2f0cbc for the first line) plus the module base address.
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> And do this for some of the lines: 
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> ```
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> (gdb) info symbol 0x786ef0
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> typeinfo for std::bad_alloc in section .rdata
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> (gdb) info symbol 0x6f00d2
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> operator new(unsigned int) [clone .cold] + 42 in section .text
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> (gdb) info symbol 0x552654
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> CLayerTiles::CLayerTiles(int, int) + 260 in section .text
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> (gdb) info symbol 0x558cd1
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> CEditor::UiDoPopupMenu() + 385 in section .text
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> ```
14:08 < bridge> <Robyt3> The script doesn't use the numbers at the end of the stack trace lines but instead uses the AddrPC number and first subtracts the base address of the application (because of address space randomization), which end up being the same number:  01160CBC - 00E70000 = 0x2f0cbc
14:09 <+ChillerDragon> is there a tutorial on that on the forum or wiki? if not seems sane to add that
14:10 < bridge> <Robyt3> Yeah, would be a good idea if there was a script that works on Windows. Not sure if addr2line also works on Windows, so we could get the code lines as well.
14:11 < bridge> <Robyt3> It's a bit of a mix because dumpbin from Visual Studio is necessary, because the respective tool from MinGW gets an incorrect module base address for some reason
14:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just use Linux subsystem
14:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or Linux directly xd
14:26 < that_haiku_user> good afternoon, just wanted to say that the haiku port is in the process of being included in our app store soon: https://depot.haiku-os.org

14:47 < bridge> <shiro> does anyone knows how to fix this issue
15:01 <+ChillerDragon> shirowo
15:02 < bridge> <Shyzo> Is there a guide somewhere on how to install ddnet on Ubuntu? I downloaded Ubuntu version from ddnet.tw but I can't double click ddnet.exe
15:02 < bridge> <Shyzo> Send help pls xd
15:02 < bridge> <Shyzo> Linux too hard.
15:03 < bridge> <Shyzo> Ah im using Ubuntu 18.04
15:03 < bridge> <shiro> chillerdragon: nup
15:07 <+ChillerDragon> DDNet should be double clickable it has the executable flag by default right?
15:09 <+ChillerDragon> send screenshot @Shyzo
15:09 < bridge> <Shyzo> Well I can't screen it but I can take a photo XD scuffed
15:10 < bridge> <Shyzo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083391238595678270/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_cbe72219-8717-4a6d-9833-6f376643fbd4.jpg
15:10 < bridge> <Shyzo> I'm on live usb, maybe that's important.
15:10 <+ChillerDragon> and nothing happens if you double click DDNet ?
15:10 < bridge> <Shyzo> Yes, nothing
15:10 <+ChillerDragon> can you right click -> "open terminal here"
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> and then run ``./DDNet`` and share the output
15:11 < bridge> <Shyzo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083391586920058971/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_f4b0efae-2bdc-4610-86b0-62371c4fa462.jpg
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> ah rightlick the folder
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> not DDDNet

15:12 <+ChillerDragon> ``./DDNet``
15:12 <+ChillerDragon> not ``/DDNet``

15:13 <+ChillerDragon> interesting i thought the web download should just work seems like you need to install sdl
15:14 <+ChillerDragon> you can just run ``sudo apt install ddnet`` should install you all needed libs
15:14 < bridge> <Shyzo> I tried sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0-0
15:14 <+ChillerDragon> make sure to run  ``sudo apt update`` first
15:15 <+ChillerDragon> it would be ``sudo apt install libsdl2-dev`` i guess but other libs are potentially missing too
15:15 < bridge> <Shyzo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083392738281668719/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_a8e807b7-a919-4bf9-8fdd-96abf7e61572.jpg
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> and then install ddnet
15:16 < bridge> <Shyzo> Don't I need to upgrade now first?
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> no
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> ``sudo apt install ddnet``
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> and then yu should be able to double click it
15:17 < bridge> <Shyzo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083393065881960468/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_5607c12d-405f-4d6a-aac9-262669e24967.jpg
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> debian has it :p
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> ubuntu trash
15:17 < bridge> <Shyzo> Yes. But I have Ubuntu now, can't switch xd
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> then just bloat install all dev depdenys from ddnet readme :D
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> ``sudo apt install build-essential cargo cmake git glslang-tools google-mock libavcodec-extra libavdevice-dev libavfilter-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libfreetype6-dev libglew-dev libnotify-dev libogg-dev libopus-dev libopusfile-dev libpng-dev libsdl2-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libvulkan-dev libwavpack-dev libx264-dev python rustc spirv-tools``
15:18 < bridge> <Learath2> You shouldn't need all those just to run ddnet
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> most of the things you dont need if you 
15:18 < bridge> <Shyzo> How can I install the 325 things that popped up when I wrote sudo apt update ? Or is this not needed?
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> ye wat lerato said
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> not needed
15:18 < bridge> <Learath2> Do `ldd ./DDNet` let's see what is missing
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> but im too lazy to handpick what you need
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 how do you see what is missing?
15:19 < bridge> <Learath2> ldd
15:19 <+ChillerDragon> does it show errors?
15:19 <+ChillerDragon> i thought it only shows what it expects
15:19 < bridge> <Shyzo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083393647992647720/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_4c8903f3-246e-4612-b748-ce25a6606b27.jpg
15:19 <+ChillerDragon> ah indeed
15:19 <+ChillerDragon> cool i didnt know that
15:19 <+ChillerDragon> so just sdl curl and vulkan
15:20 < bridge> <Shyzo> Sudo apt install sdl curl?
15:20 < bridge> <Learath2> So `apt install libsdl2`
15:21 < bridge> <Shyzo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083394115217137694/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_8ea3e165-fc85-4a1d-a6ee-e97565959f0b.jpg
15:21 < bridge> <Learath2> Apparently it's called libsdl2-2.0
15:21 < bridge> <Learath2> Nice os this ubuntu
15:21 <+ChillerDragon> ubuntu is such a trol
15:21 < bridge> <Learath2> Apparently it's called libsdl2-2.0-0

15:22 < bridge> <Shyzo> Linux is easy they said. Don't use windows they daid
15:22 <+ChillerDragon> just install dev alr
15:22 <+ChillerDragon> ubuntu = windows
15:22 < bridge> <Learath2> You are missing the -0 at the end. I edited it quickly
15:23 < bridge> <Shyzo> Same @Learath2

15:23 <+ChillerDragon> no sane linux user downloads a archive from a website to install a program :D
15:23 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Also: don't use outdated distros. The folk forgot the downsides of a distro released five years ago.
15:23 <+ChillerDragon> ``sudo apt install libsdl2-dev``
15:23 < bridge> <Kaffeine> No dev! @Shyzo don't need to build ddnet.
15:23 <+ChillerDragon> idc
15:23 < bridge> <Learath2> `apt-cache search libsdl2`
15:23 <+ChillerDragon> its not that bad
15:24 < bridge> <Shyzo> Fair point. I had this on my usb stick so I thought I will give it a try
15:24 < bridge> <Learath2> What version of ubuntu is this even?
15:24 < bridge> <Shyzo> 18.04 x)
15:24 <+ChillerDragon> wtf
15:24 <+ChillerDragon> thats eol isnt it
15:24 <+ChillerDragon> maybe thats why ddnet is not in apt
15:24 < bridge> <Kaffeine> It brings all the dev tools / bloatware he does not need. Hundreds of MB. It might be acceptable for some installed OS but not for a USB stick :-D.
15:25 <+ChillerDragon> just install sdl dev already no need to spend 2hours on this if its just a temp usb stick
15:25 <+ChillerDragon> sdl dev is not big
15:25 < bridge> <Shyzo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083395175897890827/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_8aa88493-71ed-469b-9f33-58669d6751ac.jpg
15:25 <+ChillerDragon> holy
15:25 < bridge> <Learath2> Idk ubuntu website says it's called `libsdl2-2.0-0`
15:25 < bridge> <Shyzo> Doesn't work anyway :kek:
15:26 < bridge> <Shyzo> Maybe I need to update the package manager or smth idk? Apparently I can't find anything lol
15:26 <+ChillerDragon> https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/libsdl2-dev
15:27 < bridge> <Learath2> https://pimylifeup.com/ubuntu-universe-repository/#:~:text=To%20enable%20the%20universe%20repository%20on%20Ubuntu%2C%20find%20the%20%E2%80%9CCommunity,)%E2%80%9D%20option%20and%20click%20it.
15:27 < bridge> <Learath2> Try this?
15:27 <+ChillerDragon> libsdl2-dev is in bionic (18)
15:27 < bridge> <Learath2> Apparently sdl is in universe
15:27 <+ChillerDragon> leak ``cat /etc/apt/sources.list``
15:27 < bridge> <Learath2> `sudo add-apt-repository universe` in the terminal also works too apparently
15:27 < bridge> <Kaffeine> @Shyzo this version of DDNet won't work in your OS. It is just too outdated.
15:27 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Guys, there is  `GLIBC_2.28 not found` message in the `ldd` output. Please don't make @Shyzo also building his own glibc on a live USB system.
15:27 <+ChillerDragon> what lerato said
15:28 < bridge> <Learath2> Though I think last time I installed ubuntu was in 2010 so who knows
15:28 <+ChillerDragon> what even is your goal? @Shyzo?
15:29 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Modern commands do not work there. Compiled DDNet needs at least Ubuntu 20.04.
15:29 <+ChillerDragon> running a super old ubuntu on a usb doesnt seem like the best ddnet gaming environment
15:29 < bridge> <Learath2> Didn't even spot the ancient glibc, good catch
15:30 < bridge> <RafaelFF> '325 packages can be upgraded'. Please do upgrade, make your system happy
15:30 < bridge> <Learath2> Though I don't remember when we upped our glibc requirement
15:30 < bridge> <Shyzo> So just f it and get new ubuntu version?
15:30 <+ChillerDragon> its a stick who cares about happy system xd
15:30 <+ChillerDragon> ye f it and get a new ubuntu like 22 or better get debian :p or manjaro
15:30 < bridge> <Shyzo> I would, but I don't even know what command to use to say "yes, please upgrade" xd
15:31 <+ChillerDragon> sudo apt upgrade -y
15:31 < bridge> <Learath2> `apt upgrade`
15:31 < bridge> <Shyzo> I see
15:31 < bridge> <Learath2> But don't bother imo. I think glibc 2.28 isn't even in 18.04
15:31 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Stop. Raping. USB. Live. System.
15:31 < bridge> <Shyzo> Should I try this still or makes no sense?
15:31 <+ChillerDragon> no sense
15:31 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah max glibc version on 18.04 is 2.27
15:32 < bridge> <Shyzo> Okay I will get new ubuntu boys. Thanks for your help though! Appreciate it
15:32 < bridge> <Shyzo> Short trip back in time
15:32 < bridge> <Learath2> Backwards compatibility is always annoying on linux sadly :/
15:33 < bridge> <Shyzo> Ubuntu 18.04 it is
15:33 < bridge> <RafaelFF> FYI: `apt update` updates the packages database provided by the APT sources. Then `apt upgrade` install the updated packages based on that package database.
15:33 < bridge> <Shyzo> üëçüëç
15:34 < bridge> <Learath2> I guess bionics standard support will end in a month but still sadge that we broke compatibility with ubuntu LTS sometime without even noticing
15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ubuntu upgrade shoulod be more or less seamless right?
15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> as long as u dont skip a upgrade
15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 18 -> 20 -> 22
15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or smth idk
15:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> havent used ubuntu since 2016
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im glad with my gentoo
15:43 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Haven't used Ubuntu before 2021 (ex. Gentoo user 2006-2021). Ubuntu broke on 2/2 upgrades for me :-D.
15:43 < bridge> <Learath2> Omg are you a convert? I was sure you'd go back to arch within the year
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lol no
15:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im converted
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and openrc is rly nice and easy
15:44 < bridge> <Learath2> Also did you stick with openrc or do you use systemd?
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but i use debian for my server tho
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> openrc ofc
15:44 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah gentoo on a server is annoying asf
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why wouldi try gentoo with systemd
15:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the only annoying thing is firefox getting updates every other week
15:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i just postpone firefox
15:45 < bridge> <Learath2> There is a stable channel too that gets less
15:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i like having a modern browser
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i dabbled a bit in gentoo bugzilla
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> someone wanted to statically link llvm for a rust package
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the gentoo maintainer said static linking is a "bug"
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and no one would ever want that
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they ship llvm without static linking support xdd
15:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so madman lol
15:46 < bridge> <Learath2> Static linking is a bug is the most gentoo thing I've ever heard
16:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> did not
16:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
16:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki do report progress when building your language üôÇ
16:21 < bridge> <Avolicious> opensuse tumbleweed every day sadge
16:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i will
16:25 <+ChillerDragon> if you send syntax highlight ill write hello world in ryo lang 
16:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i know how to make syntax highlight file for vim
16:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i made it for ddnet config files
16:25 <+ChillerDragon> i hope you add garbage collector
16:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> look at the ddnet repo
16:25 <+ChillerDragon> yes veri good vim is dope
16:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lol no, it will be native
16:25 <+ChillerDragon> id buy
16:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> chiller do u use my syntax for configs?
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> oh tru i need to install the cfg syntax hilita in ma vim config
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> no
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> i have to!
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> sec
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> ima do
16:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/other/vim
16:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> here
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> yes yes
16:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cp -R other/vim/* ~/.config/nvim/
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> neovim only?
16:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it works for vim too
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but im lazy
16:27 <+ChillerDragon> directly in vimrc?
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i just copy pasted the ddnet readme
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm no i think its under .vim/
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> where does it store files vim
16:27 <+ChillerDragon> ah vim folder
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i forgor
16:27 <+ChillerDragon> oke
16:27 <+ChillerDragon> yes .vim
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> thats the content of my .vim folder ``autoload  backup  bundle  plugged  swap  undo``
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> whats under autolod
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> viruses
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> mainly plug.vim the plugin manager
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it should be where there is a folder called ftdetect
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and syntax
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> and pathogen.vim which is actually virus i think idk what this is
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well try adding it to that dir
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> i guess i could create ftdetect
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> `autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile settings_ddnet.cfg set filetype=ddnet-cfg`
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it only sets the syntax to ddnet-cfg automatically for settings_ddnet.cfg, u can manually set it for other cfgs
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nono
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just cp then
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> like the command i sent
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it has the folder structure
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> oke ima try
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> `cp -R other/vim/* ~/.vim/`
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> yeye
16:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is on my neovim
16:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083411413860618400/200019975-823f322a-5099-4837-9551-c46171652db9.png
16:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> my CLion update crashed, then it wanted to revert the update, which crashed, and now it says i should reinstall the IDE üò¢
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just use vim
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or vscode
16:31 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait
16:31 <+ChillerDragon> its matching the filename
16:31 <+ChillerDragon> not .cfg?
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i told u
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz .cfg is too generic
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its used by other program configs maybe
16:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u can change the autocmd
16:31 <+ChillerDragon> oh no
16:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in the ftdetect file
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> ok
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> btw vim works too
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> just fine
16:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nice
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> so you can adapt readme
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> to have vim and neovim section
16:32 < bridge> <Shyzo> Ok I'm back. I downloaded Ubuntu 22, went on live usb. Updated, installed libsdl. Opened ddnet, it loads into the game and then I can't move mouse anymore. Any idea?
16:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> make the pr
16:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so u have a contribution xd
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> fakof
16:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> i pro contributor alr
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> i top10 ranked
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> i was farming a lot of xp with typo prs
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> because im pro stat githubber
16:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> true
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> @Shyzo why stick?
16:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im lower xd
16:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sadge
16:34 < that_haiku_user> do you get any power ups if you have more contributions
16:34 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yeah more lines = proer coder, air
16:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> actually some of my old commits are not attributed to me cuz a email change
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> that_haiku_user no i just gameify it to keep me motivated :D
16:34 < that_haiku_user> why cant you add ur old email
16:34 < bridge> <Shyzo> Don't want to install on disk atm. Only if I think it's cool xd
16:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think i dont have the domain anymore
16:35 < that_haiku_user> F.
16:35 <+ChillerDragon> im not sure if using a stick will ever be cool
16:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i had ryozuki.xyz but i wanted more exposure in the dev world and it was too weeby
16:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so i have edgarluque.com
16:35 <+ChillerDragon> UwU
16:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> boring
16:35 <+ChillerDragon> edg-l
16:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i should get a better domain
16:35 < bridge> <Shyzo> Prob not. But I can try it and if it works and I like it, then I can load it onto disk. I don't want to corrupt anything on my disk
16:35 < bridge> <Shyzo> By trolling
16:35 <+ChillerDragon> you can buy ryo.zillyhuhn.com for 20 bucks a month
16:36 <+ChillerDragon> @Shyzo i highly recommend using a disk that has nothing on it 
16:36 <+ChillerDragon> so you cant trol any data 
16:36 < bridge> <Shyzo> Yes. But I don't have that atm. That's why I use a stick ü§£
16:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083413125354766386/image.png
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> ok i see
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> then keep stickin
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> as for mouse issues idk you can try window mode or all the gfx options basically
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> installing drivers for your gpu etc 
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> switch render backend
16:37 < bridge> <Shyzo> :D so you got any idea why my game freezes?
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> try opengl instead of vulkan
16:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> traffic on my vps, most is from the wiki and a site i have
16:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083413479471456426/image.png
16:38 < bridge> <Shyzo> I would do that. But I really can't load into the game. It freezes at the first screen. And I can't find the appdata folder on Ubuntu. (Haven't look yet tho xd). To change it in the config directly
16:38 <+ChillerDragon> ``./DDNet "gfx_backend OpenGL"``
16:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh wait this is for just 9 days
16:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> here february
16:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083413605942304828/image.png
16:39 <+ChillerDragon> no comment support?
16:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> does ddnet support comments?
16:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i forgor xd
16:40 <+ChillerDragon> bruv
16:40 < bridge> <Shyzo> Holy that image is scuffed. Can you ready anything? 
16:40 < bridge> <Shyzo> Don't think it worked cause it says GPU version vulkan
16:40 < bridge> <Shyzo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083414006401880085/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_78bbb9da-2163-449f-844e-c8ae9c0e6fe0.jpg
16:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dude
16:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> install screenshot
16:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U don't have GPU driver installed
16:40 <+ChillerDragon> :p
16:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and take screenshots
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> and install discord
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> to send them xd
16:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> troll chiller
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> gfx_backend
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> not gfx backend
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> boi shyo
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> hop on irc web
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> so u can copy stuff
16:41 < bridge> <Shyzo> Wow you guys think I'm einstein.

16:43 <+ChillerDragon> poggies
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> i mean tbh using discord web would probably be as little effort as webchat quakenet
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> you just have to solve 1 captcha and select a birth date
16:44 < shyzoneedshelp> ye no thats clearly too much to handle.
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> i personally have to solve 20 captchas because discord flagged me as big enemys
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki did you see https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6399https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6399https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6399 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6399 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6399
16:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:45 < shyzoneedshelp> sudo apt install nvidia-driver-515 nvidia-dkms-515 im using this. but i think i need to restart my pc after, which kinda makes the live usb useless, doesnt it? xD
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> yes
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> i should have told you

17:08 < shyzoneedshelp> thanks again chillerdragon
17:08 < shyzoneedshelp> im out
17:10 <+ChillerDragon> rq
17:30 < bridge> <Learath2> I just took a python, git/github basics lab just to see what they teach students nowadays and I'm concerned
17:31 <+ChillerDragon> whats a "lab"
17:31 < bridge> <Learath2> Just a lecture but where students actively follow along
17:31 <+ChillerDragon> in your uni?
17:31 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah
17:32 <+ChillerDragon> you hopped in a first semester room
17:32 <+ChillerDragon> physically?
17:32 < bridge> <Learath2> It's technically part of a 3rd semester class, but yes that's what I did
17:32 <+ChillerDragon> why concerned
17:32 <+ChillerDragon> because you couldnt follow along?! :D
17:32 <+ChillerDragon> hihihihi
17:33 < bridge> <Learath2> The professor was copying and pasting stuff from slides and couldn't get stuff to work for like 20 minutes
17:33 < bridge> <Learath2> We are talking about generating an ssh key here üòõ
17:33 <+ChillerDragon> yikers
17:33 <+ChillerDragon> so the prof was noob?
17:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yikes
17:34 < bridge> <Learath2> The prof had python datascience brainrot, he spent too much time messing around with numbers that he lost his touch with the computer
17:35 < bridge> <Learath2> and the exercises were bizarre, I still don't know what this one is supposed to mean even
17:35 < bridge> <Learath2> > Given a range of numbers. Iterate from i-th number to the end number and print the sum of the current number and previous number.
17:35 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1678379710.png
17:35 < bridge> <Learath2> Given how? (no explanation), print the sum of what? previous number? huh?
17:36 <+ChillerDragon> do you have prompt engineering classes in uni already?
17:36 <+ChillerDragon> like on how to use chatgpt
17:36 < bridge> <Learath2> lol, not yet
17:38 < bridge> <Learath2> This is honestly a much better summary of git than the mess of commands he had on his slides
17:38 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:38 <+ChillerDragon> to be fair one does not need to be a git wizard to be a good dev
17:39 <+ChillerDragon> i showed this meme to coworkers who didnt get it cuz they only use git guis
17:39 < bridge> <Learath2> I hate to agree with the newage people but they might be right that universities are just not good for non-theoretical computer science
17:39 < bridge> <Learath2> If you want to learn about the worst case complexity of a* great, if you want to actually develop software not so much ngl
17:40 <+ChillerDragon> i dont understand how u still in uni
17:40 <+ChillerDragon> arent you like 50 and started cs with 12?
17:40 <+ChillerDragon> are you making your 4th doctor or what?
17:40 <+ChillerDragon> no offense
17:40 < bridge> <Learath2> None taken, I'm just a horrible student
17:40 <+ChillerDragon> :p
17:40 < bridge> <Learath2> I hated all the engineering stuff, so I just didn't do any of it
17:41 < bridge> <Learath2> Then I had only engineering stuff left in my curriculum so I had no motivation to finish the degree even
17:41 <+ChillerDragon> are your lectures in english?
17:41 < bridge> <Learath2> Yep
17:42 <+ChillerDragon> is your uni bulding cool?
17:42 < bridge> <Learath2> Eh, sure, it's not bad
17:42 <+ChillerDragon> ok i come visit
17:42 < bridge> <Learath2> What for even?
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> quality python lab
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> we do not have any python in germany
17:43 < bridge> <Learath2> good good, python is the worst language imagined by mankind
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> didnt you promise me a vlog from your uni anyways?
17:45 < bridge> <Learath2> Not that I recall
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> i do
17:46 < bridge> <Learath2> I don't think I'll listen to the rest of this lab, I'm going home sadge
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> oh wow its right now?
17:47 < bridge> <Learath2> yep
17:47 < bridge> <Learath2> I wanted to vent my disappointment during the break
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> quick python trivia
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> is this a syntax error yes or no? ``"foo", "bar"``
17:48 < bridge> <Learath2> o
17:48 < bridge> <Learath2> no
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> pro
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> you did learn a lot in this lab
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> !
17:48 < bridge> <Learath2> definitely learned in this lab üòÑ
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> now your just being unthankful
17:49 < bridge> <Learath2> true, I'll go thank the teacher before I leave
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:50 < bridge> <Learath2> My favourite python trivia question is the for/else
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea its the best
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> wait i dont fully recal
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> else gets run if for didnt loop right?
17:50 < bridge> <Learath2> else clause executes if for loop finished without a break
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> oh shit
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> without break :D
17:51 < bridge> <Learath2> or in other words if the loop finished normally
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> makes total sense
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> in case of happy path
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> execute sad path as well
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> is there any lang without trol features?
17:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it makes to have it
17:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but maybe else wasn't a good keyword
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> yea i guess
17:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's the troll feature of rust? üôÇ
17:53 < bridge> <Learath2> 0 troll in C, only serious language
17:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> trigraphs
17:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> \\?
17:53 < bridge> <Learath2> we don't talk about those
17:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> \\\\?
17:53 <+ChillerDragon> C not so sure rust i don't know enough but i kinda doubt it has no trolings
17:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> did you know that you can use \u0123 escapes in normal java source code?
17:54 <+ChillerDragon> wat so special about u123
17:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. you can use `\u002f\u002f` to start a comment
17:54 <+ChillerDragon> wow
17:55 <+ChillerDragon> did you know ``<!-- this -->`` is a valid javascript comment? :D
17:55 < bridge> <Learath2> Lol, how do they even handle that I wonder
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> im not sure where this unicode thingy comes from but sounds convienent to accept similar unicode characters as syntax
17:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think it is a valid JS comment
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> it should be
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> node eats it well
17:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> care to link a reference?
17:58 <+ChillerDragon> from where i know about it or my node terminal that doesnt throw a syntax?
17:58 < bridge> <Learath2> https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-html-like-comments
17:58 < bridge> <Learath2> I guess?
17:58 < bridge> <ReiTW> who uses js afterall :giga_chad:
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> i know it from yt some dude said its there because back in the days the idea was to srpingle a bit of js <script> tags into your web page and then might as well use same comment syntax :D
17:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I thought it was a way to hide JS from non-JS browsers
17:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
17:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hm
17:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> not sure how my memory of a dude on yt is any accurate
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki can we pls have html like comments in ryo lang? thanks
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> and also the unicode comments
18:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lalrpop is amazing

18:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its not ryolang its edlang
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> ok mr ed
18:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :lulEZ:
18:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and no
18:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> html comments sux
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> sad
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> html only progaming language i know
18:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it is valid
18:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is for legacy reasons on <script> in html
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> so wat the dude on yt said is tru :D
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :drinkblob:
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im kinda glad and not that i left uni first year in
18:06 < bridge> <Learath2> ackshully html isn't programming language ü§ì
18:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe missed opportunity to learn something, but i can learn myself too
18:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i didnt have that much money, and i doubt my parents either
18:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to pay how much it costs
18:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> even if its public u have to pay lol
18:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and if u fail a module, u need to pay it again to do it again lol
18:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i knew i would fail some
18:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its a mafia
18:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and now i earn the most among my friends
18:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
18:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it isnt
18:08 < bridge> <Learath2> At the very least I can tell you you didn't miss anything from the sampling of universities I've seen lectures from
18:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe if they teached state of the art compiler stuff
18:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> like MLIR
18:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its dope
18:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but im learning it by myself
18:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and getting paid for it
18:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so
18:09 < bridge> <Learath2> That's probably more graduate level where you probably don't even get lectures but are expected to research it yourself anyway üòÑ

18:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont use netflix
18:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the article is cool ^^
18:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> independent of using netflix or not
18:16 < bridge> <Robyt3> I don't understand how this crash happens immediate when you start the game. The crash log says that an editor popup was open and from this a tile layer was created, either with too large size for the 32 bit version or with negative size (for whatever reason).
18:16 <+ChillerDragon> heinrich u got a tldr for that blog?
18:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
18:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > At that point the PDB for Chrome was at 95% of 4 GiB
18:17 <+ChillerDragon> install software to bypass closed src dmca thingies?
18:19 < bridge> <Learath2> I wonder if anyone actually tried reverse engineering libwidevine
18:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> tldr: it's apparently harder to watch netflix "legally" on unsupported platforms than breaking it
18:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> read the article :p
18:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > Thus begins the "do not violate the DMCA challenge 2023". The goal of this challenge is to figure out how to watch Netflix on Asahi Linux without bypassing or otherwise breaking DRM.

18:19 <+ChillerDragon> your tldr is good thanks :)
18:21 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Offtopic to the current conversation has anyone got mpd (music player daemon) working?
18:23 <+ChillerDragon> this is a ddnet only channel no music player channel please use #off-topic
18:23 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> How would you respond to #off-topic though?
18:24 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> How would you respond to #off-topic though? Plus I thought it might be interesting (what I am trying to achieve)

18:29 < bridge> <power> hihooo schillerdragon! ^^
18:30 <+ChillerDragon> powa 
18:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> have you tried the arch wiki, @Reteah? https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Music_Player_Daemon

18:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2
18:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the icons of the keys are from the led display btw
18:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> all keys are transparent
18:57 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> looks cool but ig it's not "mechanical"
18:57 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :O it's maglev
18:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > The Flux Keyboard combines the best of both worlds. The tactility and speed of a mechanical keyboard with the adaptability of a screen, breaking down the barriers between you and what you want to do.
18:58 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> makes sense it's maglev now that I think about it because all the "wires" would be inside the case and the keyboard just has the magnets cool

19:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> The keyboard will cost between US$299 - $350 after discounts for pre-orders with a retail price of US$450.
19:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not bad honestly
19:00 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I expected it to be near ~700$
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the keyboard looks like shit tho
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so small
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no numpad
19:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
19:17 < bridge> <Learath2> bizarre

19:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i can parse this xd
19:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> totally not rust inspired
19:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> need to add the return thing
19:34 < bridge> <Learath2> lalrpop I'm guessing is just an LR language parser?
19:35 < bridge> <Learath2> Parser generator*
19:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop
19:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lalrpop itself is made with lalrpop
19:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> originally made by niko matsakis
19:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a core rust dev
19:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/03/java-20-so-far/
19:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for you
19:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i know u love this
19:47 < bridge> <Chairn> it's always interesting for students to start with historical stuff. You probably didn't learn complex number before seeing integers and then real numbers
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> before i dont get 20% more FPS in minecraft java updates are useless xd
19:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i never said to not teach that
19:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its just that they dont teach the new stuff
19:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> that i know of
19:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or atleast its the image most unis give off
19:49 < bridge> <Chairn> well, as a uni teacher, i can tell you that we'd like to, but we don't have enough time
19:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh ur a uni teacher now?
19:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nice
19:49 < bridge> <Chairn> im given 10 hours to teach 1st year student basic digital electronics
19:50 < bridge> <Chairn> base 2 representation, 2's complement, boolean algebra, combinatorial logics, sequential logics and state machine
19:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this gives a rly interesting philosophical question: eventually you will have to learn so many "before" things to reach to the "current knowledge" that to be a a expert u will be a old person, or you can just skip the before stuff
19:50 < bridge> <Chairn> clearly not enough
19:50 < bridge> <Chairn> you can skip part of it
19:50 < bridge> <Chairn> for instance in architecture, we could skip stack based machine
19:50 < bridge> <Chairn> BUT Java uses this in software, so, we can't really skip it
19:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
19:52 < bridge> <Chairn> i believe it is the case if you wanna see everything in physic or math
19:52 < bridge> <Chairn> so you gotta just see a subpart of it
20:04 < bridge> <Learath2> How was the first lalrpop made? üòõ

22:23 < bridge> <Kujire> hey, im trying to build https://github.com/35niavlys/teeworlds-trainfng.. idk if this is the right place to ask, but im having trouble with building/compiling it, and i figured somone here might know whats going on?
22:23 < bridge> <Kujire> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083500315371896862/its_borken.png
22:23 < bridge> <Kujire> I have cmake itstalled.
22:23 < bridge> <Kujire> I have cmake insttalled.
22:23 < bridge> <Kujire> I have cmake installed.
22:27 < bridge> <Chairn> don't use sudo for building softwares
22:27 < bridge> <Chairn> try `sudo apt install build-essential`
22:28 < bridge> <Chairn> `sudo apt install build-essential cmake git google-mock libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libfreetype6-dev libglew-dev libnotify-dev libogg-dev libopus-dev libopusfile-dev libsdl2-dev libsqlite3-dev libwavpack-dev python libx264-dev libavfilter-dev libavdevice-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-extra libavutil-dev libvulkan-dev glslang-tools spirv-tools libpng-dev`
22:28 < bridge> <Kujire> If i don't do `sudo` before then it tells me permission denied xd
22:28 < bridge> <Kujire> alright
22:28 < bridge> <Chairn> never ever use sudo for building stuff, fix permission problems first
22:28 < bridge> <Kujire> ok üëç
22:29 < bridge> <Chairn> something like `chmod 755 build/`
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just remove the dir and recreate it xd
22:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> -r
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> -R
22:29 < bridge> <Kujire> these are mixed messagess
22:29 < bridge> <Kujire> but i guess ill go with one of these lmao
22:30 < bridge> <Kujire> what does -R do?
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well when u already used sudo with git clone
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> best is u re clone it
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> -R means recursive
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so all files in a directory
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its a flag for chmod
22:31 < bridge> <Kujire> wait what dont tell me i have to reclone
22:31 < bridge> <Kujire> downloading 600MB took 3 hours lmao
22:31 < bridge> <Chairn> ah yeah, so something like `cd && sudo chmod -R 755 Downloads`
22:31 < bridge> <Chairn> then just `cd -`
22:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not chmod
22:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> more like chown
22:31 < bridge> <Kujire> also i didnt use sudo when i git cloned it
22:31 < bridge> <Chairn> ah also...
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd probs only use chown
22:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sudo uses root user
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno if they do, but if the compiler checks the permission level this can still cause weird problems
22:32 < bridge> <Kujire> ..?
22:33 < bridge> <Chairn> why would it?
22:33 < bridge> <Kujire> so whats the first thing i do xdü§ì
22:33 < bridge> <Kujire> kinda noob here and i have no clue what i screwed up
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cd ~/Downloads
22:34 < bridge> <Chairn> `cd && sudo chmod -R 755 Downloads && sudo chown -R ${USER} Downloads && sudo chgrp -R ${USER} && cd -`
22:34 < bridge> <Kujire> alright, i know that part at least lmao
22:34 < bridge> <Chairn> should fix most of it
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chown -R kujire:kujire -R teeworlds-trainfng
22:34 < bridge> <Kujire> alr lol
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 755 is quite lessisive
22:35 < bridge> <Kujire> ok downloading essential build thing first which is taking ages with my 20kb/s
22:35 < bridge> <Chairn> ah god, should use find then...
22:36 < bridge> <ReiTW> chown -R user:user
22:36 < bridge> <ReiTW> why so complicated
22:36 < bridge> <Chairn> something like `find Downloads -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;` then `find Downloads -type -exec chmod 755 {} \;`
22:36 < bridge> <Chairn> because i use these like once a month
22:37 < bridge> <Chairn> dont know all the shortcuts
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 644 is pretty normal
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why change it
22:37 < bridge> <Kujire> so start from `~` or whatever and then just run this?
22:37 < bridge> <Chairn> we don't know how much he messed with permissions
22:37 < bridge> <Chairn> first cd will move you into ~
22:38 < bridge> <Kujire> ah ok ty
22:38 < bridge> <Kujire> i feel stupid being this much of a noob :justatest:
22:38 < bridge> <Kujire> ig this is what devs like yall deal with daily anyway xd
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> usually u only add -x to a file permission
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i rarely ever touch then for a different reason
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> some programs refuse specific modes
22:39 < bridge> <Kujire> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083504422321139722/Screenshot_from_2023-03-09_14-39-27.png
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. ssh only allows user permissions
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> on .ssh
22:40 < bridge> <Kujire> it didnt work
22:40 < bridge> <Kujire> :feelsamazingman:
22:40 < bridge> <Chairn> ah forgot Downloads after ${USER} in chgrp command
22:40 < bridge> <Kujire> so `chgrp -R ${USER} && cd Downloads-`?
22:41 < bridge> <Chairn> nah, chgrp -R ${USER} Downloads
22:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao
22:41 < bridge> <Kujire> xd
22:41 < bridge> <Kujire> dont laugh at m
22:41 < bridge> <Chairn> then cd Downloads/something-fng
22:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i assume u use KDE?
22:41 < bridge> <Kujire> cinnomen
22:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why not simply right click -> settings -> rights
22:41 < bridge> <Kujire> or however thats spelled
22:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and then do it with a gui xD
22:42 < bridge> <ReiTW> ```
22:42 < bridge> <ReiTW> sudo chmod -R 755 Downloads && sudo chown -R ${USER}:${USER} Downloads
22:42 < bridge> <ReiTW> ```
22:42 < bridge> <Kujire> idk im not the magician
22:42 < bridge> <Kujire> ok
22:42 < bridge> <Kujire> the command worked i think
22:43 < bridge> <Kujire> `cd && sudo chmod -R 755 Downloads && sudo chown -R ${USER} Downloads && sudo chgrp -R ${USER} Downloads`
22:43 < bridge> <Kujire> this is what i was supposed to do right?
22:43 < bridge> <ReiTW> both works
22:43 < bridge> <Chairn> looks like yes
22:43 < bridge> <Kujire> so now jhust try and build again?
22:43 < bridge> <ReiTW> without sudo
22:43 < bridge> <Kujire> alright
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> try with sudo again to check if you understood the previous part
22:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lmao
22:44 < bridge> <Kujire> ok
22:44 < bridge> <Kujire> it worked
22:44 < bridge> <Kujire> but a new error :greenthing:

22:46 < bridge> <Kujire> looks likea bunch of libs didnt download.. or?
22:46 < bridge> <ReiTW> normal in some cases
22:47 < bridge> <ReiTW> if you build only server-side you don't need some
22:47 < bridge> <Kujire> so what now
22:47 < bridge> <Kujire> :gigachad:
22:48 < bridge> <ReiTW> install zlib
22:48 < bridge> <ReiTW> should be named zlib1g smth like that

22:49 < bridge> <ReiTW> yes because server requires zlib
22:49 < bridge> <ReiTW> sudo apt install zlib1g-dev
22:49 < bridge> <Kujire> ok
22:49 < bridge> <Kujire> ok finally it built
22:49 < bridge> <Kujire> ty guys lmao
22:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> btw we even seem to not have it included in our README
22:50 < bridge> <ReiTW> yes
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is it normally preisntalled?
22:50 < bridge> <Chairn> yup, just noticed that
22:50 < bridge> <ReiTW> no
22:50 < bridge> <ReiTW> (ig depends on systems but generally no)
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean dev and runtime is different anyway
22:50 < bridge> <Kujire> ok gtg now tysm everyone lol
22:50 < bridge> <Chairn> time for quick pr then
22:50 < bridge> <ReiTW> +
22:51 < bridge> <ReiTW> there's not only that missing
22:51 < bridge> <ReiTW> all the sqlite stuff if I remember correctly
22:51 < bridge> <ReiTW> some other libs
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh i could swear every single time i install new OS
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just copy paste the command
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and it works
22:51 < bridge> <ReiTW> u're a client-side chad
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but i usually do make -j20
22:51 < bridge> <ReiTW> (dunno if it uses zlib, never knew the use-case of it)
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> without specifying a target
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> zlib is the compression lib
22:52 < bridge> <ReiTW> ah
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> our client uses it too anyway
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for map compression
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://packages.debian.org/stretch/libpng-dev
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think most libs simply link to zlib-debv
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think most libs simply link to zlib-dev
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "dep: zlib1g-dev"
23:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1083511294151380992/i923oisf8oma1.webp
23:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so he starts the client presses "Play" and it crashes inside the editor?
23:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as a rust fanboy i'd expect you to not understand it. not bcs its hard to understand, but bcs its too bad solution xd
23:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
23:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Robyt3 do we like execute the editor console chains, and do they call some editor code?
23:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how should editor code else be called at all, except the Init
23:14 < bridge> <Robyt3> No idea how this happens. I tried again with addr2line and I get the same results:
23:14 < bridge> <Robyt3> ```

23:15 < bridge> <Robyt3> ```
23:15 < bridge> <Robyt3> So this happens in the PopupGroup render function
23:15 < bridge> <Robyt3> That should only be called while the editor is open and the popup is manually opened
23:15 < bridge> <Robyt3> And popups.cpp:285 is only reached when the button "Add tile layer" is pressed
23:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i get the same stack trace too
23:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe the trace is simply wrong on 32bit xD
23:18 < bridge> <Robyt3> The lines fit together though
23:19 < bridge> <Robyt3> Would be a strange coincidence
23:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> his assert logs indicates some invalid texture use
23:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but he deleted them
23:20 < bridge> <Robyt3> Maybe if the map doesn't contain a game layer then invalid memory is accessed
23:21 < bridge> <Robyt3> I expected that 32 bit would at least consistently crash on null-pointer access
