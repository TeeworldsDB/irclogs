00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> somehow a steam notification just killed me
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> maybe it took focus or smth, but this hasnt happened before
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i wasnt able to left-/rightclick with my mouse

07:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> > Hi! I am trying to build the javascript client of DDNet in this project: https://github.com/eeeee/ddnet. And I get stuck at the last stage of linking. It seem that the wasm binary file can not link with dynamic library in linux64. Should I compile all dynamic library which ddnet client used to wasm binary with emscripten by myself?  or there are another simpler way? Any help would be appreciate.
07:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> @Eki Finally I change the compile_to_js file and build some js successfully, but it can not run normally. So I use ddnet_*.js file from http://teewebs.net, and do some hack, then serve it using github page. https://github.com/QingGo/ddnet-web-client-test

09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u around?
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok nvm
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Eki nice. what's the plan now?
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> > @Eki nice. what's the plan now?
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> @deen next step I'll make a crawler to fetch info of servers whose support websocket and respond json to web client.
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Could you fix websockets in servers first? ðŸ˜„
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2695
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2697
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And would also be great to have a way for normal client to use websockets, since sometimes UDP is blocked but Websockets keeps working
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> > Could you fix websockets in servers first? ðŸ˜„
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> @deen i ll try but it seems work normally with libwebsockets 2.x, why should we update it?
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ah, then we just need to enforce using websockets 2.x in cmake
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because my distribution only has websockets 4
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and we don't bundle it, do we?
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> > And would also be great to have a way for normal client to use websockets, since sometimes UDP is blocked but Websockets keeps working
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> @deen and this maybe including lots of work
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I thought most of the changes for the server code would apply equally to client
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> can we bundle it by change cmake and  put it into ddnet-lib?
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> > I thought most of the changes for the server code would apply equally to client
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> @deen it seem not that difficulty, i 'll try it.
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks a lot!
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Eki yeah, we could bundle it. But is libwebsockets 2 even still maintained? Maybe libwebsockets has an upgrade guide explaining what you have to change to make it work with current library version?
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And if you get websockets working again, I'm planning to run it on official servers again
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is there an Option that ddnet.exe doesn't use recources when tabbed out
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh heinrich ur here
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum you could try `gfx_backgroundrender`
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> > @Eki yeah, we could bundle it. But is libwebsockets 2 even still maintained? Maybe libwebsockets has an upgrade guide explaining what you have to change to make it work with current library version?
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> @deen when I install libwebsockets in debian 10 and ubuntu 18, the default version is 2.0.3 iirc. I will try to and websockets function to client first, and then try to update the libwebsockets version.
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki just woke up
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well, read my pm when u can :justatest:
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i can just say it here, im trying to add the join functionality via steam, but it needs the callback stuff from steam, to register a callback you use a macro and i dont know how to add that exactly to the api flat
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum I use cl_refresh_rate_inactive 120
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also is there a reason why you didnt add the connect key to rich presence?
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki couldn't figure it out last time, added some debug info
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wanted to add it today
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think this is fine
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752093713253138472/unknown.png
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but to join another u need the callback
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as is, this just puts the server address on the command line
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which is not that helpful
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but yea, something like this will work
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wanted to experiment with what the callback actually returns
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamFriends#GameRichPresenceJoinRequested_t
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we need to handle this event
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the steam:// url?
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what we passed?
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752094027427348540/unknown.png
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the connect in the rich presence is just that
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ip + port
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not the thing we need I think
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it is used in that event
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its that
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamFriends#SetRichPresence
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > "connect" - A UTF-8 string that contains the command-line for how a friend can connect to a game. This enables the 'join game' button in the 'view game info' dialog, in the steam friends list right click menu, and on the players Steam community profile. Be sure your app implements ISteamApps::GetLaunchCommandLine so you can disable the popup warning when launched via a command line.
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so we can get the param using GetLaunchCommandLine
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which we do already
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but it also works for when the game is already running
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> via the callback i sent
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this command line is when the game is not running
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u join
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not only
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> your stuff sounds like you have to invite your friend
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it also works for joining
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there is an event "new launch param"
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> without iinvite
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> GameRichPresenceJoinRequested_t
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Called when the user tries to join a game from their friends list or after a user accepts an invite by a friend with InviteUserToGame.
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> see
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is either u join or u join by nivite
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its both
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the callback contains the value of the connect key that rich presence has
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why u dont need invite
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if the rich presence has the connect info
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i just need to know how to add STEAM_CALLBACK to api flat
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> > @Eki yeah, we could bundle it. But is libwebsockets 2 even still maintained? Maybe libwebsockets has an upgrade guide explaining what you have to change to make it work with current library version?

11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it probably doesn't have to do anything for the flat API
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe insert a typecheck, if feasible
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but other than that, it can simply be a no-op, if I understand it correctly
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe not
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> need to investigate
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/api#callbacks> (for reference)
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have i3 and it works perfectly for me
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i3-gaps
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah but both my monitors have same resolution tho
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> > @Im 'corneum you could try `gfx_backgroundrender`
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @heinrich5991 
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> > @Im 'corneum I use cl_refresh_rate_inactive 120
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @deen 
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i had backgroundrender on 0 and refresh rate on 120 already. 
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but ddnet still causes my pc to stay awake or even wake up from energy saving mode
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh, it's about this problem. Sounds more like a Windows Energy Saving setting
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki have you tried only having the steam window open on the screen when launching it?
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it is defenetly because of ddnet. ofc i searched all about windows settings already
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 i have steam set to floating tho cuz its all bugged with the friends chat
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ye usually only steam is open there
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum I don't really understand how an application can wake up a computer if the computer is off
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki can you open one non-floating window before ddnet?
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps windows wakes up the computer for updates (it sometimes does) and ddnet doesn't let it power off automatically anmore
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> its not off. its that mode when i press any button or move the mouse the fans turn on again and the pc the ready to go.
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> still, ddnet is not running then
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the cpu is off in that mode AFAIK
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 works fine with firefox open steam on top of it floating and opening ddnet
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm k
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 do u use i3 or i3gaps?
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i3gaps has fixes and stuff
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum same problem with teeworlds btw?
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it has to be. today i logged out of my account with ddnet turned off. and then after 20 minutes my pc automaticly went into the energy saving mode.... i didnt even knew that was a thing
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> im gonna try tonight or later
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> also i mentioned before that when i used to tab into ddnet in the morning (it was running all night) the client would crash instantly.. or maybe already be crashed idk
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i mean its no big deal. i just have to close ddnet when i turn off my pc. but something must be going on there
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe sdl sets some kind of "do not power off while I'm running" flag like media players do?
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki no, using i3. it doesn't happen with only one monitor enabled for me
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> any reason u dont use i3gaps
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't need gaps? ^^
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can disable them
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :)
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but why would I run i3gaps then?
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AFAIK they're by the same maintainer
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not just gaps
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i3-gaps â€“ i3 with more features (forked from https://github.com/i3/i3)
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> arch has it btw
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > It is kept up to date with upstream, adding a few additional features such as gaps between windows (see below for a complete list).
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> features: gaps, smart gaps, smart border, smart edge borders, i3 bar height
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk then
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @deen  could it be that because i deleted all languages.txt ddnet says update failed, but it actually updated?
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> All except 1
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Couldn't we store both mapres `.png` & `.rules` in mapres directory, instead of having the first one in `mapres/` while the other in `editor/`? it's damn confusing, even though I think I kinda get the point of separating them... but that'd also make it easier to clearly see for what you have the automapper rules
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why do i have redownload almost every map?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why do i have to redownload almost every map?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in autoupdater? we deleted them in some version and redownloaded later.
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> was there any change in the hash?
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> or looks like a lot of map have been updated recently
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Chairn Lots of maps had mapres in sizes not divisable by 16, which could, or caused graphical bugs
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> so they had to be fixed
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oh
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that explains it then
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> thx
14:54 <@deen> Zwelf: teamrace inserts fail super often, other ones seem to work fine. could you take a look if you see something wrong?
15:15 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Since mostly teamrace is affected, I would guess that the cause is locking the tables. As for each insert/update the table is locked first.
15:26 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Using a transactions instead might help. Or changing the teamrank semantic to save each teamrank would help as well, but would make accessing teamranks more expensive. (Didn't come around to test how expensive yet :/)

15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 id 2763 generic enough that we can implement join with another sdk too?

15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes actually
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> although I didn't take care about that
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking of doing discord game sdk so we get rich presence here too
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> discord isn't accepting new games rn apparently
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> although the deprecated rich presence API might still work
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, where did you see that?
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on the help pages about the game sdk
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only saw a warning about the discord commerce stuff

15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, understood
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I even made us a team ðŸ˜›
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> aww
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 5991... 5.09.91
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> happy birthday afterwards i guess xd
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> prolly nit
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not*
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh ðŸ˜¦
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ðŸ¥³
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know we aren't too far apart in age so I'd guess the 5991 stands for 1995 ðŸ˜„
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> lets just celebrate heinrich without any reason
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh thought he's older ðŸ˜„
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I don't know for sure, so lets celebrate anyway :Celebrate: :feelsbirthdayman: ðŸŽ‚ ðŸ¥³
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> alles gute zum geburtstag @heinrich5991
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess it's my real fake birthday today ðŸ¥³
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> happy fake birthday \o/
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 is str_token_next allowed to not advance? like is a length of 0 allowed
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually don't remember what specifications I designed that to
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª wym by length of 0? like empty string?
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar âœª I think that you now abort the tokenization on empty list elements
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unfortunately, it seems that there is no test for this
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you add one?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. `EXPECT_TRUE(str_in_list("abc,,def", ",", "def"));` in src/test/str.cpp
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i meant what heinrich said ðŸ˜„
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt @Learath2 c++20 format, available now ðŸ˜‰
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, this is nice, but it kinda requires compiler support to be great
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wdym?
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Knowing the internals of std::string would make the implementation nice, clean and performant ðŸ™‚
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you see what this one looks like? Full of compiler specific workarounds for stuff
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the implementation? no
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> haven't looked into it
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> though I guess one doesn't really need to concern themselves with the implementation details
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just have a thing for elegant code ðŸ˜„
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the std lib also usually looks messy ðŸ˜‰
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Y, so much backwards compatibility cruft
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen || Zwelf: Should we just log every INSERT query we make while one of you figures out how to fix teamranks?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 well, i have a bug for that open but Zwelf said it's not so easy to do since we have prepared statements now
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we used to do that, made life much easier
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2673
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sqlite seems to allow us to expand the query, we can do that
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its better than not having the query and losing teamranks

20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> again not dilated/compressed/optimized
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @BannZay ^
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> when u take a screenshot wouldn't it be good to echo in chat "Screenshot Taken" or something along those lines
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> its in f1
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> bind f10 "+screenshot(dk, is it right); echo Screenshot Taken"
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> `Bind <key> "screenshot; echo <msg>"`
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> > when u take a screenshot wouldn't it be good to echo in chat "Screenshot Taken" or something along those lines
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @louis I had another idea but @jao didn't like it :C
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> my game just hanged twice when I used spectate on person while being on pause. on full server (Back in the sky, windows, steam version)
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> r u able to debug it
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Jupstar âœª yes, I opened an issue
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> the thread just infenitely sits at system.c sphore_wait()
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> it loads CPU pretty hard and memory grows up to 3gbs and keep doing it
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> seems like a dead lock, a couple of other threads also blocked here
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> but I am not familiar with this code
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can u see what the graphic thread is doing @BannZay ?
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> how can I know which thread is a graphics thread?
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it will probs feature class names with graphic in it
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or backend
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> right now its at CommandProcessorFragment_OpenGL2::RenderBorderTileEmulation
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> at sync_barrier();
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mh
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can i see a screenshot?
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> from the calling tree
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yes, as well I could stream for you if you want to
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yes
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> secd
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752276095910412399/unknown.png
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can u look what the value of vertexcount is
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> not, its not available
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah is it an optimized build?
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> no
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> oh, I dont know
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I dont think so*
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh strange that u cannot access it
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> does it still run or does it hang there?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> like can you continue debugging?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I used  "${workspaceFolder}/build/DDNet.sln",
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay>                 "-t:DDNet",
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay>                 "-p:Configuration=Debug",
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay>                 "-p:Platform=x64",
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay>                 "-m",
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> it hanged
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can you access Drawnum in the for loop?
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just hover over it
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> DrawNum
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> 4294966218
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that sounds wrong xd
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can u click left on function call above
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and go over pcommand
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> VertexCount
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> 4096
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that sound good, but the other is way too much
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752278085469995114/unknown.png
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok ty
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> anything else?
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> hard to say, bcs actually it uses the same command as the OpenGL 3.3 impl, and i never had that bug, so either buffer overflow inside the backend or buffer overflow outside of that thread
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> okay, I can reproduce it later if you will need some more data about it. Just contact me if you will need
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok ty
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> np
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well if its easy to reproduce for you, you can quickly write a patch to find whats the real value ðŸ˜„
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> the real value? Of what?
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I have no idea what to do
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i will tell you soon
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> sure, I will be available for about an hour
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> src/engine/client/graphics_threaded.cpp
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> replace
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the first three lines of function `RenderBorderTiles`
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with `
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> void CGraphics_Threaded::RenderBorderTiles(int BufferContainerIndex, float *pColor, char *pIndexBufferOffset, float *pOffset, float *pDir, int JumpIndex, int64 DrawNum)
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> {
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>     if(DrawNum < 0) {
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>         return;
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>     }`
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in src/engine/client/graphics_threaded.h
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> replace the function with 
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>     virtual void RenderBorderTiles(int BufferContainerIndex, float *pColor, char *pIndexBufferOffset, float *pOffset, float *pDir, int JumpIndex, int64 DrawNum);`
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and in src/engine/graphics.h
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with 
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>     virtual void RenderBorderTiles(int BufferContainerIndex, float *pColor, char *pIndexBufferOffset, float *pOffset, float *pDir, int JumpIndex, int64 DrawNum) = 0;`
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> oh boy, hacker time
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then set a break point at the return
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its funny, that bug should be pretty easy to repreduce
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i cant xD
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I spent about 2 minutes clicking on different persons, its actually not that ez in debug build
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if thats actually the bug and not smth else, it should be dependend on the position of your camera
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe it resets or smth when switching spec
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yes, try to locate your camera far away from the start
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> you are right
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> thats what I did]
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe u can record with obs
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then we see where it happens _D
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> mhm? You want recoring of how do I reproduce the bug?
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes, it should always happen at the same position
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> hmm, okay
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but you can also just remember the position
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if the game hangs it probs still shows an image?
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that would probs already help
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> even in release mode
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/752282770277007381/2020-09-07_00-41-57.mp4
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thx @BannZay
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the camera might reset too far left
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> like even left from killtiles
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno if i ever thought about that xD
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yep can reproduce
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ty
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> by the way I patched code and reproduced hang, do you still need results ?
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> oh, okay. So you can do it now
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I always say and then think, nevermind
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just as i thought
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the camera goes left from border kill tiles
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'll fix it, and somebody else should fix these camera bugs xD
