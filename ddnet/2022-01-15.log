10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> might there be some simple fix? as it looks for me its not a big feature
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> im loosing it here. How is it even possible that a 27 ping plays like 80? How does one debug latency
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i didnt really had this with "feels like ping 80"
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> But on servers where my ping is actually closer to 28 (the real ping) instead of my normal ping of around (10-12ms) i also always thought it felt a bit differentMaybe the calculation is sensitive with smth like that
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but ddnet ping is always 8 + 20 \* closest\_value if stable
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but ddnet ping is always 8 + 20 \* closest\_value("uprounded") if stable
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: maybe the ping is very variable?
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have packet loss?
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you make a video of the fps drop? deen tried to reproduce the issue but couldn't :/
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> how d i measure?
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> how do i measure?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> It drives me nuts to feel how it behaves. But i feel it is pretty constant but also so suddle I mean i could not catch it with a camera or something \:D
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I wish i had another internet source to test to make sure im not crazy. But my mobile is even worse xd
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> watch the graph in ctrl-shift-d ctrl-shift g
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and your prediction time
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> when there are spikes regularly the prediction time will go up even though your ping is low
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/OpenTube/video.php?t=laggo.mp4&u=chiller
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i feel you can even see the sg being laggy
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but graphs look good
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i feel like i am trippin this xd
15:08 < l_jkjgkj> hey
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ñ•Î±âˆ‚â„“ÏƒÎ½Ñ”ðŸ–¤> @ChillerDragon.* send me this channel link to matrix pls
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i cant, it hhappens too random
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ñ•Î±âˆ‚â„“ÏƒÎ½Ñ”ðŸ–¤> Who can add an matrix channel but in general pls
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> It's not yet bridged, but I think we can consider bridging it soon. You can see all currently bridged rooms in the space [#ddnet\:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#ddnet:matrix.org)
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ñ•Î±âˆ‚â„“ÏƒÎ½Ñ”ðŸ–¤> Ok ty \:D
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @nuborn what is the IntraTick exactly? can i calculate it from the server, or at least getting close to it?
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> @fokkonaut its a fraction of a tick. for predintratick that is a fraction of one tick, and for gametick its a fraction of the difference between the current and previous tick (usually two ticks)
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh, okay
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> general bridged soon poggers
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> no u
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> the intraticks don't "exist" on the server btw, since intraticks are only used by the client to decide what to render between two ticks
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yep
