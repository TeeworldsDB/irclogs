00:00 <@deen> Moderate Tournament on Sunday!: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=530
00:03 < laxa> you wanna come to cologne 8th november deen ? :)
00:03 <@deen> nope
00:03 < laxa> little maggi is sad about that
00:03 <@deen> maggi?
00:03 < laxa> maggi323
00:04 <@deen> I thought you were meeting Anqel
00:04 < laxa> yeah
00:04 < laxa> but we will meet maggi in cologne
00:04 <@deen> ahaha, so this is what boratr was up to: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11126
00:04 < laxa> xD
00:05 < laxa> I didn't took much risk :)
00:06 <@deen> I just realized that the map for next Sunday is called SunDay 2
00:09 < laxa> I hate tournaments
00:10 < laxa> I am suppose to eat at 20:00
00:10 <@deen> haha
00:10 <@deen> that's way too late to eat!
00:10 < laxa> and my parents don't let me eat before
00:10 <@deen> we can't make it later =/
00:10 <@deen> everyone with their Monday activities..
00:10 < laxa> I know, germans eat at 18 or something
00:10 < laxa> yeah
00:10 < laxa> well
00:10 < laxa> I have to go to mcdo
00:10 < laxa> to make it to tournament
00:11 < Mikeli> laxa, i share your concerns
00:11 < Mikeli> we should make a union
00:11 < laxa> I am fucking 25
00:11 < laxa> and they don't let me live yet :(
00:11 < laxa> well, their stupid rules
00:13 <@deen> It's pretty logical though, you eat at 6, 12 and 18
00:13 < laxa> problem is
00:13 < laxa> you are hungry when you go to bed
00:13 < Mikeli> at 6???
00:13 < Mikeli> are you serious?
00:13 < laxa> Mikeli: it's german culture
00:14 < Mikeli> and here i was thinking i would emigrate to germany
00:14 < Mikeli> make it france instead
00:14 < Mikeli> jesus
00:14 < Mikeli> i wake up at 8.30 to go to work
00:14 < laxa> 6PM
00:14 < laxa> not 6AM
00:15 < laxa> but when you are a kid deen
00:15 < Mikeli> deen said  you eat at 6, 12 and 18
00:15 < laxa> oh right
00:15 <@deen> I have no idea if anyone does, I used to do that when i was in school^^
00:15 < laxa> when a kid you eat like that : 8 - 12 - 16 - 20
00:15 < laxa> in france at least
00:16 <@deen> always had to be out of the house at 6:30 =/
00:16 < laxa> but when getting older, you don't take the 16 anymore
00:16 <@deen> anyway, every Tournament time I choose is bad for someone
00:16 < laxa> I know that
00:16 < laxa> but I wanna make it to the tournament
00:17 < laxa> and it's annoying to pay 8 euros to play the tournament xD
00:17 <@deen> Chinese players could never even play in tournament
00:17 <@deen> it's at 4 am for them or something
00:17 < Mikeli> deen ofcourse. and the majority of players are ger, so it should cater them
00:18 <@deen> wrong
00:18 <@deen> even on the GER server less than 50% are from germany
00:18 <@deen> but it's the biggest minority
00:19 < Mikeli> technicalities :P
00:22 < ochristi> btw pause, laxadedi that dvorak symph (4th mov) has similar pattern as lotr 2 tower soundtrack #5 (ukuk-hai)
00:23 < laxa> link
00:23 < laxa> I'll look that tomorrow

17:02 <@deen> Nimda is a bit slow?
17:06 < laxadedi> Dunno, I don't have seconds
17:20 <@deen> So, HH FRA server seems to be working more stable now
17:20 <@EastByte> that's great I guess
17:20 <@deen> EastByte: what do we do with all the servers? Have you learned anything interesting?
17:21 <@deen> I guess website should be separate from gameservers
17:21 <@deen> so we keep GER and FRA, cancel Kimsufi and move the website to somewhere else?
17:21 <@EastByte> yep
17:22 <@deen> and where?
17:22 <@EastByte> what are the min resources for the website?
17:23 <@deen> no idea. not much?
17:23 <@deen> it should be part of the database network
17:23 <@deen> and needs to rebuild some of the website every 20 min
17:24 <@deen> forum and /players/ are dynamic
17:24 <@deen> I'd guess 1 core would be enough
17:24 <@EastByte> how about a cheap ovh classic vps
17:24 <@deen> the 2,40 one?
17:25 <@EastByte> yea
17:25 <@EastByte> oh well, rather not
17:25 <@deen> why not?
17:25 <@EastByte> the vcore seems to be really slow
17:25 <@deen> yes, it's openvz
17:26 <@EastByte> openvz doesn't matter
17:26 <@EastByte> but there seems to be limited cpu time
17:26 <@deen> i don't think I've ever seen a fast openvz server, but ok :P
17:26 <@EastByte> I mean python is a little bit too heavy for it
17:26 <@deen> wow
17:27 <@deen> guess i have to rewrite everything in nimrod!
17:27 <@EastByte> :D
17:27 <@EastByte> so, I still have two of them, want to test one?
17:27 <@deen> hm, no
17:28 <+o_be_one> <EastByte> the vcore seems to be really slow
17:28 <+o_be_one> true story
17:28 <+o_be_one> <deen> yes, it's openvz
17:28 <+o_be_one> no prob with that, no prob about core too
17:28 <@deen> I'm just thinking. still have 3 weeks until kimsufi runs out
17:28 <+o_be_one> you have same with all virtualisation, its not cause of openvz
17:28 <+o_be_one> (HH use OpenVZ ...)
17:28 <@deen> o_be_one: oh..
17:28 <+o_be_one> i use OpenVZ too for all my dedis
17:29 <+o_be_one> vCore is a shared core i think
17:29 <+o_be_one> hh offer only dedicated core, not vcore
17:29 <@deen> that explains why they crash all the time!
17:29 <+o_be_one> lool
17:29 <+o_be_one> serious you know OpenVZ :D ?
17:29 <+o_be_one> i think no ^^
17:30 <@EastByte> openvz has a bad reputation because it's oversold by the most hosters
17:31 <@EastByte> and why do they still stuck at 2.6.* kernel
17:31 <+o_be_one> thats what is amazing with OpenVZ, some people like me loves this technology, some other thinks that its the worst technology. All have an opinion about that
17:31 <@EastByte> matter of point of view
17:31 <@EastByte> from customer to hoster
17:31 <+o_be_one> but OpenVZ took all parts, docker switcher to openVZ too ... OpenVZ is powerful and fast
17:32 <+o_be_one> BUT its true, hosters are expansive idk why
17:32 <@EastByte> yea sure, their is no hardware virtualisation at all
17:32 <@EastByte> there*
17:32 <+o_be_one> like if it was hard to do vzctl create and other easy shells cmds -_-
17:32 <+o_be_one> with Proxmox its easy to do a cluster
17:33 <+o_be_one> yes for game hosting the "jail" or "chroot" system is the best
17:33 <+o_be_one> thats why ive choosed openVZ instead of vmware (by my school i have all vmware licenses)
17:34 <+o_be_one> And VMWare needs more attention and skills ...
17:35 <@deen> but i guess that's why HH had to update their kernel, some openvz vulnerability
17:38 <+o_be_one> maybe
17:39 <+o_be_one> ovh openvz when you have a problem : "hi my vps is not online but i can control it over ovh manager ..." "oh ive restarted your vps, it works now."
17:39 <+o_be_one> really guy ? why not ask or suggest to reboot instead of doing it -_- ... OVH support lvl : noob.
17:42 <@EastByte> well, as ovh supporter I also would get mad of all the kids buying virtual private servers these days
17:44 <@EastByte> like working in a telephone company for computers first aid
17:45 <+o_be_one> yeah sure :/
17:46 <+o_be_one> but when you havent something like that with ovh, you got same troubles like if you was noob
17:46 <+o_be_one> just you, you understand that ovh does shit.
17:48 <@EastByte> that's normal
17:48 <@EastByte> just buy a ovh professional instead
17:48 <@EastByte> support will be great I guess
17:57 <+o_be_one> EastByte, you realy think that :D ?
17:57 <+o_be_one> i've a Dedicated Cloud in Canada, 2000$/month -_-
17:57 <+o_be_one> already 2 times 1 node changed
17:58 <+o_be_one> the second time thay changed it, they forget to stop maintenancem ode
17:58 <+o_be_one> and it was a LVL 3 support action. Serious OVH ? 
17:58 <+o_be_one> so pro, sure :D

17:59 <+o_be_one> and just to let you know, dedicated cloud support is number one in theyr priority list ........
17:59 <@deen> Hm, what about hosting ddnet.tw on someone else's server?
17:59 <+o_be_one> so when you contact them, its only direct mail with answer in the 5 minutes, thats awesome but for miss some things like maintenance mode ... serious :D
18:00 <+o_be_one> deen, if he is ok to handle some ddos :D
18:00 <@deen> maybe laxa's ts.ddnet.tw / ddracepro.net one. he always wanted to host some ddnet stuff :P
18:02 <@deen> laxadedi: you have this one? http://www.online.net/en/dedicated-server/dedibox-scg2
18:06 < ochristi> they put the cpu of my toothbrush into servers nowadays?
18:11 <@deen> you can colocate your rasperry pi for free :P
18:12 < ochristi> edis does that, are there other hosters too?
18:12 <@deen> nope
18:12 <@deen> but i always had problems with edis
18:12 < ochristi> always, such as?
18:13 <@deen> had 2 russian and 2 chilean servers with them, had to shut them all down
18:13 <@deen> performance was terrible without kvm
18:13 <@deen> was laggy with kvm in Russia
18:13 <@deen> and in Chile they shut me down whenever I got 100 KB/s, and I had to restart server manually...
18:14 < ochristi> uhg, I got kvms there, not that many issues with service
18:14 <@deen> probably not in chile and russia^^
18:14 < ochristi> nah, mostly europe based, us and hk
18:15 <@deen> someone is paying for ddnet china every month, but i have no idea who it is
18:19 <@deen> hm, the ddnet.tw server is looking so bored. 4 cores doing nothing and 15 GB of free RAM
18:32 < laxa> deen: yeah I got that one
18:33 < Nimda> Kobra 3 Solo by Zerodin just released on Solo at 2014-10-17 15:58
19:12 <@deen> "just released" oops^^
19:24 < laxa> :p
19:24 < laxa> the time is displayed
19:24 < laxa> 15:58
19:24 <@deen> yes, i know. my mistake
19:24 <@EastByte> it just released, only 4 hours ago
19:58 < eeeee> doesn't "dedicated cloud" sound funny for you?
19:59 < eeeee> i mean the whole purpose of cloud is to be shared
19:59 < eeeee> to use resources more efficiently
19:59 < Learath2> eeeee: maybe its a cloud you can resell
20:00 < eeeee> does it matter if it's dedicated then?
20:00 < eeeee> whatever that actually means
20:01 < Learath2> well no idea what they are selling as dedicated cloud so cant really speculate
20:02 < eeeee> my bet they just sell some bullshit. must've figured out that everything sells better if you add a word "cloud" to it
20:03 < eeeee> e.g. instead of VPS you can sell "dedicated virtual private cloud server"
20:05 <@heinrich5991> selling a vps as dedicated server is quite a stretch
20:19 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/qQZRdg
20:19 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 d9b94a7 def: Fixed jungle_background (by 645654)
20:44 < laxa> ddos alert !
20:44 <@deen> shit
20:44 < laxa> well dunno
20:44 < laxa> that was short
20:44 < laxa> on GER
20:44 <@deen> yeah, but i saw 50 MB/s on GER
20:45 <@deen> so something is starting
20:55 <@deen> and stronger now
20:56 <@deen> 230 MB/s
20:57 <@deen> i think the network doesn't have problems at that level, but the irq handling gets too slow, which is why it gets laggy
20:58 <@deen> it's a bit difficult to get interrupts spread on all cores with kvm
20:59 <@deen> would need a dedicated machine with a good network card for that
21:01 <@deen> I'm looking at the tcpdump of one of these attacks, 70 MB in half a second^^
21:02 <@deen> ah, it's a dns amplification attack
21:02 <@deen> the old ones we always used to get
21:17 <@deen> ok, got the ddoser
21:18 <@deen> ....gg, connected over a Romanian server with nice connectivity
21:18 <@deen> https://www.voxility.com/shop/hosting/server
21:18 <@deen> 20 gbit/s
21:20 <@EastByte> how did you get him?
21:20 <@deen> he called a vote on server "f3 or server lags"
21:20 <@deen> i forced f4, and immediately next ddos
21:21 <@EastByte> so he plays using a 20gbit server and also does amplification with it?
21:21 <@deen> probably not
21:21 <@deen> the attacks are much smaller
21:21 <@deen> I'm just surprised they have 20 gbit/s servers
21:21 <@EastByte> but maybe he doesn't want use his full bandwidth
21:22 <@deen> hm, not a romanian server after all
21:23 <@deen> the company just works from romania
21:23 <@EastByte> ah
21:23 <@EastByte> hm, maybe you should try an abuse notification?
21:23 <@EastByte> with a tcpdump attached
21:24 <@deen> maybe i should buy a server at that company
21:24 <@deen> they sound really cool^^
21:24 <@EastByte> xd
21:24 <@deen> "Traffic should be less than 5TB/month, but you can upgrade to multiple 10Gbps ports and unlimited traffic anytime."
21:24 <@EastByte> so that's how we find servers now
21:24 <@deen> ping is better than to GER
21:24 <@EastByte> lol
21:24 <@deen> and they have ddos protection!
21:24 <@deen> (first server I've ever seen with better ping)
21:24 <@EastByte> sounds a little bit unrealistic
21:26 <@deen> 300 MB/s
21:28 <@EastByte> well an attack like this would be no problem for ovh
21:30 <@deen> for the pro protection of ovh*
21:30 <@deen> which we should have now at FRA
21:31 <@EastByte> yea
21:31 <@deen> can you see any prizes on voxility.com?
21:31 <@deen> it just says "login per month" for me^^
21:31 <@EastByte> well I gave up search after 10 seconds
21:32 <@deen> they're probably way too expensive
21:32 <@EastByte> I guess
21:32 <@deen> with stuff like 800 € ddos protection
21:33 <@deen> at least GER didn't go down
21:36 <@EastByte> hm, if the irq handler is getting slow
21:36 <@EastByte> it would be atleast nice to set up firewall rules on the host system
21:37 <@deen> the guy said he will stop the attacks and come on irc next time he's unhappy^^
21:37 <@deen> EastByte: i have firewall rules for that, they blocked 70 GB
21:38 <@deen> but the kernel still needs to handle every single packet and that's what gets slow
21:38 <@EastByte> the kvm kernel?
21:38 <@deen> because it can only be done efficiently on 1 core
21:38 <@deen> if you want to use all cores, you need to spread them using software, which is expensive
21:38 <@EastByte> hmm yea right
21:38 <@deen> (or get a good dedicated server)
21:42 <@deen> well, voxility doesn't even sell to normal people
21:43 <@deen> https://www.voxility.com/login#register
21:44 <@EastByte> well, you are an it expert and hosting a large website/community :D
21:44 <@deen> haha, i'm currently signing up just to see what happens :P
21:44 <@EastByte> :)
21:45 <@EastByte> would be nice to have such a hoster only for ddnet
21:46 <@deen> " Initial registration is complete.
21:46 <@deen> We are checking now in the background if your business profile fits ours. "
21:46 <@EastByte> so did you provide any informatin?
21:46 <@EastByte> information*
21:46 <@deen> mail address, website of my "company"
21:47 <@EastByte> ah
21:47 <@deen> shit, chile under attack
21:48 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
21:49 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
21:59 <@deen> EastByte: i agree, some sponsor like that would be nice
22:00 <@deen> I don't know how they got an ISP in South Africa to host us
22:00 <@EastByte> hmm
22:25 <+o_be_one> guys i've a OnePlus One invitation if someone needs.
22:25 <@EastByte> what's that?
22:29 <+o_be_one> smartphone Flagship Killer :p
22:30 <+o_be_one> one of the best smartphone in the world at this time, with all flagships like Samsung Galaxy S5, iPhone 6, etc.
22:30 <+o_be_one> but ... At only 350$ for 64go model :p
22:34 < XXLTomate> a friend of mine hase it too, it's really great
22:34 < XXLTomate> -e

22:48 <@deen> hi
22:49 < Paszczak> so
22:49 <@deen> Paszczak: it's probably the same license as teeworlds and ddrace
22:49 <@deen> i didn't think anyone would want to sell ddnet :P
22:49 <@deen> This should be the license: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/license.txt
22:49 < Paszczak> ddnet no
22:49 <@deen> what's your plan?
22:50 < Paszczak> but ive added nice functions
22:51 <@deen> Paszczak: I'd prefer if you make a pull request and we get these features in regular ddnet :P
22:51 <@deen> EastByte: "Your registration on Voxility's website was approved and you can now review prices and place orders."
22:51 < Paszczak> yeah
22:51 < Paszczak> where is it ?
22:51 < Paszczak> or should i send an email
22:51 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet

23:02 < Paszczak> dont lie
23:03 <@deen> hm, then what do you want?
23:03 < Paszczak> i wanted to know what is about license
23:03 < Paszczak> and thats all
23:03 <@deen> yes, but you wrote a bot and are planning to sell it, right?
23:03 < Paszczak> nope
23:03 < Paszczak> one guy
23:03 < Paszczak> is asking me
23:04 <@deen> I'm strongly against it
23:04 < Paszczak> btw im too
23:04 <@deen> and if i see anyone using bots on my server, they get kicked
23:04 < Paszczak> but flying doesnt help a lot
23:04 <@deen> on some maps it does
23:04 < Paszczak> you mean race
23:04 < Paszczak> yeah
23:04 < Paszczak> but im playing on blocker xd
23:04 <@deen> yes, ddnet is a ddrace mod
23:05 < Paszczak> and btw when i found this client i wanted to say to you GJ
23:05 <@EastByte> everything bad comes from blocker

23:23 <@deen> virtio iirc
23:23 <@deen> at least GER didn't go down today!
23:24 < eeeee> can you try asking the hoster to drop all dns?
23:24 <@deen> i did, he says "no"
