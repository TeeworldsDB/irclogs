00:08 < bridge> <louis> you have a windows computer?
00:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i wouldnt be surprised if he dualboots
00:49 < bridge> <Ewan> most linux users do have it just in case
00:50 < bridge> <Ewan> some real life stuff comes up and they have to put their OSS ideologies aside
01:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> yup - i have windows for solidworks and cubase (and some games i cba to download twice :kekw:)

02:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> perfection
02:48 < bridge> <totar> should say C
03:03 < bridge> <Ewan> there is merit to this
03:03 < bridge> <Ewan> even if it’s a meme
03:04 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s only one of the most mature documented languages ever…
03:46 < bridge> <_kemel_> day 2
03:46 < bridge> <_kemel_> 
03:46 < bridge> <_kemel_> how can I find hammer's hitbox or range implementation in source?
03:46 < bridge> <_kemel_> 
03:46 < bridge> <_kemel_> i've been digging it for 2 or 3 hours but can't seem to find anything related, someone also been posting here hitbox skins but that not a thing I want to make (toggle)
03:46 < bridge> <_kemel_> 
03:46 < bridge> <_kemel_> can they be stored in some local files?
03:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> first
03:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> server or client code
03:47 < bridge> <_kemel_> client
03:47 < bridge> <_kemel_> just a range I can use in all servers and draw it on toggle
03:49 < bridge> <_kemel_> I also mean not the server's exact range, the ones used in ddnet, kog etc.
03:49 < bridge> <_kemel_> doesnt matter if server has another hitboxes, I need only default ones used in popular serverss
03:49 < bridge> <_kemel_> I also mean not the server's exact range, the ones used in ddnet, kog etc.
03:49 < bridge> <_kemel_> doesnt matter if server has another hitboxes, I need only default ones used in popular servers
03:49 < bridge> <_kemel_> I also mean not the server's exact range, but the ones used in ddnet, kog etc.
03:49 < bridge> <_kemel_> doesnt matter if server has another hitboxes, I need only default ones used in popular servers
03:49 < bridge> <_kemel_> I think ddnet and similar use default value?
03:49 < bridge> <jxsl13> I haven't looked at client code at all, but my guess is that you will at most have prediction code on the client side that emulates the server's behavior, because the server should(tm) tell the client when it's actually  a hit.
03:51 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L478
03:51 < bridge> <jxsl13> might be this here
03:53 < bridge> <_kemel_> quite don't get it, I'll look up but I dont understand the assumption
03:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> the server is the truth
03:53 < bridge> <_kemel_> can I get the hammer range hitbox without using direct reference to it?
03:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> a client just executes what the server tell it to do
03:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> a client just executes what the server tells it to do
03:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> what do you mean by "direct reference"?
03:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> client side prediction: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/prediction/entities/character.cpp#L308
03:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> gotta find out what m_ProximityRadius is set to
03:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> and then *0.5
03:55 < bridge> <_kemel_> yea I bumped up into it
03:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> might be a static value
03:56 < bridge> <_kemel_> the only thing I could think of is m_ProximityRadius * 0.5f  but thats pretty implicit
03:56 < bridge> <_kemel_> I have this thing rn
03:56 < bridge> <_kemel_> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1286868670093721691/2C1D6F17-B285-4982-88F2-8950AE0E3519.png?ex=66ef7957&is=66ee27d7&hm=6e86bf000e927d22a85348c1b41fbae2a2f35fb413bae753c5df20b0c0e567b5&
03:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> th einteresting part is that the code says radius, so it's a circle and not a box that you want.
03:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> the interesting part is that the code says radius, so it's a circle and not a box that you want.
03:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> that is the radius around your tee
03:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> ProjStartPos probably the character's center
03:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> = center of your tee
03:58 < bridge> <_kemel_> p much I dont care whatever it is, I just need the values that I can do something with
03:58 < bridge> <_kemel_> p much I dont care whatever it is, I just need the exact values that I can do something with
03:59 < bridge> <_kemel_> I also think I should look at hook collision
03:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> guess that depend son where your code modifications are
03:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> guess that depends on where your code modifications are
03:59 < bridge> <_kemel_> so I have the main idea of it's working
03:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> and how to access those character values from the location where you do your modifications
04:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> what cpp file you currently modifying?
04:01 < bridge> <_kemel_> menus_settings.cpp
04:01 < bridge> <_kemel_> 
04:01 < bridge> <_kemel_> with a help of tater client source I got the main idea how to create menu and save custom configs
04:01 < bridge> <_kemel_> 
04:01 < bridge> <_kemel_> ```cpp
04:01 < bridge> <_kemel_> void CMenus::RenderSettingsHitbox(CUIRect MainView)
04:01 < bridge> <_kemel_> {
04:01 < bridge> <_kemel_>     CUIRect Column, Section;
04:01 < bridge> <_kemel_>     const float LineMargin = 20.0f;
04:01 < bridge> <_kemel_> 
04:01 < bridge> <_kemel_>     MainView.VSplitLeft(MainView.w * 0.5, &MainView, &Column);
04:01 < bridge> <_kemel_> 
04:01 < bridge> <_kemel_>     MainView.HSplitTop(30.0f, &Section, &MainView);
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_>     Ui()->DoLabel(&Section, ("Hitbox"), 20.0f, TEXTALIGN_LEFT);
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_>     MainView.VSplitLeft(5.0f, 0x0, &MainView);
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_>     MainView.HSplitTop(5.0f, 0x0, &MainView);
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_> 
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_>     DoButton_CheckBoxAutoVMarginAndSet(&g_Config.m_ClHammerHitbox, ("Hammer"), &g_Config.m_ClHammerHitbox, &MainView, LineMargin);
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_>     DoButton_CheckBoxAutoVMarginAndSet(&g_Config.m_ClHookHitbox, ("Hook"), &g_Config.m_ClHookHitbox, &MainView, LineMargin);
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_>     DoButton_CheckBoxAutoVMarginAndSet(&g_Config.m_ClTeeHitbox, ("Tee"), &g_Config.m_ClTeeHitbox, &MainView, LineMargin);
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_>     {
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_>         CUIRect Button, Label;
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_>         MainView.HSplitTop(20.0f, &Button, &MainView);
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_>         Button.VSplitLeft(140.0f, &Label, &Button);
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_>     }
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_>     {
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_>         CUIRect Button, Label;
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_>         MainView.HSplitTop(20.0f, &Button, &MainView);
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_>         Button.VSplitLeft(140.0f, &Label, &Button);
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_>     }
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_>     {
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_> but the functions of course are located in other files
04:02 < bridge> <_kemel_> and I'm trying to find out things
04:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> if you want static values, add a debug_msg in the client code that I pointed you too and see how that value behaves when you hit other player on some server
04:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> if it's static (I'd guess), you can just hardcode thos evalues in your settings rendering
04:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> if it's static (I'd guess), you can just hardcode those values in your settings rendering
04:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> ```
04:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> entity.h
04:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> /*
04:05 < bridge> <jxsl13>         Variable: m_ProximityRadius
04:05 < bridge> <jxsl13>             Contains the physical size of the entity.
04:05 < bridge> <jxsl13>     */
04:05 < bridge> <jxsl13>     float m_ProximityRadius;
04:06 < bridge> <jxsl13> ```
04:06 < bridge> <jxsl13> cuz character is inheriting from entity, it's probably the size of the character, but let me dig a littl ebit
04:07 < bridge> <jxsl13> initialized here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/b34edb64c0a20373214bdc28d666ba445f43263d/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L27C61-L28C2
04:07 < bridge> <jxsl13> with a static class value
04:09 < bridge> <_kemel_> ok thanks, I'll figure it out and get back if anything works out
04:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> you can simply use the static variable CCharacterCore::PhysicalSize()
04:10 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/b34edb64c0a20373214bdc28d666ba445f43263d/src/game/gamecore.h#L181
04:10 < bridge> <jxsl13> it's 28.0f
04:10 < bridge> <jxsl13> but I'd use the static value
04:10 < bridge> <jxsl13> as is used everywhere throughout the code
04:11 < bridge> <jxsl13> `CCharacterCore::PhysicalSize()`
04:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> you can simply use the static ~~variable~~function CCharacterCore::PhysicalSize()
04:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> you can simply use the static ~~variable~~ function CCharacterCore::PhysicalSize()
07:02 < bridge> <Ewan> just reread this. super based cubase
07:11 < bridge> <Ewan> cubased perhaps
07:12 < bridge> <Ewan> WTF man
07:12 < bridge> <Ewan> make an NTFS partition and put your games on there
07:12 < bridge> <Ewan> or btrfs + winbtrfs if you’re feeling risky
07:12 < bridge> <Ewan> then u can have all games only one time
08:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> github display bug? wot
08:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1726900883.png
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> weird
08:57 < bridge> <totar> where is the bug
08:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> There's no tab in IsStatTrack return line?
08:59 < bridge> <totar> oh true
09:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Also, syntax highlighting didn't work for me on GitHub for a last week
09:51 < bridge> <3x1st_> someone can say me where  is this '2024-09-21 10:49:21 I' in ddnet client source? i want delete it.
09:57 < bridge> <Ewan> Why would you expect to find a random time & date in the ddnet source
09:57 < bridge> <Ewan> What is the issue you’re facing
09:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Maybe it's log time :thonk:
10:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @3x1st_ https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/b34edb64c0a20373214bdc28d666ba445f43263d/src/base/log.cpp#L101
10:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``	Msg.m_aTimestamp[0] = 0;`` to delete it
10:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you care about the ``I`` part thats here 
10:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/b34edb64c0a20373214bdc28d666ba445f43263d/src/base/log.cpp#L107
10:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can change ``"EWIDT"[level]`` to ``""`` and its gone
12:17 < bridge> <3x1st_> thanks
13:19 < bridge> <alw5> variables operators and statements  in config files when
13:30 < bridge> <zhn> never

13:54 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1287019101935636500/image.png?ex=66f00571&is=66eeb3f1&hm=3fc30196aec6c90e503956854b5bca92bc482598367854b33c4f4f28917bb9e5&
13:54 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> is this allowed
13:56 < bridge> <manikoo> why no
14:02 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> @manikoo because it looks like a official server. Its basically impersonation. And might cause confusion for the players that did not get their ranks saved.
14:03 < bridge> <manikoo> as i know official servers have a mark
14:03 < bridge> <manikoo> but ok
14:03 < bridge> <manikoo> i got u
14:04 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> yes and this one doesn't but not every Linear enjoyer might understand that xd
14:05 < bridge> <chairn> no, it's not
14:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:banhammer:392813948858269696>
14:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean the master is ddnet controlled it could just do a string substitution for fakes :D and prefix it with [UNOFFICIAL] 
14:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> automatic one ofc
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> any1 wants to write me some code? xd
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i need to count the amount of different ips connected to the server
14:21 < bridge> <01000111g> `print(len(ip_list))` np
14:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thank
14:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if it was a high level scripting language i would probably use hash maps but i dont wanna use them in C++ somehow. And my naive idea would be a nested for loop.
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> ? Why
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat why
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> Unordered map is good enough
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye is it?
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> why not lmao
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its C++
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> Yes
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> ?
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I prefer not using the evil ``::``
14:41 < bridge> <teero777> C++ is high level
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea i guess
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> next up ill be using ``std::string``
14:42 < bridge> <omar_05826> лоюяож\
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> woah ``std::map`` is uses all over ddnet codebase
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or is undorder map something else?
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh there is also ``std::unordered_map`` 
14:45 < bridge> <zhn> unorderer_map faster then map, but map has some constraints that i don't remember
14:49 < bridge> <teero777> ```cpp
14:49 < bridge> <teero777> std::unordered_map<std::string, int> map;
14:49 < bridge> <teero777> for(auto &Player : vPlayers)
14:49 < bridge> <teero777>                 map[Player.m_IP] = 1;
14:49 < bridge> <teero777> printf("%zu", map.size());
14:49 < bridge> <teero777> ```
14:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> unordered map is a hashmap, map is a red-black tree
14:49 < bridge> <teero777> Coding on phone is trash
14:49 < bridge> <teero777> Here's your pseudocode
14:49 < bridge> <manikoo> teero really write it on phone
14:49 < bridge> <manikoo> :gigachad:
14:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you'd probably use an `unordered_set` for that
14:50 < bridge> <teero777> true i forgor
14:50 < bridge> <teero777> true i forgot
15:05 < bridge> <animepdf> no, report their ip to heinrich
15:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea i rly dont wanna do C++ so i went with the for loop xd
15:18 < bridge> <jxsl13> avoiding stdlib
15:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea
15:19 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ok
15:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> C++ makes me nervous
15:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I never know how fast it is. How and where it allocates memory.
15:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> And the syntax is really ugly. And also its so much harder to read and write because its more complex than C.
15:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Also its infectious. Once you add C++ it depends on further C++ to work.
15:20 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> @heinrich5991 id like to report the server 45.90.218.105:8303 for faking official ddnet servers as you can see in this screenshot
15:20 < bridge> <DDNet> 45.90.218.105:8303 is not a DDraceNetwork or Community server.
15:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> snitch @cyberfrighter 
15:21 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> did you just delete your message
15:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> it is indeed ugly but you can try to not make it ugly
15:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> me?
15:21 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> Yes
15:21 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> can webhooks do that?
15:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am on irc there is no delete
15:21 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> Uh oh
15:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it was deleted by heinrich because it was an insult
15:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> looks like there is a aimbotter on 176.9.114.238:8220 name: ChillerDragon
15:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @fngmods
15:59 < bridge> <headshotnoby> xd sure chillerbot.png is lyfe
16:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok nvm the kick vote passed
16:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> crazy that it took multiple tries on such obvious aimbot for a top scorer with the clantag BOT xd
16:03 < bridge> <headshotnoby> [rus4] -ChillerDragon- has left the game (You have been banned for 3000 minutes (version 20000))
16:03 < bridge> <headshotnoby> :think_bot:
16:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean there are 70 servers this boi is just traveling xd
16:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao two botters stealing each others kills. Do the ddnet fng servers have no antibot? Last time i saw such shameless botting was 10 years ago on BlmapV3 xd
16:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i understand why the kick votes are not passing. Its because there are more botters than non botters xd
16:48 < bridge> <APFFF> How does the `Exclude `work in the Server List
16:48 < bridge> <APFFF> How does the `Exclude` work in the Server List. Is it a Regex?
16:48 < bridge> <APFFF> Because I'd like several words
16:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so semicolon ``;`` to split words
16:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> use*
16:54 < bridge> <APFFF> thx
17:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: i finally got all of the bitwise operators needed to implement packer xd
17:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> :poggers2:
17:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> can't wait for your language to his v0.0.1 stage
17:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> there won't be v0.0.1, first true version has to be `v69.42.0`
17:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> also i updated the banner for repo
17:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> tru tru tru
17:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/meraki
17:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 also cast expressions were pain in the ass, so now it's `as` keyword xd
17:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> basically everything is yoinked from rust
17:54 < bridge> <learath2> basically rust with a tinge of C and incomplete
17:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it would be so cool to add macros and imports 😬
17:56 < bridge> <learath2> Use the C preprocessor, much easier to yoink someone elses work 😄
17:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that's easy way
17:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> we don't choose those
18:08 < bridge> <teero777> Can I make a grammar readme pr
18:09 < bridge> <zhn> :kek:
18:10 < bridge> <zhn> i don't really think you need to know this in terms of ddnet development
18:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> i'd say its decently important to know how c++ handles memory when coding anything in it :oop:
18:13 < bridge> <zhn> yeah but if you are writing cpp then you know how cpp works
18:13 < bridge> <meloƞ> you can write functional programs without using a single pointer
18:13 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, don't use ranges though
18:14 < bridge> <zhn> i mean its basic thing to know, if you want to write c, don't use cpp
18:14 < bridge> <zhn> and vice versa
18:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> yeah i get that
18:16 < bridge> <teero777> streams are the thing that draws me too c++ instead of c
18:16 < bridge> <teero777> on everything else I would prefer c
18:17 < bridge> <teero777> Handling files is so much easier with streams
18:17 < bridge> <zhn> im missing templates and generics on c so much
18:17 < bridge> <zhn> the only reason to use ccp instead id say
18:17 < bridge> <zhn> cpp
18:17 < bridge> <teero777> use macros xd
18:18 < bridge> <teero777> /s
18:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> yeah i can tell you like your templates....
18:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> **cries in having to understand 300 boilerplate functions reading your code**
18:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> no hate tho - love you!
18:18 < bridge> <zhn> u would have to read 3000 otherwise
18:19 < bridge> <zhn> also i just reimplemented existing json wrapper so its useless actually

18:19 < bridge> <teero777> json parser and builder exists in c
18:19 < bridge> <zhn> we saw that :troll:
18:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> :xd:
18:20 < bridge> <zhn> btw nlohmanns implementation is quite faster afair
18:20 < bridge> <zhn> but it would compile for a day :justatest:
18:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> i planned on using nlohmanns json iirc
18:28 < bridge> <Ewan> do not take static initialization & automatic de/serialization for granted
19:01 < bridge> <learath2> Funnily enough streams are probably one of my least favourite things about C++
19:01 < bridge> <teero777> what happened
19:01 < bridge> <learath2> Idk, I just don't like that form of I/O
19:02 < bridge> <teero777> what would be the better way?
19:02 < bridge> <zhn> arent cpp streams slowest kind of io processing :justatest:
19:02 < bridge> <learath2> I like C style IO with `printf`/`scanf`/`puts`
19:03 < bridge> <teero777> It's okay
19:03 < bridge> <learath2> They are not that bad(tm)
19:04 < bridge> <learath2> I'm a big fan of C++20 `std::format`
19:04 < bridge> <learath2> Any new C++ I write uses those

20:05 < bridge> <lukron55> when trying to build ddnet for a server|
20:05 < bridge> <lukron55> Raspian OS Lite
20:05 < bridge> <lukron55> PI 4 4GB
20:06 < bridge> <robyt3> You are compiling the client though. Set `CLIENT=OFF` in cmake so the client is not built, or install the dependencies for the client
20:07 < bridge> <lukron55> so 
20:07 < bridge> <lukron55> cmake CLIENT=OFF ..
20:07 < bridge> <reitw> -DCLIENT=OFF
20:08 < bridge> <lukron55> wait it built in like a second when I did that, is that normal?
20:08 < bridge> <reitw> it doesn't build the client
20:08 < bridge> <reitw> so obv
20:08 < bridge> <reitw> so obv takes less time
20:11 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe you only reconfigured but didn't build yet. Which commands are you running to build?
20:19 < bridge> <lukron55> ```
20:19 < bridge> <lukron55>  cmake -DCLIENT=OFF ..
20:19 < bridge> <lukron55> $ make -j$(nproc)
20:19 < bridge> <lukron55> ```
20:19 < bridge> <lukron55> ```
20:19 < bridge> <lukron55>  cmake -DCLIENT=OFF ..
20:19 < bridge> <lukron55>  make -j$(nproc)
20:19 < bridge> <lukron55> ```
20:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> the server is built before the client
20:19 < bridge> <reitw> if u already built before I think it doesn't build entirely again
20:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> that's why - the server was already built
20:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> that's why - the server was already built (and failed on the client which you now turned off)
20:20 < bridge> <robyt3> You should probably use `-j4` instead of `-j$(nproc)` as the latter effectively fork bombs your system
20:21 < bridge> <robyt3> NVM, I think that was `-j` that starts as many processes as possible
20:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> IIRC the command `cmake --build . -j` will equal to -j$(nproc)
20:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> while `make -j` will eqaul `-j1`
20:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> IIRC the command `cmake --build . -j` will equal to -j$(nproc)
20:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> while `make -j` will equal `-j1`
20:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> IIRC the command `cmake --build . -j` will equal -j$(nproc)
20:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> while `make -j` will equal `-j1`
20:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> (i may be confusing it tho)
20:22 < bridge> <robyt3> `make -j` starts unlimited processes for me
20:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
20:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> 5.4 Parallel Execution
20:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
20:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> GNU make knows how to execute several recipes at once. Normally, make will execute only one recipe at a time, waiting for it to finish before executing the next. However, the ‘-j’ or ‘--jobs’ option tells make to execute many recipes simultaneously.
20:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
20:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
20:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> TiL
20:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> so yes, just -j can hurt weaker pc's
20:27 < bridge> <lukron55> im getting mixed signals
20:27 < bridge> <robyt3> Does the server executable exist now?
20:27 < bridge> <lukron55> one sec
20:32 < bridge> <lukron55> yeah it does
20:33 < bridge> <lukron55> where should i gitclone the ddnet-maps git?
20:33 < bridge> <lukron55> and also is it worth setting up a myServerconfig.cfg?
20:33 < bridge> <lukron55> its purely just a server for me and my mates
20:42 < bridge> <Ewan> now im curious
20:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> my friend is also curious
20:46 < bridge> <lukron55> ?
20:48 < bridge> <Ewan> maps folder
20:48 < bridge> <Ewan> and depends on what you wanna do
20:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> maps can go in your generated maps folder under `build/data/maps` or your local ddnet folder (if one exists, no idea since you didnt build the client) under `~/.local/share/ddnet/maps`
20:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
20:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> the myServerconfig.cfg is a useful way to "backup" your settings - the myServerconfig may be overwritten if you update it
20:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> maps can go in your generated maps folder under `build/data/maps` or your local ddnet folder (if one exists, no idea since you didnt build the client) under `~/.local/share/ddnet/maps`
20:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
20:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> the myServerconfig.cfg is a useful way to "backup" your settings - the generated config may be overwritten if you update it
20:50 < bridge> <lukron55> so if i delete the ones currently there, and git clone the ddnet-maps that should work?
20:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> yup, just make sure to do  `mv ddnet-maps maps` (change it's name)
20:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> i think there even is a tutorial on the ddnet-maps github repo?
20:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> ah well that might even be the best option
20:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
20:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
20:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> All official DDNet maps, ready to be run in your own server! Simply download this repository, add your DDNet-Server binary (distributed together with the DDNet client) and start the server. You can change the settings in autoexec_server.cfg
20:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
20:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> since then there is no way you loose your maps at any time
20:52 < bridge> <lukron55> what does that mean? add you binary?
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> your ddnet executable
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> your ddnet server executable
20:53 < bridge> <lukron55> oh yeah
20:58 < bridge> <zhn> im horny 24/7, i don't pay attention id say :owo:
20:58 < bridge> <zhn> later
21:21 < bridge> <ar1gin> how are you guys working with such backgrounds, I find it too distracting if its not blurred or just a solid color :nouis:

21:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> Aahhahahaha
21:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://notgull.net/announcing-dozer/
21:54 < bridge> <animepdf> Is there a command to disable records saving at all, I have few main servers and few test servers, I want to disable finishing on them
21:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I believe `sv_test_cmds 1` disables records
21:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah no, maybe it doesn't
21:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sur
21:55 < bridge> <animepdf> I think records with test commands used while run will not count
21:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> otherwise you could set up a different DB
21:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> simply using sqlite3 with a different filename should work
21:57 < bridge> <animepdf> okay, will try this workaround, thanks
21:58 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i think it does
21:58 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> unless it was changed not long ago
22:00 < bridge> <learath2> I’m unsure how much of what they are talking about can be considered an API, especially since most of it is completely private stuff
22:03 < bridge> <learath2> This is why I feel rust for linux is having so many problems. Rust’s type system pretty much requires everything to be properly thought out, while these internal private pieces are everchanging and just evolve to cater to their downstream users. Rather than the downstream users figuring out a way to make it work
22:15 < bridge> <teero777> solid black for me xd
22:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmmm. I'd think internal APIs are still APIs and it's nice when you know whether you need a held lock or whether the function takes ownership
22:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmmm. I'd think for internal APIs it's still nice when you know whether you need a held lock or whether the function takes ownership
22:16 < bridge> <learath2> Definitely nice, but I can see why it would be really annoying having to commit to an interface in private APIs
22:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why commit? you can change it any time (just like before), and on the rust side, you'll even get compiler help to find the places that need changes
22:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> rust-based fish imminent: https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10633
