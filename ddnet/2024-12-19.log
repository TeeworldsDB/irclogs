02:17 < bridge> <totar> Can someone explain why this fails ASan?

02:17 < bridge> <totar> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/compare/master...sjrc6:TaterClient-ddnet:why_is_copyworld>
02:22 < bridge> <totar> this makes it a lot harder to do work on antiping smoothing
02:41 < bridge> <pioooooo> https://github.com/sjrc6/TaterClient-ddnet/blob/why_is_copyworld/src%2Fgame%2Fclient%2Fprediction%2Fgameworld.cpp#L588
02:42 < bridge> <pioooooo> Copy isn't actually copying :kek:
02:42 < bridge> <totar> that doesn't return early idk what you mean
02:43 < bridge> <totar> it does copy
02:53 < bridge> <totar> the issue seems to be that ``CGameWorld::RemoveEntity`` does not check for IsValidCopy before doing ``pEnt->m_pParent->m_pChild = nullptr;``
02:56 < bridge> <pioooooo> I consider copy should be somewhat like clone and doesn't interfere the clone and original object
02:56 < bridge> <pioooooo> Anyway you found the cause
02:57 < bridge> <totar> yeah I made a new CopyWorldClean function to sidestep this
02:58 < bridge> <pioooooo> Btw I tried to teach others who want to use your client
02:59 < bridge> <pioooooo> But failed because they don't know where is the download folder
02:59 < bridge> <pioooooo> Btw I tried to teach others who want to use your client this morning (UTC+8)
03:00 < bridge> <totar> :kek:
03:00 < bridge> <totar> how did they install steam
03:01 < bridge> <pioooooo> :kek: through their ex I'd guess
05:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @pioooooo oh hello fellow utc+8 enjoyer
05:50 < bridge> <pioooooo> ChillerDragon Hi Chiller, though I am about to sleep :zzzz:
06:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wtf
06:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it is quite common now that you have to teach an adult to extract zip :justatest:
06:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i've seen interns graduated from CS who don't know how to operate explorer let alone terminals
06:40 < bridge> <totar> I've never met one of those people somehow
06:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if someone don't play PC game there is a solid chance that they've never used a computer i think.
06:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if someone doesn't play PC game there is a solid chance that they've never used a computer i think.
07:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> Really? A friend of mine who I've been working with for 4 years now didn't know how to list a file tree under Linux, he's been a software engineer at my firm for ~6 years.
07:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> But to be fair, he develops in visual studio, has never used Linux (windows exclusively) and he had his entire dev setup by someone else.
07:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
07:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> I might ask him later if he knows how to add things to PATH :greenthing:
07:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> > didn't know how to list a file tree under Linux
07:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 
07:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> well i think that should be expected really...
07:38 < bridge> <Ewan> tree isn’t even installed by default on many distros
07:38 < bridge> <totar> not knowing how to use an OS you never use and not knowing how to use the OS you use every day are completely different things.
07:41 < bridge> <totar> the important part is also not even having anything memorized, if someone tells you "find the file in your download folder" and you can't do it even with google then you're pretty clueless.
07:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i still remember the days where people freaks out because "My Computer" is no longer visible on the desktop.
07:55 < bridge> <Ewan> that was annoying to get used to
08:20 < bridge> <totar> I don't remember what My Computer did
08:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> its just a desktop shortcut of file explorer i think
08:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> well im pretty sure it is that actually:justatest:
08:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> before they put everything into a single file explorer there was My Computer and Network Neighborhood iirc. so just two file explorers one for local one for remote
08:54 < bridge> <learath2> I had a friend defend this situation to me, trying to convince me that someone who doesn’t know what a terminal is can be a good hire
08:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i could see people arguing that it don't really matter but idk about it being a GOOD hire
08:56 < bridge> <learath2> I can use chatgpt myself. I don’t need no fresh graduate
08:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it like my dad keep saying that he's a lot better than me even though he doesn't finish highschool and told me i should only hire people without a degree.
08:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it like my dad keep saying that he's a lot better than me even though he didnt finish highschool and told me i should only hire people without a degree.
08:58 < bridge> <learath2> We were talking about software developers btw. Ofc it won’t matter if my accountant doesn’t know what a terminal is
08:59 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> lol
08:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> well ofc
08:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> again, i can see dropout being good at something but saying having a degree is worse is wacky
08:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't like midlife crisis dad :greenthing:
09:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i want my normal dad back
09:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i've noticed a pattern recently, as soon as my dad sees me coding he will stare at my screen pretend to know what im doing and when i ask does he need anything he'll just say "doesn't look too complicated, i can do this too if i try, i just don't feel like it"
09:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's like talking to teenage boy with too much self-esteem :justatest:
09:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> > doesn't look too complicated, i can do this too if i try
09:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> basically me about any new project idea xd
09:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> xd
09:07 < bridge> <motkote> somebody help, why command dbg_dummies dont work???
09:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it only works if you build the server yourself with debug mode, and the sever dummies won't do anything, they are for debugging.
09:09 < bridge> <totar> there are probably hundreds of web developers making 6 figures who never use a terminal at their job even once. So I don't think he is really wrong.
09:10 < bridge> <motkote> and how do I enable debugging mode on my server?
09:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> not even `npm run dev` ¿
09:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kekw:
09:10 < bridge> <totar> alright true
09:10 < bridge> <totar> idk how you avoid it xd
09:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> well you can if you only develop static html or js only frontend with plain js and you test it with double clicking the html and use a cors bypass extension
09:12 < bridge> <totar> or you have a hotkey that launches your project
09:12 < bridge> <totar> that someone else setup for you
09:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> even then vscode just opens up a terminal when you do that i think? so at least they've SEEN one
09:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> or they are just using devin
09:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :greenthing:
09:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> devin is here to save web dev
09:13 < bridge> <totar> I guess to be a good web developer you also must know about the browser javascript console
09:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> mod4+shift+lctrl+kp_5 to launch ddnet in vsc :greenthing:
09:14 < bridge> <totar> why so many buttons :justatest:
09:14 < bridge> <totar> every function key is taken?
09:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> melon be using 25% keyboard
09:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> Every keybind that launches something is bound to at least 2 modifier keys, I have fat fingers
09:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> how fat your finger is that you could just hit a f5 that far up above
09:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> I died mid run 3 days ago because I accidentally launched Firefox while playing, Firefox is Ctrl+shift+alt+f <a:AquaTriggered:855153345781956640>
09:16 < bridge> <totar> can someone explain the appeal of using a low% keyboard as a developer. I thought the whole point of the small keyboards was to get extra desk space for your mouse to be closer to your left hand.
09:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> save hand movement actually
09:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> Are you a left hand mouse user???
09:16 < bridge> <totar> no
09:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cuts down a lot of reaching and finger extensions
09:16 < bridge> <totar> but the buttons aren't more dense?
09:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye but i don't need to reach for function rows or numbers
09:17 < bridge> <totar> "save hand movement" -> "press 4 keys to launch your project instead of 1"
09:17 < bridge> <totar> nice
09:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> hand movment, not finger strength
09:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> These minimalistic keyboards are annoying to me personally, it's rare but I do need a keypad and f1-f12 keys, and I don't want to press something like fn+1 to actually press f1
09:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> I use a 100% keyboard
09:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like saves your arms and wrist
09:18 < bridge> <motkote> how do I enable debugging mode on my server?
09:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> Get a split keyboard 💥
09:19 < bridge> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319217551959654430/safetype_safetype_vertical_keyboard_p1_800x566.jpg?ex=67652896&is=6763d716&hm=763628c7ffa539fbb3800870660d2730012fb44828ae88e6aefc055074030aa1&
09:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the only reason why i tolerate modifiers is that i have split space bar
09:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> a lot of stuff is right space modified
09:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> :cat_sad:  ew
09:20 < bridge> <totar> maximum ergonomic
09:20 < bridge> <louis> tie fighter build
09:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i do need numpad and stuff occastionally to be fair. but i have those on my laptop keepboard
09:21 < bridge> <louis> function row is usually not useful for me
09:21 < bridge> <louis> but i like my arrow keys
09:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> my arrow is just right space + hjkl
09:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> still one hand, home row and thumb, imo pretty easy to get used to
09:22 < bridge> <totar> maybe the small keyboard appeals to the minimalist OS user, "I don't press those buttons so I should remove them"
09:22 < bridge> <louis> ive historically had a lot of issues when i try to use arrow keys + some other key on top of it
09:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> heck i don't even have capslock, my capslock is backspace
09:22 < bridge> <louis> the modifier will not recognize i only want to modify the arrow keys
09:23 < bridge> <louis> you mean the 6 key block + numpad?
09:23 < bridge> <totar> idk
09:23 < bridge> <totar> any keys
09:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh i forgot to order a anykey keycap
09:24 < bridge> <louis> i understand 60% for developers but nowhere under that
09:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> thanks for the reminder
09:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i use 60% now just so i can play deadlock
09:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but i did use 40% most of the time in college
09:26 < bridge> <louis> :justatest:
09:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i can still find my 40% layout even tho i don't have that keyboard anymore

09:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i made that warning, it's my tool. it's fine I tested it
09:31 < bridge> <totar> o lol
09:31 < bridge> <totar> they should add more memory if the keyboard is missing so many keys
09:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's probably not a memory thing
09:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> just terrible firmware in general
09:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the firmware is so bad they stopped updating the version that supports custom layout lol
10:11 < bridge> <zhn> looks unusable with per hand :justatest:
10:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
10:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> hands aren't created equally anyway
10:22 < bridge> <.puch> Chillerdragon: I compiled your ddnet-insta on my server. What I need to put for CTF+ gametype?
10:22 < bridge> <.puch> i don't find

10:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @.puch ``sv_gametype ctf``
11:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Funny thing, I actually use capslock because SCREAMING ON THE INTERNET is annoying without it
11:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Though I would be perfectly happy to press Fn+Shift for that functionality
11:42 < bridge> <.puch> Chillerdragon: I think i already tried it but i got a ddrace server in the end
11:42 < bridge> <.puch> Maybe im using an old branch
12:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> get stronger pinky
12:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> No but the correct way to scream is to always use the opposite shift key to the key you're pressing
12:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> too bad chinese doesn't have uppercase
12:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Unless you're one of those filthy people who doesn't know how to use right shift
12:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You guys should invent lowercase Chinese
12:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> its called simplified chinese
12:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> And this is slow and annoying
12:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I've never used right shift in my life 😬
12:10 < bridge> <_qey> Hey, I received a complaint from my hosting provider about port scanning activities originating from my DDNet server. The complaint mentions multiple UDP connections on port 8307 targeting external IPs, all of them are Hetzner's subnets. At the time of the incident, logs show users on the server were complaining about lags and high ping. Could this behavior be related to the server configuration or a known issue with DDNet?
12:10 < bridge> <_qey> I mean, it for sure looks like a DDoS-attack, but how did the perpetrator manage to make my server echo another IP, since none of the IPs were related to users connected at the time.
12:10 < bridge> <_qey> The outgoing traffic was exceeding 8 Mbps. For an hour.
12:11 < bridge> <_qey> While the incoming traffic was at about 1 Mbps.
12:19 < bridge> <_qey> I hope DDNet master-server or any other infrastructure don’t use Hetzner subnets, as of now I’m disallowing any traffic on DDNet-Server ports on Hetzner’s subnets.
12:34 < bridge> <0xdeen> Seems like someone is using spoofed IPs to make you reflect an attack against our official DDNet servers (and other servers at Hetzner probably)
12:35 < bridge> <0xdeen> See these iptable rules to prevent your server from responding to all incoming requests: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/ddnet-setup.sh#L45-L55
12:36 < bridge> <_qey> Already on it, implementing DNSBL and will look into iptables rules. Any of your servers use Hetzner?
12:37 < bridge> <zhn> someone did the same two months ago too, happened to me too
12:39 < bridge> <0xdeen> Yes, many: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/blob/master/www/_includes/funding.html
12:45 < bridge> <_qey> I see. Is enabling DNSBL in server config sufficient or do I need to further configure the VPS? I cannot run the script since VPS is hosting many other projects, I will selectively implement some parts of the script. As for DNSBL, I cannot tell if any additional configuration is needed besides sv_dnsbl* cmds.
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is that what they claim, or is it in your network stats?
13:04 < bridge> <_qey> Network monitoring logs.
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok, bcs i also had that once (for tcp traffic) and disabled all tcp traffic and they still claimed that my server created so much traffic. so i wrote the support to monitor my server and since then they never banned me again xd
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tho it's not hetzner
13:07 < bridge> <_qey> My thing was real, only UDP, only DDNet-Server port. Backed up by logs.
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what you should defs do is ignore any inc packets from client port <= 1024
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that already solves most port scanning reports
13:10 < bridge> <_qey> It says that my server was port-scanning Hetzner’s servers. I have UFW, so only needed ports are allowed. This is a DDNet-Server-level issue.
13:11 < bridge> <_qey> It says that my server was port-scanning Hetzner’s servers. I have UFW enabled, so only needed ports are allowed. This is a DDNet-Server-level issue.
13:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this is not a ddnet-server issue, that is simply how the internet works 😄
13:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you can just ignore jupstar, they are not correcting you, they just talk like that.
13:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's just their thing
13:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ?XD
13:12 < bridge> <_qey> Thanks for the heads up. I was gonna get myself into a heated discussion.
13:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you guys are talking about different things
13:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's just how it goes sometime
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> his server did port scanning bcs it responded to spoofed ip packets
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how are we talking about different things
13:14 < bridge> <teero777> chillerdragon: do you want the video vertical or horizontal xdd
13:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Square!
13:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The perfect middleground :greenthing:
13:20 < bridge> <teero777> I don't think my phone can record in square ;-;
13:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Vertical!
13:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wait
13:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Which is which
13:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> vertical is tall
13:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> horizontal is wide
13:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 16:9 land scape not TikTok layout xd
13:21 < bridge> <teero777> good ok xD
13:23 < bridge> <teero777> Chiller can you check simplex? I imported my db from my PC idk if it still works
13:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Horizontal then
13:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I simplexed you 15 mins ago
13:24 < bridge> <teero777> Ah fk
13:24 < bridge> <teero777> Yea mb

13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's fixed in master
13:58 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> what version
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nightly
13:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> strictly speaking it's not a new bug, so i don't think it's fixed in latest ver
14:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> which pr?
14:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm really curious why that happens
14:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9347
14:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean i can guess but i'm a bit confused on the exact trigger condition
14:01 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> it feels random
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's kinda a race
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> between loading and showing the loading screen
14:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ok renderloading oof
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it probably to a certain extent is
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as much as we can call timing random
14:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye, it is quite random just how it runs and if there is anything run in between i think?
14:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh `Box.Draw` doesn't reset?
14:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i guess it makes sense
14:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> im just saying that so you turn your attention to me instead of holding the guy from doing anything useful just to argue with you.
14:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it worked didn't it
14:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> he'll figure it out even if you are right. and he might never do if you guys just spent an hour arguing and draining energy
14:08 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon
14:09 < bridge> <woidless> It's you who are constantly raising the level on TeeSports, with the help of a kind of bot that constantly goes to the place  of farm
14:09 < bridge> <woidless> If yes, then you can give this Bot
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i didnt even argue? XD
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i gave him a tip what he could do
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and i told him it's not ddnet related.. any service can be abused like that
14:16 < bridge> <0xdeen> having UDP-based serverinfo available is pretty bad though, the reflection can have more data than the request
14:17 < bridge> <0xdeen> There is already `sv_server_info_per_second`, and with the default of 50 we shouldn't be seeing 8 Mbit/s
14:24 < bridge> <_qey> Well, that’s a new one. 300 Mpbs DDoS. Server is down even from VNC in the panel.
14:25 < bridge> <_qey> 100% CPU load even after rebooting the server, which kills DDNet-Servers. Any suggestions? Sorry for being slightly off-topic.
14:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if he replies it will start
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and so?
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if i or him doesn't want the discussion we can simply say it.
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> really dunno what you are up to rn
14:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i stopped him from wasting his time
14:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's it
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you are creating a discussion rn too :lol:
14:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and i will stop wasting mine too starting now
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> against ddos, you basically have no chance.
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> normally server hosters provide a ddos protection.. wait until it gets active
14:31 < bridge> <_qey> Not against a 300 Mbps one.
14:31 < bridge> <_qey> I can’t even tell where the traffic is coming from, since I cannot access the server.
14:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ~~nooo, don't respond. i was rooting for you.~~
14:32 < bridge> <_qey> Even forced restarts don’t work, lol.
14:32 < bridge> <_qey> I’m not arguing with him at the moment.
14:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm just kidding.
14:33 < bridge> <_qey> I’m straight up baffled by what’s going on. People are wasting resources to take down my little network, that’s just stupid.
14:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that happens all the time
14:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> luckily our server with our 5mbps bandwidth will just kill itself before they can do anything with it.
14:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> luckily my server with my 5mbps bandwidth will just kill itself before they can do anything with it.
14:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> still a DOS tho, but I solved it by just not caring about it
14:36 < bridge> <_qey> I have a 1 Gbps port, I have no idea why 300 Mbps killed it, maybe a CPU issue then.
14:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like a home connection or?
14:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like from a hoster
14:37 < bridge> <_qey> Hosting provider.
14:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye, no idea then
14:38 < bridge> <_qey> 11 minutes in, I manager to shut the hecking server down.
14:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe it was one physical link shared between multiple instances and a QoS somewhere stopped yours.
14:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i guess lots of things can happen and i shouldn't just guess randomly lol
14:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean lots of things can happen and i shouldn't just guess randomly lol

15:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless yes it is me. Sedonya said it is okay if I use a bot. But sadly he disallows farm bots in general so nobody else can use them. Which means I can not distribute a bot that is disallowed by all Copy Love Box admins I know.
15:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh and its also not running on windows. Its written in a propriatary linux only programming language.
15:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> proprietary* one day i learn how to spell it
15:09 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 5head
15:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Wait what? That's amazing :D
15:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> bash
15:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> need to write more Windows-incompatible software
15:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> what even is linux only?
15:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> is alt+scroll a thing on other OSs than windows?
15:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> something that uses every obscure Linux only syscall and has no implementations for other operating systems :)
15:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like just a faster scroll
15:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i forgot what exactly but since i never intended on publishing it i went full "it works on my machine" mode with some linux only C headers
15:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You could probably *make* it a thing
15:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh wait i'm dumb it's a vsc thing, not a windows thing oof
15:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> nvm then
15:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> well. I expected it to be a linux only language
15:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Apparently Alt+scroll in Firefox is back and forwards
15:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Apparently Alt+scroll in Firefox is back and forwards in history
15:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> not an app only working on linux
15:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> 😢 disappointed
15:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> wtf
15:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't like that
15:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> me neither!

15:35 < bridge> <Ewan> cygwin users when
15:35 < bridge> <Ewan> it looks cool but im not allowed to use it for work because they got hacked
15:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean not really
15:36 < bridge> <Ewan> someone found a fairly obvious CVE and they handled it well but it was all because of extra dumb shit
15:36 < bridge> <Ewan> linux version when 🥱
15:37 < bridge> <Ewan> they did handle it pretty well tho
15:38 < bridge> <Ewan> https://kibty.town/blog/arc/
15:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i say fairly obvious but they all are after you discover them right lol
15:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i have the useless phone app tho
15:39 < bridge> <Ewan> which is just browser for phone
15:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I just use normal mobile firefox
15:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> boring but good
15:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> at least it's not preinstalled chrome you know
15:40 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
15:40 < bridge> <Ewan> they had a bug where opening the app if you left off in private browsing would crash semi consistently
15:41 < bridge> <Ewan> took them like over a year to fix iirc
15:41 < bridge> <Ewan> but otherwise i love mobile firefox and have used it for as long as apple has allowed non-safari default browsers
15:41 < bridge> <Ewan> and before on my s10e. that was a nice phone
16:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm saying it is terrible cuz i misclicked it the first time cuz the 80% dodged my click
16:17 < bridge> <Ewan> different UX doesn’t mean bad
16:17 < bridge> <Ewan> but i do hear they changed the top left corner a lot
16:17 < bridge> <Ewan> but ya i am not a big fan of extra options like that moving around
16:18 < bridge> <Ewan> it should just come out to the left of the existing ones, and the existing ones should have fixed positions
16:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm saying the button moves when you hover it is bad
16:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
16:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm pretty sure that is bad like objectively
16:19 < bridge> <Ewan> we are agreeing
16:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye
16:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm more talking about i don't really care about the rest of the UX like top bar designs and stuff
16:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> just the button moving lol
17:18 < bridge> <teero777> Hey can someone check out the 32bit exe from the newest release? I got told it is buggy
17:18 < bridge> <teero777> All the UI elements wiggling around
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it also happens in wine
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> seems like the time is completely wrong
17:22 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319338979786625134/2024-12-19_17-13-19.mp4?ex=676599ac&is=6764482c&hm=fba71c3e701987bc524e245cfad73ac3dbb0d98c5df8ea852c5cb6c9b94128c6&
17:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> looks like holding tab with very short key repeat delay or something
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but the snow is also super fast
17:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> except pressing Tab doesn't even change the tabs... so what is even happening here?
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> must be some time thing
17:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @0xdeen did you upgrade your system or smth?
17:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or why do we encounter such weird bugs on legacy platforms
17:30 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s fine
17:36 < bridge> <0xdeen> That's hilarious. Is that win32?
17:36 < bridge> <0xdeen> I guess some code changed
17:36 < bridge> <0xdeen> but arch linux always gets updates, so who knows
17:38 < bridge> <robyt3> ok, 32 bit is pretty broken
17:39 < bridge> <Ewan> lgtm idk
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but must have broken lately
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but why is the time in the maplayers broken
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 did you change smth about how the local time is processed there?
17:40 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks limited edition feature
17:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why the UI elements jump around is another weird thing, since they only react to mouse
17:40 < bridge> <robyt3> 18.7 unaffected, so must be a recent change
17:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i didn't have 32-bit & win7 breaks on my 2024 bingo card for certain
17:41 < bridge> <Ewan> does that happen everywhere there are UIs or just the main menu
17:42 < bridge> <Ewan> i can see something with ui rects working from uninitialized or otherwise invalid values
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah certainly possible, but the map animations must be time related
17:42 < bridge> <Ewan> floating point different on 32 bit, msvc compiler flags, etc
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i also insta timeout
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319344224117723226/image.png?ex=67659e8f&is=67644d0f&hm=380e005b3c33ba20f3d34dbc2ebd801eedc16383ff7afd09353a2009650b188d&
17:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when joining a server
17:43 < bridge> <Ewan> something is very wrong

17:45 < bridge> <htrudfhdfhuytryfghnj> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319344857512284290/image.png?ex=67659f26&is=67644da6&hm=8d4ea72de7aff49aecebd3fb82066bf97d6aaab84c6bea5f3f72c9f90bd99e7d&
17:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Tabbing in and out of 32 bit 18.8 also makes it freeze with 0% CPU usage for me
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ah thought it's a wayland bug xD
17:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah, i have it in wine too
17:46 < bridge> <Ewan> broadcast? what server? if anything but ddnet, then you have your answer
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can you share the ip
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in this channel
17:46 < bridge> <htrudfhdfhuytryfghnj> I mean, why is he insulting my country?
17:47 < bridge> <Ewan> this is presumably an independent server host
17:47 < bridge> <htrudfhdfhuytryfghnj> i leave...
17:47 < bridge> <Ewan> they can do whatever they want
17:47 < bridge> <Ewan> they are not ddnet
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean the server ip
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you dont know?
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or server name
17:47 < bridge> <htrudfhdfhuytryfghnj> sorry i dont know because i dont have a server history list
17:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh k
17:48 < bridge> <Ewan> with exceptions but i don’t think strong language constitutes a ban from the masters
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think this is simply your ingame name?
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i joined a block server with the map in your screenshot
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and it said "WELCOME '<my name'>
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and it said "WELCOME '<my name>'
17:49 < bridge> <htrudfhdfhuytryfghnj> ?
17:49 < bridge> <Ewan> are you trolling?
17:49 < bridge> <Ewan> you have to tell me if you’re trolling
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think heis
17:49 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s entrapment otherwise
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think he is
17:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> no I'm sure htrudfhdfhuytryfghnj is super serious about everything
17:50 < bridge> <Ewan> some ppl do come in here with crazy ass names looking for help
17:59 < bridge> <eetadam> Hello, what is the minimum version of Android to support the game, and will it be supported on Android in the future?
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://ddnet.org/downloads/DDNet-18.8.1.apk
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just try it out
18:02 < bridge> <eetadam> I dont have old android
18:02 < bridge> <eetadam> I have only android 14 and android 8
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well 8 is defs something i'd consider old
18:03 < bridge> <eetadam> Ok
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it should still work on that version, just to be clear xd
18:05 < bridge> <robyt3> Android 7.0 and newer should be supported
18:05 < bridge> <Ewan> just curious, are you looking into the 32 bit thing? it’s a fascinating bug
18:05 < bridge> <Ewan> or collection of bugd
18:05 < bridge> <Ewan> or collection of bugs
18:06 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, I can't reproduce it when compiling with MSVC 32 bit both in debug and release build
18:06 < bridge> <Ewan> oh great
18:06 < bridge> <Ewan> are deen’s build scripts public
18:07 < bridge> <robyt3> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/a17337fde68e0de9b16da15df5d3ccd5a63d9307/release/build.sh
18:08 < bridge> <Ewan> the releases use mingw?? news to me
18:09 < bridge> <Ewan> if you have msys2 and can’t repro with this cmake/toolchains/mingw$PLATFORM.toolchain then i’d be worried
18:10 < bridge> <robyt3> Might also be related to different configuration flags like Discord/Steam/Autoupdater integration
18:12 < bridge> <Ewan> i see
18:12 < bridge> <Ewan> i have a question that might seem weird
18:12 < bridge> <Ewan> how tf do you bring yourself to do so much for ddnet
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes robyte tell us
18:13 < bridge> <Ewan> idk historically your affiliation with the game or what it means to you but putting in this much work for anything as a volunteer is admirable
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> robyte time
18:13 < bridge> <robyt3> I was just about to eat :pepeW:
18:13 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
18:13 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah what time is it anyway
18:13 < bridge> <Ewan> dinnertime ig
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok ok, you eat, bon apetit
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and when you back you have your biography ready 😄
18:14 < bridge> <Ewan> well idk
18:14 < bridge> <Ewan> this guy just works for seemingly nothing other than to have it accomplished
18:15 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe there is more to it
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so basically like all hobbies xd
18:17 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe i am just particularly used to seeing laziness all around but that’s kind of discrediting his contributions
18:17 < bridge> <Ewan> he does a lot
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think there is only lack of motivation, not laziness
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like what are things you consider yourself lazy for?
18:19 < bridge> <Ewan> discord chatting on the clock :justatest:
18:19 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe robyte is just super disciplined
18:20 < bridge> <Ewan> manages time well
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> discord like all social media can easily make addicted.
18:20 < bridge> <Ewan> ye i have been using discord since i was 11
18:20 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s bad
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well as stupid as it sounds. log out, don't log in for 3-4 days
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then it gets easier
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the first days are the hardest
18:21 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ohhhh oh this is so weird
18:21 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319353811818778654/Screenshot_20241219_120914_DDNet-1881.jpg?ex=6765a77d&is=676455fd&hm=6758644cf7f771b6b3a7f6b001839dd932a056e775dd1ac0ca6c6d21c5f5c4f4&
18:21 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> everything is teeny tiny
18:21 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> fng also hates the mobile client LOL
18:21 < bridge> <Ewan> there’s an API to have a native text field rendered above the keyboard instead of the game
18:21 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe that’s worth looking into
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, would defs be worth it 😄
18:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i wonder how it tells the difference
18:22 < bridge> <Ewan> just erratic mobile inputs ig
18:22 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i didnt even touch anything
18:22 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> just joined and got purged
18:22 < bridge> <Ewan> so u didnt even get to move around or anything
18:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i can see it kicking u after some seconds if ur input is strange
18:23 < bridge> <Ewan> but not for no reason. it should be the same client on paper
18:23 < bridge> <Ewan> right?
18:23 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
18:24 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i think the main bug is how text boxes are handled
18:24 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> you select a box, half the time it doesnt even focus properly. the only way to deselect it is to press the back button (usually you can tap outside the box to deselect it)
18:24 < bridge> <Ewan> are you expecting it to unfocus when you click smth else
18:24 < bridge> <Ewan> what if u like switch tabs
18:24 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yes
18:25 < bridge> <Ewan> idr but i think ddnet controls will remain focused until another focus-capturing control is selected? may be wrong
18:25 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319354848742867135/Screen_Recording_20241219_122459_DDNet-1881.mp4?ex=6765a874&is=676456f4&hm=580756f62b8ced2da7b886a70df58dcd3ebd19659bd233caa895d19b42a23fea&
18:25 < bridge> <Ewan> yea like i think if u selected a browser item there you’d typically be able to keep typing in the browser search field, on desktop
18:26 < bridge> <Ewan> so not a bug per se but bad for usability
18:26 < bridge> <Ewan> if android is to be maintained long-term i don’t see it happening without a fundamental UI overhaul
18:26 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yea true
18:27 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> just wanted to try it out to see how it fares
18:27 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
18:27 < bridge> <Ewan> did you ever try ddnet 9 on android
18:27 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yea
18:27 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> it sux
18:27 < bridge> <Ewan> nah it was a whole lot of fun
18:28 < bridge> <Ewan> esp when u switched apps and all the textures were freed and not reuploaded
18:28 < bridge> <Ewan> or at least the glyphs and some other things
18:28 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> test #2
18:28 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> thats p cool

18:29 < bridge> <Ewan> that is cool
18:29 < bridge> <Ewan> i question anyone who really wants to play it without bluetooth mouse and keyboard tbh
18:30 < bridge> <Ewan> not really question but… the ergonomics seem so bad
18:31 < bridge> <Ewan> i think i wanna try to learn vim (or at least become competent in some TUI editor)
18:31 < bridge> <Ewan> my awesome WM setup on my desktop has become a crutch and now im constantly pulling my hair out trying to keep vscode and my terminal open alongside each other on the mac xdd

18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i always get green borders in ddnet for whatever reason xD
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and set to vulkan
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for more epyc gamen
18:44 < bridge> <Ewan> strange
18:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i only get them on GL ES
18:56 < bridge> <Ewan> if you have a wide corner radius on ur phone maybe it’s just to pad for that
18:56 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319362757682008084/Screenshot_20241219_105627_DDNet-1881.jpg?ex=6765afd2&is=67645e52&hm=b1619c1595885ed46d278f4ef401b7e61d60270eb09b84341862b868e01966c6&
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or it's some game mode xd
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah but it's not cutted edges
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's a border around the whole screen
18:57 < bridge> <Ewan> that photo is misleading
18:57 < bridge> <Ewan> ig it is not backend specific
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lol now it's gone
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> random
18:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i did have the green bezel too
18:58 < bridge> <Ewan> but now i cant get it back
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> funny stuff
19:02 < bridge> <Ewan> the game feels weird
19:02 < bridge> <Ewan> thats all i can say
19:02 < bridge> <teero777> You fps is 07:29:30?!
19:03 < bridge> <teero777> Your fps is 07:29:30?!
19:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes, thx superteero
19:04 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> bro poured skimmed milk on his cpu
19:13 < bridge> <Ewan> i noticed that enabling show all display modes will do that, and though any custom display mode will be ignored for display purposes, the mouse inputs are processed with the display mode in mind
19:13 < bridge> <Ewan> so i set it to the res i play on normally and it feels more normaler
19:13 < bridge> <Ewan> i think.
19:14 < bridge> <robyt3> That was mostly fixed on more recent Android versions or because they just have more RAM so they don't need to unload the textures anymore, we didn't fix it properly yet (i.e. reload every texture)
19:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i also noticed that sometimes my inputs get cut off with keyboard, if im holding right and then jump and then view the scoreboard within that jump i will no longer be walking right tho the button is held
19:14 < bridge> <Ewan> oh that isn’t even true
19:14 < bridge> <Ewan> it my mouse
19:14 < bridge> <Ewan> but only sometimes
19:15 < bridge> <Ewan> annoying
19:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i wonder if my phone would support a thunderbolt tethered Ethernet connection
19:16 < bridge> <robyt3> Might also be related to your particular virtual keyboard how it effectively moves the entire game window up. I have a smaller keyboard and it opens on a different side than the text input in the game so I can see both
19:19 < bridge> <Ewan> this keyboard stuff seems like a mess. i was using gboard and i had to turn off some settings for my physical keyboard to not make a stupid popup over the game while i’m typing
19:19 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, I think I was looking for some more practical programming hobby and remembered Teeworlds
19:20 < bridge> <Ewan> and even still it’ll lock my mouse inside the input field, as if it was my thumb to move the cursor between characters
19:20 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
19:21 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319369003566891008/Screenshot_20241219_112116_Discord.jpg?ex=6765b5a3&is=67646423&hm=ee2a291c19090f80855a7e2ff33891323aafa793d03fb9fc27e441c765dc256b&
19:21 < bridge> <Ewan> Win shift s screenshot on droid... Crazy
19:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> don't lie teeworlds is your oxygen, you'd die without
19:31 < bridge> <Ewan> where is the config dir on android
19:31 < bridge> <Ewan> crippled without my binds
19:33 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> bind z laggg!!!
19:33 < bridge> <robyt3> `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/org.ddnet.client/files/user`
19:34 < bridge> <Ewan> ty
19:34 < bridge> <robyt3> But the only way to read from it is with Google's Files app and it's impossible to write to on modern Android versions...
19:34 < bridge> <robyt3> Unless you use root or maybe a file manager that supports it with shizuku
19:34 < bridge> <Ewan> how are settings preserved on restart
19:35 < bridge> <Ewan> if u cant write there
19:35 < bridge> <robyt3> I mean for you as a user
19:35 < bridge> <robyt3> The app can use the folder however it wants
19:35 < bridge> <Ewan> fair enough
19:35 < bridge> <Solly> Btw does keyboard/mouse work with android Verizon
19:36 < bridge> <robyt3> https://source.android.com/docs/core/storage/scoped
19:36 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319372768760037418/Screenshot_20241219_113614_Termux.jpg?ex=6765b924&is=676467a4&hm=403d32884355bff9fd612fe96a483f1802425f193f5455b4484f75cf4e7288a9&
19:36 < bridge> <Ewan> Sadge
19:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Should work, if your keyboard/mouse are supported at all
19:37 < bridge> <Ewan> It's "working" for me but that issue I was talking about where my inputs get cut off makes it somewhat unplayable
19:37 < bridge> <Ewan> But idk where the blame for that lies
19:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> permissions on Android are such a pain sometimes
19:37 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the price of security I guess
19:37 < bridge> <Ewan> Yeah
19:37 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, these storage changes are a real pain for our use case of "users can drop whatever files they want into the game"
19:37 < bridge> <Ewan> Gboard was intervening beforehand in the input fields so I suspect it's virtual keyboard specific
19:38 < bridge> <Ewan> And yea I mean you can probably expose a simple import from zip or something but it's unfortunate nonetheless
19:38 < bridge> <Ewan> I'm gonna try the aosp keyboard
19:38 < bridge> <robyt3> 1. Port to SDL3
19:38 < bridge> <robyt3> 2. It has support for native file open/save dialogs also on Android
19:38 < bridge> <robyt3> :justatest:
19:41 < bridge> <Solly> It is really hard to control on android
19:41 < bridge> <Ewan> damn are there not even file dialogs
19:41 < bridge> <Ewan> :feelsbadman:
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao okay
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319375021143232512/Screenshot_20241219_114458_Settings.jpg?ex=6765bb3d&is=676469bd&hm=992c985379bdf401da4a022ebdfd255d97cd7017cb525c9c21dc372e586c7110&
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> it is detecting my mouse as a keyboard. that is probably the issue
19:50 < bridge> <Ewan> the only other bluetooth mouse i have to test with is a trackball mouse… rip
19:59 < bridge> <_qey> @0xdeen not sure if you’re the one I’m supposed to ping, but you’ve provided some help before, so… I made some tweaks to my VPS, did my homework on iptables, but now I’m having trouble setting up DNSBL. It just doesn’t work apparently, I didn’t use dnsmasq, since it probably should work just with config, but I may be wrong. I’d appreciate any help.
20:01 < bridge> <_qey> Who would’ve thought a hobby-hosting of DDNet servers would be such a pain in the ass, lol. Never had that issue with games like CS and GTA before for some reason.
20:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i’d wager he’s not on rn but if you would explain the whole situation maybe i could help
20:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you were banned for port scanning then a dnsbl will most like not help
20:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the spoofed ips are legit ips
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs only teeworlds has the most hobbyless ppl ever xd
20:10 < bridge> <_qey> DDoS. Both times on port 8307, which is DDNet-Server. First time I’ve received a complaint about my server port-scanning Hetzner’s servers it was 8 Mbps, the second time everything just bottlenecked and froze on me with 300 Mbps attack.
20:11 < bridge> <_qey> So I shut down everything, rewrote the firewall rules.
20:11 < bridge> <_qey> Now I just want to enable DNSBL.
20:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> still amazes me that people actually bother attacking TW servers
20:11 < bridge> <Ewan> are these the reflection attacks? @timakro may have insight
20:11 < bridge> <_qey> To further secure server from idiots.
20:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you even understand what a dns blacklist does?
20:12 < bridge> <_qey> Probably the guy that warned me about you was right, you just like to bother people with nonsense.
20:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
20:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so you don't, that's fine
20:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> That's... a bit much
20:13 < bridge> <_qey> As mentioned before, I just want to further secure the server, I was letting blacklisted IPs on the server, in the light of recent events I do not want to do that anymore.
20:14 < bridge> <_qey> He was trying to get me into a ‘discussion’ for like 6 hours now. I budged this time.
20:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah sure
20:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> believe what tsfreddie randomly hallucinates
20:14 < bridge> <Ewan> I’m obviously missing context but i’ve never seen jupstar inquire with bad intent
20:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Jupstar is certified cool, you've yet to prove yourself
20:15 < bridge> <_qey> I don’t see myself as a permanent member anyways. I’m here on occasion.
20:15 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s not a popularity contest anyway
20:16 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
20:16 < bridge> <_qey> I just ignored Jupstar for 6 hours while he was trying to incur that I’m stupid and I don’t understand what I’m doing. I replied for him to get off of me.
20:17 < bridge> <_qey> I mean, he was asking me questions that I already gave an answer to.
20:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I mean, asking if you know what you're doing is a pretty common thing to do when you're trying to help someone with a technical matter
20:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If you *really* knew what you were doing you wouldn't have to be asking for help
20:18 < bridge> <_qey> That wasn’t how it went.
20:18 < bridge> <Ewan> unique servers experienced similar port-scanning attacks, and i believe they were solved by adding particular iptables rules but i wasn’t the one who fixed it on my vps
20:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> All I'm seeing is you smearing Jupstar and that isn't going to get you very far
20:18 < bridge> <Ewan> i don’t see what the point is in dwelling on it
20:19 < bridge> <_qey> I asked people, only Deen gave me an adequate response.
20:19 < bridge> <_qey> Jupstar proceeded to ask me nonsense.
20:19 < bridge> <_qey> Several times.
20:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> please stop the lies thanks
20:19 < bridge> <_qey> I get why you’re defending him, but give it another thought.
20:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> nonsense, relevant details, tomato, tomahto
20:20 < bridge> <Ewan> this discussion will mean nothing to anyone until screenshots or message links are provided, at which point you’ll be redirected to offtopic or told to stop talking about drama
20:20 < bridge> <_qey> You may wanna read the conversation before stating facts.
20:20 < bridge> <Ewan> so this is a pointless conversation to be having rn
20:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> read above here and tell me where i said "you are stupid", or where i started any kind of discussion
20:21 < bridge> <_qey> I’m trying to get off this conversation. It’s pointless. I couldn’t care less about Jupstar, people trying to get me on for some reason.
20:22 < bridge> <Ewan> sometimes non native speakers have an inflammatory tone that i can tell you isn’t intentional in jupstar’s case
20:23 < bridge> <Ewan> we ended up turning off ufw and relying just on the iptables rules.. afaik we have received no complaints since
20:23 < bridge> <_qey> No, I’m fully aware of the tone I’m using. At this point he is annoying me.
20:23 < bridge> <_qey> That’s what I did.
20:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> So you're trying to get people mad at you on purpose? Well that's nice of you.
20:24 < bridge> <_qey> Mad for telling the truth? lol.
20:24 < bridge> <Ewan> are you still victim to these attacks? it sounds like it hasn’t been solved
20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I tried to explain that a spoofed ip attack, works by the simple fact that your server responds to the incomming ip + port.
20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So a firewall that disables unused ports on your server will not solve this exact issue.
20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think that is a fair and good tip
20:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i didn't say you did, and this was a lie to stop pointless convos, which I already said here https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1319289516200038470
20:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I tried to explain that a spoofed ip attack works by the simple fact that your server responds to the incomming ip + port.

20:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think that is a fair and good tip
20:25 < bridge> <_qey> I shut down the server and just recently turned it back on, along with DDNet Servers, time will tell.
20:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i stopped him from arguing with you didn't mean you started arguing already.
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> okay, great
20:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i head out for now
20:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i never argues, that's the problem
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> b-b-but
20:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i threw facts against him
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> :kek:
20:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i didn't say you did
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> it doesn’t matter guys
20:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> which i've stated here https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1319385264509947934
20:27 < bridge> <Ewan> fred as a blue guy isn’t it your job to de-escalate
20:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Today on DDNewsNetwork: Unexpected Drama in Developer Chat? Find The Spiciest Details Here!
20:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> im pretty sure im trying to
20:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> love ya fred
20:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what i find even more sad is that some hosters prefer to trust reports from hetzner than checking if the traffic even existed in first place.
20:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this is also something i had with my hoster.. they just banned me based on hetzner reports, even tho my server didn't create any traffic (thus i asked him if his network stats confirmed the traffic came from his server)
20:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> love ya Fred
20:28 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
20:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i could also just time everyone out if you prefer that
20:28 < bridge> <_qey> The issue arose when my servers had full online 64/64, now it’s like 1/4 of that. What I noticed at the time is that other servers were unavailable too, a small portion, but enough to notice.
20:28 < bridge> <Ewan> you can usually appeal
20:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep but my server was always down for few hours
20:29 < bridge> <Ewan> well let us know if it’s still not fixed
20:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> was kinda annoying until the support accepted it
20:29 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
20:30 < bridge> <_qey> *deep fucking sigh*
20:30 < bridge> <_qey> I literally told you that this info is backed up by my logs.
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> fred’s about to dish out some timeouts
20:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> im trying to stay calm, woke me up with a notification at 3am and demand explanation did step on my nerves a bit and i apologie for that.
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> :brownbear:
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> i stand corrected
20:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i won't time out anyone. just stop talking.
20:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 🥺 we love Fred
20:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> hear me out
20:31 < bridge> <Ewan> if you want to bicker anyway do it in offtopic lol
20:31 < bridge> <mirfay123> hear me out guys
20:31 < bridge> <mirfay123> i want everything mark as read
20:31 < bridge> <mirfay123> and youre making it worse
20:32 < bridge> <mirfay123> how ami suppost to sleep when my phone constandly vibrate
20:32 < bridge> <_qey> Will do. Thanks for adequate responses.
20:32 < bridge> <mirfay123> pleade
20:32 < bridge> <mirfay123> please*
20:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I too read every channel
20:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> must keep up with all the DDGossip
20:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you guys love facts. **but i love people**. discussing these thing over and over doesn't do anything. you guys stated what you think already. i have no idea who has better facts because i don't care and this is not a contest. but i'm pretty sure time are better spent on fixing things and researching. draining energy talking is useless.

20:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> not f3 if you agree
20:33 < bridge> <_qey> Fun fact, I actually DDoS’ed myself once. I made a mode that constantly sends packets to the server, like 33000 packets in 5 minutes per 30 players, my server was suspended.
20:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> now f3 if you agree
20:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> BASED
20:34 < bridge> <mirfay123> can i please have a good sleep or do i need to fuck off this beautiful server
20:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> DDoSed or just DoSed?
20:34 < bridge> <Ewan> wait what did u have to do with this xD
20:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> you can turn off your notifications while you sleep lol
20:34 < bridge> <Ewan> peanut gallery hours
20:34 < bridge> <_qey> Since it was coming from multiple users, DDoSed.
20:34 < bridge> <Ewan> im gonna go work now
20:34 < bridge> <mirfay123> my phone litellary looks like its alive from vibrating
20:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> nice
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> no way u got notifs on for every msg in dev channel?
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds like a you problem
20:35 < bridge> <mirfay123> ye
20:35 < bridge> <teero777> everything is mute
20:35 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> every guild is mentions only, suppress @ everyone @ here
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry man not to be rude but you’re literally signing up for this annoyance
20:35 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the only reasonable setting
20:36 < bridge> <_qey> I’m thinking of fully reworking the movement system in DDNet-Server. I want to make it a top-down view.
20:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also people are learners but you guys obviously doesn't have education degrees. state what you think exactly **once** is good enough for people to learn.
20:36 < bridge> <_qey> And then make CS out of it, lol.
20:37 < bridge> <mirfay123> lets play a game
20:37 < bridge> <mirfay123> whoever is quietest for longest in this channel we all call legend
20:37 < bridge> <mirfay123> ready?
20:38 < bridge> <_qey> Just disable notifications.
20:38 < bridge> <mirfay123> no just
20:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> or put your phone in dnd for the next 8 hours
20:38 < bridge> <mirfay123> do it
20:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> apparently no one cares about me venting
20:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> they usually have a button for that
20:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> how do i even sleep now
20:38 < bridge> <mirfay123> i use nokia
20:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> What sort of response do you expect?
20:38 < bridge> <_qey> Count sheep.
20:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Suomi mainittu, torilla tavataan!
20:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> mf woke me up
20:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and just left lmao
20:39 < bridge> <mirfay123> ok seriously guys
20:39 < bridge> <mirfay123> meta testing got deleted for drama
20:39 < bridge> <_qey> What does blue nickname mean? I don’t use Discord like at all.
20:39 < bridge> <mirfay123> and u want this channel dead too?
20:39 < bridge> <mirfay123> come on bro
20:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ~~the most heated convo here usually involves juppy for reason.~~
20:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's community dependent, but here it means they're a moderator
20:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i just mean people like me :brownbear:
20:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ~~should I one-up him?~~
20:40 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> watch over the server like a hawk
20:41 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> you can click his profile and look at the list of roles
20:41 < bridge> <_qey> You’re testing apparently.
20:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the guy just don't know how to back down. nothing works, he state roughly the samething over and over again, you agree with him he double down, you disagree with him he pushes harder lmao.
20:42 < bridge> <_qey> Is there a default setting to ban KRX players? Like DNSBL.
20:42 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> its a role you can give yourself in #📌info to see map testing channels
20:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I should get myself *at least* one fancy role...
20:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i have a feeling that he sees every message with bad intent
20:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Literally me 😍
20:42 < bridge> <_qey> Thanks, but I only test my own maps.
20:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> win a tournament
20:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's pretty rare and cool
20:43 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> 1. no i think
20:43 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> 2. moderators dont like that client name being mentioned
20:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> too noob for that 😔
20:43 < bridge> <_qey> I wonder why this is called #develover if most of my dev messages get ignored, lol.
20:44 < bridge> <mirfay123> ok dont judge me, perfect chance to get someone in my discord https://discord.gg/b2Rv7NqS i want friends (+ my clan server)
20:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also be careful what you wish for, lerato gave me a bot role for fun cuz i asked that and unintentionally banned me from all channels other than a music channel for three days
20:44 < bridge> <Ewan> @Discord Mod
20:44 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> wtf
20:44 < bridge> <teero777> Brother you have only been posting irrelevant or questions with either no answer or an obvious answer
20:44 < bridge> <louis> how would a default setting in open source code prevent a hack client from ever being banned for more than a week
20:44 < bridge> <louis> they would just read the code and bypass it again
20:45 < bridge> <_qey> I’m thinking of reading PMs in game, those are sending spam links, gets rid of 99% of free users.
20:45 < bridge> <Ewan> you can definitely do that
20:45 < bridge> <Ewan> they use character lookalikes
20:45 < bridge> <Ewan> they are evolving
20:45 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> idk you have to code it yourself or something
20:45 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> nudelsafts server has stuff against that
20:45 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> works pretty well as far as i can tell
20:45 < bridge> <Ewan> there are presumably already automated bans for it because just today i saw one in strange cosmetic script
20:45 < bridge> <_qey> The more the merrier, just ban all MB chars.
20:46 < bridge> <Ewan> they already remap known lookalikes
20:46 < bridge> <Ewan> need multibyte
20:46 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> do you know why tw has that weird text font? lol
20:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do not assume we do or don't do anything please
20:46 < bridge> <Ewan> most of ddnet’s current userbase relies on it lmfao
20:47 < bridge> <_qey> Doesn’t matter, if I ban all multibyte characters in PM, they can remap all they want.
20:47 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> theres also spam bots in normal chat
20:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess
20:47 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
20:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> bro im chinese
20:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Nahh, only English in DMs
20:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> all chinese are multicharacter
20:47 < bridge> <_qey> Chinese people don’t play on my servers.
20:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i think he just means his server doesnt need it
20:47 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
20:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> im just kidding
20:48 < bridge> <_qey> I can’t tell whether you are kidding or not.
20:48 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> chinese guy joins, asks someone something in pms and promptly gets executed by the automod
20:48 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> :kek:
20:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i told you so you now know :brownbear:
20:49 < bridge> <_qey> 好
20:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> you could whitelist certain character ranges I guess
20:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but that's like annoying and stuff
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> by they i mean ddnet btw. this may only apply to names but certain cyrillic characters look identical to latin ones for example so those will automatically be rebound to the latin counterparts by the server
20:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> pretty sure it's the chinese font fallback?
20:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the cjk font is pretty universal
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> i think he means non-ascii latin characters like the cosmetic characters
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> which… it’s in the unicode standard, so
20:50 < bridge> <_qey> When it comes to names, DDNet’s system is fucked up, I literally can’t use 90% of the Unicode characters as they appear as a square.
20:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cjk font is pretty pan unicode
20:50 < bridge> <Ewan> think about it for the database and such
20:51 < bridge> <Ewan> you either clean your strings aggressively or bad things happen
20:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> obviously not the entire unicode but they did fit like most sensible things
20:51 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
20:51 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> 𝕥𝕙𝕚𝕟𝕜 𝕪𝕠𝕦 𝕔𝕠𝕦𝕝𝕕 𝕕𝕠 𝕓𝕖𝕥𝕥𝕖𝕣? 𝕟𝕠𝕥 𝕨𝕚𝕥𝕙𝕠𝕦𝕥
20:51 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> this thing
20:51 < bridge> <Ewan> yes, that!
20:51 < bridge> <Ewan> is what i saw today
20:51 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe it should be taken out of the font. old clients will always still see it
20:52 < bridge> <_qey> Should I update the client?
20:52 < bridge> <_qey> I never do.
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> it gets better all the time
20:52 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> what client are you on
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> depending on who you ask
20:52 < bridge> <_qey> 16.x
20:52 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i dont see a reason not to
20:52 < bridge> <Ewan> i would update. 16 isn’t so so old but there are cool features
20:52 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> unless you have like 2 kb left of storage
20:53 < bridge> <_qey> Not to kid anyone, but I literally have to delete one game in order to install another.
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet’s binary size should be roughly the same as it was
20:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean i don't really see a problem if it is just for regular fun uses. there is a unicode confusables table or something that is pretty comprehensive of mapping all latin characters too all variants maybe just use that
20:53 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> as in no auto update in ddnet or actually no space
20:53 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> xd
20:53 < bridge> <_qey> I never bothered changing my SSD, so I’m stuck with 128 GB.
20:54 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ah
20:54 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> thats tiny
20:54 < bridge> <_qey> More that enough for Linux and 1 game.
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s not, today i saw that exact char set used to promote ___ client in global chat
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> was i talking to you, that always invents his own facts?
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my very first question to you was simple:
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1319274125713473597
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i just wanted to know if it was in your network logs.
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you said yes.
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my reason why i ever asked this question was the statement. COMPLETELY unrelated to you
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Now you are provocative for no reason...
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> still?
20:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> stop retro fitting
20:54 < bridge> <_qey> Ah, shit, here we go again.
20:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> imma timeout
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes time him out please
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> warn first
20:54 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> oh damn
20:54 < bridge> <_qey> I forgot about him 10 times.
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> explicitly
20:55 < bridge> <louis> nah justice for jupstar
20:55 < bridge> <Ewan> then it’s their lwn fault when they get timed out
20:55 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> someones getting smoked tonight
20:55 < bridge> <Ewan> then it’s their own fault when they get timed out
20:55 < bridge> <louis> yall talked abt him after he left too, let him talk back
20:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> fair enough
20:56 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> @jupeyy_keks talk
20:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> although DO NOT respond
20:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
20:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> this is a warning
20:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> DEMOCRACY BABY
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> we should decide on what’s happening here. i think he should be given the opportunity to stick up for himself, but not in this channel
20:56 < bridge> <_qey> 9 out 10 of his messages is just him trying to get me on. I happily forgot about his existence, but here he is with nonsense again.
20:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you can block him which is an option on discord
20:57 < bridge> <_qey> Please, tell me how.
20:57 < bridge> <Ewan> this stopped being developer conversation as soon as it became personal. i am okay with drivel but not when it’s aggressive and interpersonal
20:57 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> Uh
20:57 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> right click his profile
20:57 < bridge> <Ewan> (Im not a mod)
20:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> emm, im sure you can figure it out
20:57 < bridge> <_qey> I literally installed Discord just to ask for DDNet-related help. I don’t use it.
20:57 < bridge> <louis> u can google how to do it
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> for anyone who wants to continue this conversation 
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> #off-topic 
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> click that blue rectangle and be on your way to prosperity
20:58 < bridge> <_qey> Would be better off asking for ‘how’, rather than figuring out.
20:58 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> okay louis at that point you could just tell him
20:58 < bridge> <sannitt.> what is this yap
20:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the thing is juppy is not even aggressive. the lack of polite suffix in english also kinda kills me sometime.
20:58 < bridge> <sannitt.> shut up
20:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but that's more of an asian thing i think
20:58 < bridge> <louis> you want to ask other people to tell you how to live your entire life?
20:58 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> not personally
20:59 < bridge> <sannitt.> aw louis
20:59 < bridge> <louis> and you come in developer and complain when your questions are not being immediately answered
20:59 < bridge> <sannitt.> w*
20:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> english being a second language also doesn't help
20:59 < bridge> <sannitt.> OOOOHHH
20:59 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> but at that point you want to ask google how to live your life
20:59 < bridge> <_qey> Nope, couldn’t figure out how. I long-pressed his message, there’s no block option. Neither there is one in his profile.
20:59 < bridge> <_qey> Or I’m just blind.
20:59 < bridge> <Ewan> are you on desktop?
20:59 < bridge> <_qey> No.
20:59 < bridge> <sannitt.> bro click the 3 dots
20:59 < bridge> <sannitt.> and block
20:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am never polite, i am neutral. all the stuff i said was neutral
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319393833854832682/IMG_7310.png?ex=6765ccc3&is=67647b43&hm=25cccea1db7490e62ba5a5bd143519852dc8fa4667f78bed150c313b4a30a3bf&
21:00 < bridge> <sannitt.> 😭
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> until YOU @tsfreddie escalated it for no reason
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then he suddenly believed you
21:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> neutral is impolite to asian.
21:00 < bridge> <_qey> LOL, I didn’t see it. Thanks.
21:00 < bridge> <sannitt.> ooooh @tsfreddie why u escalating
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and hated me for doing nothing at all
21:00 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> anyways when is the stupid star bug getting fixed
21:00 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> the random stars that appear when you join a server
21:01 < bridge> <Ewan> isn’t that really hard to trace
21:01 < bridge> <Ewan> probably why it hasnt been fixed
21:01 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> man it has been in for far too long
21:01 < bridge> <_qey> Huh? Never seen that one.
21:01 < bridge> <Ewan> you can debug the stars in the client but as soon as you involve that network boundary of client/server things become 100x harder to diagnose

21:02 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> and probably something with pistol bullets
21:02 < bridge> <Ewan> guys it’s nkt even like moving to offtopic is impractical like it used to be. we have message forwarding in discord now. the context of the conversation will be preserved. please stop polluting this channel
21:02 < bridge> <sannitt.> hell naw
21:02 < bridge> <Ewan> guys it’s not even like moving to offtopic is impractical like it used to be. we have message forwarding in discord now. the context of the conversation will be preserved. please stop polluting this channel
21:03 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i saw like five of them at once its getting out of hand lol
21:03 < bridge> <_qey> I found another bug, when you hold LMB (fire) while in freeze and sv_freeze_delay is set to 1, you will fire a projectile even though you are frozen.
21:03 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> really fun to try to diagnose a bug you can't reproduce :)
21:04 < bridge> <teero777> Not a bug.
21:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Bug but also intended behaviour so actually a feature
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of maps make use of that
21:04 < bridge> <_qey> Why?
21:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Half of DDRace features are bugs
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> they cant retcon it
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> same with dummy
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> same with hooking thru corners
21:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> hammering through walls
21:04 < bridge> <_qey> That was a bug initially? lol.
21:05 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> wackiness with velramp
21:05 < bridge> <Ewan> i think so. not bugs but maybe undesirable behaviors that are now cemented in the gameplay
21:05 < bridge> <Ewan> i think so. not bugs strictly but maybe undesirable behaviors that are now cemented in the gameplay
21:05 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> being able to skip through blockers and doors with speed
21:05 < bridge> <Ewan> any map with blue tp
21:05 < bridge> <_qey> Blockers should be banned.
21:05 < bridge> <Ewan> i think he means stoppers (the one-way entities)
21:05 < bridge> <_qey> I ban blockers ruthlessly on my servers that are not intended for blocking.
21:05 < bridge> <_qey> Oh.
21:05 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah these
21:06 < bridge> <Ewan> idk if they have a formal name
21:06 < bridge> <louis> stoppers
21:06 < bridge> <_qey> Same should really go for DDNet mods. But they’re nonexistent.
21:06 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> isnt there something super buggy about flipped stoppers
21:06 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> louis do you know
21:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> stoppers, blockers, easy to mix up okay :)
21:06 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> pred fucked up?
21:06 < bridge> <louis> you can skip thru them it's buggy
21:06 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i mean u can skip thru normal ones
21:07 < bridge> <louis> err more like lodge yourself in them more easily
21:07 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ah
21:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319395662151815218/Screenshot_20241220_040338.jpg?ex=6765ce77&is=67647cf7&hm=bcc95de0a40c375969355e27f402bca00e9b0f17a05a1d039f5d49f090d4786c&
21:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> im back
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> u can also move thru tp boundaries if 2 adjacent corners are both empty times
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> u need super specific velocity
21:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i can see that now, i am sorry
21:07 < bridge> <_qey> 4 AM, bro, go to bed.
21:07 < bridge> <louis> wot
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> u can also move thru tp boundaries if 2 adjacent corners are both empty tiles
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> edited
21:08 < bridge> <louis> oh
21:08 < bridge> <louis> that's a lot of other tiles too
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> empty as in non-obstructive to physics
21:09 < bridge> <_qey> How about we add a random teleport from tile?
21:09 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> huh
21:09 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> wtf is an adjacent corner
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> create multiple destinations for one tp #
21:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i can see him getting frustrated, i just want you guys to stop talking to each other because he's better off spend time actually doing his work after deen and you already gave him a statement each. and the that's the idea i come up with, which i can see is a poor choice. again, for that, i apologize.
21:09 < bridge> <_qey> I may have not fully addressed the issue.
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i may have messed up the geometry lingo but it’s any 2 angles on opposing sides of a point
21:10 < bridge> <_qey> My brains are too cooked up to say what I want to say.
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> in this case imagine a 2x2 grid where top left and bottom right are tp
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> u can go thru it from the bottom left with specific angle and speed
21:11 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> yeah om
21:11 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> but tele is different to normal tiles
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> they have different collision from most but there are tiles that have the same boundaries/hit detection logic iirc
21:12 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> you cant pass straight through them
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> so technically it’s not just to
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> so technically it’s not just tp
21:12 < bridge> <louis> u can skip basically any other tile in that same configuration
21:13 < bridge> <louis> tele has same hitbox as most other ddnet tiles
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> no i mean
21:13 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> weird ass coding
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> u can’t do it with stage geometry or kill tiles
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> not in the same way at least
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> can with frz
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> that’s all I envision
21:13 < bridge> <sannitt.> what clients are allowed
21:14 < bridge> <louis> yeah i mean those are basically the only other tiles that have different hitbox outside of weapons hearts etc :justatest:
21:14 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> maybe you can with kill
21:14 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> kill is smaller than geometry
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet, tclient, anything that doesn’t automate inputs
21:14 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> but idk
21:14 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> maybe if you have a lot of speed
21:14 < bridge> <teero777> everything is that does not give you an unfair advantage and does not stress the server
21:14 < bridge> <sannitt.> so krx isnt allowed..
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> or do otherwise obviously cheating things
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> krx definitely not
21:14 < bridge> <sannitt.> oh.
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> u know this bro 😭
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> is that why u got goated so fast
21:14 < bridge> <sannitt.> is cactus client allowed
21:14 < bridge> <sannitt.> yeah
21:15 < bridge> <Ewan> probably but I wouldn’t use it
21:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i didn’t hear anything
21:15 < bridge> <sannitt.> is snow tree client allowed
21:15 < bridge> <_qey> Define allowed?
21:15 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> is the doo doo fard client allowed
21:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> don't mention cheat clients names
21:16 < bridge> <sannitt.> or what
21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> allowed in this case can be interpreted as whatever a mod in the server things & is able to back up
21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> there are rules but
21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> nobody really
21:16 < bridge> <sannitt.> my ign is Your_Onii_Chan ban me
21:16 < bridge> <teero777> timeout.
21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> LOL
21:17 < bridge> <sannitt.> woah @teero777 do you have the ability to do that?
21:17 < bridge> <sannitt.> how long is the timeout tho?
21:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> Deleted the message, sannitt pls respect people correcting you.
21:17 < bridge> <sannitt.> what message
21:17 < bridge> <_qey> I see people come here for the sole purpose of trolling, why?
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s funny
21:17 < bridge> <sannitt.> bored
21:18 < bridge> <sannitt.> wait is it a timeout in game or just in server
21:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> MilkeeyCat told you which message and why you shouldn't say it.
21:18 < bridge> <sannitt.> oh krx?
21:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> Good night.
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> 😄
21:18 < bridge> <_qey> Yeah, like you’ll be living for 500 years to waste time on that BS.
21:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> This isn't like a thing you have to pay in compensation for the naughty three letters, it's a punishment
21:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> And just like normal crimes, the punishment is worse if you keep repeating it
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> must be such a thrill to moderate discord
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> you get to justify making stupid petty quips
21:20 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> what about ingame moderation
21:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> It's mostly an annoyance, they keep pushing wanting you to snap. It's rarely people being actually clueless
21:21 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah i mean
21:21 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s more about whether the thing is actually worth getting into
21:21 < bridge> <_qey> Nonexistent.
21:21 < bridge> <_qey> I tried to get a mod on a server once.
21:22 < bridge> <_qey> Failed miserably.
21:22 < bridge> <Ewan> in this company saying the name of the client won’t have an adverse affect on anyone. no noob with intent to cheat is reading these chats
21:22 < bridge> <Ewan> he kept going because it’s funny and it’s a stupid rule
21:22 < bridge> <Ewan> dedicated to the bit
21:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> No, just underpaid ($0) and understaffed
21:22 < bridge> <Ewan> and you end up looking like the ass 😂
21:22 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe we should have better rules
21:22 < bridge> <_qey> So they’re there for exactly what reason then?
21:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Just because you had one bad experience doesn't mean they're not there to help plenty of people
21:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> the only reason we have an overflow of people using it is the constant adds in-game
21:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> And that adds to discord as well
21:23 < bridge> <Ewan> well he wasn’t advertising it by saying its name
21:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> the only reason we have an overflow of people using it is the constant ads in-game
21:23 < bridge> <_qey> No, I had multiple. Only once I was calling for justice.
21:23 < bridge> <Ewan> if anything it’s clear disclosure to anyone reading chat that if they are found to use the client, they will be banned
21:24 < bridge> <_qey> But a mod in all these situations would’ve really helped.
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> but you get caught up in the technicality of him having said it
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> the life of discord moderators
21:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Multiple bad experiences related to one mod request? I guess you should elaborate then to help them do a bit better in the future
21:24 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> is voxel clieny allowed (adds nothing to the client except iy has raytracing)
21:24 < bridge> <_qey> Just ban the client from all DDNet servers and it suddenly becomes obsolete.
21:24 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> is voxel client allowed (adds nothing to the client except iy has raytracing)
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> not like you shouldn’t enforce rules either it’s just funny
21:25 < bridge> <Ewan> if only
21:25 < bridge> <Ewan> It was that simple
21:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> No, RTX tees improve your skill by at least 20%, unfair advantage
21:25 < bridge> <_qey> Multiple bad experiences when an online mod would’ve done justice. Only once I was going through channels to find somebody on my own.
21:26 < bridge> <_qey> It is. As I was saying before, they do public chat and private chat announcements, which contains a link to their website. Just ban the three letters in PM, not instantly, set a threshold.
21:27 < bridge> <_qey> 80-90% of free users are gone.
21:27 < bridge> <_qey> And they spam cooonstantly.
21:27 < bridge> <Ewan> how do you make those bans persist, realistically
21:28 < bridge> <Ewan> what happens if they turn off the advertising
21:28 < bridge> <_qey> It’s a game of annoyance.
21:28 < bridge> <_qey> AFAIK, only paid ones can do that?
21:28 < bridge> <Ewan> if there’s anything the server sidebar shows it’s that more mods != better moderation
21:29 < bridge> <_qey> They’ll eventually get tired of constant bans and hop onto a good client.
21:29 < bridge> <Ewan> you’re on mobile actually but my point is there are a lot of mods who can see public chat and dish out bans and things, still ppl use the client on ddnet servers
21:29 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> :kek:
21:29 < bridge> <_qey> Not to mention like 60% of those are kids and they don’t know anything about avoiding bans.
21:30 < bridge> <Ewan> some ddnet mods have been personally targeted by said kids
21:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> something about too many chefs attending to soup
21:30 < bridge> <Ewan> indeed
21:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> something about too many chefs attending to soup (or was it broth?)
21:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> I have over 70 cases of the n word in my dms alone, all from ddnet :owo:
21:31 < bridge> <_qey> Better moderation = better moderation. Duh.
21:31 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
21:31 < bridge> <Ewan> good luck getting collectively competent mods at $0/hr
21:31 < bridge> <_qey> There’s that thing called passion.
21:31 < bridge> <_qey> Not enough passion? Why the mod status?
21:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> we do have a lot of inactive mods, but that's fair considering a lot of people signed up with free time and then BOOM, life happened
21:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Passion isn't enough, you need emotionally stable adults who won't let the power get to their heads, which are surprisingly rare
21:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> it's also frustrating going into your favourite game and you have people constantly screaming for you to moderate a dropped kys on multeasymap
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> you’re not technically wrong but ddnet is an example of exactly what you’re describing. they have mods, and a fairly delicate process for election, passion only goes so far
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> all i can say is if you think you can do it better, then do it better
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> not so easy right
21:34 < bridge> <Ewan> bureaucratic systems run on passion alone don’t tend to work *that* well on a large scale, ever
21:34 < bridge> <_qey> Of course it’s not, it’s me alone for half a dozen servers vs what, like 20 mods per region?
21:34 < bridge> <Ewan> right
21:35 < bridge> <_qey> Make a report system.
21:35 < bridge> <Ewan> there is one
21:35 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s quite robust
21:35 < bridge> <Ewan> #✉-create-a-ticket
21:35 < bridge> <_qey> I meant an in-game one.
21:36 < bridge> <Ewan> without accounts it’s prone to spam and abuse
21:36 < bridge> <_qey> /report somebody, the report goes to Discord, free mods check out the issue at hand, problem solved.
21:36 < bridge> <_qey> Rate limit them.
21:36 < bridge> <Ewan> what about fraudulent identity
21:37 < bridge> <_qey> I mean like per-server.
21:37 < bridge> <Ewan> lemme join on a second client under another name so i can report this guy i dont like
21:37 < bridge> <_qey> 1 report every 10 min would go a long way.
21:37 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s just not that simple, right now at least
21:38 < bridge> <Ewan> there is something you can do in the meantime, which is aide in implementing accounts, but you probably won’t like that for a few reasons
21:38 < bridge> <_qey> The IP would be identical in most cases.
21:38 < bridge> <Ewan> these kids are absolutely VPN savvy
21:38 < bridge> <Ewan> and no, you can never hope to blacklist every VPN ip
21:38 < bridge> <_qey> It’s not me who won’t like it. People of DDNet won’t like it.
21:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i mainly mean it would involve talking to jupstar 😆
21:39 < bridge> <_qey> Lol. Why?
21:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> who are the people of DDNet you're referring to here, I certainly want accounts :cat_whaaa:
21:39 < bridge> <_qey> :kek:
21:40 < bridge> <_qey> 80% of them are kids. Kids are not good with accounts. Not to mention you’ll be legally required to do a shit ton of law-abiding things, since you’ll be handling data of <13 yo kids.
21:40 < bridge> <Ewan> anyone know issue # for accounts?
21:40 < bridge> <_qey> Yes, there are savvy ones. But they’re not a majority.
21:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> He's like the main person to have made any progress on account-related work
21:41 < bridge> <Ewan> or, they can say don’t use if under 13, then the child is responsible
21:41 < bridge> <Ewan> coppa is complicated but there arent that many considerations
21:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> what data? It's not like we'll safe the personal data of someone apart from an optional email if you don't auth via Steam or maybe discord(?)
21:42 < bridge> <Ewan> iirc the flow was just simple pub key identities bound to emails
21:42 < bridge> <_qey> Unfortunately, that’s not how it works. Companies are being blamed for not figuring out the kid was under 13.
21:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> username + password login is the basedest thing
21:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> A public key is even more based but you can't expect normies to handle those
21:42 < bridge> <_qey> Then it defeats the purpose. Just spam the accounts.
21:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> username + password login (without emails) is the basedest thing
21:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> A public key is even more based but you can't expect normies to handle those
21:43 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s much more work but yes still hard
21:43 < bridge> <Ewan> nobody has that down to an exact science unless they store and verify your SSN or some shit
21:43 < bridge> <Ewan> I really don’t know what you want
21:44 < bridge> <_qey> I first came to Teeworlds back in 2013. It was a better place.
21:44 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s much more work but yes still possible
21:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> That's the case for every single online service there is.
21:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
21:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> But what's the point on having 8272 dead accounts
21:44 < bridge> <_qey> I want it to be that way.
21:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's already done, you go do the cpp implementation and it'll work
21:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the best we have without national ID is payment card based verification and that only works for adults
21:44 < bridge> <_qey> The same reason people come here just to troll.
21:45 < bridge> <_qey> Not to mention that having an account-based game is just an another vector of attack.
21:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://tenor.com/view/bunny-wth-confused-huh-what-gif-6154003038879814
21:46 < bridge> <_qey> There are certainly some pros to it, but… Cons outweigh IMO.
21:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i understand your frustration but you’re directing it at us like we can do anything about the state of the game
21:46 < bridge> <Ewan> as soon as this game got popular on twitch & tiktok it was over
21:47 < bridge> <louis> holy gatekeep
21:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> Louis when linear 2, we're waiting
21:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> a big community will automatically have a ton of idiots and assholes, nothing you can do about that
21:47 < bridge> <Ewan> wait who
21:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> <a:Scared:1132025669115727962>
21:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You just deal with it.
21:47 < bridge> <_qey> Gotta love Discord.
21:47 < bridge> <_qey> What, why can I sent an image?
21:48 < bridge> <Ewan> why can you?
21:48 < bridge> <Ewan> because it’s often helpful in communicating
21:48 < bridge> <_qey> Uhm… Because it’s a dev channel…
21:48 < bridge> <_qey> Can’t*
21:48 < bridge> <_qey> What, why can’t I sent an image?
21:48 < bridge> <Ewan> you can’t? news to mr
21:48 < bridge> <Ewan> you can’t? news to me
21:48 < bridge> <_qey> I can’t.
21:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319406123346038929/unreachable_code.png?ex=6765d835&is=676486b5&hm=f7436b3f4ca1ca51fa1db52941a3d9278a8294f7d1cb8e75c1bb23b5968a714c&
21:48 < bridge> <_qey> It just goes red.
21:49 < bridge> <_qey> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319406166094118912/IMG_8973.png?ex=6765d83f&is=676486bf&hm=8e4fe28c376eddb8e793dc1711cbd9a758553a41eba6947a8eaf2da3b71c929f&
21:49 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah but we still don’t control the game’s outward appearance and crowd
21:49 < bridge> <_qey> lol.
21:49 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s an open source project run on donations for server costs
21:49 < bridge> <Ewan> there’s no fucking marketing budget
21:49 < bridge> <_qey> Worked after like 10 tries.
21:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> :justatest:
21:50 < bridge> <_qey> So, I was saying, gotta love Discord.
21:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> Only tomorrow left, then I have an entire week to finish my launcher 💥
21:50 < bridge> <_qey> Melon Client?
21:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> Side project where I'm learning go
21:51 < bridge> <_qey> I didn’t say there is. Again, passion. I run servers out of passion.
21:51 < bridge> <_qey> I code for DDNet out of passion.
21:51 < bridge> <_qey> I’m paying out of my own pocket.
21:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> You code for passion
21:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> I code for purple name
21:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
21:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> We are not the same
21:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> REAL
21:52 < bridge> <Ewan> so true
21:52 < bridge> <Ewan> (me with 2 merged PRs
21:52 < bridge> <_qey> I actually code for some monetary gain, but let’s not talk about that.
21:52 < bridge> <Ewan> me too
21:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok but what if I'm passionate about purple names?
21:53 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> LOL
21:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i understand the frustration but unless you can come up with a realistic scenario where our actions actually influence the problem then we’ll be here talking about it forever
21:54 < bridge> <syrinok> I regret to inform you, your name is blue.
21:54 < bridge> <_qey> Find me a cure for burning out and I will code you a perfect server.
21:54 < bridge> <Ewan> if your goal is to talk about it and feel the doom then that’s fine too but don’t point the blame at the devs/admins
21:54 < bridge> <Ewan> no longer saying we because i’m not that involved, but
21:55 < bridge> <Ewan> :feelsbadman:
21:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Confident I see :)
21:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but yeah I feel ya
21:55 < bridge> <_qey> Did I tho?
21:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> a fair bit yeah
21:55 < bridge> <_qey> I’m Elon Musk jr, there’s a fucking storm of ideas in my head.
21:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> :NotLikeKogasa:
21:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You did NOT just compare yourself to Musk
21:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> resign now and claim your purple
21:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> actual insane works
21:56 < bridge> <_qey> I blame the problem for its existence, not people ‘responsible’ for it.
21:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> As bencie said
21:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
21:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> Demoted to moderator
21:57 < bridge> <_qey> I didn’t. I compared the storm of ideas in our heads.
21:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i once was demoted to music bot
21:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/767122790943555614
21:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok cool
21:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> As for my second gripe, it's not really *ideas* that make good software :P
21:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> *especially* not *storms* of ideas :D :D
21:58 < bridge> <Ewan> thanks for clearing that up. i will take this at face value but just know that beforehand i genuinely did think you were blaming because of your language
21:59 < bridge> <Ewan> overall demeanor
21:59 < bridge> <Ewan> no problems though
21:59 < bridge> <_qey> It’s actually the abundance of ideas that makes us progress. You can’t make something before thinking about it.
21:59 < bridge> <_qey> Is there a problem with how I say things?
21:59 < bridge> <Ewan> not inherently. if you feel like you’re misinterpreted often then maybe you could choose your words more carefully tho
21:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You said you were aware of your tone earlier but we're feeling rather doubtful...
22:00 < bridge> <_qey> That’s me.
22:00 < bridge> <Ewan> there you go
22:00 < bridge> <_qey> I’m just toxic.
22:00 < bridge> <_qey> I know my words sting.
22:00 < bridge> <_qey> I don’t mean it.
22:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> :kek:
22:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> I just realized your name is gaygay 
22:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
22:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> I admire your passion
22:00 < bridge> <_qey> It’s how I am and I can do nothing about it. I’m being the nicest you y’all.
22:01 < bridge> <_qey> It’s how I am and I can do nothing about it. I’m being the nicest to y’all.
22:01 < bridge> <_qey> Not taking Jupiter in consideration.
22:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm sure you can do something about it but I'm aware that sort of thing takes time
22:02 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah that’s all well and good. i have no inherent issue with your demeanor. i feel like you might though, because to us your words were conflicting with your intent
22:03 < bridge> <Ewan> whatever that says about us doesn’t really matter. maybe we are stuck up or read into things too much. but that’s the collective of people in this channel
22:03 < bridge> <_qey> No, I’m taking no issue. I just want to be heard the way I intend it to sound, not the way it actually sounds.
22:03 < bridge> <_qey> Doesn’t happen too often tho.
22:04 < bridge> <_qey> Thanks for noticing. So lovely of you.
22:05 < bridge> <_qey> Me being me, I want to jump off a cliff after being that nice.
22:05 < bridge> <Ewan> such is life
22:07 < bridge> <_qey> And that’s all the wrote.
22:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i just looked at the clock man i gotta write code or i’ll get in trouble

22:08 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean it’s December so mostly my team has checked out already but i already spent so much time in here today lol
22:08 < bridge> <_qey> Same here, but I’ve got all night.
22:10 < bridge> <_qey> On the second by second graph it was 300.
22:10 < bridge> <_qey> But I guess that’s average.
22:11 < bridge> <Ewan> i don’t have a great frame of reference for this
22:11 < bridge> <Ewan> depends on connected clients & whether they have things like showall enabled
22:11 < bridge> <Ewan> but that certainly is a number
22:13 < bridge> <_qey> Nah, I had 165 players with bandwidth usage close to none, then the DDoS came.
22:14 < bridge> <_qey> It is extremely unusual for DDNet to have that amount of traffic.
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> 🤷
22:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> what about my passion of actually being gay
22:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> I respect it
22:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :greenthing:
22:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Wait how did I just now realize that it's DDraceNetwork not DDRaceNetwork
22:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> Dummydrag race network
22:21 < bridge> <pioooooo> R u
22:22 < bridge> <_qey> Dylan you my mommy yummy dragon race network
22:23 < bridge> <_qey> I’m off
22:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> most ide spell checker be like: Ddrace
22:24 < bridge> <Ewan> DummyDrag race Network
22:24 < bridge> <Ewan> is his point
22:24 < bridge> <Ewan> as opposed to Dummy Drag Race Network
22:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> Dummy Dragrace Network 💃
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
22:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> yaas queen
22:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 💅
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i envision a group of mentally handicapped individuals wreaking havoc on sidestreets
22:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oof
22:27 < bridge> <Ewan> drag race != drag show fwiw
22:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> right
22:35 < bridge> <swarfey> out of curiosity, did it start today at (roughly) 10:20?
22:35 < bridge> <swarfey> out of curiosity, did it start today at (roughly) 10:20 CET?
22:35 < bridge> <swarfey> thats when my servers got attacked too
22:38 < bridge> <_qey> I won’t tell you exactly when, but it came in two waves, one in the first half of the day, I’d say in the morning, the second a few hours after.
22:38 < bridge> <swarfey> hmm okay
22:39 < bridge> <_qey> Those here spanning like an hour-two each.
22:39 < bridge> <_qey> Those were spanning like an hour-two each.
22:41 < bridge> <_qey> Does your region speak Cyrillic?
22:42 < bridge> <swarfey> I am hosting the server in germany - but there are a lot of russian people starting to join lately, yes
22:43 < bridge> <swarfey> > https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/176.116.18.87
22:43 < bridge> <swarfey> seems that someone is spoofing tw server ips again, idk - same shit happened 8 months ago already

22:43 < bridge> <swarfey> seems that someone is spoofing tw server ips again, idk - same shit happened 8 months ago already
22:48 < bridge> <_qey> My IP is listed there too, reports from 13-14 hours ago.
22:49 < bridge> <_qey> That’s when Hentzner sent a complaint to my provider.
22:49 < bridge> <_qey> That’s when Hetzner sent a complaint to my provider.
22:50 < bridge> <swarfey> I see - could you share which server you are hosting? Is it a copy love box server by any chance?
22:50 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s fairly annoying
22:50 < bridge> <_qey> One of them is, a modification.
22:51 < bridge> <_qey> But it wasn’t the one attacked.
22:51 < bridge> <swarfey> i see, im also hosting multiple servers, one of them is copy love box. someone is probably targetting them
22:51 < bridge> <swarfey> oh
22:51 < bridge> <_qey> Linear one was attacked. None of the others were directly impacted.
22:52 < bridge> <swarfey> ah 😂 yeah then its probably linear hosters instead that get targetted
22:52 < bridge> <swarfey> I also was running 2 instances of it
22:53 < bridge> <swarfey> well, i sent a mail to my hoster. It should be unblocked soon, same procedure 8 months ago
22:54 < bridge> <_qey> I guess I have a more lenient provider. You’re the second person telling me their server was suspended.
22:54 < bridge> <_qey> I just got a notification and 12 hours to resolve the issue.
22:55 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe you wouldn’t get attacked if you didn’t host such lowest common denominator maps on your servers
22:55 < bridge> <Ewan> half joking
22:55 < bridge> <swarfey> yeah well i didnt receive any notification. I woke up to people reporting me that the server is down, and only 3 out of 8 instances are reachable. weird enough that they only blocked selected ports
22:55 < bridge> <_qey> Then I just straight up black listed all Hetzner’s subnets, because they were the one complaining.
22:56 < bridge> <_qey> And the next attack I didn’t receive any notifications from the provider.
22:57 < bridge> <_qey> There may be not enough servers in people’s regions with good reach reachability and ping.
22:57 < bridge> <_qey> It’s a mystery to me why some prefer my servers over the DDNet or the likes.
22:58 < bridge> <_qey> There may be not enough servers in people’s regions with good reachability and ping.
23:00 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ermmm typo? 1 players?
23:00 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319424134156910673/image.png?ex=6765e8fb&is=6764977b&hm=4faaf51870ef62dc144d43d82baec4590960612d816bdaa69b072ce539ca753c&
23:00 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> unplayable game?
23:01 < bridge> <_qey> The default is 4. So they just changed it to 1 and the text stays the same.
23:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> around here we don't do proper pluralization because localization is enough of a pain without going the extra mile
23:14 < bridge> <Ewan> if you set it up heuristically it’s really not hard to get right
23:14 < bridge> <Ewan> stop treating english like debug output and create a proper grammar
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> of some kind
23:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> easy to do with a ternary
23:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> and used across the code already AFAIR
23:17 < bridge> <Ewan> that as well though now you have to localize the word on its own
23:17 < bridge> <Ewan> instead of the sentence
23:17 < bridge> <louis> player(s) boom ez solve
23:17 < bridge> <kebscs> #9011
23:17 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9011
23:17 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s server msg anyway tho so it’s just english :thonk: c
23:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> yep!
23:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> you'd just do "text %i %s", amount, amount <= 1 ? "player" : "players"); iirc
23:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> yep!
23:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> you'd just do `("text %i %s", amount, amount <= 1 ? "player" : "players");` iirc
23:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> to be fair, that's ugly as hell
23:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> but it works
23:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> woops, you happen to support a language where there's a different form for when there are exactly two of a thing
23:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> i dont understand :c
23:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> some languages have dual in addition to singular and plural
23:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> some have paucal, which is used when there are a few of a thing, but not enough to consider many
23:22 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah that too
23:22 < bridge> <Ewan> you can usually get away with a sentence builder
23:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> builder :justatest:
23:22 < bridge> <Ewan> yerp
23:23 < bridge> <Ewan> ad hoc collection of str_formats where the lexically distinct sections are composed
23:23 < bridge> <Ewan> or something of that nature
23:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> OH YOU MEANT.. i thought you were referring to programming languages which made me so confused
23:23 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfaoo
23:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> stuff like
23:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> `One book`
23:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> `two book`
23:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> `books`
23:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> right?
23:23 < bridge> <Ewan> TIL ddnet is written in english
23:24 < bridge> <Ewan> Many languages can have different words entirely
23:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Truly deserving of the blue name 😔
23:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> :thisemoji:
23:24 < bridge> <Ewan> or like a different leading conjunction
23:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> ewan, do you use a seperate repo for your devshells, are you only keeping them locally or are you dumping them into your regular dotfiles
23:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> i dont know where to put mine :kekw:
23:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i have a dotfiles monorepo but it’s quite chaotic
23:26 < bridge> <Ewan> my dev shells stay in the working trees of their respective projects tho
23:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Still easier than dealing with RTL text :frozen:
23:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i’ve kind of phased out vague dev shells cuz they’re usually easy enough to tailor to the project
23:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> yeah i used to have a single template in which i have core things in at all times like debuggers and formatters and only adjust actual dependencies when needed, but it feels messy doing it that way
23:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> maybe i just use to many languages, c++, rust, go, sometimes js/ts, python
23:29 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah that’s true as well with the existence of the template repo functionality i hardly even write one anyway
23:29 < bridge> <Ewan> i just have nix fetch the template from online
23:29 < bridge> <Ewan> usually the only things about the flake that matter to me are the packages so it’s not too bad
23:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> i used devenv for a while but having it add 3 files and 2 hidden directories into each project was meh
23:30 < bridge> <Ewan> no good
23:30 < bridge> <Ewan> usually the only things about the flake that matter to me are the packages so it’s not too bad to change them between projects
23:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> melon why did you just turn into a likely spammer?

23:34 < bridge> <sannitt.> jk bro i wont do it again
23:34 < bridge> <sannitt.> chillll
23:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is that a moderator feature?
23:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to flag someone as spammer
23:34 < bridge> <sannitt.> maybe flag me as one
23:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I've never seen anything related to it, I think it's just automatic detection?
23:34 < bridge> <syrinok> I don't believe so?
23:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> IT HAPPENS ON OTHER SERVERS TOO
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's just funny that melon is a spammer now
23:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> AAAAA
23:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319432881181032498/image.png?ex=6765f120&is=67649fa0&hm=3063f7f4b54648aeafa7dee2e1911a39ad3133a674e386c404c24f3008719858&
23:35 < bridge> <syrinok> What the hell did you do melon
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i wonder if that stays this way forever
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDDDDD
23:35 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> LOL
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they clearly saw through this
23:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you tried to scam with x86
23:36 < bridge> <chairn> IA will kill internet given the way corporations use it
23:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wait
23:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> google says something about x86 virtualization with a webinterface, OSS ofc
23:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> test
23:36 < bridge> <chairn> who will stay on platform where they can't exchange properly ?
23:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> test
23:37 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> dude check your account status
23:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this is the funniest discord moment ever
23:37 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> see if its like, in limited or smth
23:37 < bridge> <totar> that's insane they would do that to a 2016 account
23:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he even pays for nitro xD
23:37 < bridge> <syrinok> Did you copy paste some spam message or something and get autoflagged
23:39 < bridge> <oxyzo.> someone reported melon
23:39 < bridge> <totar> @blaiszephyr you have to create a discord support ticket
23:39 < bridge> <totar> they fix it in a few days apparently
23:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> on it rn, god damn it
23:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can you all read the replied msg?
23:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's also kinda a bug in discord xD
23:39 < bridge> <syrinok> ya
23:39 < bridge> <totar> https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new
23:39 < bridge> <oxyzo.> check this thing idk

23:40 < bridge> <louis> melon isnt a spammer for me
23:40 < bridge> <sannitt.> same
23:40 < bridge> <chairn> where is that on desktop app ?
23:40 < bridge> <oxyzo.> somewhere in privacy/safety things idk
23:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319434303641489409/image.png?ex=6765f273&is=6764a0f3&hm=6a84503a1b3e06cb2c9171978fe97210c555bdbae388295498d899585a014caa&
23:40 < bridge> <totar> lol
23:41 < bridge> <chairn> maybe it's the use of the weird n character in the anme ?
23:41 < bridge> <oxyzo.> why would it be that:greenthing:
23:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> whaat, that's even weirder, press f5 xd
23:42 < bridge> <chairn> lol, is it locally determined by the app ?
23:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Maybe it hasn't propagated to all regions?
23:42 < bridge> <oxyzo.> no i don't think so
23:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or is he in your friendlist?
23:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> tater added me to test it, it's still.
23:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> tater added me to test it, it's still marked as spam :kekw:.
23:43 < bridge> <chairn> interestingly there's a small cross on the left of the spam message, but you can't click it
23:43 < bridge> <syrinok> I always knew melon was a criminal
23:43 < bridge> <oxyzo.> shouldn't have spammed tbh
23:43 < bridge> <chairn> demote him
23:43 < bridge> <oxyzo.> thats just an icon
23:43 < bridge> <chairn> he's showing the wrong example
23:43 < bridge> <syrinok> Bad look for a moderator tbh, he'll be removed soon
23:44 < bridge> <oxyzo.> same with blocked messages
23:44 < bridge> <oxyzo.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1319435177369534464/Screenshot_20241220-014359.png?ex=6765f344&is=6764a1c4&hm=bec6858ec25ab0fa1834d22d78d74c7c41bb7b6153c62dfccbc636f657b072af&

23:45 < bridge> <oxyzo.> months
23:45 < bridge> <oxyzo.> :greenthing:
23:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> thanks for your discord pw again btw
23:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i wonder if someone simply reported one of your messages
23:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and discord bot was like, ok bye
23:46 < bridge> <oxyzo.> this is the reason
23:46 < bridge> <oxyzo.> its usually because of reports
23:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> 😭
23:46 < bridge> <sannitt.> it wasnt me i swear
23:48 < bridge> <oxyzo.> or its just discord drunk
