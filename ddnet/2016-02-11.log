00:49 < eeeee> if login server is http behind cloudflare or sth then it could theoretically work
00:50 < eeeee> if we had access to hardware firewalls upstream of our servers, we could totally just require people to do a http handshake with another server before they are whitelisted in the firewall for the game server
00:55 < eeeee> some providers even do provide such an access (like ovh or ec2) but unfortunately the limit on max number of whitelisted ips is too low
10:22 <@EastByte> eeeee: well, it's about hosting in Iran, same situation with Chile and Brazil
10:22 <@EastByte> the server providers themselves probably cannot withstand the ddos attacks
16:06 < ACTom> hello, is there a standalone demo viewer?
16:06 <@EastByte> nope
16:09 < ACTom> EastByte: thanks
16:10 <@EastByte> No big deal!
16:12 < ACTom> When sdl2 branch will merge to master?
18:06 < fstd> i recommend the linux distributions that end in BSD
19:05 < switcher_> ok next question, any recommendations on text editors
19:06 < fstd> one of the vi remakes
19:06 < fstd> i.e. vim or nvi
19:06 < fstd> sorta matter of taste
19:08 < switcher_> thanks for the answer
19:09 < laxa> switcher_: I wouldn't recommend using BSD if you are new to those OS
19:09 < laxa> and they aren't linux
19:09 < laxa> they are UNIX
19:09 < Gabeee> switcher_: if you're using linux.. there is no real recommendation
19:10 < Gabeee> For example, I'm more a nano person, vim is probably more oriented for coding
19:10 < laxa> ubuntu/debian are the most popular linux
19:10 < Gabeee> It depends on your usage
19:10 < laxa> text editors, depends if you want a console one or a graphic one...
19:10 < laxa> read the internet to make up your mind about all those topics
19:10 < laxa> no one has the perfect answer :)
19:10 < deen> or just try out stuff
19:11 < laxa> yes also ^^
19:11 < deen> I don't think I ever read about Linux, BSDs, vim etc, just tried them
19:11 < Gabeee> yep, try everything!
19:11 < fstd> it's not like linux is fundamentally easier than BSD, especially these days
19:11 < fstd> quite the opposite IME
19:11 < Gabeee> (except gentoo ofc)
19:12 < laxa> everyone has it's own opinion
19:12 < deen> Gabeee: hey, i started with gentoo :(
19:12 < laxa> ubuntu and debian are easy to install, not sure we can say the same about BSD OS
19:12 < Gabeee> deen: wow..
19:12 < Gabeee> I started with mandriva, then ubuntu, I'm on Arch now..
19:12 < Gabeee> I wanted to go back on ubuntu/fedora, but they're too heavy for my usage
19:14 < fstd> installing ubuntu/whateverlinux/BSD is a matter of locating the enter key
19:14 < fstd> installing gentoo is about figuring out how to copypaste from the handbook into a terminal :)
19:14 < fstd> and waiting
19:15 <@heinrich5991> I found it easier to install ubuntu than to install arch linux
19:16 <@heinrich5991> despite arch probably having a similar level of documentation as gentoo
19:16 < Gabeee> Come on.. we all know Arch has the best wiki :P
19:17 < Gabeee> Arch isn't for everyone tho
19:17 <@heinrich5991> I'm using arch, but I still think that ubuntu was easier to install
19:18 < Gabeee> I've been trying ubuntu 10 minutes ago in a VM.. I can't handle it anymore
19:18 < Gabeee> All the stuff about privacy gets me dizzy
19:19 <@heinrich5991> you could try some flavor of ubuntu, e.g. xubuntu
19:19 <@heinrich5991> or fedora
19:21 < deen> fstd: the only thing I'm worried about on BSD is drivers for customer hardware
19:21 < o_be_one> Gabeee: privacy are same everywhere ... Just bullshit
19:22 < o_be_one> Gabeee: i mean Ubuntu if you dont install their soft, so if you install it as server, what about your privacy ?
19:22 < o_be_one> theres nothing in, just aptitude stats like with Debian and all distros
19:23 < switcher_> I installed Fedora, lets see how it goes
19:23 < o_be_one> I was "pro debian" but now i use more often Ubuntu as server just cause it's really easyer to do what i need, it takes 5 mins to deploy a new serv with it for me
19:23 < o_be_one> Fedora is good, but for desktop. For server use, prefer CentOS
19:24 < o_be_one> for desktop the best linux i met is Linux Mint
19:24 < switcher_> I just wanted to programm some nim on it anyways, should be good enough
19:24 < o_be_one> just all-in-one made easy :)
19:24 < switcher_> so I need a text editor which supports nim :D
19:24 < deen> switcher_: nice!
19:24 < switcher_> is there any?
19:24 < o_be_one> vi :D
19:24 < Gabeee> o_be_one: In unity, the searches are sent over the net, there are statistics and stuff too
19:24 < o_be_one> universal :p
19:24 < Gabeee> o_be_one: ubuntu as a server is okay, but as a desktop.. not really, at least for me
19:25 < deen> switcher_: https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/wiki/Editor-Support
19:25 < o_be_one> Gabeee: i talk about server ... But if you talk about Unity, Unity is a big shit :D
19:25 < switcher_> deen:  thank you good sir
19:25 < Gabeee> o_be_one: it is!
19:25 < Gabeee> o_be_one: why would you use ubuntu if not for unity
19:25 < Gabeee> :D
19:26 < o_be_one> Gabeee: stats are everywhere, event on Arch ... btw. Unity just add "ads" in his Unity, it's easy to disable, option is in the control panel, it's not like if you had to edit some files or tweak with tiers app
19:26 < o_be_one> Linux Mint bro, Cinnamon and Mate power !
19:26 < Gabeee> "stats are everywhere, event on Arch ..."
19:26 < o_be_one> Linux Mint is Ubuntu based, but with a better desktop
19:26 < Gabeee> I'd like to know where
19:27 < o_be_one> Gabeee: lol just check app you installed, they all do stats, and theyr repo do the same job, fortunatly ! its useful to know what is the most wanted in a product
19:27 < Gabeee> I've been on Arch for more than 5 years, I even tracked all the data going through my computer few times and there is nothing big, really
19:27 < deen> o_be_one: eh, i hope i don't run any programs that phone their "stats" home
19:28 < Gabeee> deen: I hope it too :P
19:28 < Gabeee> o_be_one: if you use ufw (and the gui) you can block everything.. I ran wireshark on the machine, except the apps I know using the net, there is nothing suspicious or unexpected
19:31 < deen> and except DDNet client, it calls home to find out the version and servers :P
19:33 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: I believe that is opt-in
19:33 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: package pkgstats
19:33 <@heinrich5991> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pkgstats
19:34 < o_be_one> nice, like ubuntu and debians asks it during installation
19:34 < o_be_one> its optin too
19:35 < deen> and something like that SHOULD always be opt-in. imagine installing software forbidden in a country (tor?) and pkgstats sends that information around the world, making it interceptable for your government
19:35 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: arch doesn't have an installer, not sure how it could ask
19:35 <@heinrich5991> deen: could be done securely, https with pinned cert
19:35 < o_be_one> all personnal informations must be optin
19:36 < o_be_one> but most of the time you just cant choose, you are a stat, even for Quakenet :p
19:36 < o_be_one> I dont want that DDNet follows me when i play on their server, how i can do that ? Just not possible. Where's my optin ? Not existant.
19:36 < o_be_one> (its a joke, i dont care if i'm a stat for DDNet too)
19:37 < deen> o_be_one: i know i know. i thought about asking on first start, but imagined that people would complain if they can't see servers then^^
19:37 < o_be_one> :D
19:37 < deen> anyway, cl_ddnet_version_server "" and it can't call home
19:38 < o_be_one> but its useful for you to know what works and what doesnt work
19:38 < o_be_one> you know with that what to do next
19:38 < o_be_one> where to go with DDNet, and that helped to do a good ddrace network
19:42 <@heinrich5991> that's the same everywhere
19:42 <@heinrich5991> (that reasoning)
19:43 <@heinrich5991> see e.g. the arch linux link above
