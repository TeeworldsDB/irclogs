00:49 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> is there currently any way to get the client to load a demo file from a server? im wondering if loading a evil demo file would be a attack surfires worth looking into
01:11 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> no there is not
01:21 < bridge> <Solly> mods often open demo files
01:21 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> wdym?
01:21 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> also how do i build the tools?
01:21 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> wait nvm they automaticly build
01:21 < bridge> <Solly> in #
01:21 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ?
01:22 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> whats #?
01:23 < bridge> <Solly> sorry my internet has died for some reason
01:23 < bridge> <Solly> in #‚úâ-create-a-ticket 
01:23 < bridge> <Solly> if someones blocking u might upload a demo to prove it
01:48 < bridge> <kebscs> why client doesnt keep the number of players but always loops max_clients instead?
01:52 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ah ok good to know
01:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The players are usually held in an array that uses client ids as indecies
01:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The highest used id does not always match the player count
01:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It would require new data structures
01:58 < bridge> <kebscs> counting players from m_apPlayerInfos?
02:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don‚Äôt know client code to well I am more a server dev
02:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But I am pretty sure it has the same max clients arrays
02:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not sure what you mean with this
02:02 < bridge> <kebscs> so if client receives all player infos every snap, why not count players and loop it instead of max clients
02:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Could you link the code?
02:04 < bridge> <kebscs> nvm i forgot its not sorted
02:04 < bridge> <kebscs> but these are
02:04 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1347012010034069604/image.png?ex=67ca4631&is=67c8f4b1&hm=5a3437e9ca3a57f7c0401b2b6247343de7143cd90ef070827b6b113f93c68b5e&
02:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> yea that‚Äôs what I mean with the data structures. It‚Äôs mostly arrays where the elements are spread across the array and do not fill up the beginning or the end
02:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Depending on how players reconnect
02:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea the sorted ones could exit the loop early I suppose
02:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There might be room for improvement not sure. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised. We do other things that are way more expensive than 128 continue checks I assume
02:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Question is is keeping count even worth it. It‚Äôs a code complexity vs runtime trade off.
02:15 < bridge> <kebscs> i had to add it so it updates the player count for this
02:15 < bridge> <kebscs> it should be simple to implement elsewhere
02:21 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ummmmm lol 200%

10:10 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ill tell you if it found any when i get back up
10:49 < bridge> <Assa> @kebscs Thank you for the "Test map locally" feature, this is amazing!
10:50 < bridge> <kebscs> üòÑ
10:53 < bridge> <Assa> üôà
10:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I saw that Test map locally does not connect to the correct server if a local server on 8303 is already running xd
11:00 < bridge> <Assa> well this makes sense, doesn't it? xD
11:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well it cannot log into rcon then
11:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I guess the fact that we cannot start a server inside the client kinda limits our abilities
11:04 < bridge> <kebscs> It just calls connect localhost so it'll connect to the first port with local server
11:12 < bridge> <Assa> I never was able to login into rcon with this feature, as see my ticket
11:12 < bridge> <Assa> log into, login to, login into what is english
11:13 < bridge> <Assa> ^this was a duplicate
11:27 < bridge> <Assa> interesting, the local server doesn't log me in even with `Client()->RconAuth("", aRandomPass, g_Config.m_ClDummy);` called
11:31 < bridge> <kebscs> Maybe you've changed login
11:31 < bridge> <kebscs> Username
11:32 < bridge> <Assa> that's not in my autoexec. If I start my local server normally, I can simply login with my password defined there. If I start it with the in-editor-option, the password is overwritten
11:32 < bridge> <Assa> because it tries to autologin
11:39 < bridge> <kebscs> and it doesnt auto log you in?
11:39 < bridge> <Assa> nope
11:41 < bridge> <Assa> and If I press the button again, it even tells me i am not authorized or connected (while I am connected):
11:41 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1347157105034920006/screenshot_2025-03-06_11-40-36.png?ex=67cacd52&is=67c97bd2&hm=3bcdf1f4ac68e7c2721229d53dad17d122d9d91f2b1b5f69bdc2e457a98f1af0&
11:41 < bridge> <kebscs> weird
11:55 < bridge> <Assa> @kebscs we could use (pStorage->ReadFile)[<https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/cd6a4373aff7d525bbd053ccb27ac71edaf57923/src/engine/shared/storage.cpp#L584>] and simply check if an rcon exists already. There are parsing options in the console, but none of them seem to match our usecase
11:56 < bridge> <kebscs> better to do what roby's issue says than scan pc autoexec for password
11:56 < bridge> <kebscs> this doesnt sound like a secure idea
11:56 < bridge> <Assa> server scans for autoexec anyways but okay
11:57 < bridge> <kebscs> client doesnt, the client needs to know the password to auth
12:01 < bridge> <Assa> how does auth_add work? It takes an ident, a level and a password, but what are ident and level options?
12:01 < bridge> <kebscs> havent looked into it yet
12:04 < bridge> <Assa> ` "level can be one of {\"admin\", \"mod(erator)\", \"helper\"}"`
12:06 < bridge> <kebscs> ident = identificator/key
12:06 < bridge> <Assa> so to summarize:
12:06 < bridge> <Assa> `auth_add editor-local-server admin password` or
12:06 < bridge> <Assa> so to summarize:
12:06 < bridge> <Assa> `auth_add editor-local-server admin password`
12:06 < bridge> <kebscs> yea i guess
12:08 < bridge> <Assa> and use RconAuth("editor-local-server", ...) are you fine if I do the PR or do you want to do it?
12:08 < bridge> <kebscs> you can do the pr, im doing the discord rp thing rn
12:15 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Does anyone know what's total width and height of CUIRect?
12:15 < bridge> <kebscs> CUIRect has w and h values
12:16 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> I mean, if the rect is as big as your screen
12:17 < bridge> <teero777> There is a Screen() function that returns a rect of your screen
12:17 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> ok, thx
12:20 < bridge> <Assa> @kebs this also doesn't log me in. The normal rcon now works for me, but I have a 1/30 wrong passwords
12:21 < bridge> <kebscs> debug it
12:21 < bridge> <kebscs> maybe the ident isnt username
12:21 < bridge> <Assa> how do I login with user password in rcon?
12:22 < bridge> <Assa> I can only enter a password there
12:22 < bridge> <kebscs> yea then theres no user
12:22 < bridge> <kebscs> just RconAuth("", pass)
12:23 < bridge> <Assa> I used "add_user" instead of "auth_user" ü§¶
12:23 < bridge> <Assa> i need more coffee
12:32 < bridge> <Assa> `2025-03-06 12:32:04 I chatresp: No such command: auth_user.  `
12:32 < bridge> <Assa> huh?
12:33 < bridge> <Assa> its fucking `auth_add` .....
12:37 < bridge> <Assa> `2025-03-06 12:36:30 I server: ClientId=0 authed with key=editor-local-server (admin) `
12:37 < bridge> <Assa> Now I am authed, but rcon still asks for username password?
12:38 < bridge> <Assa> also I auth before I join the server
12:39 < bridge> <Assa> I auth before I join the server, because the server asks for password, there are multiple issues on top of each other
12:42 < bridge> <robyt3> Are you using persistent mode and tmpfs already? The exec speed still looks rather slow
12:42 < bridge> <kebscs> how does it connect you when theres a password
12:42 < bridge> <Assa> it asks for the password
12:42 < bridge> <Assa> the server password in autoexec
12:43 < bridge> <Assa> I added a fourth command now witch sets password ""
12:43 < bridge> <Assa> because with sv_register 0 this is useless anyway
12:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Can you use the rcon auth to pass the server password or does that only work for reserved slots?
12:46 < bridge> <Assa> The server respons with a successful auth, but the client doesn't know (is my guess)
12:46 < bridge> <Assa> So I should be able to pass the password through this, but we don't know the password at this stage
12:47 < bridge> <robyt3> You don't need the password if you can use the existing rcon auth instead
12:47 < bridge> <robyt3> You can join reserved slots with password "username:password" but I don't know if that works without a reserved slot
12:48 < bridge> <Assa> do you see any benefit in letting the password in for your local server? I mean technically another person from your network could join
12:50 < bridge> <kebscs> yea chillerdragon plays on public networks
12:51 < bridge> <robyt3> If it works with that feature I mentioned then using the rcon auth to bypass the server password would be cleaner
12:51 < bridge> <Assa> Two questions: 
12:51 < bridge> <Assa> - How do we add a reserved slot
12:51 < bridge> <Assa> - How do we join it out of the client?
12:51 < bridge> <robyt3> Is the reserved slot even necessary or does rcon auth work for server password in general?
12:53 < bridge> <Assa> yes, you can login with rcon even with a server password enabled
12:53 < bridge> <Assa> yes, you can login with rcon even with a server password enabled, also for other users
12:53 < bridge> <Assa> I see, easy fix: we can generate a server password and simply connect with Connect(IP, Password)
12:54 < bridge> <robyt3> Then setting `password username:password` on the client side before joining should work regardless of the server password using the editor auth
12:54 < bridge> <robyt3> I mean do you need the server password still?
12:55 < bridge> <Assa> I like my global autoexec. If I test multiple clients or servers I don't want to reconfigure them individually
12:55 < bridge> <Assa> In this case I don't need a persistent server password, so no ig?
12:56 < bridge> <Assa> whats the benefit of doing `password username:password` instead of `password something_generated` ?
12:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Then you don't need to change the existing password
12:57 < bridge> <kebscs> dont set random password, itll be same issue as preset rcon password
13:02 < bridge> <robyt3> Doesn't look like rcon auth works for server password without reserved slot. Maybe we should just add that as a feature as well.
13:05 < bridge> <learath2> For us mods were just leaking the generated password to some of their friends
13:06 < bridge> <learath2> So we moved to their personal rcon password
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> if you are logged in, just type "password" into the console and leak whatever the password is
13:07 < bridge> <Assa> checkout #9815 if this is what you want
13:07 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9815
13:12 < bridge> <Assa> Maybe we should rename it to "local server security hardening" xD

16:19 < bridge> <Assa> @learath2 should we print the rcon/password in the console when the local server is started? After you disconnect from it you have no way back in
16:20 < bridge> <Assa> @learath2 should we print the rcon/password in the client console when the local server is started? After you disconnect from it you have no way back in
16:21 < bridge> <kebscs> why do you want to set password on a local server
16:22 < bridge> <kebscs> someone can do it in autoexec if they want to
16:22 < bridge> <kebscs> if then auto rcon doesnt work edit code so it works when connected
16:22 < bridge> <Assa> 2 reasons:
16:22 < bridge> <Assa> - to prevent others in my local network from joining
16:22 < bridge> <Assa> - to overwrite the existing password from my autoexec which is automatically loaded
16:22 < bridge> <kebscs> idk how you gonna do it
16:23 < bridge> <kebscs> if you just print passwd into console, what if i dont check console
16:23 < bridge> <kebscs> or exit game? the server will still run
16:23 < bridge> <robyt3> We should just add the feature to auth with rcon username and password to join a server
16:23 < bridge> <Assa> doesn't help you to join back, because you are never informed about your credentials
16:24 < bridge> <robyt3> Not sure I created an issue for that already, but basically the automatic auth should also extend to the normal start server button and not only the editor
16:24 < bridge> <robyt3> So whenever you start a local server via the client it should be able to auth and join automatically
16:25 < bridge> <kebscs> yea you have it in your sv_rcon_password issue
16:25 < bridge> <kebscs> but hes saying to lock local server entirely by password, not just rcon
16:25 < bridge> <robyt3> The client should remember the credentials so you can join transparently I guess
16:27 < bridge> <kebscs> i dont like the idea of it being password locked when i dont want to
16:27 < bridge> <kebscs> im restarting the client so many times during testing
16:28 < bridge> <robyt3> There's no need to set the password on the server, but the client should always use the automatic username:password to join the local server so it works in any case
16:30 < bridge> <robyt3> If you restart the client that also quits the local server though
16:30 < bridge> <kebscs> not with the restart button in vs
16:31 < bridge> <robyt3> I assume because it just kills the client?
16:31 < bridge> <kebscs> yes
16:31 < bridge> <robyt3> Then your config also isn't saved
16:31 < bridge> <Assa> how do I configure this? It currently doesn't
16:32 < bridge> <Assa> also if you kill the client @kebscs the server also closes
16:32 < bridge> <robyt3> We would have to first add the feature to allow authing with rcon credentials instead of general server password
16:32 < bridge> <robyt3> Only with a clean exit, the server doesn't detect if the client stopped running (except on Android)
16:33 < bridge> <Assa> doesn't the OS kill all the child processes if the parent dies?
16:34 < bridge> <Assa> at least on windows I can't do that easily, not even if I kill the client over task manager
16:34 < bridge> <robyt3> From a quick search this would require admin permission on Windows
16:35 < bridge> <Assa> So far I didn't find a way to kill the client without killing the local server
16:35 < bridge> <robyt3> I assume if you crash it it does not close the server
16:38 < bridge> <Assa> there is a subissue in this ticket:
16:38 < bridge> <Assa> If I rcon into a server, and then connect into it afterwards, the rcon console doesn't unlock
16:38 < bridge> <Assa> there is a subissue in this ticket:
16:38 < bridge> <Assa> If I rcon into a server, and then connect into it afterwards, the rcon console isn't unlocked
16:39 < bridge> <kebscs> this is only issue that you need to fix i think
16:39 < bridge> <Assa> I literally can't login into rcon without setting and joining with server password automatically or preventing a server password to be set in the first place
16:39 < bridge> <kebscs> this will also fix if someone has password set up in autoexec
16:40 < bridge> <Assa> I also asked if we need a password for the local server. I would be fine to overwrite ith with `""`, empty
16:41 < bridge> <Assa> but "testing a map locally" shouldn't mean "Test your map with friends"
16:42 < bridge> <kebscs> just add rcon auth on local server join if it was set by the test map locally
16:42 < bridge> <kebscs> maybe in client.cpp ProcessServerPacket

18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how people who never wrote rust see rust code
18:17 < bridge> <Assa> problem with all of this is how stateless this is: You start the server

18:17 < bridge> <Assa> - send an rcon message, hope for the best

18:21 < bridge> <Assa> - can still be the wrong server, as an other issue suggested
18:21 < bridge> <Assa> - you don't know if you can successfully connect or successfully auth
18:21 < bridge> <Assa> I bet there is some obscure ubuntu local network setup where this fails
18:21 < bridge> <kebscs> you dont need to check if sucessfully connected
18:21 < bridge> <kebscs> just run when connected
18:22 < bridge> <kebscs> just run auth when connected
18:22 < bridge> <Assa> but you don't do that
18:22 < bridge> <Assa> you send a connect message and immediately an auth message
18:22 < bridge> <kebscs> yea bcs the feature was already complicated to do from ground up
18:22 < bridge> <kollpotato> it will be ambiguous but it will look the same as rust!
18:22 < bridge> <kollpotato> :owo:
18:22 < bridge> <Assa> if your connection takes any longer for whatever reason your rcon will be too early
18:22 < bridge> <kebscs> if i was to improve it rn i would do that
18:23 < bridge> <Assa> yes, I don't want to kill your feature, as I said, it's amazing and I'm glad to have it! :owo:
18:24 < bridge> <kebscs> you can just add the auth_add for now i think
18:24 < bridge> <kebscs> doing the rcon auth with checks would be more complicated
18:24 < bridge> <kebscs> and password thing especially
18:25 < bridge> <Assa> the auth add part is not the issue, this is working perfectly ^^
18:26 < bridge> <Assa> the auth feature just breaks with server password. That's my issue
18:26 < bridge> <Assa> at least with auth_add i can still login with my usual rcon
18:27 < bridge> <Assa> what does the f2 rcon expect for a username for the root user? root or nothing?
18:33 < bridge> <louis> why do you run a password on local
18:33 < bridge> <louis> unless you're opening it to the public?
18:33 < bridge> <Assa> local servers are still findable in the LAN network
18:34 < bridge> <louis> ah like within apartment networks etc.?
18:34 < bridge> <Assa> also this way I only put sv_register ipv4 into the console to make it public for testing
18:34 < bridge> <Assa> yes or if you life in teeworlds households
19:02 < bridge> <Assa> def faster in merging, then I can review
19:03 < bridge> <Assa> def faster in merging, than I can review
19:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> same <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
19:07 < bridge> <kebscs> bcs its a gramebreaking bug
19:08 < bridge> <kebscs> and its copy paste from other part of code
19:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> can't we skip merge queue for these things then?
19:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> tho ngl, just make a follow up PR tbh, if you push it now it gets removed out of the merge queue
19:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> oh the check fails ¬∞-¬∞
19:15 < bridge> <kebscs> i guess reviews blocked merge?
19:15 < bridge> <kebscs> idk what happened
19:16 < bridge> <robyt3> Reviews shouldn't cancel the jobs, maybe a github issue

19:16 < bridge> <robyt3> `Internal server error. Correlation ID`
19:24 < bridge> <kebscs> will push random fix to rerun jobs
19:33 < bridge> <Assa> sorry, maybe I caused it then. I thought def- stopped the jobs
19:35 < bridge> <kebscs> i changed to your printing function
19:35 < bridge> <kebscs> but theyre exactly the same it doesnt matter
19:35 < bridge> <kebscs> when pr is fixing bug thats used for cheating ranks
20:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I spent one day refactoring code and the result looks way worse than before. I regret my life decisions.

20:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i feel like i need the struct as parameter robyte keeps talking about
20:09 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> passing half-initialized structs is so C-coded üò© I love it
21:00 < bridge> <robyt3> Thanks for reading my mind :justatest:, looks like you already refreshed while I was typing

22:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki just look at dis GEP
22:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```rust

22:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> gives
22:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```x86asm
22:12 < bridge> <teero777> @milkeeycat is this good or bad news?
22:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> good
22:12 < bridge> <teero777> cool
22:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> why is a place a register
22:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think a place should have no notion of register, stack or otherwise
22:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> a place is like a pointer to place in memory
22:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw its handy if a place has a projection
22:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> so there is a local, that the place points to and the projection (store in the place struct)
22:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> the projection for example can be a field access, a dereference, a index
22:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> projection is a vec
22:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> a local is like the base pointer to the alloca
22:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess it depends on how low level u want ur ir to be
22:39 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ok yep still no crashes
22:39 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1347322747784527922/image.png?ex=67cb6797&is=67ca1617&hm=e9b7ff2da1bf7ebdccc962922f9c3da19915992b6ffb338db4b7a6b52ab709e6&
22:40 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> not in this case but i am using asan so that slows it down some
22:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> because I wrote so xd
22:41 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> im gonna keep it running for now though because its still getting new finds
22:41 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> witch is surprising
