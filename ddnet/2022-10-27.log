00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aggregate functions operate of GROUPS of rows, instead of just rows

01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I changed from gmail to outlook like three years ago
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest: now i realise there are exactly 0 good android email apps in china.
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I would use spark but google's notification doesn't work all the time here

08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the R^2 on my huffman benchmark for compression is incredibly low but on decompression is close to 1
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk how to get it higher so its more accurate

08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> The thing is, i understand what they do, like avg, sum, count, min and max, i know what they are doing but finding the right code for them is hard for me. It's probably just learning by doing.. but it's frustrating :/

09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> new
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Right code? Can you give an example thay confuses you? Maybe I can figure out what you are getting stuck on. Aggregates are pretty simple except for very few caveats
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> I will, when i get home

12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Updated teemasterparser
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Now its a cli tool
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ill improve it with more stats
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> is this the map coke made that everyones talks about
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Any rust pros, what does it even mean? 😭 😭😭 😭
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1035153518274814054/unknown.png
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <susanjessy> https://t.me/+PEc8FSRwFiFiYzc0
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Looks like one too many square brackets at the start, though idk the context at all
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `tiles[i][j]` instead of `tiles[[i][j]]`
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> nah, its ndarray
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1035156150758416384/unknown.png
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> `result` is `Vec<Vec<bool>>`, `tiles` is `Array2<Tile>`, im transmutating `bool` into `u8`
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> but even if i use simple `u8` number, it will give same error
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> oh, wait, i actually need to use `tiles[i,j]` instead of `tiles[[i][j]]`
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> oopsie doopsie 😅
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> oh, wait, i actually need to use `tiles[[i,j]]` instead of `tiles[[i][j]]`

13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I recommend the itertools crate too
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Magick
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I didn't know what the type of tiles was, so just made a random guess 😄
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Wrapping a reader that has its datq in memory around a buffered reader makes sense?
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Probs not
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/struct.Reverse.html
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did you knwo about this?
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its awesome
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```rust
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>  let mut total_game_types: Vec<(String, usize)> = total_game_types.into_iter().collect();
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>  total_game_types.sort_by_key(|x| Reverse(x.1));
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u want to sort but in the other order, simply wrap it around that
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye, seen it
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edg-l/teemasterparser/master/example.svg
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> discord cant display svg shit
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> need "players playing multeasymap"
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😛
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but nice graph
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how did you generate it?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Parsing the master srv data
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/ddnet-map-gen
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Oops wrong link

16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah thats old
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Not required anymore xd
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that probably belongs into your user config instead
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ~/.cargo/config.toml
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Parsing things in a streaming way is nice, but some buffering helps great to reduce time, i found a optimization where each json inside the file went from 5ms to 1ms by allocating a buffer from the known size stored in the tar metadata
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1ms on a not so good cpu
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah nice 🙂
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 nah, its cuz i used simd_json before
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Xd
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does it distinguish between 0.6 and 0.7 servers btw?
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably not
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Not yet
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Also i found some servers dont even have a max_clients field
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Gotta be rly careful parsing
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> those don't get shown in the client, I think
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are you sure they exist?
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Well my json parser sure said so
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah. you could probably treat them as invalid
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Im still amazed how well zstd compressed those json files
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> From 9mb to 8gb iirc
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh yeah, I ran into that too, only started recently
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Simon'> "How about of having [...] teeworlds with client generated world where everyone would play" - allu2, 2015

19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> deen who doesn’t know GitHub has a follow feature casually flexing Stars hehe
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats a cool graph theme
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jessyjim> https://t.me/+PEc8FSRwFiFiYzc0
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Github stars just measure how useful your repo is to other developers sadly
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Of course, non-developers rarely use Github
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Yeah
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Is quite amazing the ratio of contributors to stars is about 1:2 I wonder if ddnet has the most contributors of any open source game
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nekorul> i think when the others opacity changes, strong/weak indicators opacity should also change

21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Is this a good place for the tiles?

21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I also thought of using it as a seperate file. Like this is supposed to be for DDNet/DDRace tiles only and mods should have extra tilesets?
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> On second thought I don't think that would be easily possible or possible at all
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <calliopehadassahxpr.> https://t.me/+WCCmjeeBfKswMjY0
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> On second thought I don't think that would be easily possible or possible at all (the second part not the first part)
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Ryozuki do you have any good db website to search for helmet & weapons shops
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> (elite)
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the one i sent u
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://inara.cz/elite/outfitting/#tab_outfittingequip
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ok ok
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> is that some kind of xkcd theme plot?
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that misleading right y-scale
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ReiTW https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i suggest u use this
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u sync it with inara
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it updates ur location on inara
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so all searches are relative to ur location
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> otherwise u gotta do it manually
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u also contribute to updating the prices on the db
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (it just parses logs the game outputs, which are quite detailed btw)
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh nvm
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > This app uses the “Companion” web API that Frontier originally supplied for their Elite Dangerous iOS app and now support for third-party apps. If that API ceases to function in the future then much of this application's functionality will be curtailed (although it could still utilise Journal files).
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> some points look very far from each other while in reality there's less than 3% variation due to autoscaling
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> which is why its misleading
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but it makes sense
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it does, but it's still misleading
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm well if u dont read the axes before nothing makes sense xd
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> people don't pay attention to those things unfortunately
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but the point of that graph is to see samples that look outside the norm
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you gotta account also for the visual impact
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its pretty far
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> given that we deal with ms
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think the scale makes sense
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyway that benc has a rly low R^2
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and idk how to make it bigger
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from that i read a R^2 closer to 1 means more accurate
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its 0.002
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wanna write a blog post for the huffman crate i made
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe this weekend
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:Copium:863129500149874698>
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> No ddnet is not the open source game with the most contributors. For example minetest has 600 contributors but it did surpass supertuxcart!
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Tater)
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> oh nice
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Well wait that repo is also kinda claiming to be a game engine. So it might not be a fair comparison.
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Ah well there is osu haha https://github.com/ppy/osu
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> osu best aimtrainer!
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Just a few more contributors needed to get ddnet as popular as osu…. Wait what? \:D
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> uh no? you got a straight line, so R^2 is really close to 1, or you're talking about something else that is not the R2 of the linear regression you're trying to fit to data
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1035296796718665759/unknown.png
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 0.00003
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk xd
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how do you compute it?
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think maybe i should make the input smaller
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> criterion does x iterations based on a estimate of how much iterations it can do in x time
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe if more iterations its more accurate
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no, it seems to show something completely different from what a 0 R2 would be
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/rustyman/blob/master/benches/benchmark.rs
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> sorry, i don't speak rust (yet)
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it calles compress a lot of times
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk criterion does all
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> can't you compute it yourself?
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im a lazy programmer
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and this tool is used by everyone
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> just compute least square
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyway i just wanted a overview xd
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> R^2 is a measure of closeness between your retrofitted model and real data
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what kind of model did you retrofit?
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> criterion does it
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it warms up for 3 seconds
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you don't answer my question
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iguess it gets the estimate from that
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt do anything thats the answer xd
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > So, without further ado, let's start with a general overview. Each benchmark in Criterion.rs goes through four phases:
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >     Warmup - The routine is executed repeatedly to fill the CPU and OS caches and (if applicable) give the JIT time to compile the code
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >     Measurement - The routine is executed repeatedly and the execution times are recorded
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >     Analysis - The recorded samples are analyzed and distilled into meaningful statistics, which are then reported to the user
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >     Comparison - The performance of the current run is compared to the stored data from the last run to determine whether it has changed, and if so by how much
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The warmup period is quite simple. The routine is executed once, then twice, four times and so on until the total accumulated execution time is greater than the configured warm up time. The number of iterations that were completed during this period is recorded, along with the elapsed time.
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/analysis.html
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so either you don't give him proper input data, or its doing something wrong there
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> okay, i think the text is just wrong
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what they call R^2 is actually the director coefficient a
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> can you give him a linear time function with a sleep 2x ms only ?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> r^2 will then be 2
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so the lib is wrong
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> (only in the labeling part)
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1035299618860318760/unknown.png
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is the decompress
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it's a straight line, R^2 should be close to 1
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> as i said, i think what's R^2 in your screenshot is _a_, the director coefficient in _y=ax+b_
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, in second screenshot, you have a slope output
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not in the first one
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it does that when r is closer to 1
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> slope is 0 in the first one (what you label as R2)
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> okay, in the 2nd screenshot, slope looks correct (just look x input and multiply it by slope and you find corresponding y which is on the blue line)
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so i guess r^2 is correct in 2nd screenshot
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and 1st screenshot r2 is actually slope, hence 0 as it's a flat line
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1035300932507947078/unknown.png
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> now it shows correct xd
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it might have been a bad bench
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> rust looks fun, but pnet raw socket looks scary💀
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jessyjim> https://t.me/+PEc8FSRwFiFiYzc0
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> rust looks like you're coding a fusion reactor
