11:11 < guenstigwerben> hi
11:12 < guenstigwerben> src/game/server/player.cpp
11:12 < guenstigwerben> i think i made a mistake in the snap part, but it appears only if not ddnet client
11:12 < guenstigwerben> where could the problem be
11:21 < guenstig_werben> anyone has an answer?
11:21 < guenstig_werben> anyone online?
11:25 < guenstig_werben> or better. Is snap or fakes
11:25 < guenstig_werben> or better. Is snap or fakesnap executed with vanilla client
11:29 <@EastByte> hi
11:29 <@EastByte> guenstig_werben: what exactly are you talking about?
11:42 < guenstig_werben> I mean I made a little modification at both snap and fakesnap. everything is OK if I join with ddnet client, but crash if I join with vanilla client
11:42 < guenstig_werben> So in which part (snap or fakesnap) is the error
11:46 <@EastByte> I don't know what a fakesnap is
11:54 < guenstig_werben> In server source, there is a function called Snap(...)
11:54 < guenstig_werben> under this function is one called FakeSnap(..) with a bit different content
11:55 < guenstig_werben> I think this Is because of the 64 players and send data to the client. but which one is the 64p section and which the 16p section
11:58 <@EastByte> the fake snap is probably only sent to non 64pl clients
12:01 <@EastByte> btw. I guess you are working on the tw proxy balancer thing right?
