08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I used to have an old laptop repurposed as a media center and -march=native made all the difference in being able to play 1080p without any framedrops. But if performance generally is good enough and you're more worried about keeping your system cool/quiet/energy efficient then recompiling everything is not worth it.
08:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The code where it really matters most likely has feature detection switches and assembly/intrinsics for some common vector instructions
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I see
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Could you host some more GER2 servers, they are very popular and all used for some hours now
17:39 <@deen> ok
17:42 <@deen> done, 18 GER2 servers now
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> GameController is made in such a mod unfriendly way

22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> issue # > year when?
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oh great demo map fixes thanks @Learath2
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Are you planning the same for vanilla? ðŸ™‚
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Would be awesome
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking of porting it over
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991  this year
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Or probably next
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't need the uuid stuff on vanilla given cross compatibility is not something they care about
