11:59 < bridge> <woidless> I want to write a login system on my server, can this work?
12:00 < bridge> <woidless> Can this be integrated into ddnet chat?
12:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> we can't really test this for you, it looks vulnerable - did you write this yourself? - if you want an account system why not just use the work from others, chillerdragon's ddnetPP has a functional account system
12:36 < bridge> <woidless> Please provide a link to github , the account system
12:37 < bridge> <woidless> I did not write this completely myself , but with the help of
12:37 < bridge> <woidless> I didn't completely write this myself, but with the help of ChatGPT
12:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/blob/master/src/game/server/ddpp/accounts.cpp
12:44 < bridge> <woidless> But how do I use it?
12:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> follow DDNetPP's readme, if that doesnt work i can't really help you ^^
12:48 < bridge> <woidless> Ubuntu=linux?

13:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The download is here https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/releases/tag/v0.1.1 run it and then you can use the /register command in chat
13:10 < bridge> <woidless> Мой сервер работает на виртуальной машине на ubuntu
13:10 < bridge> <mirfay123> ughh

13:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes it works on Ubuntu
13:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also on a virtual machine
13:11 < bridge> <woidless> Oh sorry
13:11 < bridge> <woidless> Can you help me step by step<3
13:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``wget https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/releases/download/v0.1.1/DDNetPP-18.5.1-linux_x86_64.tar.xz``
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``tar xvf DDNetPP-18.5.1-linux_x86_64.tar.xz``
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``cd DDNetPP-18.5.1-linux_x86_64/``
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``./DDNetPP``
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats all
13:14 < bridge> <woidless> But I want to make a registration system on my servers, and they have already been created through a regular ddnet
13:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do you have custom servers already?
13:15 < bridge> <mirfay123> just make a trashmap server
13:15 < bridge> <mirfay123> problem solve
13:15 < bridge> <woidless> Yes
13:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless is your source code public?
13:15 < bridge> <woidless> And they work using different configs
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> DDNet++ is ddnet compatible
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what makes your config different?
13:16 < bridge> <woidless> Do you want me to give all the files of my server?
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless no i just need to understand what you currently have and what you want
13:17 < bridge> <woidless> It's the same, I'm running my own server  screen -dm bash -c "./DDNet-Server -f servercfg.cfg"
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and it is a regular ddnet server?
13:18 < bridge> <woidless> My configs correspond to the usual autoexec_server.cfg in ddnet client ,just there. The RCN flogged , names , etc. have been changed
13:18 < bridge> <woidless> Well, in fact
13:18 < bridge> <woidless> It is located in the none tab
13:19 < bridge> <woidless> I want to add a login system there
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes then do what i sent you
13:19 < bridge> <woidless> Now
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can can move your config there and use ``screen -dm bash -c "./DDNetPP -f servercfg.cfg"``
13:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then you have a login system and your config 
13:21 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1302608674300231692/image.png?ex=6728bc5d&is=67276add&hm=44c6b0d2c2e7a3c7b3533d157d427abd22af3dc373fdf2d8b96a37cec970616a&

13:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay now you need your maps and config that you already had
13:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> where did you run the screen command?
13:23 < bridge> <woidless> root/ddnet/build
13:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok then ``cp DDNetPP /root/ddnet/build && cd /root/ddnet/build``
13:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``./DDNetPP -f servercfg.cfg``
13:25 < bridge> <woidless> Can I just download the court library screen , and download the config and also throw it there
13:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can also move your config into the /root/DDNetPP-18.5.1-linux_x86_64 folder yes
13:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no idea what "download the court library screen" is
13:27 < bridge> <woidless> sudo apt install screen
13:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you already have it installed
13:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you do not need to install it again
13:28 < bridge> <woidless> oh ok wait
13:32 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1302611279663599676/image.png?ex=6728beca&is=67276d4a&hm=c0e528a9db23d2c6ea720d88303d07ab626d96f0b830a46bfe3850edf94ee7ff&
13:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cool
13:33 < bridge> <woidless> this work
13:34 < bridge> <woidless> Now how to make registration completely optional, and what is the tab account?
13:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it is optional?
13:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what is a "tab account"
13:36 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1302612450159497216/image.png?ex=6728bfe1&is=67276e61&hm=1478c15fb501c2fb5f2a957349fdb32287f646a0ef86659788ade4276a3d3b6a&
13:36 < bridge> <woidless> this
13:37 < bridge> <woidless> sorry for  russian langugage
13:37 < bridge> <woidless> language
13:37 < bridge> <woidless> I want to make registration completely obligatory, for example, if you are not registered then you are in an endless freeze
13:38 < bridge> <zhn> @4ipset did you test "Save skin" ingame? its alright?
13:38 < bridge> <zhn> chillerdragon: he means tab score
13:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> try the chat command "/score level" is that what you want?
13:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think thats default it should already show the level in tab
13:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless thats the opposite of optional xd
13:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that feature does not exist but i can code it if you need it @woidless 
13:40 < bridge> <4ipset> Nah, i havent tested the “save skin” feature
13:41 < bridge> <zhn> don't tick "tested ingame" next time if you didn't xd
13:41 < bridge> <4ipset> :oop:
13:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> :BAN:
13:42 < bridge> <woidless> Can you please program it, and also how to return the usual finish time instead of the tab score?
13:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah you mean /score time
13:43 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1302614151717457920/image.png?ex=6728c177&is=67276ff7&hm=1e26159d125ed57ebc7f5d6aaf50aa8665f37700a57b593c5d80f0f4b31251a1&
13:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless did you build ddnet from source?
13:53 < bridge> <sollybunny> if cl_hook_coll_size_other where to be added would cl_hook_coll_size have to be renamed to cl_hook_coll_size_own or could it just stay as is for compat?
13:54 < bridge> <woidless> yes
13:55 < bridge> <woidless> Find my first messages in where Jupstar replied, there is how we created the server with him
13:55 < bridge> <woidless> #questions
13:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok nice then you can also compile ddnet++ to get the latest changes
13:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``git clone --recursive git@github.com:DDNetPP/DDNetPP && cd DDNetPP && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make``
13:57 < bridge> <woidless> where should I enter this?
13:57 < bridge> <woidless> to /root?
13:58 < bridge> <sollybunny> add -j$(nproc) to the end of that and in your home directory or projects folder
13:58 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1302617833057816657/image.png?ex=6728c4e4&is=67277364&hm=d243e803bb3b3f5abbb29d79f391d2960092098bf7f92bb0878d41f92f71078f&
13:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea /root is good
14:00 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1302618527122853949/image.png?ex=6728c58a&is=6727740a&hm=cf3a4209c2bc6ef534b8431eaa1a8c2e18b6b933b7b9bd2e5cfa06c9104dfc16&
14:04 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> did you run it twice?
14:04 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> ```cd /root/DDNetPP && mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && make```
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``cd /root/DDNetPP && mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && make``
14:05 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1302619656451919922/image.png?ex=6728c697&is=67277517&hm=9f10f62fe24595b55bbe75689de21426a92de37e52073234a4bfaa501f8a754d&
14:06 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> ```cd /root/DDNetPP && mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && make```
14:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also run this one first ``git pull``
14:06 < bridge> <woidless> but I'm already root
14:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i finished coding your two feature requests
14:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> /root/DDNetPP is a fool proof absolute path you can run it from anywhere as many times as you want
14:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you use the relative path DDNetPP you have to understand what you are doing
14:07 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1302620263908769873/image.png?ex=6728c728&is=672775a8&hm=843328441feffec28634ee782bcad14740456bf44149b29187b7758c97c45c13&
14:08 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> ok then the clone failed
14:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``rm -rf /root/DDNetPP && cd /root && git clone --recursive git@github.com:DDNetPP/DDNetPP && cd DDNetPP && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make``

14:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> guess that ssh remote only works if you are logged in to github
14:11 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1302621075468718171/image.png?ex=6728c7e9&is=67277669&hm=6a7066da26cc84b143d86329268eea0aeb52944c432083e4466ba1bae3929bed&
14:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay nice
14:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> once thats finished you need to add ``sv_account_stuff 1;sv_tournament_mode 1;sv_require_login 1`` to your config
14:12 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1302621388955451506/image.png?ex=6728c834&is=672776b4&hm=93877a916f968db66649b112c732113062e113cca91f4ed2009f618fbf23bfed&

14:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ou the submodule is a ssh remote hmm ...
14:13 < bridge> <woidless> I don't see the DDNetPP file
14:13 < bridge> <woidless> It also happened when I cloned regular DDNet
14:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> really bad never do this quick fix:
14:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> `git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf "git@github.com:`
14:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> ?
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> try this again i changed it to https
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``rm -rf /root/DDNetPP && cd /root && git clone --recursive https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP && cd DDNetPP && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make``
14:15 < bridge> <sollybunny> plz add --depth 1 and -j$(nproc) x-x
14:15 < bridge> <woidless> Enter this?
14:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
14:15 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://github.com/
14:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nproc can be dos
14:15 < bridge> <sollybunny> no dont he fixed it
14:15 < bridge> <sollybunny> that is true, but is the server not running?

15:09 < bridge> <woidless> It hasn't translated
15:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did you add ``sv_language ru``
15:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah yes you did hmm
15:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did you ``git pull && make``
15:10 < bridge> <woidless> ye
15:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do ``git pull && make`` again send a screenshot and start the server

15:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay looks good then wait for it to finish
15:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do you know how many cores your server has?
15:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> btw you can now also set ``sv_game_type_name Gores`` and ``sv_game_type_name_test Training`` in your config
15:15 < bridge> <woidless> 2
15:15 < bridge> <woidless> and 4 ddr4 ram
15:16 < bridge> <woidless> It's all gone
15:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> whats gone? xd
15:17 < bridge> <woidless> Well, I mean the translation was supposedly correct
15:27 < bridge> <woidless> omg this worked
16:13 < bridge> <woidless> @chillerdragon
16:13 < bridge> <woidless> I hope you will answer tomorrow
16:14 < bridge> <woidless> For some reason, it shows that there are 0 online servers on my servers , but when people log on to them , they appear
18:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> for a passwords list when connecting to servers should it just be called passwords
18:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> and should I use an unordered map like a sane person or do what the friends list does and have an array with some hashing for speeding up comparisons
18:37 < bridge> <sollybunny> fav serves is just called favorites and uses unordered_map
18:37 < bridge> <sollybunny> fav servers is just called favorites and uses unordered_map
18:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> also i know "if it broke, dont fix it" but as it is the friends container uses 4096 * (16 + 12 + 8) = 144KiB just existing
18:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> also i know "if it aint broke, dont fix it" but as it is the friends container uses 4096 * (16 + 12 + 8) = 144KiB just existing
18:49 < bridge> <robyt3> 1. Is this about #9201? It's unclear to me what this issue asks for. It seems impossible/unwanted to me AFAICT.
18:49 < bridge> <robyt3> 2. Without confirmation from maintainers on the issue that this is wanted it might lead to wasted effort if you invest into a solution.
18:49 < bridge> <robyt3> 3. What exactly are you trying to do? Your questions are about implementation details for a solution, but I don't understand what problem you are trying to solve.
18:49 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9201
18:51 < bridge> <sollybunny> 1. yes
18:51 < bridge> <sollybunny> 2. havent done anything yet
18:51 < bridge> <sollybunny> 3. allow paswords to be remembered for serves and then autofilled instead of having to confirm
18:51 < bridge> <sollybunny> 1. yes
18:51 < bridge> <sollybunny> 2. havent done anything yet
18:51 < bridge> <sollybunny> 3. allow paswords to be remembered for serves and then tried without confirmation
18:56 < bridge> <robyt3> See #9055 about saving the password for favorite servers, which is already implemented in Teeworlds 0.7. So #9201 would be a duplicate of that if that's what trikiman is asking for.

18:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> helo, sorry I just remembered that I in fact did not ask you after I finished my question
18:57 < bridge> <sollybunny> i dont think passwords should only be saved for favourate servers
18:57 < bridge> <fokkonaut> helo, sorry I just remembered that I in fact did not greet you after I finished my question
18:58 < bridge> <fokkonaut> helo, sorry I just remembered that I in fact did not greet you after I finished my question (like I intended to xd)
18:58 < bridge> <robyt3> Please comment that on 9055

19:03 < Voxel> Quick update on the image splitting update: I think I'm doing something wrong, because every time I build the client, it doesn't update the textures. Like, if I replace one image with another for the ones I'm changing, it only changes in-game when I clear the CMake cache
19:04 < Voxel> Slowly learning that I don't think I can make this all by myself :sob:
19:07 < bridge> <kebscs> i dont think building can detect changed images
19:07 < bridge> <kebscs> was the same thing when i was updating flags
19:07 < bridge> <kebscs> so i was just testing them straight in the output folder
19:08 < Voxel> Oh, that's weird.
19:08 < Voxel> Next step is to make the getter function work.
19:09 < bridge> <kebscs> if youre using visual studio i think thats how it works to speed up rebuilds
19:09 < Voxel> Yeah, I'm using Visual Studio
19:12 < bridge> <kebscs> you can ask me if youre stuck on anything
19:13 < Voxel> I'll explain what I'm trying to do, then.
19:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> is there any issue related to having spectate state synced between dummies
19:14 < Voxel> I'm trying to remove the dependancy of Texture Atlases for the gameskins, and was told all images should be handled in its respect CPP files. I'm starting with emoticons since they're the easiest to work with.
19:16 < Voxel> I'm shoving all the images into an array named `IGraphics::CTextureHandle m_aEmoticonTextures`, and was told to make a getter function to return a texture
19:16 < Voxel> So far it's literally just this: `IGraphics::CTextureHandle CEmoticon::EmoticonTexture(int Emoticon)  { return m_aEmoticonTextures[Emoticon]; }`
19:19 < bridge> <kebscs> yea, and any problems with it?
19:21 < Voxel> It's not really sending the texture, for some reason.
19:21 < Voxel> Maybe it's the implimentation for how I'm doing it?
19:22 < bridge> <robyt3> Try logging the ID of the texture handle at various places
19:22 < Voxel> I'm sending them as `CEmoticon Emoticon;   Graphics()->TextureSet(Emoticon.EmoticonTexture(CurEmoticon));`, which doesn't feel right for some reason.
19:23 < Voxel> Using the same getter idea you said before.
19:23 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, why are you creating a local object `CEmoticon Emoticon`?
19:23 < bridge> <robyt3> you should use emoticon instance of the gameclient
19:24 < Voxel> If I don't it states "identifier "EmoticonTexture" is undefinedC/C++(20)" as an error in VS Code.
19:24 < Voxel> Hold on, should I just join the discord server for easier communication?
19:24 < bridge> <robyt3> You need to access the emoticon instance using the gameclient pointer, i.e. `GameClient()->m_Emoticon.EmoticonTexture(CurEmoticon)`
19:24 < bridge> <woidless> For some reason, it shows that there are 0 online servers on my servers , but when people log on to them , they appear
19:26 < Voxel> I literally did not know that there was an m_Emoticon in GameClient
19:29 < bridge> <robyt3> All the components are members of the gameclient. The gameclient takes care of calling the different component functions like `OnInit` and `OnRender`. Since you created a local `CEmoticon` variable its textures were never loaded.
19:39 < Voxel> Perfect! Everything else feels just self explanatory now!
19:40 < Voxel> Thanks for the help!
19:42 < bridge> <tombrider1337> hi, why on master branch version is "18.8" while public version is still "18.6"? This is confusing
19:45 < bridge> <kebscs> 18.6 is current version, 18.7 is going to be released in a week, 18.8 hes the newest commits
19:46 < bridge> <tombrider1337> hmmm interesting, it wasn't like this before
19:48 < bridge> <kebscs> yea was changed not so long ago

19:48 < bridge> <tombrider1337> oh makes sense, thanks
19:57 < Voxel> Should weapon textures go into a place like items.cpp, or should I make a new weapons.cpp to handle those?
20:02 < bridge> <robyt3> I guess items.cpp would fit, but you could also keep them in gameclient.cpp for now if there's no clear component that they belong to like emoticons, particles and HUD
20:04 < Voxel> Just asking now, since there's 27 seperate images that could be classified as weapons, and I don't want to put them all in and then find a better solution later
20:09 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> are you working on the thing where you can see peoples weapons differently
20:10 < Voxel> Well yes, but actually no.
20:10 < Voxel> I'm working on splitting the texture atlases. The weapon server thing should just follow naturally if everything goes right.
20:21 < bridge> <robyt3> We have to define which different assets pack we want to support. For example, emoticons and particles make sense as individual groups that would be replaced as separate zip files. If we want to support mixing all assets in one zip file, then having unified asset handling in one class would easier, but that seems rather complicated so I think having separate defined groups like game, particles, emoticons etc. makes more sense. If we for example sett

20:24 < bridge> <Ewan> hi voxel
20:24 < Voxel> Hi, Evan!
20:24 < Voxel> Sorry- E*w*an.
20:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> fancy w!
20:25 < Voxel> Honestly, yeah. I think it'd be a lot easier if I just created like, a textures.cpp file, and work off from there.
20:27 < bridge> <Ewan> why u gotta do me like that
20:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Took only almost 3 hours to compile `rustc` :pepeW:
20:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1302717121889046658/image.png?ex=6729215d&is=6727cfdd&hm=c3c13ad2c08d3f3ad5c0b29e2204ed7acaa39966b8cdb96ddaf0617cb3087477&
20:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> And I just remembered I didn't add one flag
20:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> wtf
20:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> it shouldnt take that long
20:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is that something in rich?
20:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> how did u build it
20:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ./configure && ./x build
20:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it also built llvm
20:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> bloat
21:24 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ping me 3 million times once you can see multiple gameskins at once
23:31 < bridge> <0xdeen> So that you can have version checks for 18.8 already, which work immediately for the nightly versions
23:31 < bridge> <0xdeen> The previous approach was awkward for that
