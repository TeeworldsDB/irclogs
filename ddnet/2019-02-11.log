03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Roon> Does anyone teach me how to create race or ddrace maps "2019" Pls?
05:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Roon https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=2419
05:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @[ĢøŴ]Lickout DDNet uses https://github.com/heinrich5991/teeworlds/tree/bomb
05:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Roon also https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=2426
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <[ĢøŴ]Lickout> @deen  thx
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> Is anyone (still) interested in https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=6593? I think might be add some cool options for mappers
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> I tried to do something like it with tunezones, and it almost worked, except that keyboard input still changed the your speed while hooking
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @bob_fasul Ah, you're Bojidar?
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'd guess the feature wouldn't be super popular, but personally I'm not opposed to it
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just adding another tile I guess? Or would you do a tune for it?
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> @deen I think another tile with on/off will be better
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> as it will allow for one player to have no movement while the other has no hammer, etc.
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's like 10-20 lines of code to add in, not sure if it's very useful though
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> I think it might do for some cool maps
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> but, first, some mappers have to be convinced to make something
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> but, first, some mappers have to be beaten^Wconvinced to make something
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just a matter of generalizing the freeze code and using that without the ninja
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> yeah, or even just not forwarding the inputs to CharacterCore
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 can you take a look at #1443?
21:58 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: you are adding dead code :/
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, didn't notice str_tokenize was dead after a refactor

22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pksol1 Br> :/
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrashtimeHD> Is there any way to make the Corsshair smaller?
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrashtimeHD> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/544639061890039808/screenshot_2019-02-11_22-56-08.png
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrashtimeHD> Is there any way to make the crosshair smaller?
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrashtimeHD> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/544639061890039808/screenshot_2019-02-11_22-56-08.png
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Well you could resize the image
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Idk about a command
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrashtimeHD> Yes, theoretically I could shrink the image, but this could lead to a loss of detail. Depending on the crosshair this may or may not be noticeable.
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrashtimeHD> That's why I wanted to know if there is an option just for that.
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> Resize crosshair in the image
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> @pksol1 Br refresh internet and game . 
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> /
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> Delete in folder "%appdata%" teeworlds or rename folder all data about teeworls will deleted and will run default settings
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> Close game before you do that
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pksol1 Br> @texnonik  I romove file "teeworlds" ?
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrashtimeHD> Yes, theoretically I could shrink the image, but this could lead to a loss of detail. Depending on the crosshair this may or may not be noticeable.
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrashtimeHD> That's why I wanted to know if there is an option just for that size change without downscaling the image.

23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pksol1 Br> I tried
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrashtimeHD> Yes, theoretically I could shrink the image, but this could lead to a loss of detail. Depending on the crosshair this may or may not be noticeable.
