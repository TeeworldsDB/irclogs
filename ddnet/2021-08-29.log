00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> @Matodor go make mLife
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> mNo
00:16 <+Anime_pdf> :)
00:16 <+Anime_pdf> there is no timakro here :(
00:17 <+Anime_pdf> where can i find him
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> on matrix
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> well, timakro's repo with sixup works... but not how it should, fddrace is more like ddnet and kog is closed src.
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> i asked chillerdragon for sources
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i'm here
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> now waiting üò¥
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> hii
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> i builded and tested ur sixup vanilla implementation and it works really weird
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> did I make a sixup vanilla implementation?
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> not that i remember
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> timakro/teeworlds
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> 'sixup' bramch
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> timakro/teeworlds
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> 'sixup' branch
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkaS:
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Ok haha
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> forgot I did this
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> No idea what state this is in
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> unfortunately
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I believe I was thinking how to go about implementing this and at first I wanted to come up with a patch that could be applied to vanilla, ddnet, unique race, etc
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But then I realized that this wouldn't be possible so I just did it for unique race
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> : o ok, i will look unique race commits and try to do it in my mode, or maybe just remake race, kek
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> what codebase are you working on?
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> just curious
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> actually i need sixup with vanilla weapons, i can rewrite ddnet's entity and character to vanulla and get all i need but im trying to find gamemode that already did it
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> actually i need sixup with vanilla weapons, i can rewrite ddnet's entity and character to vanilla and get all i need but im trying to find gamemode that already did it
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> do you essentially want deathmatch?
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> well, yeah
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> i cant take or give myself rifle or shotgun
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> is that okay
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @Jupstar ‚ú™ I've heard you've been working on some kind of system similar to our skin database, but for community skins? (less strict rules)
04:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <üñ§Smetanolubüíé> YES!
05:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen can you add my server to DDNet tab? Would be cool, as fng or infclass is there too and my server is getting heavily faked, this would ensure its my server because of the tick symbol.
05:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I asked this a long time ago already, and I think my server is trustful enough to be there (somehow maybe? xd)
05:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> remove the thing that makes lol go into i like turtles
05:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> :troll:
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no u
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Its an artifact
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> from many years ago, from XXLDDRace
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Or, even before that
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Also, whats your problem with turtles? üê¢ sus

09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Noice
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Finally merged
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Nobody wants to write the website part I think. So rip
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh @uwu for gctf bridge i just took ddnet and added the 5lines diff that is gctf \:D and voila i got a bridged 64p gctf server
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkaS:
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Well
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Im dumb
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I was looking for vanilla weapons
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> But i firgot that gctf only need grenade
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :bluestripe:
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> smort
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea vanilla weapons are way more work. If you want a bridge with vanilla weapons F-DDrace is your best fit but its closed src now sadly .-.what do you need it for btw? @uwu
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> for.... gamemode
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> with sixup and 64 players
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> but vanilla weapons
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> i saw @gerdoe's 2xp. Its ddnet but with vanilla weapons
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://github.com/tw-2xp/2xp
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> looks good
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i didn't finish vanilla weapons support
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :feelsbadman:
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> actually i didn't even start :troll:
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :justatest:
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> which gamemode im curisous tell me more
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i did üëÄ
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah :D
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @uwu lurk in TsFreddie's github profile :p
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> how about fork my stuff and just make your mod and contribute back any interface
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i need it lol
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i did too many refactoring shit in my repo
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> oof
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i don't want to repeat that experience xd
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> then i guess not
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> lol
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> sooo
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> @uwu your turn
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> üëÄ
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkalaugh:
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but ye, i have all vanilla gamemode and weapons finished
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> it's probably a pretty good starting point if you want to make pvp mod with sixup/ddnet support
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but the server config is totally different from regular teeworlds, and the weapon system need some getting used to if you are used to modding entities to make weapons.
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Blade> Worth making a branch with just that tho (vanilla weapons in ddnet)
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ü§î i probably won't make any sense. you'll have to recode a lot of ddnet features just to get vanilla weapons. since some ddnet features use the same entities (e.g. shotgun bullets)
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> it*
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> and there will be tons of disagreement on how vanilla weapons should behave in a ddrace setting.
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> so it'd be better just to let people fork out and nuke ddrace and make their own.
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> why it have 2 same lines
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/881518681815932928/unknown.png
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tezcan> It's not the same
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> isnt it?
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> oh well yeah there are + and -
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> sry i didnt notice
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> bruh
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> If ground check was broken the whole time that would be hella funny
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It sadly is for bigger entities, I need proper collision handling for entities larger than a block or so
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> entity larger than a block :justatest:
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> get box2D(

15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I saw that, but i dont think its required just for a bigger entity
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its super cool tho
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> you are super cool as well
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkalaugh:
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you are mean :(
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :monkaS:
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i'm sorry
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lol
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I see, thats unfortunate :/
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i use https://skins.tee.world/ for download url
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well the annoying part is these creator packs and skin packs, if you dont want to zip them on fly
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> is it possible
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> to make a AI, that find a map if you draw it a map layout
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> like when you can't remember a map's name but you do remember how it looked like :kek:
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is so unreadable though, it's normal that you were confused
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> man my sleep schedule is messed up even when i have to work. it is annoying.
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> also huge moth is gross

18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ok I go back to my hibernation
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> voice reveal
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> do you like it
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> im more impressed by that other animal on the window
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> he's on the outside
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> so he's fine
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but casually chillin on ur window
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i think wall lizard are harmless too
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> never seen a wall lizard xd
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we have some lizards near, but they are fcking shy
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> it's pretty common here, and we see it in our home all the time
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its american spy
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> poor moth btw
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> grilled, do you also eat them? xd
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but now the buildings are constructed better with better sanitation it's less common to see them at home.
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but they still chilling on the windows tho
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i see
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> no
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i didn't even want to pick it up. oof
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i just grabbed a bag and lift the cardboard below and dumped it in
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> now it's in the trash
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i cant kill animals, not even insects <.<
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> üò≥ yes
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also have that electric shit
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i kinda miss teeworlds but it's been nice to focus on myself
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://smcameron.github.io/space-nerds-in-space/
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> real nerd shit here
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look the video
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats dedication right there
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > One computer runs the central server simulation of the game's universe. Each player's computer acts as a station on a simulated spaceship. There are stations for Navigation, Weapons, Engineering, Communications, Damage Control, and the "Main View", an out-the-window 3d rendering. Multiple starships each with their own team may connect to the server for bridge-vs-bridge combat, or for cooperative play. Additionally, a game master may injec
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> insane
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i reorganized my TODO list into issues, then i realize it was hell
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> https://github.com/TeeworldsCN/ddnet-pvp/issues
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> what tf is ddnet-pvp
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> DDNet based server designed for PvP
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> just a vanilla server
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> like ddnet with weapons
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> using ddnet code base
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> oh thats brilliant
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> with multiple room support (like /team)
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :poggers:
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ^  now i think that feature is a huge mistake and make everything more complicated than it needs to be lol
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but you can host dm and ctf in the same server which is neat, but i still haven't got multiple maps working. so you either host it with all ctf5 or make a mega map that can be switched.
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :monkaS: @uwu also the CGameController is actually pretty capable now, so you can code a mod in one class. and please help us if you feel like using it as base code
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> i will merge half of ur mode into mine :monkalaugh:
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> yoink
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> https://tenor.com/view/trihard-tridance-funny-gif-15894590
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> the project only support zCatch and instagib on top of vanilla modes as an example
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> city mod
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkalaugh:
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i have fng coded in a private repo so i can tell if the interface is good enough (and it is, at least for fng)
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i don't know exactly what city mod does
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but i would imagine you need to override player's clans and stuff?
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> sit here, do money
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> thats all
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yay cserver stuff xd
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> if it is just that then it is probably doable with one class
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> with one variable :kek:
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> for that i've planned some CPlayer's methods for overriding name/clan and skins, so the CServer will keep the original name/clan unless you want to set it directly of course.
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> also there's https://github.com/TeeworldsCN/ddnet-pvp/issues/37 planned if you want to fake a tee/player
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> the project needs a better name too lol
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> nice. I briefly tried something like this starting from vanilla, but I got caught up in too much refactoring
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Take this method for example. The generic implementation could just return false and the specific implementation be in CGameControllerSurvival.
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/881592006139342869/unknown.png
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @Ryozuki soo
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> what about rusty jam
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :justatest:
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> we just should use ec/ecs :justatest:
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt do anything xd
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Then I had GameControllerSurvival and ~Teamplay and ended up with the diamond inheritance problem ..
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> :pepepopo:
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> inojelis tried to show us submissions
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but idk xd
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i don't even remember if i've dealt with that
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> this jam didnt bring something new here
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> you still have some IsSurvival and IsTeamplay checks mixed in the gamecontroller, but I think refactoring everything out might be impossible
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> all devs used bevy (unless one person with his own framework)
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well bevy is good
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> well he couldn't show half of games bcs he uses linux :kek:
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bevy works better on linux
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> this
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk who this guy is
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/881593117650878514/unknown.png
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> probably, i think i was going into it with the idea of "everything was how it was" and if you need to redo anything you just override it.
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was in the team whop did this https://itch.io/jam/rusty-jam/rate/1175554
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i didnt do anything
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was kinda busy and lost motivation xd
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lul
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw he probs couldnt play it cuz he has a old kernel
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u compile on a newer kernel
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sometimes old kernels cant play it
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth like that
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no mud works perfectly on his machine
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> another not xd
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I hope we can get vanilla source code going into that direction, so modders don't have to modify vanilla files, making future merges harder
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 did u convince oy?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oy is anti modders
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> era of lua-bindings :justatest:
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> noo lua pls
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just organized c++
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i rly hate lua scripting for games
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> anti? I thought it's more like "we don't care about mods"
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> but that's not exactly supportive either
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he hates ddnet
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he says it killed teeworlds
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> oof
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> he is right in this point
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> well we kinda did
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not at all
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lot of ppl discovered this game thanks to ddnet
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its just that pvp fun ends pretty quickly
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no replay value
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ü§î
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ddnet killed 0.6 vanilla :pepepopo:
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what killed vanilla is decades of same players playing
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and noobs not being able to compete
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u cant have fun
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but for me, it justy gets boring real fast
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fng is the only fun pvp for me
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> capgame pushes good dose of adrenaline in your organism
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> dm 1o1 is boring yeah
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> play teesmash :monkalaugh:
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but ctf games
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> well i just really want a server that is easier to work with and just works for both vanilla and ddnet.
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ^
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> then there might be a mod bloom again for all.
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> that's a huge might tho
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the people doing this rework are the ones that will prob mod something of quality
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur wasting ur time on making it mod friendly
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> instead of making a mod urself
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> also since i'm coding almost everything a call in gamecontroller lua binding is probably gonna be trivial for ddnet-pvp
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> if it's generic and modfriendly like "ddnet-pvp" then it would be useful for making your own mods in any case
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> kog-lvl based on ddnet-pvp
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://mun-lang.org/
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the future
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> of scripting languages
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> but I'm too uncreative to create my own mods :feelsbadman:
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> well the goal is to replace every mod we host in twcn with this
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> robyt3 try to do something with necro's code xd
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> so modding is gonna start really soon
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> maybe you'll have some ideas while discovering it
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the necro guy who was making an external editor?
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i think infclass actually
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> iirc
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> oh ye, map merger for envelope hacks. adding that to my TODO list lol
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> fng boring after a while too
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> same map 24/7
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :justatest:
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> infclass best pvp
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i'm glad chn players don't complain about map change in fng tbh
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> how can i fucking fix the /16 players max in the server list?
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/881598386216775690/unknown.png
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> use ddnet's server info
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how would we know how to fix the leaked source code of a closed source mod?
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kek
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> oof
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> didn't know
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> its not the real "blockworlds" code, and btw the mod is based on ddnet
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> very old ddnet by the looks of it
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> if only someone is still maintaining that with bugfixes and more classes(?)
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> this server still use bam so yes
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> there are some chinese modders on the rise who just tweaked some tuning values and change a weapon spread and call it a new mods. which is kinda underwhelming.
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ultralight-ux/Ultralight
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rewrite our UX with html
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not even open source xd
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but they are getting all the attentions in chn communities as the master modder guys. so i guess they are doing something for the "players" at least.
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> master coder hacking the matrix
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> call the gov this guy is dangerous
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> meanwhile we are just struggling coming out with new ideas. and they are like "haha 6 spread grenades go brrrrr" and apparently that was enough to get some of the players entertained for a while
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :kek:
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> have they tried teesmash? :monkalaugh:
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u could host it, its fun :monkalaugh:
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but it is annoying when someone see a modded gores server and just spammed my dm to "report a cheater"
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :kek:
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> we did, but they probably haven't
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but we don't need to do anything
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/881600703976603708/unknown.png
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> one the master hacker guy hosted every mods he can find in chn
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> they will get to it eventually
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> one of the master hacker guy hosted every mods he can find in chn
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> send him this <https://github.com/timazuki/TeeSmash>
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i believed he already hosted one
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but i cant find it anymore
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> weird
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/881601222312878140/unknown.png
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but he did get kicked for distributing bot clients. maybe he rqed
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :think_bot:
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i swear there were like 20 servers with his prefix which just so happens to look like ours.
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/881601624886374461/Screenshot_20210830-020927.jpg
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> now there are only two it seems
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> teeworlds.ch
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> teeworlds.cn
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :justatest:
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> teeworlds.tw
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkalaugh:
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> now i'm just asking for ddos ain't i
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :justatest:
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i should setup cdn for the whole site actually
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> since it is entirely made of SPA, so it is static
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> btw does anyone want this domain: `teel.ink`
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> got it for free, and i have no use for it
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> url shortener
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> is there a open source one that i can just setup and use?
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ryozuki has one i think
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> its not that short but it is short enough i guess
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> my personal domain is one character shorter.
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/edg-l/shorust
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> lol thats a good name
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in rust
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xdd
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> rust is cool
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and by ryozuki, so you have direct support
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> also i love that teeworlds devs have made basically every service in existence.
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> does sqlite means everything is in memory?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :justatest:
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no but it has a simple database
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. no mysql server required
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> how does sqlite works
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> it's just one file
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> he actually did moddable map format
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> but you can also load the database into memory
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i know. but how does it read it
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> fread
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> sqlite uses a B-tree to store the data on disk
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> so it can seek the an entry out of the entire database file?
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> https://www.sqlite.org/arch.html
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> every file based db i've used for node (that aren't sqlite) just load everything in memory
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :justatest:
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> it also puts some "Page cache" on top of the B-trees
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> so it works block-based
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i see. that's cool
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i've never looked up how sqlite works.
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @TsFreddie https://noby.world/
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a liv eexample
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> of shorust
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in use
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> more than 200 usages of "goto" in some sqlite-files :justatest:
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> then i guess teel.ink is better than that one
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u give the domain i can host it
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh one of the few, that use goto
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dmed u ip
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> my teachers never allowed it, when we wrote qbasic xD
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz ddosers look here
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i can probably host it but sure why not free myself from the burden
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :kek:
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> setting it up rn
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> there is even a comment explaining that this code is explicitly unstructured and that usage of goto results in 1.5% performance increase :greenthing:
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> uff, i wonder if thats really the case
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> over higher performance flags
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> iirc @Learath2 is pro goto at well
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> > according to "valgrind --tool=cachegrind"
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> *optimization
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok, when they that tryhard that it might be right xD
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Here o/
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> hi
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> they still use formating strings(sqlite3_snprintf) where is the 0.001% perf increase by not using it xd
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I like how sqlite doesn't compromise to the pleas of the modern era
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "Use just 5 extra kb of memory lol", "It's just a .1% performance increase"
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Say no to this propaganda by the business people that want their deadlines met
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I also love how the factorio people operate, the optimizations they come up with that don't even matter on modern hardware are astonishing
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> modern hardware best tho
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> at some point they always come back to performance
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> opengl -> vulkan
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think someone shared this here https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-333, just look at this beauty
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> what
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> why
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> they should port it to snes
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :justatest:
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> modern hardware has largely made quality software engineering like this obsolete
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If there is any team working on a modern team that could code for the snes it's probably this lot
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/modern team/modern game/
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did some gameboy assembly for a while, it's a whole lot of problem solving getting things to fit in there
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> https://twitter.com/reduzio/status/1431304207139737604?s=19
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mostly wrote patches for games though, so even more cramped
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> also sega remade sonic colors ultimate in godot is kinda insane
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, they are targetting modern platforms, I think godot is a very rational choice here, not as rigid as other engines
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet it'd be more expensive to get someone to port the original engine, whatever that was
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but sega already has a hedgehog engine that already runs on modern platforms with GIs and stuff.
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a new service is born
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://teel.ink/
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, if they do indeed have their own their choice of godot becomes more interesting
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://teel.ink/YlMss0>
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ye i think they had their own hedgehog engine since sonic unleashed
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> maybe the remake is offloaded to a third party company that has godot experience.
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ü§î
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe they wanted a more direct port and the assets of the original proved incompatible with the more modern engine?
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://teel.ink/V1PllM :justatest:
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I hope someone from sega does tell us why
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh shit i should delete the old db
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> idk. how imcompatible would it be for them to just remake every assets for godot tho.
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah no
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it should work
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://teel.ink/SnEN6G
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> abuse this generator to get /twitter
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its too clever
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i could provide a small invite only mail service if someone had a cool teeish domain too
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz discord reads redirects
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u have to use <>
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or remove the overview
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> preview
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://teel.ink/SwTU8u>
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I assume it's much easier to get godot to load the original assets
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> they just read them in blender and then ez xd
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> scam links go brrr
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> <https://teel.ink/8knZzV>
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen can we just release a mini version without whats left in the milestone and shift them, or no time?
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> what cool stuff did you made into ddnet this time
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am just annoyed by win7 users who have problems with their tilemaps xD
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i made the fallback a bit safer
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ic
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but we also have some new fancy features xd
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> colored consoles xD
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> can you port 0.7's text edit? k thx.
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> can you port ddnet text render
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> k thx
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :justatest:
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> :happy:

21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u add colors
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on linux
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we got
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true color

21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> instead of virgin ansi
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> true color best
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the cyan is my default
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so ignore that
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does it work well
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> non color
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tty
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it works on kterminal and xterm and stuff
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the linux default only has 256bit
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> colors*
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is ddnets textrenderer better than vanillas anyway? I thought we just had some extra caching stuff using the fact that we have gl3.3
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes cuz jupstar made it :greenthing:
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well there are differences
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> and if only i know text input in sdl2 isn't that complicated in 2013
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> text input is defs better on vanilla xD
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we still gotta add this
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://harfbuzz.github.io/
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the ime calls are also annoying, on android the always open the keyboard xD
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The damn TEXTEDITING stuff
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> what text input
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> how does that even integrate btw, is that a math library?
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or does it also implement gpu rendering?
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™ https://harfbuzz.github.io/why-do-i-need-a-shaping-engine.html
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I spent HOURS, HOURS of excruciating debugging, deep into appkit and xlib
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/881617444106551386/unknown.png
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> TLDR
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the ime stuff
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is absolutely impossible to get it all right without redoing major parts of the teeworlds input code
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> dude, they should just learn english
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> XD
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> vanilla's ime support is pretty good already (for windows)
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I do have a plan to do it correctly, but haven't had the time to try it out yet
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> oh wait they haven't merged it
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Other languages involve marks and accents that need to be rendered in specific positions relative a base character. For instance, the Moldovan language includes the Cyrillic letter "zhe" (–∂) with a breve accent, like so: "”Ç".
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Some fonts will provide this character as a single zhe-with-breve glyph, but other fonts will not and, instead, will expect the rendering engine to form the character by superimposing the separate "–∂" and "Àò" glyphs.
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its funny how english is somehow also ez for computers
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How did you end up managing the textediting state inside sdl?
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> unlike many other languages
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and i doubt its just bcs america invented most software
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> english is the perfect fit for computers
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine having to type multiple characters to form one
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g asian langs
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :justatest: dont know what you are talking about
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm guessing the computer would be fine with any language with a glyphcount < 255
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> give me a KISS: keep it simple, stupid
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw teeworlds was made following KISS
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> :troll:
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Learath2 i think in sdl2 u do
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> text edit start
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> text edit stop
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> give string
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Most of the weird ime bugs we have is caused by us not using sdls textediting state correctly
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> does sdl2 has problem with SDL_StartTextEditing
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™ btw harfbuzz also handles RTL
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine reading right to left
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> insane
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, just makes it even more complicated xd
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You do textedit start, you start getting text input events, you then do textedit stop
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i could live with it, if all languages would be like it
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ŸáÿßŸáÿß ÿ£ŸÜÿ™ ŸÖÿ≥ÿ™ÿ¨ÿØ
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> discord cant
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder how they recognize this stuff
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so teeworlds doesnt need
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its rly small
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> robert refactored almost everything so vanilla now tracks active text input cursor
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On macOS with pressandholdime sdls text editing gets very very confused
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/881618705103065118/unknown.png
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> whats pressandholdime
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> when i see this i get demotivated to work on it xD
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This kind of ime to add accents to a character
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/881618938155380766/Screenshot_2021-08-29_at_22.18.31.png
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ü§î
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> is that even a standard ime thing
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> or does windows has a similar one
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its fancy javascript
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The way this works is completely incompatible with how sdl does textediting, you will first get a standard `e`¬†then you'll get a `√´` event
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or is it something android
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I haven't seen it anywhere else, but it's default on macOS
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> with nothing in between?
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i only did text edit for windows, and windows's ime event is fairly standard even tho it is broken for some third party ime.
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nope, nothing, the actual events from macOS include a "replacement range" telling you what range this new piece of text replaced, but sdls event doesn't include this information so they need to drop it
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> do you know if the sys event get into sdl?
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It does, I even made an experimental patch to add a new event to sdl to support this kind of ime
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> have you tried just let sdl2 pass every system event to you
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> without patching it
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/3622 if one day mr ryan c gordon would take a look at the issues
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> :/
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> sdl is so unfinished under windows and macos
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> well ime just doesn't work on linux most of the time anyway
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> valve only cares about linux xD
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah i dont just mean ime
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> like have you tried to get the replacerange event with SDL_EventState(SDL_SYSWMEVENT, SDL_ENABLE);
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Um I don't think this event is passed through like that, the way sdl does textinput on macOS is a tad weird, they create a fake CoreText input field (it's on the top left by default so you get that weird ime bug), it's not an event but a callback
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ü§î
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> that is indeed weird
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> SDL could however "forge" a fake wm event from it to pass through, which could be helpful
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think they took the idea from a minecraft mod that enables IME usage by using the same trick
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ~~well apple should've just provide ime events~~
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @TsFreddie couldn't we just set a bool everytick on Input() to signal IME is need, and if that bool is not set deactivate IME again, and just store the current string in the CInput class and render it over the text input boxes?
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> apple should just expose the internals of appkit so we don't have to use stupid hacks like this, just let us interface directly with the text input engine
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we need a focus unfocus event, would be really cleaner UI thing
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> vanilla has that
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> just port it
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> focus, or the one i said
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> well not focus unfocus, its a cursor stack iirc
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok, and how does SDL suggest IME stuff? or does it require to run ddnet in windowed mode, bcs its rendered by windows?
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i rendered ime window in teeworlds
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but how did you get the suggestions
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> and just pulled the candidate list from windows myself
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> like in the screen of learath
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> suggestions come from windows API
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ye. sdl doesn't give you anything
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> annoying already xd
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but you can still get it from windows
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but then it wont work on macos
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or some other stuff
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> macos already draws candidate window just fine
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> android just shows the virtual keyboard, thats ez af
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> we don't take over wm on macos i think.
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> the candidate window will just draw in the place that we told sdl
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but there are some canvas/window chord thing.
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™ its weird given how many ppl depend on sdl
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but u know most companies probs dont share their patches
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> greedy bastards
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just often read that they use SDL for the linux port
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and have other stuff for windows
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. csgo
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> valve engine uses sdl
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the source engine
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> and just forget about linux. ime isn't a thing on most linux wm. they are just frameworks hacked onto the wm.
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> and just forget about linux. ime isn't a thing on most linux wm. imes are just frameworks hacked onto the wm.
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> none work good?

21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> yep
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> none
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make one
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the spirit of linux
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not even google pinyin?
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has google in its name
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> must be good kek
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ibus is obslete on wayland. fcitx is just broken
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> kek
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Fcitx5?
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> r–ª—É–ª
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> kek
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i still use them
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but they just dont talk
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/fcitx/fcitx5
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i looks in active dev
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 3 days ago last commit
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> um, only if we are borderless or windowed, otherwise the ime can't render anything over us, except in windows with their wonky blend mode
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i thought macos doesn't have fullscreen mode anymore
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but it's probably not sdl's fault that apple doesn't give you candidates. and i don't even know if apple has a standard for implementing a candidate list.
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> kek
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think SDL can do fullscreen now
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ours is broken though, so i'm not sure
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ~~also most users are on windows anyway~~
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think only windows gives you candidates btw
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> https://developer.apple.com/documentation/inputmethodkit
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> this should give you the candidates
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not so quick, that only helps you implement a server, not interface with that server üòõ
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i think even valve didn't implement candidate list beyond windows.
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can open a in memory db with :memory: as path
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> and they should so we can just steal it
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did develop an awful hack to extract candidates from imkit (root only and you need SIP disabled)
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> truly a hack
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> @Learath2 does sdl give you any info about the fake Textfield thing?
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nope, it's completely opaque to the user
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> oof
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i would hope you can just grab the field and factory a "event" system.
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Setting the IME spot actually moves the secret textfield over üòõ
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is the backend to the info. api available to see?
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always wanted to make a cool modern frontend maybe i can with that
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and heavy caching
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can create an event off of it, no problem, but I need to learn how they want it implemented
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I think it's in ddnet-web, not sure though
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet-web should only be the static part
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess it doesnt
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/881626541178650684/102012211-5a310100-3d49-11eb-9249-18139eecaa48.png
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but this is cool tho
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> can we just have it :kek:
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/6f684f674e1c91777d6bca6e2a49c478c4d5c401/src/video/cocoa/SDL_cocoakeyboard.m here you can see the weird thing they do for macOS
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think apples interface is just way too invasive, why do you need to know whether I have marked text, just tell me the input and I'll handle it
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :justatest:
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> maybe in the name of privacy
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good project to learn svelte
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the reactjs killer
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> so one day they'll notify user whether a field is active and disable your keyboard if you don't click allow
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :kek:
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> so apps can't turn your input into text. and they'll send scrambled mess keyevent for game apps.
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> so no app can log your keys
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Robyt3 if you find a way to get access to the imkcontroller through some api lmk btw, I looked for a while but I kinda gave up on it
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I don't even own any apple device so that's probably not going to happen :kek:
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (my awful hack was to just extract the address of the imkcontroller with a debugger and setting a global variable in my program üòõ )
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> does ddnet work with other keyboard layout btw?
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> vanilla using keycodes :justatest:
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> https://www.logcg.com/en/archives/2902.html
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> does this make any sense
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> also i can't remove preview on mobile
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> um, the english is a bit suspect but there might be interesting info in there
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> the ariecle is written in chinese
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> idk where did the english version come from
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But we don't want lower level events, but access to a middle layer, I will read, see if there is any trick used there that might get me access to the IMKit
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't even know who I would ask for this kind of information btw, macOS is so closed
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> tbh getting candidatelist is probably not so important on macos. i feel like the wm adds a lot less input delay than windows.
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only reason I want the candidatelist is so we can just have one unified way to handle imes that way
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> well good luck talking to ibus or fcitx i guess
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let's add frida to ddnet, we can dynamically insert code into fcitx and ibus to extract it
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> candidatelist is also overrated
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets add frida
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/881631782250897408/unknown.png
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i've been trying so hard to live without one
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but my brain isn't large enough to remember all my encoding for characters
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I don't think there are any humans smart enough for that
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> and i probably can if i move to a shape based ime. but i don't even know how to write a lot of characters so :kek:
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> maybe i should get back and practice hand writing just so i can type without a candidatelist
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how do shape based imes work? radicals?
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ye
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/881632547048673360/600px-Wubi86_keyboard_layout.png
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> you cant read it but it should be pretty obvious what it does
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Êûó so this would be SS?
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> probably
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i didnt learn this
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see the idea though, that's cute but I wonder if it's how most people think while writing
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> SSY
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> probably not
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> its a bit different than writing
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> especially on this ime
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i have no idea where the Y came from but i just looked it up and it was SSY
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> my own ime currently is a sound-shape one where i type sound first and type one or two storkes to narrow it down
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet it's to overcome some ambiguity, maybe it's possible to combine two glyphs in two different ways in some cases
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> Ê£ÆÊûó
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's not really ambiguous though, SS vs SSS
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> Á¶Å
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> Â©™
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> È∫ª
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> idk
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> none of these would make the Y nessasary. maybe it's some rules that i'm missing
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i can barely keep up with my own ime already tho
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `ÂîÑ` vs `Âì°` Here is the one that came to my mind
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not sure if both exist in chinese though
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> Âëó Âëò
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> similar enough
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> for my sound-shape ime it is ez cuz they sound different anyway
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you look up the combination for these?
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> KMY
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> KM
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> respectively
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Y is like move it to the right in my mind now and the default compositing mode is top to bottom
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> maybe its a rule thing
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ok its a short code thing
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> so every char has a structure code at the end
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> and they just decided that you can ignore the last code for Âëò
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> probably because it is more common
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> mine is BWO and FGO
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ez
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but longer code overall tho
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When will the east upgrade to a computer friendly alphabet?
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :kek:
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/881636648440455178/Screenshot_20210830-042909.jpg
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe take the korean route? They still have cool glyphs but the rules allow for typing easily
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> is chinese actually the only language (in use) that is solely designed by shape?
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> like we just do not have a "alphabet"
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> like you can't just break down a kanji into several pieces. a kanji is the smallest unit in chinese.
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> and you have to remember most of them if you want to read a book.
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :justatest:
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think I've seen another language like it
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hindu and arabic are also very difficult for computers but for different reasons, there are glyphs there, it's just hard to combine them
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> and we can't just make a system for us to import english word without nuking the meaning for some kanjis and just stuff them together to make a sound.
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :kek: imagine reading a book with only kanjis
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> one of my friend who lives in japan think japanese are less likely to learn kanjis as well
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> when we were making jp translations for ddnet he even suggested breaking down some of the common kanjis cuz nobody use them anymore.
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but we did keep some of them just be cause otherwise they were too long
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm there is this single unicode letter in arabic but seems it is a combination of others just made into one for ease of use` Ô∑Ω`
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> it is stacked
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i think it is supposed to be a pretty long character
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but some font just stacks it to make it more like one character
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is very wide on my computer but stacked on mobile indeed
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> if I copy that into firefox it becomes squashed into a rectangle
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Arabic as far as I'm aware has an alphabet
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> https://youtu.be/cnMWoupwH6s
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why not just use the latin alphabet at that point anyway?
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The people should be fairly familiar with the glyphs and have some idea of the sounds from using pinyin
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> because "normal people" who don't know english need a way to say it
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm. Well that is an issue maybe you should borrow katakana
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :kek: exactly
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> because we just don't have that
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> fun fact: pinyin and zhuyin are actually a modern invention. imagine how chinese education before these.
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> seems like chinese is actually the last one in real use: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i find it very hard to wrap around why u need so many symbols when english does with 23
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> fun fact: pinyin and zhuyin are actually a modern invention. imagine how chinese education works before these.
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, every other script moved away from logograms, usually thousands of years ago
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Very interesting that it stuck around so long in china, a country decently connected to the rest of the world through trade
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe when long distance trading became a thing it was already too late to change
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i think they have a system back then, because you learn to speak before reading, they can just map what you can speak into characters. and now you at least know how to read the characters you've spoken.
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> so i think ancient chinese books marks chars with two common characters where you would combine the two sounds
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So you need some bootstrapping as a child to learn the common characters üòõ
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> well most people can't read back then anyway.
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i think one of my grandfather actually can't read.
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it's no surprise, these extremely complex scripts have led to very low literacy rates consistently
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Linguistic_map_Southwestern_Europe-en.gif/800px-Linguistic_map_Southwestern_Europe-en.gif
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we were arabs lol
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> now it's pretty hard to not read tho
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :kek:
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> education and computers came a long way for china
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> btw, it is really weird now that a lot of thing i just physically can not say in Chinese and i have to struggle a bit to find a alternative.
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tech stuff?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> people usually complains when people back from abroad mix too much english when speaking.
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but it is sometime difficult to say it in actual chinese :justatest:
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> a quick example that i can think of is schedule.
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i mean i know how to express "let me check my schedule" in chinese now. but the first time it came up it is weird that i just can not say it directly.
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> do you guys use the expression where you repeat a word for emphasis? or it is a american thing
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> usually mo
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> x
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> d
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> not very often I would say
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> like "i just saw a mouse on my table, a mouse mouse".
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> like saying it's an actual mouse.
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :justatest:
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> yeah
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> maybe it's a american thing.
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> america Ts
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> american Ts
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i accidentally used that in chinese once and got my family confused.
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :justatest:
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> and air quoting. bad habits
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> air quoting?
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> are there equivalent quotation marks in chinese?
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ‚Äú‚Äù
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ""
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> hm
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> it's the same are yours
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> almost
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but chinese people don't know what air quoting is. actually we just don't gesture when we talk at all. i just got used to talking like a american i guess.
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :justatest:
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The word repeats aren't really a thing in any other language I'm familiar with
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Haven't heard it in italian, french or turkish
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i think chinese's punctuations are almost 1 one to one to english ones. apart from the title marks
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I've never seen it being used in german, but I think it would be understood
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I've never seen word repeats being used in german, but I think it would be understood
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would be understood in turkish aswell, but you'd sound like a badly translated movie
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @TsFreddie Epizeuxis
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> „Ääbook/song title here„Äã
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epizeuxis
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> oh also think quotation marks are modernized
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur quotation marks are weird
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> old chinese probably use what japanese are using
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, the "mouse mouse" thing is probably not what's in this article
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> „Äålike these„Äç
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Air quotes did get adopted by turkish people rather quickly though, so we have those now üòõ
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> German is also weird: ‚ÄûG√§nsef√º√üchen‚Äú
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 oh
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe its this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrastive_focus_reduplication
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> spanish people be like we need two exclamation marks
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > In English
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Contrastive focus reduplication is a form of motivated redundancy.[5] It is primarily employed as a form of repair in order to reinforce a speaker's true intended meaning.[4][2]
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> totally different naming sense for those two terms xD
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @TsFreddie it actually makes some kind of sense, so u know where the question stats
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hola, ¬øComo estas?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> starts*
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ü§î
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> well i guess
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also it looks cool
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This looks closer
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Diacope is "Bond. James Bond." ‚Äî James Bond
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Languages require sarcasm punctuation in the age of internet
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sarcasm is quite hard to get across üòõ
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes put \\s or reddit is offended
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you fat/s
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you fat\s
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> bruh xd
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> was it /s
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or \\s
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> habr-users use /s
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love the name
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Contrastive focus reduplication"
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so complicated
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> makes u look smart
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you even can call it CFR
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> apparently some ethiopic languages have an irony mark, heh TIL
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "I'm up, I'm just not up up."
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> wtf
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> chinese has a stop mark
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i haven't seen it being used for like ever
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Stop mark? Like a period?
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> .
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> „ÄÅ
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> it's probably more common in speech scripts
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> like if you are listing things, in a speech it make sense to stop in between you listing the things.
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> „ÄÇ„ÄÅjapanese has them too, I see them fairly often too, but I bet it relates a lot to the media
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> most people just use comma for that niw
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> most people just use comma for that now
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Manga doesn't have much punctuation except ! as most sentences stand alone
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> bruh i just realize i might be bad at chinese
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u read raw manga?
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur more weeb than me
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not much, mostly since I can't read that well yet and it's just not enjoyable
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ü§î
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can only read children's books with furigana as it's a lot of pain to keep checking the readings for letters
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can get a sense of the meaning by looking at it though, just can't really read üòõ
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> tbh if i got the hiragana remembered. i can probably just sound out the meaning plus reading the kanjis to get it.
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you can get a very general idea I guess
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> probably.
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i was a weeb too afterall
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Âë≥ÂôåÊ±Å, can you take a gander at this maybe? What does it look like to someone that can read chinese?
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> dude
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> we literally call it Âë≥Âôå
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> it's a imported word so we just import the entire kanji of course (unlike english)
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> miso soup btw
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> forgot to actually answer
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I picked something too common
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> Ê≥•Ê£í
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> this makes no sense in chinese
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u learn all the thousand symbols or are the tricks to it
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> but do know that it means

23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> idk
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :justatest:
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Altogether there are over 50,000 characters, though a comprehensive modern dictionary will rarely list over 20,000 in use. An educated Chinese person will know about 8,000 characters, but you will only need about 2-3,000 to be able to read a newspaper.
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> he is a cheater, born with the glyphs in his blood
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> its more like you learn the first 3000.
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2k is insane already to me xd
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess i should see them as words
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> and the rest is guess and confirm
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we probs know thousand of words
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> you probably know 8k to 10k english words or more if you are not native
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we mere mortals adopt a lot of cheats to help memorize, most people use absurd stories

23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> every digit in chinese is one syllable
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> which is super handy for numbers
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ngl
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chinese ppl spam numbers
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Âêê is just "mouth" + "soil". The kanji has the meaning "spit". Some make a lot of sense like this one
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> does it tho:justatest:
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean just imagine a guy spitting on the ground
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> oh i thought you are imagining putting soil in your mouth so you have to spit it out or something
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> :justatest:
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh, whichever you can imagine more clearly works the best
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> cuz when i see Âúü i don't think of ground at all
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> it's just dirt for me
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well where do you chinese people keep your dirt? on the sky? üòõ
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ü§î
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> fair enough
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> also Â£´
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> ü§î ü§î ü§î
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ÂçÅ
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Â£´ is gentleman, no idea what it'd be in chinese
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> Â£´ is just a person
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I chose to remember that one as a pictogram, it somewhy looks like a persons upper torso to me, someone with very broad shoulders
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> Â£´ÂúüÂçÅÁéãÂπ≤‰∏äÁî∞Âè£
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ‰∫∫ is person in japanese, it's way too common so I don't really have a story for it
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "gentleman", "soil", "ten", "king", "dry", "above", "rice field", "mouth" the ones with low stroke count aren't that much trouble imho, very easy to read
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need to zoom in like 40% on japanese sites so I can make out the damn kanji
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> pro
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> does japanese has kanjis for numbers
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> ‰∏Ä?
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> Â£πÔºü
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Êàë‰∏çÈÖ∑ÔºåÂõ†‰∏∫Êàë‰∏ç‰ºöËØ¥‰∏≠Êñá„ÄÇ ÂºóÈõ∑Ëø™Âá∫Âéª‰∫Ü
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> it's probably not common
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ‰∏Ä‰∫å‰∏âÂõõ‰∫îÂÖ≠‰∏ÉÂÖ´‰πùÂçÅ
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> i think they even have chinese pronunciation for these?
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think the german slang wasnt translated correctly xd
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> like do they say chi instead of nana for ‰∏É
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "ichi", "ni", "san", "yon", "go", "roku", "nana", "hachi", "kyuu", "jyuu" would be the normal readings
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but in some constructs they do use the chinese readings, e.g. when saying seventh you say "shichi"
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> weird
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/881658861256339526/Screenshot_20210830-055718.jpg
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> numbers in english is so longüò´
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 365879
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not too long
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Japanese has a dire need for deduping, 3 alphabets, 3 ways to read numbers
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> üíØ
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> have you played rhythm docter
