01:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> hello!
01:28 < bridge> <louis> where are u seeing who has write access
01:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> they have commits without pr
01:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> what are these files, they dont exist?
01:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1414755292159283351/image.png?ex=68c0b90a&is=68bf678a&hm=10fda48c27a758a7e4c9888c1fe55aeedddbbea1befc31fc3c66fab7f4cdd1e2&

01:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and generally who is making merge pr commits
01:39 < bridge> <kebscs> looks like no
01:39 < bridge> <kebscs> theyre in teeworlds 0.7 repo tho
01:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> what happens do these images anyway?
01:40 < bridge> <louis> i think those commits have prs, u can click on the pr link from the commit
01:40 < bridge> <kebscs> unused in ddnet i guess
01:41 < bridge> <kebscs> thats why no errors when they dont exist
01:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you sure can
01:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> my bad didnt see that
01:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and the screenshot i screenshotted may of been just for raw commits rather than merge commits
01:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well missing assets dont error
01:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i am making it error on tclient as a check for not copying the correct data directory
01:42 < bridge> <kebscs> some of the teeworlds assets are nice tho
01:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and i noticed it
01:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i heard a new ninja sound in 0.7
01:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i heard a new ninja sound in ddnet-rs
01:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> what assets do u like in 0.7?
01:43 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1414758009103454289/level.png?ex=68c0bb92&is=68bf6a12&hm=c15c700ad7a6f7ee909ef4cdc5df62d16e83dc66b7585e44902b9be753cc58de&
01:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> those are the difficulties
01:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> theres not much point in backporting them
01:43 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1414758105954390107/sidebar.png?ex=68c0bba9&is=68bf6a29&hm=1c9dd3ded272942e40018e8dfb388e51b97a399153f59e663389c8aa176d8e7c&
01:43 < bridge> <kebscs> the tee with + is nice
01:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i do agree
01:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think we have i and reload and serverlist icons from the font
01:44 < bridge> <kebscs> what if we use the tee with + in hud to indicate in hud that you have tunes
01:44 < bridge> <kebscs> what if we use the tee with + in hud to indicate that you have tunes
01:44 < bridge> <kebscs> 🧠
01:45 < bridge> <kebscs> tune lock wont be so confusing
01:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i am confused by what u mean
01:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so that didnt work
01:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think most people dont know what a tune lock is
01:47 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1414759020241223842/image.png?ex=68c0bc83&is=68bf6b03&hm=e6ea9b392ff832eb2947fddf34d9b693ce33e6eafce0f3ee3b5e6d9578f77d49&
01:47 < bridge> <kebscs> here, so if you have custom tunes on you it shows extra icons
01:47 < bridge> <kebscs> here, so if you have custom tunes on you it shows extra icon
01:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think having icons for each tune would be better
01:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which can use tees
01:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and have them like status effects, you can open chat and hover over them
01:48 < bridge> <kebscs> theres too many of them
01:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you arent 'posed to have all of em at once
01:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and you can always ... them, they werent being showed anyways
01:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
01:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> #include <game/generated/client_data.h>
01:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> #include <game/generated/protocol.h>
01:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
01:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 
01:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> these 2 includes r gone now
01:53 < bridge> <kebscs> too confusing for hud
01:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im sure you can make a convincing icon for all of the tunes
01:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> like jupiter/moon gravity
01:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or some fancy shoes or a snail shell
01:54 < bridge> <kebscs> theres like 30 tunes rn, and you can have different combinations
01:54 < bridge> <kebscs> where do you fit all these icons
01:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you dont have all the icons active at once
01:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and if you do you hide them behind ...
01:54 < bridge> <kebscs> :nouis:
01:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> :)
01:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> someone would have to make all these icons
01:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it doesnt really matter how well they instantly potray the information as people iwll learn about them
01:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> they just gotta be unique enough to not be confused for eachother
01:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and memorable
01:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its btter than "turn of entities" or server msgs in a single langugae or sometimes icons in the map itself
01:57 < bridge> <kebscs> some maps dont want u to know what tunes you have
01:57 < bridge> <kebscs> like oco
01:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why would u want to hide tunes?

09:12 < bridge> <blazulite> who's kio
09:12 < bridge> <melon> let's not give cheat devs more attention than they deserve
09:12 < bridge> <zelamusinc> XD
09:13 < bridge> <blazulite> oh alr
09:15 < bridge> <zelamusinc> Whats explore?
09:15 < bridge> <zelamusinc> There is servers already
09:15 < bridge> <blazulite> Servers is the DDNet browser 
09:15 < bridge> <blazulite> the Explorer is to look for maps, users, clans, etc
09:15 < bridge> <melon> Communities, news, wiki pages, videos
09:15 < bridge> <blazulite> oh wellp that too
09:15 < bridge> <blazulite> lol
09:16 < bridge> <melon> That's what I thought it's used for
09:16 < bridge> <melon> :justatest:
09:16 < bridge> <blazulite> "Explore" is a really broad term
09:16 < bridge> <blazulite> so
09:16 < bridge> <blazulite> It fits for both our concepts no?
09:16 < bridge> <melon> We just dump everything in there
09:16 < bridge> <zelamusinc> And how do you plan getting those infos , afaik ddnets official api's doesnt give much
09:16 < bridge> <melon> It does in fact give a lot
09:16 < bridge> <blazulite> ^
09:17 < bridge> <blazulite> Plus with the accounts database we could also attach more info (Biographies, social medias to link, etc)
09:17 < bridge> <zelamusinc> 😞
09:17 < bridge> <blazulite> Kinda like how Geometry Dash does
09:17 < bridge> <melon> Masterserver sends the names of all connected clients
09:17 < bridge> <melon> The player pages are available as Json
09:17 < bridge> <melon> 
09:17 < bridge> <melon> And the DB can be downloaded
09:17 < bridge> <blazulite> There will be a clans database as well right @blaiszephyr?
09:17 < bridge> <zelamusinc> Only online players, thats a problem
09:18 < bridge> <melon> Website's like furo fetch activity:
09:18 < bridge> <melon> 
09:18 < bridge> <melon> https://ddstats.tw/players/melon
09:18 < bridge> <blazulite> I mean, the clans system sure does need to be more safe.
09:18 < bridge> <blazulite> Since the current clans system security is... um... well...

09:18 < bridge> <melon> Website's like furo beautify activity and other stats
09:18 < bridge> <melon> 
09:18 < bridge> <melon> https://ddstats.tw/player/melon
09:18 < bridge> <blazulite> It would be so cool if clans were also able to have profiles
09:19 < bridge> <blazulite> And letting the players customize tf out of it
09:19 < bridge> <melon> Maybe in 10 years
09:19 < bridge> <melon> :justatest:
09:19 < bridge> <zelamusinc> Depending on unofficial apis didnt seem like an option
09:19 < bridge> <zelamusinc> https://zelamuss.github.io/TeeViewer/players.html?player=Melon
09:19 < bridge> <blazulite> And letting the clan owners customize tf out of it
09:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon true bavarian
09:19 < bridge> <melon> There isn't a single unofficial API on ddstats
09:19 < bridge> <blazulite> hi chiller dragon from kings of gore
09:19 < bridge> <melon> I don't quite understand your point I'm afraid
09:20 < bridge> <zelamusinc> ddstats is unofficial
09:20 < bridge> <melon> it's a frontend for available data
09:20 < bridge> <zelamusinc> Also a backend ,but u cant depend on it can you? Could close at anytime
09:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so can ddnet
09:21 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** already has actually
09:21 < bridge> <melon> ddnet.tw my beloved
09:21 < bridge> <zelamusinc> unlikely
09:21 < bridge> <blazulite> ddnet dot taiwan
09:21 < bridge> <melon> the point is that it already happened :justatest:
09:21 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @zelamusinc sorry i didnt read entire backlog what are you looking for?
09:22 < bridge> <blazulite> ragebaiting melon

09:24 < bridge> <blazulite> ChillerDragon: this is the starting point of the conversation
09:24 < bridge> <blazulite> then zelamus said
09:24 < bridge> <blazulite> > And how do you plan getting those infos , afaik ddnets official api's doesnt give much
09:24 < bridge> <blazulite> then melon said it does give a lot and we could just use ddstats.tw
09:24 < bridge> <blazulite> then zelamus said depending on unofficial apis didnt seem like an option
09:24 < bridge> <blazulite> 
09:25 < bridge> <blazulite> then spiderman fled above us and I said holy shit was that spiderman

09:30 < bridge> <blazulite> 
09:30 < bridge> <blazulite> I updated it a little thanks to some feedback from @.paxtell (love u pookie)
09:30 < bridge> <blazulite> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1414875593605906432/image.png?ex=68c12914&is=68bfd794&hm=cecc85b4970ddf5de1fc1fb366c5834295940a130314e01baa8c976354f6f6e8&
09:30 < bridge> <blazulite> I think it's better now
09:31 < bridge> <blazulite> as always any feedback is greatly appreciated
09:32 < bridge> <zelamusinc> The items are so inside the gameplay
09:32 < bridge> <zelamusinc> Idk how to say
09:33 < bridge> <zelamusinc> The space between the frame and the screen, and between the framing and the items could be less
09:33 < bridge> <zelamusinc> The space between the frame and the screen, and between the framing and the items could be smaller
09:34 < bridge> <zelamusinc> But its nice
09:34 < bridge> <blazulite> well the intention was to make it look kinda close to these, and these usually have around that distance
09:34 < bridge> <blazulite> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1414876650729902151/camera-lens-view-finder-display-background_1017-36686.png?ex=68c12a10&is=68bfd890&hm=31952d441b30e8060ada9b62de7f89d5466b442fd657da11768e344cbc907592&
09:35 < bridge> <blazulite> and I don't think the space is much big honesly
09:35 < bridge> <zelamusinc> Maybe the items could be the outside the frame
09:35 < bridge> <zelamusinc> Alright then
09:36 < bridge> <blazulite> Hmmm
09:36 < bridge> <blazulite> I will try
09:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) @Ewan `sv_destroy_ball_in_death_tile` ? or `sv_destroy_ball_on_death_tile` or `sv_destroy_ball_through_spikers` xd help how to english

09:46 < bridge> <blazulite> ddnet-rs's commands system is already quite powerful i think. I don't think adding support for Lua will be much necessary, especially considering the use most of people give to the console

09:50 < bridge> <zelamusinc> Modern's nice, but the height is waaaay to much

09:51 < bridge> <zelamusinc> And how do you do these mockups
09:51 < bridge> <zelamusinc> What software do u us

13:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I just wanna build the repo 😭
13:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Please update that description cuz it's very misleading if this is not intentional
13:49 < bridge> <melon> of course it's intentional, but you complained about disk space last time
13:49 < bridge> <melon> Idk, maybe don't enable explicit features then :ChooChoo:
13:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> well yeah, and it's still claiming over 20GBs... ofc I complain
13:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> but regardless, I setup my system now so that it's not an issue anymore
13:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> so moving on
13:51 < bridge> <cellegenrih> well this is awkward... I have alsa installed yet it's not on PATH?

14:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> it seems it works again nicely

18:09 < bridge> <sans._.> also on this note, i have used at least some of these packages, can someone help me write a bash script or smth to check my system? :OHNOOOO:
18:15 < bridge> <pilonpl> but was any malware actually distributed?
18:16 < bridge> <pilonpl> i guess it's just a crypto stealer
18:16 < bridge> <pilonpl> nothing to worry about lol
18:17 < ChillerDragon> sv_port was readonly i think
18:17 < ChillerDragon> try searching for ReadOnly xd
18:17 < bridge> <sans._.> still i'd be waray ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
18:18 < bridge> <sans._.> still i'd be wary ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
18:18 < bridge> <pilonpl> oh ok
18:18 < bridge> <pilonpl> i guess it's trivial then
18:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> i was expecting there to be a read only flag
18:20 < bridge> <pilonpl> because like why wouldn't it be a flag?
18:24 < bridge> <pilonpl> anyways
18:24 < bridge> <pilonpl> another thing to consider is that if we are making `sv_endless_drag` and `sv_hit` read only why not make other map setting read only too?
18:26 < ChillerDragon> FRA #1 laggy? 193.70.37.160:8303

18:26 < ChillerDragon> @avolicious
18:27 < ChillerDragon> @davide55 is there a ddos?
18:27 < ChillerDragon> not all players seem affected but most
18:27 < ChillerDragon> 5 ppl write in chat "ddos" and the 6th writes "why is everyone afk" xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
18:28 < bridge> <pilonpl> actually setting those configs to read only prevents maps from modifying them lol
18:28 < ChillerDragon> oh yikes
18:28 < ChillerDragon> not good first issue then
18:28 < bridge> <pilonpl> also is there any reason for it to not be a flag?
18:29 < ChillerDragon> wdym a flag
18:30 < ChillerDragon> ah u mean a CFGFLAG_READONLY
18:30 < ChillerDragon> idk
18:32 < bridge> <pilonpl> this issue is actually quite complicated
18:32 < bridge> <pilonpl> it's a waste of time honestly xd
18:32 < ChillerDragon> might be yes
18:33 < ChillerDragon> updating it for all tees on change might actually be easier then
18:33 < ChillerDragon> imo being able to set a config from rcon that only gets partially applied is quite confusing and a bug worth fixing
18:34 < ChillerDragon> there should be more time budget for fixing bugs than for adding features
18:34 < ChillerDragon> @davide55 still ongoing hmm is this a ddos?
18:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Because then nobody could change the variable, which means it's a constant and would be pointless in the configuration
18:37 < bridge> <pilonpl> Right
18:37 < bridge> <pilonpl> So what does read only actually mean?
18:37 < ChillerDragon> maybe u can call the readonly thing after the map config is loaded
18:37 < bridge> <pilonpl> When can a read only variable be set?
18:37 < ChillerDragon> readonly means it can not be set at runtime via rcon but in the config
18:37 < bridge> <pilonpl> When can a read only config be set?
18:37 < bridge> <robyt3> You can set and unset whether variables are read-only at runtime
18:37 < ChillerDragon> ah nice
18:38 < bridge> <pilonpl> So why not allow changing flags at runtime then?
18:39 < bridge> <pilonpl> But if that's the case i guess it should be possible to set those specific commands to be writable during a map load
18:39 < bridge> <robyt3> But this seems like a duplicate of #7589. We should only allow game settings to be changed by the map.
18:39 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7589
18:39 < bridge> <robyt3> But this seems like a duplicate of #7589. We should allow game settings to be changed only by the map.
18:39 < bridge> <pilonpl> Yeah that actually makes sense
18:42 < bridge> <pilonpl> It would feel least arbitrary
18:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Let's say the snippets are larger, than expected
18:46 < bridge> <cellegenrih> maaaaaybe reducing the thickness of the lines by half would make it more interesting?
18:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @blaiszephyr what cargo command should I use to get rid of that shitty alsa lib error?
18:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I cannot use anything else, but alsa-base
19:10 < bridge> <pilonpl> somehow i wasted half the day on this issue
19:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> I guess i could use a debugger to find where in the code map settings are set
19:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> Because it's so hard to find

22:02 < bridge> <manikoo> pipo chat
22:19 < bridge> <Assa> @jupeyy_keks I answered you on github, I believe it might make more sense to discuss here
22:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Nah after 22 no discussions
22:21 < bridge> <Assa> understandable, have a nice evening 👌
22:29 < bridge> <melon> 😆
22:31 < bridge> <kebscs> @robyt3 ive read the const by reference book point, and i know how it works
22:32 < bridge> <kebscs> but why use it over std::move here? just stylistic choice?
22:32 < bridge> <kebscs> ddnet code uses move in some places too
22:34 < bridge> <robyt3> But in this case you are copying anyway because the parameter is passed by value. If you wanted to avoid the move you'd have to pass by rvalue reference as far as I understand it. I think we don't move often in setters where the argument is passed by value. Having it consistently use const references except when we explicitly want to move something makes more sense to me. Otherwise the PR itself mixes different styles, e.g. for `std::function`s.
22:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Based work life balance
22:41 < bridge> <pilonpl> DDNet is life
22:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes no life after 22
22:41 < bridge> <kebscs> const-reference is also 1 move 1 copy
22:41 < bridge> <kebscs> move into function, then copy into variable
22:41 < bridge> <kebscs> by value then move, is 1 copy first then 1 move
22:43 < bridge> <robyt3> I think it's the compiler's job to optimize that, and passing by const reference should presumably give it enough information to do it
22:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don’t trust std @robyt3 are you sure std::vector is the way to go to optimize performance?
22:44 < bridge> <robyt3> Do you only want a finite number of flags in your mod? :justatest:
22:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If it’s faster maybe
22:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There is snap size limits anyways
22:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Usually I am okay with vector because it’s convienient and speed doesn’t always matter
22:46 < bridge> <kebscs> idk if you can move when its cons
22:46 < bridge> <kebscs> will check
22:46 < bridge> <kebscs> idk if you can move when its const
22:46 < bridge> <kebscs> i think not
22:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But adding heap allocations to snap to make it faster sounds wrong. But I didn’t think it through. Just wanted to say that. I guess it won’t do anything expensive on tick.
22:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sorry for 2v1ing after 22 @robyt3 just a thought. Trying to avoid that I butchered your performance pr into something that’s not performant and then everyone is sad
22:50 < bridge> <robyt3> No, moving explicitly means modifying the original object. I don't think it matters much, but as a style choice we should mostly stick to const references unless in cases where the move is intentional and useful
22:50 < bridge> <robyt3> So what's a reasonable number of flags? 128?
22:52 < bridge> <kebscs> yea it does compile
22:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think my snap filled at 1010 iirc
22:52 < bridge> <kebscs> not sure how that works when its const will check
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Rule only applies to me. Robyte has no time off
22:52 < bridge> <robyt3> So 1024 I guess
22:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sounds reasonable. I am quite confident that nobody will run into its limits
22:53 < bridge> <kebscs> chat gpt says bcs its const in practice it does copy and not move
22:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If two tees are visible it already goes down to 1005 flags
22:53 < bridge> <kebscs> so ig by value+move is same number of operations as reference+copy
22:54 < bridge> <kebscs> but can stick to reference for ddnet
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Your code doesn't move since you didn't use && for the parameter
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Rvalue
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also a move only works for heap allocated objects. For pod it's simply copying
22:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @jupeyy_keks: yes ofc but it’s not pollite to hijack conversation like that i should have written on GitHub or waited but too lazy
22:55 < bridge> <kebscs> yeah so if its heap allocated function variable it does move?
22:55 < bridge> <kebscs> ```
22:55 < bridge> <kebscs> void func(const int &num) {
22:55 < bridge> <kebscs>     a = num;
22:55 < bridge> <kebscs> }
22:55 < bridge> <kebscs> 
22:55 < bridge> <kebscs> void func( int num) {
22:55 < bridge> <kebscs>     a = std::move(num);
22:55 < bridge> <kebscs> }
22:55 < bridge> <kebscs> ```
22:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That does nothing
22:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Bcs int is simply copy
22:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Move only works for smart pointers
22:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They can change the ownership without deallocation
22:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Basically they copy the internal pointer and then set their pointer to zero
22:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The last thing is ofc not strictly required
22:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @robyt3: oh and btw i do not have such mod actually. I just coded it to test the pr. But I think it’s cool to have and someone might be using it and I for sure could see it being used in the future.
22:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So all the structures as vector and shared ptr and unique ptr can move
22:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If you want to take a moved value you have to use std:: vector && myvalue
22:59 < bridge> <kebscs> i think everything can be moved
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But moving is still a copy
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's not like u can move a stack object into heap
23:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Moving is about changing owner ship.. But a simple type like int cannot be owned
23:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> A vector owns a heap object
23:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The internal pointer again is copied
23:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That cannot be moved
23:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So even for vector a move does copy
23:01 < bridge> <kebscs> ok for int sure
23:01 < bridge> <kebscs> but when its CCharacterCore like in my pr
23:01 < bridge> <kebscs> `    void SetCore(CCharacterCore Core) { m_Core = std::move(Core); }`
23:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But see the parameter
23:01 < bridge> <kebscs> its on heap from copying into function and then move
23:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The parameter itself is already a copy
23:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wouldnt that be inlined
23:02 < bridge> <robyt3> `CCharacterCore` is POD, so there's nothing to move
23:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Is it?
23:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Hashset
23:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or smth
23:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Hooked by
23:03 < bridge> <robyt3> Ok, it also contains a `std::set` yeah
23:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Anyway the parameter has to be changed
23:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The signature
23:04 < bridge> <kebscs> so copy works in that case?
23:04 < bridge> <kebscs> so move works in that case?
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If the compiler is smart enough to move a local variable (argument) is a different question
23:04 < bridge> <kebscs> or am i understanding the std::move wrong
23:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If you add && after the type yes
23:05 < bridge> <learath2> Unless there is a move constructor that `std::move` won’t do anything
23:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That too
23:06 < bridge> <kebscs> idk then
23:06 < bridge> <kebscs> doesnt && make it so it can only take rvalues
23:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That is the sense of moving
23:09 < bridge> <kebscs> ok i see
23:10 < bridge> <kebscs> but if i want to make a copy first, to not always take by rvalue, im avoiding a second copy with the move?
23:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But then simply take const ref
23:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also this depends on compiler
23:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd assume for built in operator it's smart enough to move the object, but dunno, compile in release build and look xd
23:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Might be inlined anyway
23:12 < bridge> <kebscs> makes sense
23:13 < bridge> <kebscs> so move is kinda useless except for smart pointers
23:13 < bridge> <learath2> You aren’t, `std::move` is a very misunderstood thing, it literally only does one thing, turns what you give it into an `xvalue`
23:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes but tbf there is a set in game core
23:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And that can be moved
23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But instead of moving your local variable, change parameter to r value or const ref
23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Cleaner design
23:14 < bridge> <louis> a cpp book i was reading went straight into explaining rvalues lvalues and xvalues  from ch 1 so i just gave up
23:14 < bridge> <learath2> Very useful for stuff with move constructors, like vectors, strings, maps etc
23:15 < bridge> <learath2> From ch1 is a little early, but you do need to understand value types if you want to learn C++ at a decent level
23:16 < bridge> <learath2> `xvalue`s are very simple to understand, they are `eXpiring`, as in they won’t be used anymore, so you are allowed to plunder their resources as needed, e.g. steal an already allocated buffer instead of needing to allocate your own
23:16 < bridge> <louis> yeah it seemed like a decently advanced book, not in a rush to learn cpp though
23:17 < bridge> <learath2> Stuff like `prvalue materialization` is where it can start to get extremely confusing, with copy elision and stuff
23:20 < bridge> <kebscs> makes sense now
23:21 < bridge> <kebscs> ty @jupeyy_keks @learath2
23:27 < bridge> <kebscs> ```
23:27 < bridge> <kebscs> CLayerTilesEnvelopeReference(std::shared_ptr<CLayerTiles> pLayerTiles) :
23:27 < bridge> <kebscs>     m_pLayerTiles(std::move(pLayerTiles))
23:27 < bridge> <kebscs> ```
23:27 < bridge> <kebscs> and this can be move, or should i prefer const reference anyway?
23:30 < bridge> <learath2> Idk what this does or what it is for, but you almost always want to move shared ptrs when possible so as not to incur a refcount bump and immediate drop
23:31 < bridge> <robyt3> Most shared pointers are currently passed by const reference though, because that's what clang-tidy suggests

23:33 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, and what you store the reference after or make a copy?
23:33 < bridge> <learath2> As long as you don’t pass by value then immediately make another copy the performance is the same
23:35 < bridge> <robyt3> Sometime the const references are only used, sometimes also copied to the object
23:35 < bridge> <nikhard> How do I can get my Client or ClientId in gameclient.cpp? And how does m_aLocalIds work?
23:36 < bridge> <learath2> Only really safe as long as you can guarantee that the object outlives the reference by some means, but yeah I see
23:37 < bridge> <aegisub> yeah these two have different ownership semantics
23:37 < bridge> <kebscs> can use m_pLocalCharacter, m_aLocalIds[0] = main m_aLocalIds[1] = dummy, m_aLocalIds[g_Config.m_ClDummy] = what's currently acrtive
23:37 < bridge> <kebscs> so what would be best here, move or const-reference?
23:38 < bridge> <kebscs> looks like ddnet code uses move for similar
23:39 < bridge> <aegisub> there's pros and cons to all options but I think taking it by value and doing std::move makes sense
23:39 < bridge> <aegisub> taking a const lvalue reference means you can't take an rvalue which may be annoying
23:39 < bridge> <aegisub> scott meyers says
23:39 < bridge> <aegisub> > Consider pass by value for copyable

23:39 < bridge> <aegisub> > Consider pass by value for copyable parameters that are cheap to move and always copied
23:39 < bridge> <aegisub> and I believe this applies here
23:40 < bridge> <learath2> If unsure what you did is definitely safe and performant. If you are sure this object never outlives that reference you’d be passing in then a const ref would be “better”
23:41 < bridge> <Assa> But it may outlive it, this Reference object is part of the editor history
23:42 < bridge> <learath2> Then 100% pass by value then move it in
23:43 < bridge> <Assa> and thats why it's a shared ptr in the first place
23:44 < bridge> <kebscs> alr will update pr, everwhere const-ref except this on screenshot
