01:21 < Chairn> ddos on ger
01:23 < Chairn> i got kicked from server and some servers are not appearing anymore...
01:28 < Chairn> uU, i used timeout protection, but i dont receive any server message
01:34 < Chairn> is that possible to receive some sserver information if you got timeout?
01:37 < Chairn> well, this is official, we have a new bug
01:37 < Chairn> using timeout protection, and cant receive(dont know about send) any server chat message
03:54  * Henningstone slaps laxadedi around a bit with a large fishbot
03:54  * Henningstone slaps laxa around a bit with a large fishbot
03:54 < Henningstone> are you there?
03:54 < laxa> So, what message do you have if you try to compile without config.lua ?
03:55 < Henningstone> It just recreates the config.lua and throws out the error again
03:56 < laxa> http://askubuntu.com/questions/334884/while-compiling-truecrypt-i-get-undefined-reference-to-symbol-dlcloseglibc
03:56 < laxa> have you tried this ?
03:56 < laxa> do that
03:56 < laxa> export LIBS=-ldl
03:56 < laxa> then ./bam
03:58 < Henningstone> it doesn't change anything. But LIBS is set to -ldl for sure, because when I do $LIBS I see that 
03:58 < laxa> have you got openssl installed ?
03:59 < Henningstone> Yeah, the most current version as apt tells me
03:59 < laxa> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/271
03:59 < laxa> this issue is related to yours
03:59 < laxa> you are not the first
04:00 < laxa> try the ./bam config
04:01 < Henningstone> AUTO  zlib                 (in system path) AUTO  sdl                  using sdl-config AUTO  freetype             using freetype-config AUTO  curl                 using bundled libs AUTO  opusfile             using bundled libs AUTO  opus                 using bundled libs AUTO  ogg                  using bundled libs AUTO  mysql                using bundled libs AUTO  websockets           no
04:01 < laxa> and compile again ?
04:01 < Henningstone> the same error :/
04:02 < laxa> well then
04:02 < laxa> you should edit the config.lua, put everything to true
04:02 < laxa> and be sure to have everything ddnet needs to compile
04:02 < laxa> it should force bam to use system libs instead of the bundeld ones
04:02 < Henningstone> I'll try, wait...
04:03 < laxa> even if you want client only, you need everything ddnet needs
04:04 < laxa> iirc : boost, mysq orm, sdl 1.x, opus, curl, freetype, ogg, zlib
04:08 < laxa> If you still can't compile, could you tell us your OS and arch ?
04:09 < Henningstone> I am using Linux MINT edition MATE x64
04:10 < laxa> Ah ! The last guy with that problem was also using mint
04:10 < laxa> btw, have you read the README ? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
04:11 < laxa> it's basic, but it tells you about using the bundled or the systems one
04:11 < laxa> should work using 100% system libs
04:11 < Henningstone> I tried using the given command line in the README.md, and now I have this:
04:11 < Henningstone> AUTO  sdl                  using sdl-config AUTO  freetype             using freetype-config AUTO  curl                 using pkg-config AUTO  opusfile             using pkg-config AUTO  opus                 using pkg-config AUTO  ogg                  using pkg-config AUTO  mysql                using bundled libs
04:12 < Henningstone> but there are a looooot of errors telling me that it cannot find a shit.
04:12 < Henningstone> The problem is, I think, that I can
04:12 < Henningstone> ups
04:12 < Henningstone> √§h,
04:12 < Henningstone> I can't apt-get install libcurl, libogg, libopus, libopusfile
04:13 < Henningstone> it says that they do not exist
04:13 < laxa> apt-cache search libcurl etc...
04:13 < laxa> Their name isn't always that simple
04:13 < laxa> ok
04:13 < laxa> let's try something
04:13 < Henningstone> ok
04:14 < laxa> bam config curl.use_pkgconfig=true opus.use_pkgconfig=false opusfile.use_pkgconfig=false ogg.use_pkgconfig=false
04:14 < laxa> then wait
04:14 < Henningstone> ok I wait
04:15 < laxa> apt-get install libcurl3
04:15 < laxa> should probably work
04:15 < laxa> either that, or you need to 'apt-cache search libcurl'
04:15 < laxa> and find the meta package
04:15 < laxa> then you try to compile again
04:15 < Henningstone> I already have libcurl3, it says
04:16 < Henningstone> Yeah, well,...
04:16 < Henningstone> [ 18/130] #1 c++ src/game/client/components/mapimages.cpp Package libcurl was not found in the pkg-config search path. Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libcurl.pc' to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable No package 'libcurl' found
04:16 < Henningstone> that msg 1000 times.
04:16 < laxa> ok
04:16 < laxa> that helps at least ^^
04:16 < Henningstone> nice but I have no clue where to find libcurl.pc
04:16 < laxa> locate libcurl
04:17 < Henningstone> lol its that easy? xD
04:17 < laxa> it's a command
04:17 < laxa> yes
04:18 < Henningstone> hmm it shows me some stuff
04:18 < laxa> wait
04:18 < laxa> try this : locate libcurl.pc
04:18 < laxa> have you got any result ?
04:19 < Henningstone> already tried it, nothing.
04:19 < laxa> if you do this : ll /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/libcurl.pc
04:19 < laxa> any result ?
04:19 < laxa> well, does that print something ?
04:19 < Henningstone> can't be accessed it prints
04:20 < Henningstone> so doesnt exist
04:20 < laxa> can't be accessed and doesn't exist are two different things to me
04:20 < Henningstone> yeah it can't be accessed because it doesn't exist :)
04:21 < Henningstone> ls: Zugriff auf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/libcurl.pc nicht m√∂glich: Datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden
04:21 < laxa> do that : find /usr/ -name 'libcurl.pc'
04:21 < Henningstone> nothing
04:21 < laxa> then
04:22 < Henningstone> I have to say sorry that I'm such a linux noob, but I am, maybe was, native windows user...
04:22 < laxa> find / -name 'libcurl.pc'
04:22 < laxa> might take some time though, depending on how full your disk is full
04:22 < Chairn> Henningstone: you can still come back to the dark side ^^
04:22 < Henningstone> nothing when I do this, laxa
04:24 < Henningstone> @laxa I have to tell you, when I configure bam to use only pkg's, everything is missing not only libcurl.pc
04:24 < Henningstone> through this: bam config curl.use_pkgconfig=true opus.use_pkgconfig=false opusfile.use_pkgconfig=false ogg.use_pkgconfig=false
04:25 < Henningstone> oups, assume every 'false' as 'true' please, it's a copy-paste mistake
04:25 < laxa> pkg-config --list-all | grep libcurl
04:26 < Henningstone> should that output smth?
04:26 < Henningstone> because it doesn't
04:26 < laxa> well yeah
04:26 < laxa> well, it means probably that means isn't that standard
04:27 < laxa> -means+mint
04:27 < Henningstone> I thought it could have been, because they forked it from ubuntu...
04:27 < laxa> that means, the only way I could think of is to add a line to gcc to link to your libcurl.so
04:27 < laxa> but I think ddnet compiles curl with static lib
04:27 < laxa> well
04:28 < laxa> if you fork, it's to make changes
04:28 < laxa> ddnet is a fork of teeworlds
04:28 < Henningstone> yeah I know that
04:28 < Henningstone> and I mean what I said
04:28 < Henningstone> Ubuntu... jears ago
04:28 < Henningstone> before they went to Unity (which I don't like so I use MINT)
04:30 < laxa> try that
04:30 < laxa> find / -name '*curl*.a'
04:31 < Henningstone> it finds only the files /ddnet/other/curl/linux/lib64/libcurl.a
04:31 < Henningstone> and for lib32 the same
04:31 < laxa> do that
04:31 < laxa> ./bam -v
04:31 < laxa> and copy paste the result to pastebin.com
04:32 < Henningstone> oh hey, er, the "result" is overfloating my terminal :0 So I give you just the last part of it, wait, link follows...
04:33 < laxa> then do that
04:33 < laxa> ./ban -v > output
04:33 < laxa> ./bam -v > output
04:33 < Henningstone> thats true...
04:34 < Henningstone> oh its so much shorter at the second call
04:34 < Henningstone> wait
04:34 < Henningstone> -- first link: http://pastebin.com/g25w4rYj
04:35 < Henningstone> -- second link: http://pastebin.com/WcRphYrY
04:36 < Henningstone> Hmm... Thanks so much for your help and what you tried... Nevermind that it didn't work. I'll ask Meskalin tomorrow, I think he uses MINT too. But now I'll go to bed, it is very late :3

04:50 < laxa> then, ./bam config

04:50 < Henningstone> uhhh it downloads so much >.> hopin' for success ^
04:51 < laxa> it will hopefully
04:51 < Henningstone> Ahhhhh look at this, it were after "rm bam.config" then "bam config"
04:51 < Henningstone> AUTO  curl                 using pkg-config
04:52 < Henningstone> AND YEAAAAAHHHH IT SUCCEDED!!
04:52 < laxa> :)
04:52 < Henningstone> THANK MAN! The only problem was my noobyness >.<
04:53 < laxa> the problem too is bam
04:53 < Henningstone> thank you so much for your effords on solving my problem :)
04:54 < laxa> Your welcome
04:54 < Henningstone> And now I can go to sleep well with a good feeling that it works now :D
11:59 <@EastByte> deen: hab das problem mit der timeout protection gefunden
11:59 <@EastByte> verstehe nur nicht warum das problem vor dem antispoof patch nicht aufgetreten ist
12:01 <@EastByte> whoops, english pls
12:13 <@deen> EastByte: i think it did happen sometimes
12:13 <@deen> and great that you found it
12:15 <@EastByte> the problem I found is that the server still sends packets to the timeouted slots
12:15 <@EastByte> which can still be received by the client if it tries to reconnect
12:16 <@deen> right
12:16 <@deen> can you fix it?
12:16 <@EastByte> in my case the client receives two different snapshots
12:16 <@EastByte> I could fix it by simply not sending packets to timeouted slots
12:40 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east opened pull request #300: Fixes current problems with timeout protection (master...timeoutfix) http://git.io/vsr0c
12:42 <@EastByte> we should probably add this to the servers until evening
12:42 <@EastByte> this isse makes ddos attacks even worse
12:42 <@EastByte> issue*
13:11 <@EastByte> uchar made his whole client source dos style :/
13:12 <@EastByte> afk
14:11 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/vsrXe

14:11 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 466fcf0 Dennis Felsing: Merge pull request #300 from east/timeoutfix...
14:15 <@EastByte> deen: tell me if or when you are restarting
14:16 <@deen> EastByte: looks good
14:16 <@deen> just tested on an empty server
14:16 <@deen> found no issues so far
14:17 <@EastByte> okay, I'll also test it in some minutes
14:40 <@EastByte> deen: meh, I'll need to add another fix
14:40 <@EastByte> it's a bit problematic now
14:40 <@EastByte> deen: what happend before when a client lost connection and immediately tried to reconnect?
14:41 <@deen> dunno
14:41 <@EastByte> now the client cannot reconnect until timeout protection triggers (or client restart)
14:42 <@deen> oh well, i tested with 1 second timeout protecion^^
14:43 <@EastByte> ^^
14:43 <@EastByte> I think I'll make reconnecting (session rejoin) possible
14:43 <@deen> great
14:43 <@deen> that never worked
14:43 <@EastByte> before timeout protection triggers
14:44 <@EastByte> yea I remember^^
14:44 <@deen> i think i was afraid of it because of spoofing
14:44 <@EastByte> yea no problem with ddnet client now
14:44 <@EastByte> vanilla though...
14:45 <@EastByte> I cannot help non-ddnet or < 703 in this case
15:06 < uchar> hi
15:06 <@EastByte> hellow
15:07 <@EastByte> uchar: I see dos line endings everywhere in your code
15:07 < uchar> yeah.. fuck windows...
15:07 < uchar> xD
15:08 < uchar> but i don't have any program to convert endings to all files... xD
15:08 < uchar> i have some warnings... https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30566237/imgs/Captura%20de%20pantalla%20de%202015-08-23%2015%3A04%3A03.png
15:08 < uchar> reading can cause "undefined" issues
15:09 <@EastByte> yep, strict-aliasing warnings
15:10 <@EastByte> not sure how to properly fix those
15:17 < uchar> digest: 16 bytes and SecurityToken: 4 bytes ?ø?
15:20 <@EastByte> uchar: security token uses 4 bytes of the md5 hash
15:21 < fstd> is the code dereferencing a part of a md5 digest? :O
15:21 <@EastByte> yea
15:21 < fstd> why?
15:22 <@EastByte> the token is 4 bytes long
15:22 < fstd> yes, that's why it's a strict aliasing violation, but i don't understand how dereferencing that makes sense in the first place
15:23 <@EastByte> looks like the most efficient way
15:24 <@EastByte> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/shared/network_server.cpp#L18
15:24 <@EastByte> could also be done like this
15:26 < fstd> ah, it's an array in disguise.  never mind, i misread
15:27 <@EastByte> ah okay
15:27 < fstd> i thought it was cutting off 4 bytes of the actual digest and casting /that/ to a pointer type and dereferencing it
15:28 <@EastByte> I also misunderstood that in the first place
15:28 <@EastByte> eeeee's work I guess :)
15:29 < uchar> yeah the github way looks good xD
15:29 <@EastByte> ^ we should probably use that
15:30 <@EastByte> I don't know though how dereferencing 4 bytes of an array to an integer can lead to problems
15:31 < fstd> it's a strict aliasing violation that is technically undefied behavior, i think
15:31 <@EastByte> hm
15:31 < fstd> so the compiler could, even if gcc currently doesn't seem to, mess it up
15:32 < uchar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26713851/dereferencing-type-punned-pointer-will-break-strict-aliasing-rules-wstrict-ali
15:33 < fstd> there's also a possible alignment problem, the array of bytes need not necessarily be correctly aligned to be accessed as an int *  (which I believe is what SECURITY_TOKEN is)
15:36 <@EastByte> yes, well that would make sense
15:36 < fstd> as for efficiency, how often is the token verified?
15:36 < fstd> once per client and session, i guess?
15:37 <@EastByte> nope, basically on every network packet
15:37 < fstd> ah, okay.  still probably not a concern, but that's more than i thought then :)
15:37 <@EastByte> right
16:15 < WolfAlex> o_be_one: ping
16:25 < Chairn> EastByte: any idea about this : http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2094 ?
16:26 <@EastByte> Chairn: pretty much I think
16:26 <@EastByte> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/300
16:27 < Chairn> 5 times in 1 hour, that was really disturbing :D
16:27 <@EastByte> I'm still improving timeout protection now
16:27 <@EastByte> hopfully it will be fixed
16:27 < Chairn> but it was first time i got this
16:28 <@EastByte> after timeout the server still sent snapshots to the timeouted client
16:28 <@EastByte> that caused the strange laggs
16:29 < Chairn> ok
16:29 < Chairn> and about the fact that chat didnt work after tiemout protection?
16:30 <@EastByte> not sure, maybe the timeout protection did even trigger
16:30 <@EastByte> but it already looks like you owned your old tee
16:30 <@EastByte> didn't even trigger*
16:30 < Chairn> yeah, i could get him back, but chat wasnt working except /* commands and special tile like no hit
16:31 < Chairn> no message from other tees but i think they could read mine
16:33 <@EastByte> we will see, I expect further bugs to show up anyways
16:41 < o_be_one> WolfAlex, ?
16:41 < o_be_one> pong !
16:43 < WolfAlex> o_be_one: on the ovh game servers, do they also have ddos pro with the normal firewall?
16:44 < o_be_one> pro firewall yes WolfAlex 
16:45 < WolfAlex> how are the gamerules set?
16:46 < WolfAlex> are they set per-ip? or per server? and do i select "i'm running minecraft on port xxx" - and then this ports is with the new filter? ._. 
16:57 < o_be_one> per ip
16:57 < o_be_one> you can choose all game profiles you need
16:58 < WolfAlex> there is no limitation?

18:19 <@EastByte> oh works a bit differently when merging own pull request
18:20 < Learath2> i cant get this to link :/
18:20 <@EastByte> wut? the text was successful I think
18:21 <@EastByte>  ci/circleci Your tests passed on CircleCI! 
18:21 < Learath2> not that im trying to use openssl functions
18:21 <@EastByte> ah
18:21 < Learath2> oh its dynamically linked
18:22 < Learath2> how do i tell the linker to ignore it ? LD
18:22 <@EastByte> deen: rebuilding server now would cause laggs I guess?
18:23 <@EastByte> Learath2: what's wrong about dynamically linked
18:24 < Learath2> i need to create the lib file
18:24 < Learath2> EastByte: are you on windows ?
18:25 <@EastByte> nope
18:25 <@EastByte> lib files are windows stuff I think
18:25 < Learath2> yeah
18:25 <@EastByte> haha
18:25 < Learath2> pff visual studio is 10GB and i have 8mbits internet 
18:26 <@EastByte> :D
18:26 <@EastByte> afk
18:51 < o_be_one> WolfAlex, there is, 20 rules in Cisco firewall, and theres just game protection for sources (HL2, CSGO, etc.) and Minecraft, idk if there is other game.
18:52 < o_be_one> WolfAlex, so cisco firewall is just to open ports you need, not to blacklist, for example
18:56 < WolfAlex> so the game servers are like enterprise servers (with ssd) but with preconfigured Cisco ASA 5505/5510/5520 ?
19:01 < o_be_one> its more than just that
19:02 < o_be_one> Cisco behind game servers are more complex, with udp algorithm to check if traffic is allowed
19:02 < o_be_one> and there's just the game network with udp check
19:03 < o_be_one> i'm not allowed to tell more about the algorithm, i can just say it will be awesome when it will be ready (actually it's in beta)
19:08 < WolfAlex> okay :D
19:08 < WolfAlex> thx o_be_one 
19:09 <@EastByte> okay it's official, teeworlds 0.6.4 client basically has no mod support
19:10 < WolfAlex> EastByte: there will be a teeworls 0.6.4?
19:10 <@EastByte> yes
19:11 < WolfAlex> EastByte: why, thats just stupid
19:11 <@EastByte> just a tag with simple fixes like 0.6.3
19:11 <@EastByte> no one will use it anyways
19:21 < Nimda> Day Two by Vasten100 just released on Moderate at 2015-08-23 19:16
21:26 <@deen> no mod support and will be released on steam
21:27 <@deen> so no one of the new players will even be able to try mods
21:36 < laxa> what ?
21:36 < laxa> ddnet servers won't be on the server list of steam client oO ?
21:37 < fstd> how silly
21:37 < fstd> what's the reasoning?
21:42 <@deen> I assume it's this commit: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/f457b58d68e72df83128a7bc779d71a5208dfe47
21:43 < WolfAlex> deen: wait, no mod support = NO mods at all?
21:43 <@deen> i don't know, I'm just reading what EastByte said
21:45 < WolfAlex> deen: if i understand correct, only fastdl (not http-dl) is affected
21:46 < fstd> httpdl is not possible with the vanilla client anyway, is it?
21:47 < Learath2> ofc nod
21:47 < Learath2> not
22:02 <@heinrich5991> deen: as far as I see it's the fastdownload extension that will stop working
22:02 <@heinrich5991> but since TW on steam starts with 0.6.3, it doesn't need immediate response
22:05 <@EastByte> indeed "oldschool" fastdl doesn't work with 0.6.4
22:06 <@EastByte> you can only join like 40% of the servers
22:06 < Learath2> we should do normal download if version > 0.6.3
22:08 <@EastByte> it's fixable anyways
22:08 <@EastByte> map chunks just need vital flag
22:09 < Savander> EastByte, savander.pl/upload/dafuq.demo
22:09 < Savander> check this demo
22:09 < Savander> and tell me, what's going on
22:09 <@EastByte> I probably already know how the demo looks like
22:09 <@EastByte> brb
22:14 <@EastByte> Savander: hopefully only prediction bugs
22:14 < Savander> It's bug or?
22:17 <@EastByte> looks pretty scary
22:17 < Savander> hahah
22:17 < Savander> ye
22:17 < Savander> and i can't move :P
22:17 < Savander> but it's client side
22:18 < Savander> bumeq and Lady played normally.
22:18 <@EastByte> ah okay
22:18 <@EastByte> have you got a timeout before?
22:19 < Savander> nope
22:19 < Savander> but it was
22:19 < Savander> first connect
22:19 < Savander> i mean, after connection
22:37 <@EastByte> strange
22:43 <@EastByte> Savander: can you tell me the server you played on?
22:45 < Savander> 8317
22:45 < Savander> GER2
22:49 <@EastByte> atleast the server is not up to date
22:53 < Savander> :P
23:15 <@deen> thanks for the good work, EastByte & Savander
23:15 < Savander> hm
23:15 < Savander> ?
23:15 <@deen> just in general, last days/weeks
23:15 <@EastByte> deen: btw. still working on the demo column/sort list
23:15 <@EastByte> pretty fun
23:15 <@EastByte> no problem :)
23:15 <@deen> Savander: for example you reacted right in forum right now, and EastByte is working on important development stuff
23:15 < Savander> no problem 
23:16 < Savander> :), It's my job at this moment
23:16 < Savander> ^^
23:16 <@deen> Savander: i was just thinking about whether to write the same or delete it myself and then you posted already, so great
23:16 < Savander> ;p
23:16 < Savander> i don't like post like that
23:17 <@deen> it's bad for the community as a whole
23:17 < Savander> forum should be friendly for everyone, and shouldn't make bad look on anyone.
23:17 <@deen> and of course for the people involved as well
23:17 <@deen> yeah
23:17 < Savander> Aoe don't really understand it
23:17 < Savander> sometimes..
23:17 < Savander> in his DDNet trailer topic (f.e)
