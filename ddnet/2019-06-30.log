12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you know why we aren't using the c++ operator sugar for json-parser in ddnet?
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the json_.*_get functions lead to pretty darn ugly code
14:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I most definitely went overboard breaking compatibility, will have to rewrite this later :/
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I used `operator[]` in my json parsing routines pretty heavily
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (and `operator char*`, `operator int` etc. after checking the type)
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> where did you use json?
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in my proof of concept http master servers
14:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜„
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll prolly have to re-do all of this anyways, I just dropped way too much compatibility
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> like the servers can't even register on old masters
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why did you even touch this file?
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> which file?
14:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> src/engine/server/register.cpp (except maybe renaming it to register_legacy.cpp and doing some search&replace
14:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> )
14:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I was pretty out of it when I was coding this
14:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 40 hours without sleep and you can't really think much
14:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 
14:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/594868511025791006/Screenshot_2019-06-30_at_14.34.42.png
14:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the registering is the hard partâ„¢ ðŸ˜›
14:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> top left buttons ðŸ˜®
14:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well as you can see, it registers just fine, just sends the wrong info as I couldn't bother building the json
14:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
14:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just had a static JSON there because register didn't work
14:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> couldn't tell that it works from the screenshot ^^
14:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but I completely cannibalised register.cpp
14:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll give this a git commit, then I'll start fresh, with two new interfaces
14:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `cp register.cpp register_.cpp;git checkout -- register.cpp;mv register.cpp register_legacy.cpp;mv register_.cpp register.cpp`
14:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I messed with server.cpp aswell
14:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't mind starting over anyways, it's not too clean
14:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 can you help me link json-builder?
15:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just manually wrote the json ðŸ˜›
15:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with `str_format`
15:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but basically, just do the same as for `json-parser` I guess
15:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm shocked
15:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you? not using a library?
15:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *shrug*
15:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what goes wrong if you do it the same way as `json-parser`_
15:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what goes wrong if you do it the same way as `json-parser`?
15:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I tried linking it the same way, it doesn't work, and you don't mind me hacking it together with str_format
15:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as long as you properly escape it (I think we have a JsonEscape function)
15:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I get a lot of ```duplicate symbol _json_string_get in:
15:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2>     CMakeFiles/json.dir/src/engine/external/json-parser/json.c.o
15:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2>     CMakeFiles/json-builder.dir/src/engine/external/json-parser/json.c.o```
15:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you found out why that happens?
15:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. do you see the duplicate symbols?
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or are you maybe accidentally linking json-parser twice?
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (if that's even possible, dunno=
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only see one json_string_get
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> json-builder depends on json-parser, so maybe it somehow induces another compilation of it
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> cmake is pretty much blackmagic for me
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> link to the github repo of json-builder please
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/udp/json-builder
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> meh, this powerbank cant sustain a laptop, I guess I'm done for the day
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> bye
15:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why don't you have an outlet near you?
15:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> circuit breaker popped, and electricians don't seem to work at a reasonable price on sundays
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a couple more minutes ðŸ˜›
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can't you go to uni or so?
15:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or idk, does starbucks have power outlets? ðŸ˜›
15:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> they do, but italy doesn't have starbucks
15:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> except for 2 in milan, but milan is pretty far for a starbucks ðŸ˜„
15:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps a library?
15:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, probably not on sundays
15:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll charge it at the neighbours place
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> my client crashed while i was editing a map (just held shift and wanted to paint a big area (20x40 or so)
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> obviously with my mouser
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> obviously with my mouse
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> :/
16:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> u have latest version?
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have a coredump?
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> should be fixed
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 12.5
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no heinrich
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> weird
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> when i released the shift key and mouse the game crashed immediately
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut os?
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> windows
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, the breaker decided to work again
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what changed
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so many warnings with gcc9
21:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean it should improve the code
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm, I don't really like this `-Wdeprecated-copy` who decided it'd be a good idea to deprecate implicit copy constructors? ðŸ˜›
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 it's only deprecating implicit copy constructors for specific situations
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. when there is a destructor
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> why though?
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it indicates a programming error
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and it makes sense for that, if the destructor does anything at all, the implicit copy constructor can cause that work to get doubled, likely leading to double frees
21:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you happen to know why `IEngineMasterServer` was needed?
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (or any of the `IEngine*` variants of the interfaces at all)
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> presumably because game is only allowed to access the non-`IEngine*` variants I guess
21:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> was violated by ddrace code on one occasion apparently, the background map in the menus
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 another small Q: Is it better to request the interface from the kernel, or pass it in while initializing?
22:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Seems we use both
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for highly convoluted stuff use the kernel
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you just need one interface, pass it
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (dunno)
