08:51 <@deen> TsFreddie: cool pr, i hope someone will review/test it
09:01 <+TsFreddie> deen: me too. I actually heard somebody complains about not be able to type Japanese and Korean with ddnet client several days ago. so I did this.
09:03 <@deen> do you know why farsi (persian) input is not supposed to work with that btw?
09:03 <@deen> are there other special input methods? I always assumed IME covers everything
09:04 <+TsFreddie> i know nothing about farsi tbh.
09:05 <+TsFreddie> did they can't type it at all? or just displays in a wrong way?
09:05 <@deen> no idea!
09:05 <@deen> I'm just wondering
09:06 <+TsFreddie> I just looked it up. farsi is written right to left, so i guess it has the same problem as arabic does.
09:06 <+TsFreddie> I think we just need to find a way to display text backwards and everything will be fine.
09:27 <@deen> "just"
09:28 <@deen> there's also the problem that in farsi letters combine in weird ways
09:37 <+TsFreddie> I'm not really sure, but I think the combining letter is done by kerning, and for rtl languages kerning should be backwards too.
09:54 <@deen> well, from what I understand we don't have support for that
09:54 <@deen> anyway, one problem at a time
12:39 <@heinrich5991> !seen uchar
12:39 <@Nimda> I've last seen uchar 231 days, 19 hours, 42 minutes and 10 seconds ago in #ddnet saying "hi!".
