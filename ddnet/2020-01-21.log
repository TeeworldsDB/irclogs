09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen Something isn't working. I think you should stop the python daemon, add the `version: "0.6"` entry for every server in `daemon_storage.json` and restart the python daemon. To insert this into the json you could also briefly modify the python daemon by adding `info["version"] = "0.6"` below this line https://github.com/timakro/ddnet-trashmap/blob/4d19252c37b0714083ff7dff27e1ff4d9c205159/trashmap.py#L226
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> 
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> After you did this the version column shouldn't be empty here http://zaf.ddnet.tw/server_list.php

10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, works
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen Sorry, I can't tell how that would happen. Maybe some problem with loading the config file? When did this occur? ZAF seems to be functional right now
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen Oh, you said it works. Great! I just tested it with a 0.7 client and it's working. Thanks!
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> ZAF gets these weird whole server timeout every hour or so since yesterday :c
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TearlessAbyss46 the hoster seems to have throttled us yesterday. is this still ongoing? if so, I'll contact them
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> @deen it only happened once today when I was online but im currently not at home to know if it still happens
13:53 <@deen> ok, contacted them
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> @deen it might have to do with an underwater cable that broke here in sa,we are starting to have poor connections to international servers and bad download speeds aswell
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Evgesha> omg, you did it after all, cool

17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (which is autogenerated)
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> by `scripts/gen_keys.py` which is py2 only
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yikes we have py2 scripts
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yikes
18:07 < r_tea> how do i install ddnet for linux?
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what packet manager do you have?
18:11 <+r_tea> no idea, i just installed the lastest ubuntu ver
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> then ``sudo apt install ddnet`` should do the job
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats for client and server is ``sudo apt install ddnet-server``
18:15 <+r_tea> kk thanks
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> again error in editor same :/
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmm do you map a lot or does it crash a lot @texnonik ? what os are you on and could you maybe send in the map
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> no i was deleting are 60x55 and its glitched for moment and game switched off
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> no i was deleting area 60x55 and its glitched for moment and game switched off
