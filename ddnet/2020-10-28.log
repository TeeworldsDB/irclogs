02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> cool
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Why is the camera in fng (and maybe other gamemodes?) occasionally different, when spectating people. (the tee doesn't stay in the center of the screen)
02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Why is the camera in fng (and maybe other gamemodes?) occasionally different when spectating people. (the tee doesn't stay in the center of the screen)
02:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sounds like maybe dynamic camera?
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no it has a tiny followfactor
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i have it too
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its not noticable much unless they're going fast
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u can notice it more easily if u zooz in while spec'ing a tee tho
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> dunno what to do with HSV > HSL now
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It also seemed to be only affecting people on one team
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I made it work somehow, but the thing now is that marker for color picker moves for few pixels when you stop dragging it. And if it's on 000000 it moves to the very left corner
02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> r u both on nightly?
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> why HSL btw, not HSV / RGB?
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> yea, nightly, but I recall it happening probably half a year ago, just never looked into it. I asked multiple people that were on the server at the time, and they saw the same people with the issue. Everyone on X team would have the noncentered / smoothing-esque camera
05:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> When #3193 ?
05:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3193
05:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Why does kicking someone from your team kill the entire team
05:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> to punish you for being a bad teammate
05:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> The teammate went afk in the middle of skynet comp, so we opted to kick him, rather than attempt to carry him.. Kicking says it'll move them spec, which shouldn't kill the team... ? Normally joining spec while in a team doesn't even kill the team
05:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> So why did we just get killed an hour into skynet comp
05:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Didn't it used to force them to spec, rather than team 0?
05:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> kicking has always just moved to team 0
05:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> ive never tried to do it during a run though
05:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Maybe we shouldn't allow teams to kick someone, to avoid this type of thing, or rather, make the vote unlock the team before it passes, to avoid this type of thing
05:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> just dont kick ppl mid run why would you ever do that
05:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Because of afks, you expect the kick vote to not kill you, it's not entirely obvious....
05:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> save/load
05:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> You brought a lot of value to this conversation, thank you.
05:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yes dont kick people who are in 1 hour run
05:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Maybe people want to continue playing the map without the person, because they don't want to wait.
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what if u vote them to spectators instead
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> does it also kill them
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Voting kick instead of spec shouldn't kill the team, they should just both do the same thing, or unlock the team automatically
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It does not.
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> weird
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I didn't even know it worked that way when I voted, no one did, that's why it passed
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> if you dont want to wait that long then save and load
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Then we suddenly died, we assumed the person troll killed us before he got kicked
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> only takes 1 minute
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Stop trolling.
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how does save/load fix it xd
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> ?
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> you can load in another person
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> You keep saying the same thing, and I explained why
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what if they just want -1 person
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> then have the loaded person unlock and kill
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> But we didn't want to load in another person, we wanted to continue playing
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> you can continue playing with the loaded person
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> shouldnt have to do that ig
05:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> and why would you want to completely remove him after he went afk once in a 1 hour run
05:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Because he said he was going afk to "code"  when he could be playing, and I asked him to leave or play
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> And that doesn't matter at all, stop derailing the discussion.
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> it does wtf
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Patiga would be cool if you could figure out why it didn't load
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TTV BenJoo> hey guys
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TTV BenJoo> i have an awful question
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TTV BenJoo> will there be Teeworlds for Android and IOS?
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we dont develop teeworlds here
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ios pls
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> go to teeworlds discord
14:09 < ChillerDragon> if one is interested in a demo that is crashing current ddnet client here u go https://zillyhuhn.com/tmp/crash.demo :)
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :poggers:
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> > will there be Teeworlds for Android and IOS?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> @TTV BenJoo already exists for android in ddnet downloads as version 9.3.1
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> not sure about iOS
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Nice @jao :poggers:
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Ryozuki delete
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: How long do I have to watch for it to crash?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, hangs after a few min, but no crash
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TTV BenJoo> > @TTV BenJoo already exists for android in ddnet downloads as version 9.3.1
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TTV BenJoo> @Headshot
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TTV BenJoo> Thank you! Is it on Github?
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TTV BenJoo> Found it. thank you!
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> ghost ping :justatest:
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TTV BenJoo> Sorry - _-
16:13 < ChillerDragon> @deen you actually dont have to watch it just click at the end in the progress bar
16:13 < ChillerDragon> for me it hangs until i force quit it
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, opened a bug for it: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3208
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> @deen if u have to take a look at it today : https://pastebin.com/jTiNngXJ
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> This is about the skin fetcher
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> I think storafe.cfg thing might be the problem ?
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Neben i don't seen any attempt to download a skin in there. who was on the server with a skin from skin db?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> @deen ah ok I thought you wanted to look the startup
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> Nvm I'll check this then
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> @deen if u have the time to take a look at it today : https://pastebin.com/jTiNngXJ
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> This is about the skin fetcher
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> so, enabling damageind angles in 0.7 might cause more problem for backcompat.
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/771056680959868938/unknown.png
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk: the angle sent by 0.7 vanilla server is changed. it is technically vanilla's fault. but just be prepared to fix this. (not right now tho.)
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> :thonk: the angle sent by 0.7 vanilla server is changed. it is technically vanilla's fault. but just be prepared to fix this in sixup. (not right now tho.)
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> (and yes, 0 is left now for some reason :blobfacepalm: )
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> How can I get random tee skins to render it?
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> these skins should be included in client already
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> these skins should be guaranteed to be included in client already

19:31  * bridge [ddnet] <Marcell_HUN> 
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> due to inaccuracy in color casting from HSL to HSV palettes there is a "feature" now, that when you open color picker and pick EXACTLY #000000 full black, then close color picker and open it again, no matter where you end your marker it will always be at bottom left corner.
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Is that considered as bug / feature?

19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @deen I like to ping deen for stupid questions
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è that's ok
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @deen Is it possible to finish a map multiple times without ever having to kill?
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Like: You race a map normally (startline to finishline), then there is a tele which puts you behind the startline. You cross the startline again, race again all the way to the finish. Does the second race count as another race?
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @deen Is it possible to finish a map multiple times without ever having to kill?
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Like: You race a map normally (startline to finishline), then there is a tele (after reaching the finishline) which puts you behind the startline. You cross the startline again, race again all the way to the finish. Does the second race count as another race?

20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ugh sorry for editing in dev channel, I don't know how to explain it
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<B¬µmM>> in t0
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> yeah
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes,p ossible
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<B¬µmM>> but not on solo or race
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I always thought you'd have to actually kill before you can race another round
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> good to know
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcell_HUN> Would make Tangerine t0 cheat runs a lot harder

21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Is there a way to remake map logic and add new features to it?
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Ok, forget about it
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Help me!
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @deen @Jupstar ‚ú™ 
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I need to render a tee icon for chat preview, how can I get any default Render Skin Info?
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> build it on ur own
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> ?
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> GameClient()->m_pSkins->GetSkin("default") and so on
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> tell me some default skins @Jupstar ‚ú™
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> so it is guaranteed to be on the client
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> all vanilla skins probably, but only guaranteed until someone removes them
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but default should always be there
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> don't care if he'll remove it
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats the only skin that i'd call 100% safe
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> shouldn't been touch data folder
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> shouldn't been touching data folder
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, but doesnt matter, just use default or the current skin name from the client
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no need to create more dependencies
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/771119391110332517/unknown.png
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> also I lost default laser outline color, can you tell me what's it?
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just look in the config file
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Can you do it for me pleeeease?
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I have so many things to fix/improve now(
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> inner color: 11206591
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> outer color: 11176233
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can also modify the storage.cfg for you development client, so you can easily delete configs, whenever u want
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/447043157469954069/771132698005602304/unknown.png?width=1016&height=571
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> WIP
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the boxes and reset button look off
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> What do you mean
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> And what suggest
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye one sec
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> uh
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> like
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> rectangle doesnt look cenetered in box
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> less border would be good
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe rounded box
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> reset button is squaare
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> preview box shouldnt be solid grey
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> should be like transparent white or smth, idk
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> will it change for old style chat too?
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @louis
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/771137738225221692/2020-10-29_01-24-34.mp4
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> It's kinda hard to make, you know üôÇ And I imagine how it will not be merged for month after all the work done
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ya it looks good tho
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> There are a lot of things to check in code to evade all possible bugs and so on
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> color casting, future chat updates
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> this thing depends on chat variables and replicates real chat logic
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> why not just for the current client settings
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> instead of showing all possiblities
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> not the shit there was before like `DrawText("playername joined the game");`
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah clicking
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> that's why you cry about "We can't add more client config options, because it's hard to maintain"
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i didnt see anyone cry
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @heinrich5991 < does
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> he just wants to make the source maintainable
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it was just "unlucky" we had this discussion exactly when u made ur first pr
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> #3106
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3106
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, we have alot of configs, hes not wrong about it
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i honestly dont know a good solution for it either
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> that's good to let players customize everything they want
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Good solution: write proper code
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and stop hardcoding variables
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> ez
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> more configs = good
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i understand that, i also like customization, but just as the dummy_hammerflky thing one config creates alot of dependencies
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just hide them in "advanced settings" buttons
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its not about displaying them
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its about the code
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh lol
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I can't understand what's wrong with code
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if i want to add 1 line of code in chat, i have to check ALL config possibilities
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> you don't
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> if you write good code
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, thats why i rewrote the chat code üòâ
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> good
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> still
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> there always will be bugs
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> aslong we stay human
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so you always need to test things
