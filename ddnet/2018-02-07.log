13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is that one finally fixed??
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its the reason  i still use 10.6.2
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> test it please
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-nightly-osx.dmg
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it works
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :D
14:35 <@deen> great
14:35 <@deen> how come you didn't report the bug before?
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/410790925678149632/Screen_Shot_2018-02-07_at_7.35.52_AM.png
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i did
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I mean a bug report
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk how
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't read/remember everything people write in chat
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> next time better make a bug report ðŸ˜‰
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk how
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> github issue?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @noby there are 2 links in #info
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so i have to make an acct and make a thread
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> that sounds like work
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ?
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u have an github acc bro
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk what github issue is
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i meant the link in info
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i generaly just use github to sync code between computer and server
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> issues are even easier than creating and forum report on ddnet.tw
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/ziB6x/5301e57757.png
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> next to code
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it says issues
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> just click new issue
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and ur done
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> o
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thx
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> np c:
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @deen 
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I report this here, because I am on mobile now.
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> 
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> the newest teeworlds version doesn't work for me. he crashes when the loading is finished
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> 
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> i solved my problem, i turned opengl3 on 0 and the launch was normal. if i put it on 1 i get instantly a crash during launching
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @n000b github also works on mobile ðŸ˜›
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 about the game uuid thing: it's missing support for team ranks, and I'm still not convinced about accessing GameContext from SqlScore. what about passing it along?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> jesus christ lord almighty, okay I'll pass it along...
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but also teamranks
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Well probably yes, but I have no time now to look into that.
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @deen lol
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> now i cant change resolution at all
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> without going into config
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its alot less annoying than having to do this everytime u quit but still maybe should be fixed?
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wtf even changing it in config doesnt work
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it always goes back to 2560x1600
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that full screen?
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 would you prefer I pass it along thru `SaveScore` or if I initialize it like `m_Map` while `CSqlScore` is being constructed?
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you have around 5 minutes to decide before I toss a coin
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 like `m_Map` sounds good
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry ðŸ˜¦
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> HELP
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ?
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Laboon> isi there a chance that ddnet will host gores servers?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there is kog
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Laboon> god i hate the kog server
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and there are already maps
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> aip gores
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Laboon> its not moderatet at all
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and themix stuff
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Laboon> always funvotes
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> on ddnet too
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Laboon> bad community kicking etc etc
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Laboon> not that much
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Laboon> because there are more servers and the protection is better
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddnet has less mapvotes thats true
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but there are some gores maps on ddnet already and there is kog already so ddnet wont turn into a full supporting gores server
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Laboon> for example on http://qshar.com/
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> with tons of gores releases and a map category i think
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Laboon> when you try to download "all maps"
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Laboon> it doesnt work
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why is this releated to #developer ?
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikr qshar likes adding broken links .-.
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Laboon> I asked on their forum a few months ago
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Laboon> hundreds of views, no reply
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its a known issue
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen the times in the charts in ddnet.tw/stats is CET right?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Laboon well every community has it ups and downs. Kog community tries to do more events and try out new stuff.
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 yeah
17:33 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] bors[bot] merged staging into master: https://git.io/vAJth
18:05 <@Nimda> Flux by Pulsar just released on Brutal at 2018-02-07 18:00
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Congrats on Pulsar being the 1000Âº commit  :ddnet:
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> $ git rev-list --count HEAD
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> 1000
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> gg wp
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @RafaelFF it's not on ddnet-maps yet, or what do you mean?
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> oh, I see. I saw its release message, saw the number of commits and thought it was in ddnet-maps.   However I notice now that M Punica was the last one..
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ddnet-maps is only updated once per day
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Well, reverting the congrats. ðŸ˜›
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we have our internal repo, but tournament maps might be there a bit earlier
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so that's why we don't put them public immediately
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> I see.
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @RafaelFF you saw the debian guy making a package?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm wondering what the process is like for getting into archlinux officially, not just aur
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> deen i cant change resolution at all on the version of ddnet u sent me lol the bug of it doubling on close is fixed but it will always revert to 2560x1600 regardless of what i choose in setings or type in .cfg
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @noby ya, i know
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ok
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, i can't really fix the code without a mac device
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe someone with access to a device should fix it
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ðŸ¤” idk who that woud be
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> HMH, you or the guy on github bug
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen you get a trusted user to move the packet fro mAUR to community
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. you find a package maintainer
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Since I'm just a normal user, I don't have such power.
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sounds like @RafaelFF should become a package maintainer ðŸ˜‰
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> would be nice, but I'm not willing to become a TU as "great powers comes with greater responsibilities".
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Translation takes too much nonwork time of me, and I wouldn't be able to handle more official packages to maintain..
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> translation?
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> I'm coordinator of translation for GNOME and GNUweb, and also other smallers projects (e.g. ddnet and teeworlds)
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, cool
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> But I could ask around if a TU want to take maintainership of ddnet and move it to official repo.
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Any particular reason for moving from AUR?  It doesn't even take much time to build
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think it takes quite long to build considering it's a small game
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and we don't use templates much
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but anyway, most arch users never use the aur, so we'd reach more people
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> "Most"? I know some that avoids AUR for obvious reason, but I didn't know it was that much.
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> But it is a fair request: teeworlds is in official repos. Why not ddnet, right?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> did no one look at what the commit was actually doing? lol it looks like it just forces mac users to fullscreen which fixes the bug but then doesnt let u actually change resolution ever
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/410866736796008458/Screen_Shot_2018-02-07_at_12.36.55_PM.png
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I know
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but old mac versions always just had fullscreen anyway
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol when was this
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think ive always been able to use not fullscreen
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then maybe i misunderstood the old code
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> or it was fixed >1.5yr ago
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen server restarted?
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> weird things are happening
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ger2.ddnet.tw:8303
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> off topic, but DDNet Canada's disk usage seems to almost in the end. Heads up to it...
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> disk space *
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> And what happens then?
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki follow me plz
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (if you don't have sth else to do right now)
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> @n000b  are you asking about my comment?
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @RafaelFF yeah i die, not that I can help tho
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Well, if a computer runs out of space, more info can't be stored. This could impact, for instance, the logging feature of the services or storing new maps in the server... Don't know how critical it is, though. Maybe the disk space is not growing, but I thought it would be better to bring up the subject...
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @RafaelFF yea, CAN's disk space is tight
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but we regularly pull data from there and delete the old
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> New map fail (Flux) .
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> At start you can you can go take cp3 and then go back take weapons and go cfrm and you save weapons easy skip
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/410891908227923990/unknown.png
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Ah thanks for explaining
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> New map fail (Flux) . (skip)
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> At start you can you can go take cp3 and then go back take weapons and go cfrm and you save weapons easy skip
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/410891908227923990/unknown.png
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @snail @jao ^
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @jao
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> intended by mapper @texnonik
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> How can this be intended lol
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> It's like cheating
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> easter egg ðŸ¤·
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Hmm dunno if it has a lot of advantage tho
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> But still
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can't skip whole parts it only gains you some sec advantage on speedruns
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can only save laser btw, not shotgun
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Hmm, still if you already knew this I guess this should have been fixed. But yeah it is hard to make those decisions.
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Ah well the sg was more interesting for speedrunners
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> 
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/410892976085008394/unknown.png
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> probably you cant get shootgun
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Then it is fine. Sg would be false in my point of view.
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> in team 0 you can get grenade launcher and go back to start to get unsolo
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ehh
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> team 0 ranks don't matter unless its a 0s time
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> team 0 ranks don't matter unless it's a 0s time
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> wow hole part skip with laser
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/410894085029625867/unknown.png
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> agh one skip xD
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> laser
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> unfreeze
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> there is a switch pull down there
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that you have to deactivate
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> he falls straight and you laser him he goes right .
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> its too far down
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> if map would be much bigger it would possible to create other skips if there would be armor before
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> if map would be much bigger it would possible to create other skips if there wouldn`t be armor before
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but it isn't ðŸ¤·
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and i think your skip is too hard to pull off
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> doesn't make sense to do it
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> well i cant show you it with my dummy ...
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i made my own personal webpage :) https://www.ryobyte.com/
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Great stuff @Ryozuki
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ik chiller
