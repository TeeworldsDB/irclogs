00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> a separate commit is enough imo
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i wish i knew how to properly clang format
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> visual studio will do it for me
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> when I opened the project it saw the clang format file and asked if I wanted to use it
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/options-text-editor-c-cpp-formatting?view=vs-2022
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i didn't know that was an option. i always used VSCode for everything and only VS for compiling
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> oh
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I'm sure VSCode has a clang format extension you can get
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes it has
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> that would be very helpful
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> xaver.clang-format
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh wait i **just** found out `scripts/fix_style.py` existed
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> nevermind
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1011537003176808608/unknown.png
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> for some reason xaver likes doing this to some parts of the code
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1011537235641913416/unknown.png
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> strange, never happened to me bfore
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Guess my VSCode is just quirky like that
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> anyways I'll try to impliment a tooltips bar into the editor tommorow

13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> 9. Other miscellaneous stuff
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Anyone here interested please let me know
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> This is my telegram contact @erikvanvelzen
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> this is obviously bait but whats stopping us from just.. downloading your so called "nft" skin and using it as our skin?
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I guess you could do that but that's not really what's happening within game the profits generated there will go through the Creator and the company
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Troll
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I just wanna say
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ppl here wont buy into ur bullshit crypto scam
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Specially the devs
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ok but i still have your monkey png downloaded for fred
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ok but i still have your monkey png downloaded for free
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> This is a hard Community to break through
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> If anyone is interested to clean my name publicly I'll pay them 33 euros for doing that
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Here are the instructions:
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Well that would be first having a call with me and see me in the real world asking all the difficult questions üòú
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Basically bashing me with all the questions that generally the tea world Community would have and then I'll just answer them honestly
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I'll answer that on a YouTube video
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> And beneath the video you must respond that you have asked me those questions give me your pinion
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> when u wrote that in dm to me u didnt talk about a call just "see me in the real world"
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lmao
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think u just misspelled in dm
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> <a:zoozpepe:708147692370657301>
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :think_bot:
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ReiTW easy 33‚Ç¨ for u
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Erik van Velzen what did Dune say to your idea
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Dune told me that we could have a call .and He got too busy
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> But what we were talking about was basically my idea that I'm sharing here with all
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I'm not so good in writing and that's the reason for that call
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> He also mentioned he didn't like the idea that blockchain will be part of Tee worlds
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> But he was a where he didn't understand the full concept
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> there's something i don't understand: why you don't implement your idea yourself?
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> To build out what I'm seeking to do is going to do more for all tea worlds players and developers a like
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> But one thing is sure the t world Community is not my aim as users
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> There's a different platform with a different community that will be engaging in the game
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the more you explain the more i do not understand
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> That's very simple I'm not the dev
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ok, so why would people work for you for free?
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I never said the work would be free
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> It would be paid per hour
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> But that really depends on your skill
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> then why you don't give the hourly rate? Best way to have people interested i'd say
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How do you judge peoples skill if you are not a dev
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I have a budget of $2,000
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Good question ‚ÅâÔ∏è
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's barely for a full month of work
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's barely enough for a full month of work
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I have a very good friend and he's developer I guess he'll do the interview
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> The first interview would be directly with me
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> First TW-related job offer here üòÑ
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I doubt you‚Äôll find anyone here that‚Äôd be interested in helping you monetize the game, if we were open to the idea we‚Äôd have started selling skins years ago. But still good luck in finding someone
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also the general opinion here amongst the devs seems to be that nfts are the work of the devil
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i find NFTs to be extremely useless
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they shouldnt exist
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Look here in tee worlds people don't really get paid for developing it they have lots of knowledge on making a modifying and changing the game but outside tee worlds they're not getting paid for developing it and at the same time you guys have skills that would need to keep the costs low
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> One more thing to add that's the first phase second phase there should be more money
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> In a way you're right in another you're wrong but I would need to explain exactly what that means on a video
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> time to quit your RL job
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I already publicly posted about not liking blockchain jobs, my opinion hasn't changed much on that
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> For me everything involving nfts sounds like a scam lol
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Most blockchain projects, especially games work same as financial pyramids
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> So it's like cockfights within players? How can you prevent 322 (match fixing)
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> tea worlds
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> üçµ
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> we develoup teaworlds for free because its genuinely fun. nfts on the other hand are NOT fun
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> spilling the tea
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Britishworlds
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Erik van Velzen u dutch?
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :KEKW:
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :0cryKEKW:
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Yes but I grew up in Kenya
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I find it amusing how you try to show ur real self so easily to appear real, it just gives me the chills and screams me to stay far away
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well he is real
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Real in being fake
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> He made a youtube video lol
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I didnt say he itself wasnt real
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i thought u meant that
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> real as in trustful
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Maybe better word
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :f3:
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I would trust more heinrich5991 who i have never seen
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea same
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats true xd
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> I would trust more learath who works for the NSA
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u have no choice there anyway, he knows everything about u
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I'm dyslectisch
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I'm mostly using speech to words
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Explain please in detail 
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> What do you mean by match fixing?
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :bluestripe: what did you do @fokkonaut
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ü§≠
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Erik van Velzen does ur blockchain prevents against vali
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> :sue:
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> that would be grand lmao
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @TsFreddie (nice pp btw)
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> best argument so far üòÑ
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> One thing is absolutely sure you were totally right with people here really being difficult to react on the message
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I'm sure not the one who said that, but I was thinking it yes
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> he's got superpower, he can read minds !!
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> our company actually did got offered some blockchain projects in the later half of this year
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I mean obv
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> they mostly want existing game repackaged into their chains
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but even then they had at least a budget of $50,000 for buying out a project.
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> soooo. good luck i guess
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> btw we didn't take them ofc
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but boss was really tempted tho
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> One player loses on purpose so he or his friends gets money
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but what does that provide for the game?
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> This is a one-on-one match
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @uwu —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è –∫—É–ø–∞–µ–º—Å—è –≤ –±–ª–æ–∫—á–µ–π–Ω–∞—Ö? :kek:
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> blockchain games just want games on their platform. so probably the more the better. they just buy games to fill their list of supported games to make it look compling.
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> do something useful and fix amd and intel drivers with your money
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> throw some coins against the GPUs maybe it helps
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> also they like to pay half of the budgets in tokens
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :bluestripe: imagine
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i had some kind of these brave coins
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> they was like 1 coin = $1 whole time
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> So others can bet on that match? Only participants?
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> now 5 coins = $1 xd
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> So others cant bet on that match? Only participants?
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @uwu are you really that interested tho
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Im interested how can you prevent 322, its a big issue, i dont really believe in blockchain
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i see
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I'm applying to buy this game from you guys
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Neither am I from the blockchain
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I just have a great idea that I want to implement and I'm willing to pay money for developers who can help me build it
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye but your budget is barely my monthly salary
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you can make your own blockchain based teeworlds if you want to
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> The main token that will be used on this game would be usdc that's a stable coin and I have nothing related with that blockchain or with usdc
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> DDNet is not for sale. The source code is free and you can make a derivative game out of it as long as you adhere to the license
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Same for Teeworlds, even though I don't speak for them, but they use the same license
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think he meant "not"
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> else the neither makes no sense
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh well üòÑ
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> My Head full of Different idea,s
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Step One build the first game
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> What do you mean???
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Exactly my plan is basically to build out this modification on a completely different platform
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Nintendo Switch?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> üòÑ
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Sorry I'm dyslexic I'm using speech to word
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> 322 is a popular meme in Dota 2 that refers to any any form of throwing and match fixing.
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I'll work on figuring that out as so many more things need to be created
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I am off to my family getting them into bed
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Hopefully tomorrow  there could be more interest in this job that I am offering
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> If you have more questions please give me a list of questions and I will make a video and explain
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> @TsFreddie wtf where did you get chn role
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> I bet you didnt have it 5 minuyes ago
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> he transformed into a chinese
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> https://tenor.com/view/fade-away-oooooooooooo-aga-emoji-crumble-gif-20008708
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Erik van Velzen thing is : You wont find much people that has more than 3 years of experience in teeworlds coding (for some reason : a lot left the game already).
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Also good luck to find someone who's really interested for such a project on such a very small game
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> And good luck also to find people who has some knowledge about anything bc related
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> short: good luck xD
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> short: i dont sell my wife for 2k
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> + I guess to be honest if you really want to build a project linked to the bc I highly suggest you to not go over tw, doubt it may work at all at the end
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> before that happens, learath adds electron to ddnet
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Bruh
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> We should rewrite ddnet on Unreal engine 5
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> With lumen
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> U can zooz out with less lag
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> rewrite ddnet in javascript
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> make ddnet in html canvas
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> cuz I'm chinese
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Fair enough but i didnt see any country rolea before üò±
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think they are flagging mods
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @Kallemy be summoned
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well i guess they are busy
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> either way mods has flags now
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> either way mods has region rols now
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Oh thats nice
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> hello
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> yes
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> @TsFreddie yo, who have made ur discord pp ?
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> its very clean
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> he did afaik
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> He did indeed
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> @Erik van Velzen I have a couple years of experience with blockchain development and have played this game for many years and as I mentioned last time we talked about blockchain, while it would be possible to integrate blockchain aspects into this I don't think the game lends itself well to it and I especially don't think it would be good for the community, so if you do want to build a derivative of this game, I don't think it would be we
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> @Erik van Velzen I have a couple years of experience with blockchain development and have played this game for many years and as I mentioned last time we talked about blockchain, while it would be possible to integrate blockchain aspects into this I don't think the game lends itself well to it and I especially don't think it would be good for the community, so if you do want to build a derivative of this game with blockchain, I don't thin
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <f.> how blockchain might be used, players score?
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> the main reason to use blockchain would be for monetization and what what he was probably thinking is having skins be only displayed if you own the NFT of that skin or something like that as a way to monetize.  But yes you could have player's scores be updated to the blockchain periodically and theoretically the top ranked player could be given a skin for their accomplishments or something like that.  There's a lot you can do with it, but
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> especially when it's open source...
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> lmao, how greedy do you have to be to kinda "ruin" tw...
