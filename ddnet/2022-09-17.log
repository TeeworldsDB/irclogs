00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> gun doesnt show for my sitting animation
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Does it? What direction are you facing?
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh its cus spec goes into the ground
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> LOL
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> gun doesnt change anymore, it just points to where you point
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> werent weapons supposed to go on th back
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> That was decided against
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://papers.freebsd.org/2018/bsdcan/hayakawa-ebpf_implementation_for_freebsd/
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh, then the screenshot is out of date
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> damn eBPF on freebsd, imagine being able to use XDP on proprietary routers like Juniper etc..
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe lighter
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but dont mind me
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i kinda liked this

00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> looks like he has an anti missile array on his back
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love the new afk animation
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Got it
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Is this better?
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1020456601120935946/unknown.png
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> okay but this would look epic if the gun was on backwards
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> that just looks like its misaligned and he is looking up
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> github is slow again
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Anyways, if I were to add a Reset All button to this, How would I properly handle this? Would I just set all the values to the default string in the cl_ commands? Or would I need to set them from converted RGBA values?
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1020464216886485074/unknown.png
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> From the default seems better
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> Hey i have a weird bug by a project im doing by myself. i used others entities "unused" and i built triggers for it but i found out that the triggers only work if a wall is next to them. but i dont understand why..
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> I built the trigger into entities/character.cpp in the function HandleTiles()
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KDaniel> is this the right space to put it in?
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The size of the network, almost everywhere you'd want to go to is easily reachable within 1, max 2 transfers
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Hmm. I think I need a better way to calculate RGB values. Because how I'm doing it, I just input the CL value, split the given HEX code into separate R, G, and B channels and divide those by 255 and make it only a 6 long decimal.
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> But for some reason that's enough for the values to not go as plan when implementing it.
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1020473366139908137/unknown.png

01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It won't be exactly accurate, we have 1 byte 0-255 for hue which goes from 0-360
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So hue gets compressed down
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can try doing `cl_laser_rifle_inner_color $<hex color code rgb>`.
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then you can `cl_laser_rifle_inner_color` see what the conversion code in the client can get
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> idk, I might just brute-force my program to make the color RGBs actually match, since I think the code rounds it down
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> idk, I might just brute-force my program to make the color RGBs actually match, since I think the code in DDNet rounds it down

01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Elisha Emmaunel> (@Voxel)
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just take the code we have in ddnet if you want it to exactly match. We have to round one direction or the other, as I said 1 byte is not enough for even every degree of hue
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the best we can do is 1.5 degrees of hue per step
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a limitation of having to support old teeworlds colors. I'd have stored them as rgb if I were allowed to break peoples old colors
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> F*ck stuborn old people
03:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you didn't try to reach some suburbs :D, but yeah city center is well deserved
03:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well yeah, what would I be doing in a suburb anyway 😄
03:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I heard there are major extensions to the metro underway though which should help the suburbs
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, they wanted to have some of them for 2024 olympic games
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> they want to have a metro circling Paris in the suburbs
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think they're building 3 or 4 new metro lines and extending other, especially the line 14 to Orly airport south
04:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> How do we make it so EVERY Shotgun laser has an orange laser?
04:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Right now it feels very random on who has one or not.

08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Jupstar did you hear my idea for FNG team lasers
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, i also made it once client side, but sadly vanilla doesnt send the laser owner
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> RIP
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> would be awesome though
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlowerFell-Sans> looking awesome
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/tree/client_team_laser_color
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if it still compiles
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i think that was the basic idea, laser color per team
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it works as long as the shot is visible on screen, bcs then the client can use the entity closest to the laser, which is ok for most cases
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but e.g. wallshots out of view range = rip
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> RIP
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Voxel have u tried to make running animation faster?
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it kinda feels too slow if i test it
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also afk tee's feet kinda feel wrong
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1020591065956364288/unknown.png
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> imo this isnt a sitting state, but a stopping state
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in comic worlds
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlowerFell-Sans> Let Tee flatten when running
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I didn't know how else to do it
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> That's possible
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lets ask google "sitting ball with eyes and feets" xD
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlowerFell-Sans> lmao
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/39900765-8f1a-4ae4-ae1a-952f1d30aa9d/scale-to-width-down/800
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe use the hands too?
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlowerFell-Sans> Kaby
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i kinda feel like this improves it, but dunno if it works well in 2d
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I don't think I can do that with the current way tees are rendered
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also see the feets, they look almost straight up
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Even then, hands are made SPECFICIALLY for weapon and hook holding, so it'd be weird rendering them
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think its on
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think its ok
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlowerFell-Sans> 👍
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they now also for holding himself above the ground xD
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlowerFell-Sans> Idea: When Tee pick up some pickup, open it mouth
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah and lets also add dashing
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and make all tees pink
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlowerFell-Sans> Like this

09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> We should pitch this to Nintendo
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlowerFell-Sans> Suggestion: When Kir... Tee jumps, let Tee expand and immediately change back to the original state
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, and also let him fly

19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't use some easy functions anymore, it'll break master build until we merge the multi pr
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good call
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 can we please get this through this time? If I have to rebase this thing for a 4th time I'll cry
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess I'm gonna start reviewing
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > Should errors in the http module just be fatal?
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you mean during setup?
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Always. If it won't be fatal later, there is no point making them fatal during the setup. I'd have to have error handling either way
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok, I guess I should read the PR
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to see what you mean by fatal
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (I don't mean request fails, I mean curl calls failing with errors, like `CURLM_UNRECOVERABLE_POLL`)
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fatal is fine IMO
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then we at least find it
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well take a look at the error handling I have in place. Currently it'll error out and the http module will become inoperable
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it's going to be fatal things can be simplified a bit
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can also try to be more elaborate, try to recover from errors that could be recoverable

20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <John Fred> (@Learath2)
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 ah, you can't signal atomics in pure C++?
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You mean wait on them? In C++20 you can
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, wait, signal
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> clang and gcc used futexes and WaitOnAddress to implement it, it's pretty nice
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is there any other way to implement it?
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think you can even wait/signal all java objects?
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yup: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#notify()
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably implemented the same way
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can spin with exponential backoff, that's what gcc and clang fallback to if futexes or waitonaddress aren't available
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like the mutex/cv better, even if it's a bigger hammer
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can also give futexes and waitonaddress based implementation a go myself, but they are easy to misuse and it'll lock us down to > windows 7 and whatever linux kernel version introduced futexes
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> linux has futexes since always, I think

22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> matricks invented linux

23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why did you split engine.cpp?
