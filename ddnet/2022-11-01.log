02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ichliebesyrix.> @Voxel what up with ger3 and 10 ðŸ—¿
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> How should I know? Probably a DDOS
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Oh wait, they're down.
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Oh nice I think I have seen it and forgot about it immediately back in the days because Iâ€™m C# hater haha. But wow that project is like half a decade old! Itâ€™s hard to judge from the missing documentation and examples how useful that is but I will mention that for sure in my list of teeworlds protocol implementations \:)
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Matodor)
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> In fact, it is quite useless, main branch is not working, in the branch refactoring ready completely clean network part, there is somewhere very old branch, there is a terrible code but you can play, based on it I do city mode plus developments from the refactoring branch.
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> 
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> In any case, it's just a hobby through which I've learned to read other people's code and understand it well :justatest:
09:32 <+ChillerDragon> how does it work? Is it 100% C# running the city server?
09:33 <+ChillerDragon> Or do you somehow hook in to mod c++ servers with C#?
09:33 <+ChillerDragon> if it can run and even be used for city development. Please add some kind of setup/sample/docs im sure someone C# would really appreciate that!
09:34 <+ChillerDragon> OMG @heinrich5991 I can not say enough how much I appreciate your dissector!!!!!!!!!! The bit annotation with the ..01010 thingies is so fkin amazing. It really helps a lot to identify where these values spread to. https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1667291498.png
09:35 <+ChillerDragon> Such a trol protocol having 2 bits sequence number in the middle of the size number!?
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> `how does it work? Is it 100% C# running the city server?`
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> yes
09:36 <+ChillerDragon> awesome!
09:36 <+ChillerDragon> and people can join and play?
09:37 <+ChillerDragon> You need to document that thats amazing!
09:38 <+ChillerDragon> atleast some simple instructions on howto get a server running would be dope i guess
09:38 <+ChillerDragon> so gonna ping you too in the future when i got protocol questions :p
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> @Matodor also do not be ashamed of your old code. If it works it rocks! Be proud and promote it. If you wanna feel better about your code i can share you some of mine :D 
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> in the city mod yes, but in TeeSharp no, there is still a lot to do (in refactoring branch), I also want to study the ECS system and implement it for mods
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> 
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> But all the time I have now goes to work and to the city mod, so TeeSharp is not updated
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> i thought city mod is TeeSharp?
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> Yes, I have this problem, to rewrite everything from scratch, made a long time ago the game on the unity, three times rewrote and did not release anywhere ðŸ˜­
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> :c
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> no, mLife
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> I think you'll have a look at it by winter)
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> okeoke
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> I mentioned you on my network docs anyways
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> so at least my mom reading it will checkout your stuff!
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe the good and really modern bevy ECS can inspire you https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/ecs/
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but u will never reach rust speeds with C# :BASED:
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> Thanks, I'll read it.
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/programming/ecs-intro.html
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more here too
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Conceptually, you can think of it by analogy with tables, like in a database or spreadsheet. Your different data types (Components) are like the "columns" of a table, and there can be arbitrarily many "rows" (Entities) containing values / instances of various components.
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > For example, you could create a Health component for your game. You could then have many entities representing different things in your game, such as the player, NPCs, or monsters, all of which can have a Health value (as well as other relevant components).
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > This makes it easy to write game logic (Systems) that can operate on any entity with the necessary components (such as a health/damage system for anything that has Health), regardless of whether that's the player, an NPC, or a monster (or anything else). This makes your game logic very flexible and reusable.
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The set / combination of components that a given entity has, is called the entity's Archetype.
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Note that entities aren't limited to just "objects in the game world". The ECS is a general-purpose data structure. You can create entities and components to store any data.
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the tldr
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:38 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki when tw client in bevy?
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
10:40 <+ChillerDragon> holy shit i have been starring so long at the hexdump of tw protocol i can almost read it :D 
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen are the map preview images stored in a repo?
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: that's amazing ðŸ™‚ and yeah I also thought that someone didn't look at the actual bytes when "designing" this protocol ^^
13:46 <+ChillerDragon> not that the C++ code flippin, shuffeling, shifting and dipping those bytes using ``pBuffer[0]&0xFF<<1`` looks any better :D
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: I got the idea from wireshark's TCP dissector (screenshot attached)
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1036987092829483059/unknown.png
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> poggers
13:59 <+ChillerDragon> it does make so much sense for tw protocol
13:59 <+ChillerDragon> btw i finally figured dark mode out on arch too and actually did ditch termshark again after hyping it so much :D
14:00 <+ChillerDragon> the highlight in the hexdump is just not as accurate enough as the qt version
14:02 <+ChillerDragon> i mean it probably is feature complete but my brain can not grasp that the msg 19 is the byte 27 and it is highlighted https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1667307607.png
14:02 <+ChillerDragon> this is easier for me :( https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1667307664.png

14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Failure is
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > [  FAILED  ] Jobs.LookupHostWebsocket
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So the test server is not connected to a DNS server:
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> [ RUN      ] Jobs.LookupHostWebsocket
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 2023-11-13 18:29:23 I host_lookup: host='example.com' port=0 1
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ./src/test/jobs.cpp:109: Failure
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Expected equality of these values:
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>   pJob->m_Result
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>     Which is: -1
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>   0
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> [  FAILED  ] Jobs.LookupHostWebsocket (1 ms)
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe bad style that our tests require a DNS server
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why does the websocket test fail but not the real one?
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are you sure it's the missing internet connection?
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but yea, they do fail without internet ocnnection for me as well. hm
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Weird, maybe just sporadic internet problem?
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> hey i got a question, how can i set the background entities color to a hex or rgb value
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> nevermind i figured it out, I had to right click on the hex value in the settings =]
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `cl_background_color $808080` also should work
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> ah thanks
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> with the hex code after $ instead of the usual #
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> btw it's not setting it to a correct value though
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe it's rounding to the closest value we can store
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> oof
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> #23272A is being replaced with #222629
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, so each  color's value is off by one
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Is that expected @Learath2 ? ^
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> and in rgb by 2
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It's probably close enough that no one would notice anyway
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The calculation is here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1678/files#diff-7dc34778e6c28029830864d702a7fadf2a410dcd32033ce83c8ed6a47f145f16R40
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> okay no problem, thanks for the help
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> but i think this also ties with #5844
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5844
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh yeah, looks like @Robyt3 got it right
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We just canâ€™t represent every 3 byte rgb value with 3 bytes of hsl. It is technically possible that I have an off by 1 somewhere, but itâ€™s more likely that we canâ€™t represent this exact hue
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Alright, sounds fine
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> It could also be that it's rounding the values to a whole value without decimals
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> For example i can see that `rgb(35, 39, 42)` gets converted to `hsl(205.7, 9.1%, 15.1%)` which is also being converted in teeworlds so it fits as a value from 0 to 255
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> So if it's getting rounded to the nearest whole value then that's where the exact color is probably being lost
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki pipewire is pretty cool, I like
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 how hard it is to switch
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on gentoo
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tried it on artix, it was painless. Gentoo should be similar given both use openrc
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh u dont use gentoo?
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then im superior right now
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill take my based pill
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Testing out artix on an old laptop that canâ€™t build itâ€™s own packages in any reasonable time ðŸ˜„
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ¥¹
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did use this laptop with gentoo for a very long time though. Distcc is great
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki did you use an AUR helper while you were on arch?
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I usually go for aurutils, but just wanted to check if you used something else
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i used yay
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but if i wasnt used to yay
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would use the fork
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> made in rust
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> paru?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its by one of yay authors
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let me give it a go. I never used pacman wrappers because back when I first installed arch people were all saying they were dangerous things that will break your computer instantly ðŸ˜„
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stupid people
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> sometimes i really feel like a stranger visiting a foreign country here
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yay and paru ask if you wanna read the diff for the PKGBUILD
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its ur choice to check it
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't understand anything of what's going on with you two ðŸ˜„
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yay is like deformed yes, not a program to me
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the issue came from yay -Sy failing. If it failed for whatever reason it could leave your system in a broken half upgraded state
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm idk
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i jsut run "yay"
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to update
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yay is also the name of a program, an AUR helper
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Chairn https://github.com/Jguer/yay
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yogurt?
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Chairn cuz an old aur phelper
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh and back when I first used arch there was yaourt ðŸ˜„
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> called yaogurt
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thatâ€™s the reference
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yaourt xd
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I was once asked where I got the ddnet I use and I said yay. Then the other person said "I am not accusing you for hacking" xD
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> dammit, there should be laws to name programs ðŸ˜„
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> funny names > serious
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> let corpo be the boring ones
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> are there any program name using a copyrighted name like coca cola ?
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the rule is: choose a 2-3 letter name that is not used by another popular cli tool yet
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> let's rename ddnet to ddn
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Am I allowed to do something like this? Or, how do I manage 2 packets at once?

23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> There should be a different NETMSGTYPE_SV_KILLMSG_TEAMS for the KillMsgTeams
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It doesn't make sense to me to create two different type objects from the same raw message
