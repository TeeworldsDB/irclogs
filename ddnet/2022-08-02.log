00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> especially when other people uses it
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> idk i would imagine this having a toggle bind
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think i have it disabled, not sure
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> The design of it is ugly, if a person felt forced to use it, I don't think it'd be a good experience
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 maybe ur interested https://www.jackos.io/rust-kernel/rust-for-linux.html
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I liked Voxels design
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Prototype, could even be animated, just wanted to know if this has potential
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> This
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> could just use an entities background as well
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> yeah i liked his desing aswell, except it doesnt actually represent the true hammer hitbox
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Feels like something from a cheat client, no matter which way you make it, don't really think it belongs
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, I think it only feels like that because it's not part of the ddnet client already
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Yeah but it renders behind everything idk
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sometimes new cool features feel like that
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. remember autohammer after freeze? ^^
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Ya, but idk. Visual guides are usually what you see in cheat clients lol
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Autoedge is what i would think of in a cheat client
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen are you around and have some minutes to try to diagnose the rust PR?
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> if it also were to show the direction of aiming, this is what that shape would look like, sharpest point furhest away, then it becomes larger closer to a tee
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1003786653896278087/hammerrange.png
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> such a triangle could be made pretty interesting graphically imo
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I think if you wanted to invest time into making the game easier for new players, you should probably make some new novice maps.
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Far more valuable
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> sadly my maps are deemed unoriginal, not much i can do about that
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> and more novice maps doesnt make the game more accesible...
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Novice maps should have different rules @ tester
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It makes it more playable
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> We only have like 4? super basic novice maps
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> We should have 100
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sure
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, for the linux x86-64 build, can you add a `VERBOSE=1` to the make command line?
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like `make VERBOSE=1`
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so we can see what command it tries to execute
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, the nightly is still building for half an hour 😄
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> alright, nightly is indeed nightly ^^
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you still have the CMakeCache.txt for the failed build?
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> if i were to fully develop this feature into something looking nice and working well, could we do a community vote on whether to add it?
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We should at least decide if we'd consider it a cheat before you implement it
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for me it seems fine, maybe others disagree
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> vote on that then?
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's a very minor cheat
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it looks similar to hook line to me
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> And hook line is a cheat, if you're not using ddnet client, you're disadvantaged
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> idk its open source anyone can run it
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're not using the commonly accepted definition of cheat
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you use that, then freeze prediction is cheat
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Anything that ddnet uses is fine, we're talking about if it's a cheat, it is
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's not a good argument, if someone made an open source cheat client we still wouldn't accept it
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, so what do you consider a cheat?
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Anything that gives even a slight advantage
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> over what?
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> true but his argument sounded like its p2w or something
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> entities 😄
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Vanilla client I guess? But basically no one uses that, you're backing me into a wall for no reason, the question is, is it a cheat?
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yes.
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> If you don't use it, you're not getting information that someone else has
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I feel like this definition of cheat isn't useful
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> my argument is that playing ddnet should feel teeish and without too many unnecessary lines or distractions, i dont think this is a cheat but i think its unnecessary
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, I'm also wondering if it actually helps you while playing
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> new players should see the game for itself, not a bunch of lines over the place
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's basically saying "every gameplay feature that the vanilla client doesn't have is what I call cheat"
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I never wondered if I can hit someone at this distance
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. you're saying "bubliman's feature isn't present in the vanilla client"
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is true, but doesn't give a lot of information
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It doesn't really help people that are experienced, and I think anything around the tee would probably do more harm than good for newer players anyways
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> If it was somehow added to the crosshair, maybe it'd be usable
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> a player using various methods to create an advantage beyond normal gameplay, depends what u think is normal gameplay i guess
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> yes thats why it should be optional just like hookline
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> even hookline is kind of overused I think
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I think saying it's a lot like hook collision is basically agreeing that it's a cheat, I think everyone would agree with that
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I wanted it just for those annoying spots where you have to hook through corner to get someone out
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because continuously shooting is annoying
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Even if it's an almost useless advantage
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I think it's like hook collision; it's not present in the vanilla client either, and it helps your gameplay
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe we can get away from the word 'cheat' if we disagree on its definition
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can simply substitute your definition instead
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> "unfair advantage" ?
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> well if you want a hardcore category to exist, that could happen i guess raw teeworlds without any help
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "unfair" is not really a neutral word; then we'd have to figure out what is unfair
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> > a player using various methods to create an advantage beyond normal gameplay
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> "disagreed advantage" ?
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i like bubliman's definition
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> now we have to agreed on "normal gameplay" 😄
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, apparently that's the teeworlds client for Skeith
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> yes we are a community i guess so we agree on whats fair
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's a fair base
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so yes, hook collision is like the hammer hit box, it's an advantage over vanilla gameplay
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> normal gameplay at this time is propably the newest release of DDnet
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> normal gameplay at this time is probably the newest release of DDnet
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> normal gameplay is what the comminity decides it to be?
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> idk how u guys decide stuff here, if its only the devs or not, im new to #developer
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It doesn't automate anything, it just gives you a visual cue, the word advantage is what should be asked. I think deen more or less meant that when asking if it was a cheat
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, it's an advantage over not having it
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, I guess
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I think most people would agree that yes, it does give some minor advantage.
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> to be honest, hammer range is not the biggest advantage you could get
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> @deen did u mean that?
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> probably helps for aled though
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, I don't think deen meant that
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think deen meant whether we consider this as something that should be allowed or not
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> however, shotgun/laser line with reflection and grenade curve is, in my opinion, too much of an advantage
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> the question is: if we allow hammer range, where do we stop?
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Grey area, honestly
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Should it be added to ddnet? I really don't think so
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Imo freeze bar is a bigger advantage for aled because the difference in opacity let's you know when a tee is in freeze
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what?
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @bubliman I guess you could try opening an issue at this point
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then the discussion would be a bit more structured
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Maybe it could be added while in ctrl shift d as an information type deal, but I don't think it should be an option to help with gameplay
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Freeze bar changes opacity when tee is in/out of freeze. Imo it makes aled much easier
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> so as a debugging tool? if its that big of an advatage, ppl could play just with the debugger, ultimately helping with gameplay
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> @heinrich5991 will do! I just need to figure out how, shouldn't be too hard 🙂
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues go here
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @bubliman <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/new>
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> click new issue
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you'll need a github account though
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this link displays a login form for non-logged in users, I usually link /issues instead
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> yeah im logged in so its fine
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i dunno, im always logged in ^^
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1003795162855657572/unknown.png
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (that's all you see on /new)
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Should I write my opinion in the first comment?
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Idk, it seems annoying to feel obligated to use it, I guess it's a personal thing for me. But I think most people wouldn't use it for an advantage if it was only displayed in debugger
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> so the advantage is less harmful
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> it's just information
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do it like you want to
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Kinda silly argument I know
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can see how you don't want to be 'forced' to use it because it's allowed and because you find it ugly
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> debugger is already useful to display your actual position anyways btw
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> So it'd be a similar bit of information alongside it
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I'd argue it makes the most sense to be there
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you can now have this information in the HUD without debug mode
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I meant your shadow tee
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> In real time
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I fear even that is possible to show without debug HUD 😅
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I'd have to look it up
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1003796231660773436/unknown.png
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea that one
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Ya, I don't know the command, if there is one
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> Personally I think the worst thing allowed is the aimhack bind which allows people to autoaim to cardinal directions
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> thats based, though removing it is propably not possible, unless you kept all ranks achieved with it as still valid
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> thats based, though removing it is probably not possible, unless you kept all ranks achieved with it as still valid
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> its literally cheating idc if people got ranks by cheating
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> but more so for me people have started to use it in ictf
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> which is sooooooo dumb
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i also think this is cheating, but it's not an intended cheat, more like a feature abuse
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how does that even help in ictf
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> You can get that without debug
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I forgot the command but there is one
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> ah? neat
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Let's move our discussion here, I'm going to sleep, Good Night!
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good night 🙂
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Let's move our discussion here. I'm going to sleep, Good Night!
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> it is instant autoaim to horizantal
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> so imagine you are hooking ceiling
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> so crosshair placement is off
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> instant flick with no possibility of overshoot
04:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I hadn't realized this, this should immediately be removed, it's ruining the game /s
04:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This one is a far bigger cheat than every other non-issue mentioned here 😄
04:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Its funny you can fix aim cheat thing with a single character in config code but its too late
04:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i have never even used the aim bind. i think it's kind of a nasty misuse of otherwise legitimate mouse sens options
04:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's ofc valid and okay to use it in ddrace, but i see how it complicates other modes
04:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> we could put min value to sth like 20 to fix it
05:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ya it would be super easy
05:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that may have been the "single-character" fix Tater said
05:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> It's true if tater says
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean just add a leading character to the minimum value for cl_mouse_max_distance in the config file
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but its in the game now and imo it makes double nades a little less annoying at some points, but other uses of it is kinda annoying (like using it on shotgun)
05:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I think its a big enough advantage that many players would stay with old version if it was removed, I assume 0.7 also has it
06:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Its hard to remove advantages for that reason I guess
07:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Ya I'd never update, lining up double nades is annoying :kek:
07:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> and triple ofc
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Don't make teeworlds too ez xd
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> There should be puzzle based maps on tutorials :thonk:
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> There should be puzzle based maps on tutorials :thonk: (would be fun ngl)
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Sry don't know how github works, accidentaly close the issue 😂
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Sry don't know how github works, accidentaly closed the issue 😂
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> the solution isnt aim hack imo
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> True, ill try to think of a solution, this seems interesting
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Angle binds can't be changed, nor would it feel good for high end players to change such things, it removes tedious parts of ddrace, it's more of a QoL at this point. Plenty of ranks heavily make use of angle bind, unrealistic to do without. It's quite literally a feature at this point
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> dumb argument, If the map has a tedious part you dont aimbot to make it easier, you probably just shouldnt accept the map with a tedious part
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> i really hate that no features are ever retconed in this game
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Deal with it
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> I dont deal with cheaters
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> should be banned
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's been in the game since the start, can't really be removed
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> people said that it could, not that i know anything about coding
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> It should be imo or at least bannable from now on
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I'd imagine it'd be impossible outside of forcing a specific client
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> You could remove it from new releases of the client, but people would stop updating
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> you could detect it in the same way you would detect an aimbot
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Too complicated and messy
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> And old ranks exist, the next step would be to wipe all existing ranks and start new
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> i dont like the idea of allowing aimbot cause its too complicated to prevent it
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Well one solution could be to have an indicator for when u are aiming 270° (kinda useless),
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> 
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> the better solution would be to make grenade more forgiving, have the perfect direction downwards for a larger range of aiming angle then just one degree,  f.e 265°-275°, bit of an allowance for players to make fast flicks with grenade without aimbot...  (sadly this would either need a server tune function or a slight change of grenade physics)
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Which this discussion has already been had, it's not really going to happen
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> wipe ranks that use it
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> What's an angle bind? The 45 degree bind?
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yes
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> How can you cheat with it?
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> it aims for you
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's a problem in pvp modes in very specific cases, I guess
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> > Plenty of ranks heavily make use of angle bind, unrealistic to do without
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Can you give an example?
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> sure, gimme a second
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Most of the stop over maps by inner peace
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> noone can flick and get a perfect 270° aim, so thats why its kept in here, could be solved by what i said above imo a more "player" controlled option
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> If not all
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> if a rank makes heavy use of aimbot it shouldnt count
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> maybe thats a hot take
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> There's quite a few solo maps that make use of shotgun that are very hard to beat if you don't use angle bind, I'd imagine
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> he was quoting Skeith btw
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> ik
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> The vanilla client has this "feature", anyone can do it, so it's not really a cheat.
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> listen im sure many maps are easier with aimbot
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> meaningless
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Every single teeworlds client allows use of angle bind
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> and its meaningless that vanilla has it
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> doesnt mean we have to allow it
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> No point discussing with you 👋
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> @Dr.Funmanteddy go talk to ppl at the official teewords discord i guess... Changing it in ddnet would propably not resolve the issue u are having with shooting gamemodes
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> Idk doesnt matter anyways
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> i think ddnet should ban it in general in the same way botting is banned
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> and its up to the ictf community to do the same
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> but it will probably only ever be banned in our tournaments anyways
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> I think so too, but you need to consider stuff, first off all you cant really detect whether the bind was use, maybe possible with teehistorian after some tweaking idk whether it keeps such detailed data
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> I think so too, but you need to consider stuff, first off all you cant really detect whether the bind was used, maybe possible with teehistorian after some tweaking idk whether it keeps such detailed data
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> Idk i just also really dont like the argument that it makes hard things easier to do
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> like maybe if something requires aimbot to do consistenly it shouldnt be in most maps
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I don't see a good use case for the angle bind for those map
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Ask @Shinoa for a demo
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Or check the teehistorian yourself
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> yep one tile with double or triple rocket is the only use i guess
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> They make heavy use of angle bind to do some crazy skips
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I've watched Shinoa play it
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> TAS?
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> yeah but like i wouldnt argue for a feature that allows consistenty in doing like a 2 tile aled or somthing
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> aledbot 😄
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> then remove rank
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Wouldn't be fair, everyone accepts it as a feature of the client, it's been known and allowed for years.
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> I get that they got the rank under the pretense of it being fair game
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> The fact that it's been here for a long time doesn't mean that it should stay...
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> but it isnt anymore
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> so rip bozo
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Pointless topic imo, genuinely can't be touched, causes too many issues
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Angle bind is important in the game, but it can only be limited to vertical and horizontal angles.
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> rip off the bandaid and dont look back
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I wish, plenty of things I'd change about this game, but alas.
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> What do u think of my idea, it was ignored ...
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> i dont think you can change it to make it more forgiving
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> just say fuck it this is nearly impossible to do without bot
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> possible
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> I dont know if physics of the game should be changed
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> this would only work for grenade, and it could only be for ddnet servers
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> You still haven't given an example
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> wym?
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> i dont play ddrace but skeith is saying the double nade or whatever is hard
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> he wants us to design maps without triple rocket if we need aimbot for it
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> yeah
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> You said "Plenty of ranks heavily make use of angle bind, unrealistic to do without"
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> but instead of unrealistic, you said impossible
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> i didnt dude
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> im not @Skeith
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's not hard, it's just time consuming, once you've done a double nade thousands of times, you'd prefer if you could do it instantly, and it to be consistent. Usually it only gives a slight edge over someone not using it
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> ok well i wish i would never miss shot in ictf
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> oh ops 😄
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> ddrace isn't a pvp mode
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> so its cool if i download bot client then?
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Go for it
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Get banned though
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> adding aimbot > maps that rely on it > ranks that rely on it > remove it all?
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> its not a pvp mode tho
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> ig
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @Skeith #8
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It has rules just like every other mode, depends on the server
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Ya ya
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> maps can stay i guess, they should just be rated higher, and get their ranks wiped
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> if this were to happen, i've use the aimbot bind myself and i understand why its nice to have it in race f.e
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> yeah i think that makes sense
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> ok, rn the aim bind has a 45 deg snap in all directions,
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> 
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> imo should be reduced to upward direction and the snap should be smaller significantly 10deg 20deg 15deg something like that
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> also make it only usable with rocket equipped?
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> good to make the bind more user friendly aswell
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> the other direction would be to remove it entierly making ddnet the hardcore game that it is i guess
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> but the thing is the bind takes advantage of your cursor proximity to your tee, since its so close it forces itself to be quantized
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> so changing it is kind of. impossible?
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> yeah, remove that "glitch" and make an actual feature that is balanced and user friendly with a new method
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's similar to the weak / strong debate, it's been in the game since the beginning, it can't be changed
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> No point discussing it further
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's too late
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> If we ever start new, be sure to bring it up
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> if we start new, itd probably have a lot changed
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1003938004903149619/unknown.png
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Also forcing it is a problem, as I said previously, would have plenty of complications
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> forcing it as in the physics thing? i agree, should be bindable with the "aim snap" but should be a way smaller angle
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> no physics change required, just an input assist
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> As in probably half the community uses outdated clients
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> proof?
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I'm a moderator, I eyeball clients quite often
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Definitely not half, but a good chunk
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i think deen made a graph of who uses which client
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Ya
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Also you'd literally have to force the client onto people, or have an antibot that is prone to false positives, and deen really hates false positives
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> no need to ban it globally, just ban it for top position ranks?
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> is it possible for teehistorian to see these values `+toggle cl_mouse_max_distance 2 VALUE1; +toggle inp_mousesens 1 VALUE2"`?
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> 🤷‍♂️
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <yair> Anyone knows good host services for tw server?
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> What do u mean by services?
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> For which location?
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <yair> Like site that offer hosting
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <yair> Ger, fre
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> yeah there was a free site, i just dont remember the link ...
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> oh u want to pay, well ask deen i guess
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <yair> It dont have to be free, just something good
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> kimsufi
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1003945316015419404/unknown.png
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> They have this locations
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <yair> K i will check it thanks
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> I recommend getting the 10 euro one.
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1003945785509023744/unknown.png
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> I'm sure you can find cheaper than this but ovheco is really cheap compared to its performance.
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <yair> Looks great thanks
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hetzner
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Ddnet would defs be better without 90° bind or autohammer from freeze.. Now it's too late, but they feel like unintended cheats to a game that's very skill based. Doesn't fit
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> hmm, autohammer from freeze removed would get rid of that both double jump fly from freeze meta, that would be lovely xD
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> but i havent played the game when that was introduced, so I don't have the same feeling like u
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <turbo> Anyone got the mobile ddrace download link?
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> here is a reddit post about it https://www.reddit.com/r/ddnet/comments/mgg0ml/how_do_i_download_ddrace_to_the_phone/
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <turbo> Ty
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 90° bind worked since Vanilla Teeworlds. Autohammer was being used by pros spamming keys all the time (some even with automated tools) and it missing made the gameplay really inconsistent. Super annoying for speed running
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Not Keks have now pushed a new version of twgpu, now with the tilemap optimization, documentation and READMEs :)
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the tilemap optimization seems to work really good btw, I'm curious how high the performance increase is that your tools will measure
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twgpu
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm the docs seem to take a bit to generate
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the tools are now also on crates.io https://crates.io/crates/twgpu-tools
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, docs are up now https://docs.rs/twgpu/latest/twgpu/
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> heh, for the tilemap optimization I missed the edge case with parallax 0 groups not getting zoomed
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Yes that doesn't change the fact it sucks. I know they exist since ever... Sadly
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> The bounding box or smtj else ?
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> bounding box
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Ok will test later
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> thanks :)
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ofc it also depends on the map, my selection is a bit random
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> @Patiga is https://mapview.patiga.eu/ up to date? I find it quite laggy 😅
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes it is, the performance in the browser isn't that great
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> which browser are you using, and which gpu do you have?
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> laptop gtx 1050, firefox ~ 20fps on lavender, 
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> and just tested chrome, it's 40fps
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> ah nvm it was using the integrated gpu 🙂
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> but wtf I get 10fps on chrome on the nvidia gpu
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> But I get better perfs on my webgl renderer so I guess it has to do with the cost of the wasm layer
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> my renderer does tilemaps very differently, that has a rather big performance impact
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> ah you prob solve the mipmapping issue I have and I don't want to fix 😆
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I don't actually have mipmaps yet ^^
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We can't remove it because people can just keep using old client. So everything that was already in official client is by definition allowed
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Patiga after zooming out too much I can't zoom in anymore
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh nice find
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we could probably try to remove it if we came up with a plan
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. by gating new features behind "not having the possibility of this bind"
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at some point, people would not longer want to use the old client, because the new one is a lot better
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> had to add a `+ 1` somewhere :oop:
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> That also wasnt my plan. But we talking about adding new cheats.. Once added we have to live them
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, so we have to discuss and decide before implementing
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or accept that we could remove features in the future, and also discuss that ^^
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or put the feature behind a flag that is controlled by the server
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I don't get the fuss about the angle bind
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's obviously a gameplay improvement over not having it
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's also not really well integrated into the client, you need to look at out-of-game resources to find it
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess it's the combination of these two?
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> No, the concern is u do things which are unrealistic
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> you can do*
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Since its there u are basically forced to use it to keep up in skill
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought that this was a question, my bad
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> And that sucks
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Where? When? Why forced to use it?
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Bcs speedrunners abuse it hard
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> And u nevef as good in aiming
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Where? When?
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Jupstar feels like people play better in some ways when using the angle bind
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> U want to tell me u can aim up 100% of time?
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably e.g. when double rocketjumping ^^
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> You can't do that without a bind?
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I probably can't do that without the bind (haven't used the bind so far)
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the 100% of the time, straight up
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> it's perhaps more that the bind guarantees a higher success rate?
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> aiming up perfectly in 1 ms in unrealistic without the bind 😄
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> The bind is just a convenient way to aim up in a straight line, nothing else
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> if you aim abit to the left or right, you adjust by moving
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you don't think that the makes it easier to aim straight up?
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you don't think that the bind makes it easier to aim straight up?
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> It does, but Jupstar says people are literally forced to use it
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> and other people aswell
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> he did not say literally
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> he also added a condition
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> could you argue in good faith please? i.e. try to understand what Jupstar means
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> That's just me not reading properly 😛
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @murpi you aren't being forced but when you get all the way to triple nades it gets unrealistic for most people
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> For most people, yes probably. However, the places or maps where you do have to triple grenade are run maps most of the time and I can tell you out of experience, you don't need the bind there either
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can do a triple nade too, but it'll take me atleast like 10 tries to get it straight enough. Maybe if I played a lot more run maps I could get it down to 2-3 tries. The reason I called it more of a "cheat" than everything else mentioned was that it'd take me dozens of hours to get good enough when people can skip the effort
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eitherway, it's not a real cheat. We already all agreed it's accepted
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Every speedrun game I play has a discussion like this.
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> and it all depends on things done with alias and bind
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> for example in bhop mode this kind of thing is now considered acceptable
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I can tell you how to shoot straight up almost always without the bind
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Teach me master
14:45 <+ChillerDragon> Just use touchscreen instead of mouse
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> You configure your mouse sens and distance similar to the aim bind, but instead, you use a high sensitivity and a distance which doesn't restrict your aim to much
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> This method has the same effect similar to the aimbind, but doesn't restrict your aim in 8 directions
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> You configure your mouse sens and distance similar to the aim bind, but instead, you use a high enough mouse sensitivity which allows you to flick fast and a distance which doesn't restrict your aim to much
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> This method has the same effect similar to the aimbind, but doesn't restrict your aim to 8 directions
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Has someone noticed a teleport bug in latest master? 
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I just tested the build of 
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5696 
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> on a local server with the time shop map
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> And somehow I got teleported outside the map after entering the shop xD I tried to reproduce it again but could not get it, maybe it was just a random bitflip (maybe my RAM is broken xD)
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Heres one example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiPaycNkviI runners used to play with extreme high sensitivty and spin/flick to aim
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> okey.. thats a TAS
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> sigh, it's crazy how difficult it is to find any run videos nowadays
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> yes thats the same issue, this is Tool Assisted Speedrunning as the video sudgests and should not be a part of DDnet's normal gameplay
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> oh ok, but still, even the bind for cardinal aim, is a tool that assists your speedrun
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> The point is you can aim straight without a bind ^^
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> consistently
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> You are saying that you've got a different method and that you don't need the bind, because you have a replacement. I'm not sure how your method works exactly but isn't it also too op?
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> The argument is that if TAS runs are allowed, then it becomes a TAS category, and everyone starts using the tool, because why would they bother without it.
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> If hypothetically the aim bind was removed your method for consistent aiming might have to be patched....
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> I agree that this would be awesome, but someone could just make their own client with the bind inside and the newest features from ddnet....   Not sure how you could Gate and opensource client
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> I agree that this would be awesome, but someone could just make their own client with the bind inside and the newest features from ddnet....   Not sure how you could Gate an opensource client
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> But i guess it could have a partial effect, since that unofficial client is not going to have the same number of users.
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Playing with high sensitivty is just another way to aim, you can see people with extreme sensitivity in pvp modes all the time
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> with the side effect of being able to aim straight in any direction
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> sorry, no idea what you're talking about here 😄
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Okay well let me rephrase,
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> automated input (aim bind) = cheating, bad gameplay, competitive advantage
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> 
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> why is aim bind automated?
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> well it takes the imprecise input of a player and approximates it into precise cardinal angles 45 degrees
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> its more of an exploit than automation
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> its like saying the deepfly bind is also cheating
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> well we allow that on dummy, but technically two players would have a hard time hammering each other perfectly every time. Dummy automated input is not as broken because with a dummy you can only be faster on certain maps
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> well we allow that on dummy, but technically two players would have a hard time hammering each other perfectly every time. Dummy automated input are not as broken because with a dummy you can only be faster on certain maps
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> fix is now pushed and live :)
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao's hairy kebab> @louis :justatest:
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Patiga btw u should git ignore cargo.lock i guess? sounds like a file that is just used to check deps and got pull conflicts xd
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think you should always check in your Cargo.lock because it gives you reproducible builds
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> weird that it got changed on my site then
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe bcs i use rust nightly?
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (even for libraries, against the recommendation of the documentation)
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> link to the pull request?
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not pull request
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean i did
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> git pull
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> on twgpu
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> aah
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you show your local changes?
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's weird that you got some
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or did u force push once patiga?
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok then its probs just that 😄
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but how does that have something to do with `Cargo.lock`?
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps a merge conflict when the same commit containing Cargo.lock was added twice?
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @heinrich5991 why is .lock needed tho?
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I mean the .toml stuff already contains versioning, is there smth important in Cargo.lock?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Patiga btw the html stuff still fails:
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ```
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> error[E0432]: unresolved import `web_sys::HtmlCanvasElement`
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>   --> map-inspect-web/src/lib.rs:11:15
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>    |
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 11 | use web_sys::{HtmlCanvasElement, Response};
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>    |               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ no `HtmlCanvasElement` in the root
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ```
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i wonder how this can happen, i mean its version safe, u should get the same error shouldnt u? xd
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or is this some weird $PATH stuff 😄
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `Cargo.toml` contains versions like `serde = "1.0"`
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. "any version like `1.x.y` is compatible with this project"
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mh ok
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `Cargo.lock` contains "`serde` was compiled with version 1.0.132, with hash 0123456789abcdef"
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> its in the project readme ^^, map-inspect-web only compiles to wasm, so it fails if you do things like `cargo build` in the project root, since that will try to build it for your default target
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> build instructions are in the map-inspect-web readme
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok i see, still feels weird, since it kinda looks like some package manager cache :D, but i get your point about reproducability
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> npm and yarn have a similar lockfile
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but e.g. for npm i would not include it to git
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should. I think it’s even suggested in the documentation
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so everytime someone runs npm update u get merge conflicts
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sounds annoying xd
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, why would you get a merge conflict? For that you’d both need to run npm update
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> doesnt sound impossible in a bigger project to me
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I'd not include an npm update in an unrelated commit)
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but anyway, if they suggest it, maybe it makes sense
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i just dont understand it xd
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Think of it like how we update libraries. If both of us change the version of libcurl we’d get a merge conflict too
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> from https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-lock-json:
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > This file is intended to be committed into source repositories, […]
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess the difference is the amount of dependencies 😄
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its just weird to have versioning + exact version
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why not just use the exact version in first place xD
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for end products, exact versions are fine
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but for libraries that won't work because they're going to depend on different versions and then they can't be merged
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (only the end product's `Cargo.lock` is adhered to)
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so why not include it in the end product only
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you have reproducible builds on developer machines and CI, basically
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's possible to not have it, but IME it's worth it
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> especially if you want to go back to an old version and see what it looked like
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mh ok, e.g. for ddnet we dont do it (obviously) since its distro dependent, (almost no versioning at all), so it just felt weird that .toml atleast contains major and minor already, but then have a .lock additionally
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> But if there are sceneraios where its useful ok 😄
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Patiga do u still have our last results? ^^
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> uh I'm not sure if you wrote exact numbers, I remember correcting my fps counts here https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/998288792014291137
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Patiga ah yeah now i remember
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> from here:  "randeontop" was mentioned xd
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/995226808314241035
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah yea thats from the same session
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the overall performance seemed to decreased
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1004045687941496902/unknown.png
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but less work on GPU for sure
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that surprises me a lot
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no idea why it cannot max out my gpu anymore
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea thats what I wanted to ask, didn't expect that
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> have u added stuff CPU side?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes a bit, the bounding box for the tilemaps in particular
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but I didn't think it would be much tbh
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well maybe it runs in a CPU bottleneck now 😄
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u could add CPU side FPS
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or is 1 frame = 1 frame on CPU?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> like 1 frame is also always called on GPU
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, there are also a lot of calls to `set_scissors_rect` now, maybe I should figure out if that is significant
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I'm not sure what you mean, I count the frames on the cpu
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess you calculate the bounding box once and at most do some intersection each frame (on the cpu)?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ddnet for comparission in case of driver updates
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1004047032132051005/unknown.png
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes, each frame the intersection for each layer
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> *tilemap layer
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that is back in time 3, right?
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its a huge map, is that bad? xd
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> should be fine I think
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> notice the clock too
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> old version maxes it out, new version 2.1 ghz, ddnet 1.6ghz
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> shouldn't the cpu usage of the process be 100% of one core then? or could io be the bottleneck otherwise?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i sadly dont have the old version
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what was the commit?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> directly before the optimization af287711126e8a98e1cee21b0209c78177b4abbc
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> before some of the major refactors inbetween: 9ee24a0ce268969cd8724c9360d197d0c11d1b92
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sadly the schedular doesnt use 1core only, whats the environment flag on linux for that? XD
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1004048335809822840/unknown.png
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but from CPU usage, it's around 1 full core yeah
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> taskset -c 1
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `taskset --cpu-list 1 <command>`
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 😄
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1004048931874947092/unknown.png
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> now i try the old version
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> directly before, fps is almost the same btw in this, now i try the 9ee commit
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1004049805129031701/unknown.png
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cpu usage is a bit higher, few hunreds FPS more
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1004050115671101440/unknown.png
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but not even close to last time with 4.5k, i think my GPU got a nice downgrade xDD
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> here you talked about 3.5k at some point, maybe it was just always around that number https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/995226808314241035
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah yeah fullscreen makes difference too, true
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in ddnet i get 10k in fullscreen only, no idea wtf happens xD
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> probs direct scanout
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but the tests now were all with about the same resolution?
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah, randeontop on left, and other stuff right
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but let me quickly install the mesa version i had back then
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> quite possible that changes smth
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah nice
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> now i have 1k fps more with mesa 21.1 xD
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> here you also have around ~3.650, around 150 fps less than the last screenshot
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the cpu usage with current and directly before the optimization were 5% apart with the same fps, with about the same fps
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> maybe this indicates that some of the refactors I did before took a hit on the fps
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hmmmm
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> starting from the old commit now wait
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> old commit
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1004052181680390195/unknown.png
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 100% on 1 core, 6k fps
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> old commit is 9ee24a0ce268969cd8724c9360d197d0c11d1b92 ? (the one before the major refactors)
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but let me recheck just for safety xd
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok my command line says git:9ee24a0*
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> blame that if its wrong
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ^^
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok i guess this is the new commit then @Patiga
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gg xd
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tho i still dont get my 4.5k fps on the old version
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> really weird
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1004053914590654535/unknown.png
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm this second result would be ~ +50% fps in that particular location
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if I read the values correctly
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i just wonder wtf happened to mesa 22. that the difference is so insane 😮
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes that is really odd
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the shader file is 100% always recompiled?
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not that there is cache problems xD
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> it is stored into the binary at compile time
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> let me redo the radeontop
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://docs.rs/wgpu/0.13.1/src/wgpu/macros.rs.html#57 here is the macro I use to include the shader, it uses `include_bytes!` on the path
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_bytes.html this is the rust docs about it, I must say it confused me after reading the first line, but its just static including
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1004055595306991697/unknown.png
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> 97% graphics pipeline (is that equivalent to 100%?), ~6150 fps
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> on master?
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the GPU clocks a bit higher this the new version
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i assume its around 100%
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the geometry/vertex cores are used more heavily, is that the bounding box?
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1659456044.png
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or the simple fact that the fragment shader is soo much less 😄
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> bounding box is pure cpu work, except for the scissor discarding
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> Im currently trying to learn/understand the protocol
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but anyway for this map it seems to work out well, guess this is a good case then?
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> i do some heavy printing of the raw bytes with some annotations. Any chance that could be merged into ddnet with some #ifdef dependent prepropcessor things?
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do u except similar perf, if the bounding box is equal to the actual layer size?
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> sorry for hijacking the conversation didnt realize this was ongoing :D 
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> you are in the top-left area of the map, that might be a good spot for the optimization
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok 😄
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> just saw that I left the debug print in, the output tells you the bounding boxes of the different layers
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> its just tile coordinates
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1004056864381734962/unknown.png
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> let me zoom then
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> zoom could be even better for the optimization ^^
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the middle of the map should be the worst I think
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh wow the fps dropped that much? how can that be o.o
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> similar fps now
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1004057086235254794/unknown.png
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> what versions are those 2 screenshots?
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> is memory locality such a big thing? I don't understand why the fps is that low
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> part of the fps difference could be fullscreen, although I would've thought that the fps zoomed that far out should be very good
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: what about building that into a dissector instead?
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: what about putting that into a dissector instead?
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> Writing dissectors is a bit too hard for me trust me i tried
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> I find it really helpful integrated into the application logs
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you considered using the existing dissector at https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/tree/1b63ee7a740888b48234a9497b07efa44e4fe354/wireshark-dissector ?
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> When compiled conditionally it does not add any overhead to release binarys just grows the code base
18:08 <+ChillerDragon> yes ofc i tried all dissectors but non of the code makes sense to me
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> firtst is new, other is 9ee smth
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what code does not make sense to you?
18:09 <+ChillerDragon> but sure i would appreciate a lot if you would continue working on your dissector. I think it does not support 0.7 yet am i right?
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it does not support 0.7
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm yes zooming far out also drops the fps for me significantly, although I don't see a big reason for it. maybe memory locality is actually important o.o
18:09 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 its just too overwhealming for me to read through your code and figure out how to add 0.7
18:10 <+ChillerDragon> so i started to add some dbg msgs to vanilla and and it worked pretty wel
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that would only make sense to me if it is very cpu-bound in the new version, could you check that with this driver version once more? or should the earlier measurements still be accurate?
18:10 <+ChillerDragon> i think it would be cool to have that in the application code as well. But if you say that the added code adds unnecessary complexity to the code base thats ok
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Just a quick question, why does the source code use uppercase letter for first word in variables?
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> how it is: `int TestInteger`
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> how it should be: `int testInteger`
18:11 <+ChillerDragon> i squeezed pretty much all of it in two PrintPacket() function calls
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah yeah new commit https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1004052182343098468, old commit https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1004053915395964928 last test
18:12 <+ChillerDragon> @bubliman how it should be is defined by the code author and the teeworlds code styling guide
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Okay, makes it hard to tell apart classes and variables, whatever thanks 😉
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> your syntax highlighter should cover that part for you
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: can you link your changes?
18:15 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation/blob/master/nomenclature.md

18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> oh okay, thanks 😉
18:16 <+ChillerDragon> could be in its own file only two calls to it needed
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> permanent link: https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds/blob/0834950017aaf50ca2b3b5b196fa34b60f206656/src/engine/shared/network.cpp#L447-L564
18:16 <+ChillerDragon> and a few helpers in system.c https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds/blob/0834950017aaf50ca2b3b5b196fa34b60f206656/src/base/system.c#L2508-L2658
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that really looks like it should be a dissector
18:17 <+ChillerDragon> yea
18:17 <+ChillerDragon> sure
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could try writing your own
18:17 <+ChillerDragon> hrmpf
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> @heinrich5991 has anything come out of this ? https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11490
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or: there's packet logging in ddnet, you could take that as input files
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> so there is no effort to make any documentation?
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its with mesa 21, same that also gives 6k fps
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's correct
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could start if you want. there's a little documentation in a couple of files, but it's really only a start
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe the bounding boxes are really good for the map after all?
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and smth else gives the FPS boost? 😄
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or did u also do "smaller" bounding boxes
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for lot of unused space inside a layer
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> right now every tilemap layer has exactly one bounding box. not sure how that could be
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> expanded, maybe a quad tree?
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> like if we do n bounding boxes, it doesn't really seem trivial how to select them
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but I guess if it is cpu-bound right now, we'd need to look elsewhere for optimization ^^
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> btw do you have a nvidia alternative to radeontop?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no idea if that exists
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i only know about radeontop bcs i googled htop for amd xdd
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> heh
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hmm, "nvidia htop" also gives results, maybe I could try out a few
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> radeontop nvidia xdd
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I heard of `nvtop` already, but that that doesn't give a lot of info
18:27 <+ChillerDragon> Im not sure if documentation is a good trade of right now. It would slow down development to keep documentation up dated. And most of the documentation versions would never be read by anyone since there are not that many developers.
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Patiga btw did you update the wgpu dependency version or smth?
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> will it work with the old version?
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the 'old' commit is the commit where I updated
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think documentation is worth it, I don't think documentation slows down development
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah ok
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if you want you could step back one more commit and take an earlier version
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah could see if i finally get my 4.5k fps xD
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but actually doesnt matter, the GPU usage went down in your optimized build, and i assume that simply comes from your bounding box change, but no idea why this shouldnt also increase it when zooming out, would atleast make sense 😄
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I think documenting the particular nuanced sections of code would be helpful
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> Me too I have barely dipped my feet into c++ and ddnet code, but once I understand how Teeworlds works. I would definitely be interested in starting to work on some level of documentation.
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I think documenting the particularly nuanced sections of code would be helpful
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/tree/master/doc there is some documentation about file formats/the protocol in here
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Not Keks we seem to have really differently balanced setups. my graphics card is probably underpowered for the rest of my computer
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> before the refactors, I get at that top-left-ish portion of the map, a little zoomed out around 3150 fps, with 27% cpu usage
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> on master, I get 4600 fps there with ~36% cpu usage
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> whats ur gpu again?
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> with my built-in fps count (was that accurate after the change btw?)
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> 1060 3GB
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wtf ok
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why does that GPU even get so high FPS xd
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> is the fps counter correct now btw?
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> did u device by 5? xd
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its still 5 times as high
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> aaaaaaah
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> god damnit I fixed that at some point
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah wait i also was on old version
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> probably didn't find a good commit for it and git restored it at some point
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> let me recheck
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok but still 😄
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes I'm just gonna print fps each second :d
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but percentage wise it should still be correct
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> about 50% more fps, 40% more cpu usage
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> cant find any styling guide, does that exist as a readable file?
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok but i also have similar values
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think ChillerDragon linked some
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but on my setup the cpu usage is irrelevant coz the graphics card bottlenecks hard
18:46 <+ChillerDragon> ye i did
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Patiga yeah ok my GPU is OP
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also GPU perf tends to increase more than CPU
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 1060 is relativly old already 😄
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> aye, I do get mine to struggle in some games already, might need to upgrade some time
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> that?
18:48 <+ChillerDragon> i dont see replys
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in 7 days rtx 4090 will probs be announced xDD
18:48 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation/blob/master/nomenclature.md
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ChillerDragon, 7 days to invest in nvidia xd

18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bubliman> thx
18:49 <+louis> what does the + sign mean in irc usernames
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> "Null pointers
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Use 0 or 0x0 instead of NULL. Because Teeworlds uses C++03, nullptr does not work either."
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wtf xDD
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it means they have "voice"
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats the weirdest suggestion ever
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (+v)
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if the channel is moderator +m, people without +v can't speak
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if the channel is moderated (+m), people without +v can't speak
18:50 <+ChillerDragon> cant get my gnome terminal transparent anymore can someone send his fav terminal emulator pls
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I use xfce4-terminal
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> kvantum with kde is best
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> can custimize anything
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gnome sucks anyway bro xd
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> are u a tablet or what
18:52 <+ChillerDragon> wot
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the ui looks like it was made for tablets xD
18:53 <+ChillerDragon> how smart is it to use xfce or kde emulator with gnome? xd
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that doesn't seem to be a terminal?
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but it can customize anything
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's no problem, I think
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> including ur terminal D:
18:53 <+ChillerDragon> gnome terminal is dope they just removed the aur package that made it transparent
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
18:55 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1659459322.png
18:55 <+ChillerDragon> well out of the box xfce4 looks a bit unpleasent compared to gnome
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where's the difference?
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the menu bar and font size?
18:57 <+ChillerDragon> the menu bar colors look bad and does not hide
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
18:57 <+ChillerDragon> it doesnt take my theme so it looks a bit off
18:57 <+ChillerDragon> i prefer the look and edges of the gnome one
18:57 <+ChillerDragon> i guess font and colors can be fixed
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (you can disable the menu bar)
18:58 <+ChillerDragon> yea that looks abit better
18:58 <+ChillerDragon> how to make it transparent? :)
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk ^^ sorry
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I didn't realize that's the requirement
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I don't have windows on top of each other)
19:01 <+ChillerDragon> hrhr i3 masterrace
19:01 <+ChillerDragon> how do you know when to react in tw when being in the terminal then?
19:02 <+ChillerDragon> jopstar how to start kvantum?
19:02 <+ChillerDragon> xd
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> konsole
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1004071664079884369/unknown.png
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> transparent af
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> tw not fullscreen, or tw in a separate window
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no idea if that works on gnome tho
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> tw not fullscreen, or tw on a separate screen
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> since kde uses qt
19:04 <+ChillerDragon> i installed kvantum but only thing i find is a kvantum manager
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah maybe u can even do it without see my screenshot
19:04 <+ChillerDragon> no terminal emulator
19:05 <+ChillerDragon> i cant spawn a terminal ur screenshot is only settings
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> konsole
19:05 <+ChillerDragon> a
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its called like that xD
19:05 <+ChillerDragon> could have started with that xd
19:06 <+ChillerDragon> 41 packages
19:06 <+ChillerDragon> :D
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez
19:06 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1659459983.png
19:06 <+ChillerDragon> now thats even uglier xd
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in case u switch to kde to have best desktop, arch purple is an awesome theme, tho i use different icon pack, bcs they suck xd
19:07 <+ChillerDragon> im so used to gnome xd
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well its an KDE app
19:07 <+ChillerDragon> gnome just looks hot out of the box
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u have 100000000000 settings
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just look around u can disable most stuff xD
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also bash is default
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> urxvt, kitty, alacrity. I use all 3 on different machines. All 3 are pretty good
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u sed zsh u have to change that too
19:09 <+ChillerDragon> bash masterrace
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> zsh has some nice addons, but bash is solid af
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like fish 😉
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've been using fish on mac and I can recommend it
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I still use bash on my desktop mostly because I haven't gotten around to installing fish :D
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fish is much more friendly for interactive operation from what I've seen so far
19:11 <+ChillerDragon> i prefer writing bash scripts instead of having a friendly shell xd
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez
19:11 <+ChillerDragon> i like the apple approach more then kde
19:12 <+ChillerDragon> look good by default and no settings
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> FBI
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > i prefer writing bash scripts instead of having a friendly shell xd
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > i like the apple approach more then kde
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but it doesnt look good xddd
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apple approach is making everything closed source, uncustomisable, you sure? :D
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know what looks excellent? Out of the box urxvt256 and out of the box bspwm
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No bells, no whistles
19:14 <+ChillerDragon> wat dis?
19:14 <+ChillerDragon> ur emulator
19:15 <+ChillerDragon> cant find urxvt256 in the aur wat dis
19:15 <+ChillerDragon> heinrich what are those quotes? xd
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so did the transparency setting work on gnome?
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u have to edit your profile ->  color, edit transparency
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the package is called rxvt-unicode in arch
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And I think it's in the normal repository. Dont need aur
19:18 <+ChillerDragon> is it a emulator?=
19:19 <+ChillerDragon> didnt have time to deep dive kde settings yet
19:22 <+ChillerDragon> okok transparency works but it looks bad xd https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1659460924.png
19:22 <+ChillerDragon> all the white borders
19:23 <+ChillerDragon> i want tw console als my terminal emulator -.-
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can probably get there with the kde terminal ^^
19:24 <+ChillerDragon> time to switch back to mac
19:24 <+ChillerDragon> xd
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do me a favour and make m2 work flawless on linux xd
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the thing you're looking for is 'quake like terminal' btw
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then apple isnt as useless
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets face it
19:26 <+ChillerDragon> wats m2
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> chillerdragon wants a terminal inside ddnet
19:26 <+ChillerDragon> that too!
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> apple m2
19:26 <+ChillerDragon> but id also take the terminal outside of ddnet 
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> is apple m1 + 1
19:26 <+ChillerDragon> the chip?
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
19:26 <+ChillerDragon> u wanna install linux on mac hardware? xd
19:26 <+ChillerDragon> but then i dont get the mac terminal xd
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean the hardware seems for for laptops
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but macos sucks xd
19:27 <+ChillerDragon> wot
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: maybe this? https://github.com/Guake/guake
19:27 <+ChillerDragon> macos bae
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah sucks xddd
19:28 <+ChillerDragon> ah heinrich u got me wrong
19:28 <+ChillerDragon> its more about the looks than the dropdown functionallity
19:28 <+ChillerDragon> i prefer fullscreen over dropdown
19:28 <+ChillerDragon> but i really care about nice design
19:28 <+ChillerDragon> the ingame terminal just looks hot!
19:28 <+ChillerDragon> no white edges or menus
19:30 <+ChillerDragon> dont tell me thats what your terminal looks like @Learath2 https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1659461433.png
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> arent u the white lord of white themes?
19:31 <+ChillerDragon> tru
19:31 <+ChillerDragon> but not in my terminal
19:31 <+ChillerDragon> unless im in the sun
19:32 <+ChillerDragon> at least there is no menu ... but look at the scroll bar xd
19:32 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1659461542.png
19:32 <+ChillerDragon> gnome scrollbar is so hot
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> heueueu there is a aur archive
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> how smart is it to install that?
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No, you change colors in your .Xresources. I'm surprised you havent customised that yet :D
19:35 <+ChillerDragon> im vanilla
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> ez i installed this https://github.com/aur-archive/gnome-terminal-transparent and got transparent gnome back. But thanks guys for sharing
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ChillerDragon:
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Add this in backend_sdl.cpp ::Init
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> SDL_SetWindowOpacity(Window, 0.2f)
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then u real pro
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not terminal is transparent but ddnet xd
19:58 <+ChillerDragon> thats nice so i can quickly tab out of ddnet and let my mates fall into spikes when my terminal ncurses app in the background rings an alert
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xD
19:58 <+ChillerDragon> we need transparency option in settings! 
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> definitely, every color that exists in client needs setting xd
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe we need a color mapping UI
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that automatically lists all colors 😄
20:00 <+ChillerDragon> or i need a terminal emulator that catches keypresses when not being focussed. Aka a keylogger. Then i make ddnet transparent and control my terminal in the bacgkground xd
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> would be cool IMO 😄
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> custom designs ez
20:00 <+ChillerDragon> ddnet should auto detect KDE themes!
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
20:00 <+ChillerDragon> xd
20:00 <+ChillerDragon> keeworlds
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets drop support for anything except kde and amdgpu
20:01 <+ChillerDragon> oof
20:01 <+ChillerDragon> what about windows? xd
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what?
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what is windows
20:01 <+ChillerDragon> notin
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok gud
20:02 <+ChillerDragon> OMG
20:02 <+ChillerDragon> NOW I CANT CLICK LINKS ANYMORE
20:02 <+ChillerDragon> why is this so cursed
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> try RECHTS
20:03 <+ChillerDragon> ok fak dis shit
20:03 <+ChillerDragon> tomorrow ima compile gnome terminal from src
20:05 <+ChillerDragon> omg i accidentally uninstalled all terminals :D (sent from my tty thingy)
20:06 <+ChillerDragon> how do i get back to my graphical session again?
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> alt-f7 usually
20:08 <+ChillerDragon> yea but i pressed 1-7 already 7 only goes to last if u didnt mess up
20:08 <+ChillerDragon> f1 worked for me :) but i had to relogin
20:08 <+ChillerDragon> yay i somehow got transparent plus link clicking now
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki this java bloat better than gogs and gitlab? https://github.com/theonedev/onedev

20:39 <+ChillerDragon> didnt we all agree on hating java?
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @Ryozuki do you have any good sources about if im *just* starting out rust?
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk about rust as a first lang
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but there is nothing better than https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <yair> I want to change something in the ddnet server but im too lazy to find it, in what file u put the value in the score (not the pPlayer class var, where u set it after all the calcs and stuff)
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> looks like the c++ linker trying to statically link sdl (.lib) when you want to dynamically link it (.dll)
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> your rust sdl bindings probably have docs for that
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sounds more like its simply missing xd
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> you do use .lib for .dll linking
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe I can try working on 0.7 support in the dissector, ChillerDragon
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> idk how to set that up i just started this an hour ago 💀
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> Jupstar is right you do need a sdl.lib file somewhere in the linker path. You prob have to copy it somewhere to be visible by the compiler, or add it to you path env variable idk
