00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> I deleted because i solved
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> Srry
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ChillderDragon: we dont have a map validator, the map_convert_07 checks some image stuff, like width height. and the number of textures used
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> why do sound settings still suck after added options :/
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> need restart to turn them on and off
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also wish there was a little mixer with ping soundss / gun sounds settings, would be amazing
08:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis because I can't reproduce the issue and so I can't fix it
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlazingFire> there is so many egpyt people playing teeworlds in the last week soo.. me and my friend want from the devs do server for egypt people
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlazingFire> there is so many egypt people playing teeworlds in the last week soo.. me and my friend want from the devs do server for egypt people
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @BlazingFire what do you mean by "many"? I thought the same about Turkey, Persian, Costa Rica, Colombia, but those servers are mostly empty now
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlazingFire> imm.. im not know that english well
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlazingFire> i think that im spell wrong
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlazingFire> many is like so ppl
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> how is connection from Egypt to Turkey server?
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlazingFire> idk but we in egypt some servers pings are 200 to 350 or high
08:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlazingFire> but some servers are good too
08:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlazingFire> @AbdoZX17  tell me lets talk to admin to make egypt servers
08:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlazingFire> bec, the ping and there are so many ppl playing teeworlds
08:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlazingFire> and they egyptions
08:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlazingFire> i think i spelled right
08:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Are the Egyptian players new players on Steam?
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlazingFire> no
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlazingFire> not all
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlazingFire> there's some ppl new and the other not
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Please try ping to Turkey and check if it's good enough. I honestly don't see so many players from Egypt to warrant a new server
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlazingFire> ok
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlazingFire> thanks for reading
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BlazingFire> i will see
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 8 new players on Steam in 1 week for example
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen updated antibot
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thank u
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> does ddnet fast download also work for vanilla clients?
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> does anyone have a fast download implementation in a mod that is not ddnet? because i cant seem to get it to work, for me it always hangs at a specific point if its not the LAN server but a normal server...
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i still dont have it in my mod
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/commit/218184f0c5d3d97382e04456c21006dacb10df07
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this was my latest try, but it didnt work out, hangs relatively fast and is stuck then
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> No need to put it on GitHub to ask for a role @Dino
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xller4ble> Im thinking about drawing skin for myself, how can i upload it in skin database later?
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savalic> @Pepe i did nothing 😅
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> :monkaS: :sorry:
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut ofc, that’s the point of fastdl
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should add dbg msgs to either side, see why it slows back down
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis auto demo on?
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ya
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> have u checked the demo where the laser thing didnt render?
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if it also didnt render in the demo
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> mmm
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ill have to find it
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the only thing i can imagine is that the server sends some negative gameticks
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> nah it shows
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> connected the dummy or smth?
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 as i read this code, it only sends some packets ahead, not many at every request, like in 0.7
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is that correct?
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if yes, how can it even work?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when u shoot too many lasers it hides the players and the HUD XD
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/768827872298139648/screenshot_2020-10-22_15-26-37.png
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> too many entities I guess
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but why does it hide the HUD XD
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i will ubsan it just to be safe
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> shows nothing, still strange that the HUD is gone xD
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, would be good to find out why
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I know that parts of the UI are missing if the snapshot lacks certain netobjs
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (from my custom server impl)
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these probably couldn't get in anymore due to having too many entities
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> possible, strange tho that it blocks the FPS rendering
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm true
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut it employs a trick. The old client requests whatever chunk it receives +1
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So it gets 15 chunks, requests 15, gets 15....
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> sometimes antiping is bugged and thinks players didnt touch a collisiion tile when in fact they can
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> fix is to turn antiping off and on
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think this is expected, antiping is basically like the server locally, but some things it can't get updates on
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and it might miss that you touched a tile
17:25 <+ChillerDragon> can we get points for finishing solo parts pls? :)
17:26 <+ChillerDragon> also how to configure chat padding?
17:27 <@deen> in chat.h
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> https://github.com/12pm/ddnet-discordbot/issues/14
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> add the discord bot to `ddnet` so it will be shown here and it will be ez to find a linkj
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> add the discord bot to `ddnet` so it will be shown here and it will be ez to find a link
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> #3169 should be also about chat, particles, shot effects, shouldn't it?
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3169
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> meh
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> #3170 *
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3170
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how to add discord bot to ddnet
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao transfer the repo
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i wouldnt add that feature
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 5k is nothing
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't have 5k points yet I think ^^
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you have 5k?
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 5k points would be cool
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well u dont play
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> like announcements
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or when top10points changes
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> kog has that and its cool imo
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kog has 5 players
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet is different
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> top10 points doesnt change often id think
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 5k points is ez if u play the correct maps
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and 5k is a lot
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye still takes time
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> 5k is a lot
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u have 7k :greenthing:  if its so easy to get points u should have more by this time
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> it takes a lot of time if it's your new account. If it's not - even more
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> someone would need 277 stronghold finishers per day to rack up 5k daily
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have 7k cuz i dont actively play much anymore
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if i got a partner i would reach 20k ez
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> sure sure
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> + most points in 1 day was 500 wasnt it
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine thinking 5k is something
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u need ur mom to tell u did good?
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki hey. stop it
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok ur annoying to talk to :)

18:19 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1603383499.png
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> hardest part ngnl

18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> chiller down
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> i like ryo and i dont like the 5k points idea
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> so
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/768871484335980604/unknown.png
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > I can imagine he is a bit frustrated since he lives in the middle of coronacountry
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @n000b if u mean me no, im not frustrated cuz corona lmao

18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/768871774460837888/points_Ryozuki.png
18:21 <+ChillerDragon> :party:
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao bot abuse
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> $points ChillerDragon
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> There is no reason old players can decide if 5k points idea it's good or not, this idea is meant to be for the new players, which are learning and maybe the get some motivation to keep playing
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> omg fix bot 
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> CONGRATS CHILLER
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> still doesnt work 
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> YOU MADE IT
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> TO 5K POINTS
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what bot abuse
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> ty
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to spam bot announcements to 5k with names that heinrich will dislike
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
18:22 <+ChillerDragon> oof
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> imagine wasting ur time for 1 message
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> it took u 3 years to get 5k
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> gl
18:23 <+ChillerDragon> bouis
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> whats motivating on a one message?
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> however
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @louis the most point in 1 day idea and such achievements are great but
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah, everyone had 20k points back in 2015
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> That maybe you made your goal? It's the same thing as the ddnet birthday player xd
18:23 <+ChillerDragon> i want a congratulations email with images and confetti for finishing Kobra 2
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u can kinda cheese points in 1 day by /save /load
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> i made 5k points, time to ditch the game
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @eNJi ur mom is proud
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> in the end ppl are just gonna spam finishes with the same name
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> to beat it
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> it would work with accounts
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 10k might work
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> cant really spam that
18:24 <+ChillerDragon> oof
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> congrats ur reddit post got 5k upvotes :poggers:
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and its an actual achievement
18:24 <+ChillerDragon> until it isnt anymore
18:25 <+ChillerDragon> cuz maps get rlsd
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it still requires a lot time
18:25 <+ChillerDragon> so 5k is nothing and 10k is a lot ?
18:25 <+ChillerDragon> quick maffs
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> 5k msg is stupid, steam achievements would work the best
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> achievement unlocked: not using n word as a name
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> :poggers:
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> Not everyone use steam xd
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> tbh idk why not 5k it still takes time
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> new players do
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> u r so smart
18:26 <+ChillerDragon> not everyone collects points
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> become a dev
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> and you want this for new ppl
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> so
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> wheres the problem?
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 99% of new ppl are not even here
18:27 <+ChillerDragon> true
18:27 <+ChillerDragon> cuz there are no new ppl
18:27 <+ChillerDragon> so sad
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are in china
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> ||the reason why its sarcasm: you'll need accounts, ok?||
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
18:27 <+ChillerDragon> CHINA!
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> It's just pointless when there is a topic like this, some agree, some others don't, and we get to nothing
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not like doing this makes "progress"
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is superifical
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> superficial
18:28 <+ChillerDragon> progress?
18:28 <+ChillerDragon> im just here to shittlak
18:28 <+ChillerDragon> omg typo
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i doubt ppl will grind for 5k on some dumb or racist name just to get the discord message deleted, it takes hours to do that and doubt ppl would waste their time to troll like thaat since there's much more efficient ways of trolling lmao
18:28 <+Ryozuki> learn to write
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> shittlak
18:28 <+ChillerDragon> oof
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> wait
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> are we supposed to discuss something relevant to the game on this discord?
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> > @louis it takes months
18:29 <+ChillerDragon> "discord"
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> at least weeks for pro players with new acc

18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i was trying the role
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry.
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> test
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I banned Ryozuki for now since he couldn't behave while we were trying to mute
18:37 <+ChillerDragon> oof
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> ? xD
18:37 <+ChillerDragon> nub muter
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> :banhammer:
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @snail open #developer settings, choose "Muted" role and take away right to send messages. Go to other roles and set it to "neutral" (middle setting)
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> i banned ryo cuz he wasnt muted when i have him mute role? xD
18:38 <+ChillerDragon> #freeryo
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> wtf
18:38 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: take mod discussions elsewhere or I'll mute you…
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> D:
18:38 <+ChillerDragon> oof
18:38 <@heinrich5991> it cannot be the case that we can't ban people creating a bad atmosphere
18:38 <+ChillerDragon> do not discuss staff decisions
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @Дядя Женя i aint doing that on every single channel of this discord
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> do not discuss atmosphere
18:39 <+ChillerDragon> never doubt admins decisions
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wtf the discord mod role color is too good
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> snail look i am streaming
18:40 <+ChillerDragon> btw why did everyone ignore my great feature suggestion of adding points to soloparts?
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> what do you mean?
18:40 <+ChillerDragon> to recivie points for finishing the solo part
18:40 <+ChillerDragon> on a map
18:40 <+ChillerDragon> like the noob filter
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> lol why?
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> why is a discord mod above mods, i feel offended
18:41 <+ChillerDragon> cuz some are hard
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> just don't make these parts hard
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> it's supposed to block the noobs
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> discord mods being above mods is making bad atmosphere
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> you should feel guilty for liking Ryozuki#2188
18:47 <+ChillerDragon> dont be rude or heinrich will mute u
18:47 <+ChillerDragon> ryo is nice
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @gerdoe is the screenmapping there inside the snapshot/tick stuff too? or just inside the render function
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @eNJi
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> try writing in here
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> > + most points in 1 day was 500 wasnt it
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> @louis who?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> syltoox with bot
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> > 2000 points per month is maximum now
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> @Дядя Женя cuz nobody tryhards, i remember that milk made over 3k in 1 month 2015...
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what about starkiller
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You could easily do thousands of points in a day, by nearly finishing all maps and then collecting saves and finishing them all in one day
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the client antiping is really sensitive with tunings isnt it, added 2 tunings to my fng server and now the client thinks it has a gun for some reason
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You cant just add tunings
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you are not allowed to send tunings to a client that doesnt have those too
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> otherwise client will invalidate the packet on unpacking and just drop it
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that can lead to mispredictions or other tuning failures
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And of course its order dependent
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you should remove discordbot from webhook notifications
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @heinrich5991
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't see a way to do that here: https://github.com/organizations/ddnet/settings/hooks/14186204
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, i think I found out how
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> arent other repos excluded too?
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> like django
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, I deactivated it on the ddnet-discordbot repo now
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> k nice
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @fokkonaut well, then the client shall drop it, but not assume a gun for no reason
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> true, no idea about that
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @heinrich5991 ???? XD unban ryozoozki wtf
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> Or ban Konsti as well :justatest:
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ban U
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> trade konsti for ryozoozki
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Undeserved ban
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> He didnt evade mute
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u just didnt get mute work
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Not his fault
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> 🔇
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> yes trade konsti for ryo :greenthing:
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ddnet card game when
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> > + most points in 1 day was 500 wasnt it
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> @louis i did 2k points in some hours
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i remember some admin checking the database and it was 500 in 24 hrs
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> This sounds actually really interesting. I am curious how it is going to be tho. Maybe it sounds better then it works
