05:14 <+bridge> <egyt> How do I update Ukrainian translation?
06:23 <+bridge> <0xdeen> It's easiest if you wait for https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8460 to be merged, then do a PR to change ukrainian.txt. You could also download the file from https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8460/files#diff-2af9c8ffe5f989d05840289864dced2a1034c45de54b5140e01d55687e778fd8 directly, and send me a new version if you don't want to wait
08:29 <+bridge> <_noby> go for it id love to see a better version :happy:

12:04 <+bridge> <egyt> ???
12:38 <+bridge> <egyt> here you have your RC bug :^)
12:50 <+bridge> <meloÆž> my mom got my old PC and i even wiped it entirely and set it up for her - after booting up she asks me if i can install linux on it - she doesnt like windows and is used to linux since my dad is a software/network engineer
12:50 <+bridge> <meloÆž> my mom got my old PC and i even wiped it entirely and set it up for her - after booting up she asks me if i can install linux on it - she doesnt like windows and is used to linux since my dad is a software/network engineer and she helped him `back in the day`
12:52 <+bridge> <meloÆž> :gigachad:  <- my mom rn
12:52 <+bridge> <peter0x44> Send her a link to the Gentoo installation handbook
12:53 <+bridge> <meloÆž> she got Kubuntu
12:54 <+bridge> <meloÆž> time to play WoW with her again.. god i miss that time
12:54 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> So your mom uses Linux and you use windows?
12:54 <+bridge> <meloÆž> my mom uses linux, and i use both

13:03 <+bridge> <egyt> respect+++
13:05 <+bridge> <meloÆž> i game a lot so i'm sadly forced to stay on windows for that - anything dev related i go on linux tho
13:06 <+bridge> <peter0x44> Just... Play other games? That's my solution
13:06 <+bridge> <meloÆž> :pepe_ew92:
13:09 <+bridge> <peter0x44> What games force you to windows?
13:09 <+bridge> <meloÆž> star citizen and League
13:09 <+bridge> <meloÆž> also mw3 and diablo 4 (they run, but they do very poorly)
13:12 <+bridge> <peter0x44> I don't play any of those
13:12 <+bridge> <peter0x44> And by mw3 you mean call of duty? I've definitely played it with wine fine
13:12 <+bridge> <peter0x44> Unless you mean the whole stupid reboot thing with having to put the (2019) next to the name
13:13 <+bridge> <meloÆž> im talking about the new version :P
13:13 <+bridge> <meloÆž> i think the "original" COD MW3 would run fine
13:13 <+bridge> <peter0x44> It does
13:16 <+bridge> <egyt> Eh, I guess those two are to be solved in 18.4!

13:27 <+bridge> <learath2> W mom
13:35 <+bridge> <reitw> Imagine ur mom is a pro opensource only
13:38 <+bridge> <robyt3> No, and it would probably be better to write a new, extensible script to fix the various translation style issues that were opened recently, since the existing translation scripts are not understood by anyone anymore
13:43 <+bridge> <egyt> ðŸ‘€
13:46 <+bridge> <egyt> also, the Ukrainian translation update is not in the changelog?
13:48 <+bridge> <meloÆž> should it ? translation files get updated regularly
13:48 <+bridge> <meloÆž> deen you should give yourself some credit from time to time! :P

14:12 <+bridge> <robyt3> You can bind `lctrl` and `rctrl` different if they are the primary key of the bind, but as modifier both are combined as `ctrl`, same for `shift`, `alt` and `gui`
14:13 <+bridge> <meloÆž> i see - so this is indeed intended behaviour - i was just confused because `ctrl` doesnt show up
14:14 <+bridge> <meloÆž> i see - so this is indeed intended/expected behaviour - i was just confused because `ctrl` doesnt show up
14:15 <+bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, the key completion doesn't work for composite binds at all, it also doesn't show the modifiers since they are not real key names
14:15 <+bridge> <meloÆž> sadge
14:16 <+bridge> <robyt3> You can open an issue, I guess, maybe someone feels motivated to add support for composite binds

21:34 <+bridge> <toku.kunavara> Does anyone know how to create a bot that can receive chat messages from a DDNet server? I don't want you to do it for me; I just need some guidance on how to do it, and I'll handle the rest.
21:49 <+bridge> <meloÆž> this is already a thing - this logs the chat messages to the discord server
21:49 <+bridge> <meloÆž> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1249087847978504192/image.png?ex=66660735&is=6664b5b5&hm=a97fbdae2d55a3c7433936b4f8d495b297f6acbf550f66bdc04c45a1f1c417bd&
21:49 <+bridge> <meloÆž> your best bet is to ask these two
21:50 <+bridge> <toku.kunavara> ok
21:50 <+bridge> <toku.kunavara> thx
21:51 <+bridge> <toku.kunavara> Do you have his Discord handle?
21:51 <+bridge> <toku.kunavara> ataa
21:52 <+bridge> <toku.kunavara> discord.gg
21:52 <+bridge> <toku.kunavara> https://discord.gg/vDQMHSss8W
22:52 <+bridge> <jxsl13> might be easier to do it through econ than through a dummy client that's connected to the server.
22:52 <+bridge> <jxsl13> tho, discord messages will be server messages in that case
22:53 <+bridge> <jxsl13> if the bot is available for download, then just using it is the easiest way, obviously
23:20 <+bridge> <imilchshake> hayo! Is there a good way to render a .demo directly from the terminal? I wanna use it for batch processing of a large folder with many small demos. 
23:20 <+bridge> <imilchshake> I noticed that you can run `DDNet some_demo.demo` and it will immediately start the demo viewer of that demo. But can i also somehow immediately start a video export via `start_video`?
23:21 <+bridge> <imilchshake> 
23:21 <+bridge> <imilchshake> I tried `DDNet some.demo "start_video out.mp4"` but it runs  the start video command before running the demo so i  get `videorecorder: Video can only be recorded in demo player.`
