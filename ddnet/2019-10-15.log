09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I lost a server's ip address but found it again with a port scan. One advantage of using weird port numbers no one else uses ðŸ˜„
09:28 <+Ryozuki> :o
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Usually I would just check the logs on other servers since that one does backups of them nightly but crond segfaulted all night and so no backups were made and the DNS entry was not updated. One of my main annoyances with Archlinux, that cron keeps segfaulting after some library was updated and you have to restart it manually. And of course pacman doesn't even tell you that the e <message clipped>

09:39 <+Ryozuki> ye i had problems with that too
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 src/game/server/entities/character.cpp:1681 is wrong

10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> shouldn't it be != 0?
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or is it only for stoppers blocking you from falling down, then just m_Core.m_Vel.y I guess
12:02 <+Ryozuki> updated aur
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen wrong commit message ðŸ˜›
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> haha
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Ryozuki fastest maintainer in the west :happy:
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> btw, ddnet-skins package also updated with latest Bust-A-Move skins.
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen newest ddnet7 version I know of is 7d2b9decb2f4ea84760f1adcd749409cbbdf9cea
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tropo> is it intended that there is no "tele all" anymore on home server? or did the command change
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tele all?
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes all replacing the id and resulting in all players
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what does it do?
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rcon tele all me
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think we ever had an `all` victim
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we had
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we had
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we do
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk why it doesn't work then
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> src/engine/shared/console.h:            VICTIM_ALL=-1,
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> src/engine/shared/console.cpp:                        if(Result.HasVictim() && Result.GetVictim() == CResult::VICTIM_ALL)
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> src/engine/shared/console.cpp:        m_Victim = VICTIM_ALL;
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because tele doesnt take a victim anymore
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why not?
21:37 <+bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> teleporters in map instead of players?
21:37 <+bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> wasnt there telecp or something like that?
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i reworked it
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but i didnt know about the all thing
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 uhm, I can't start the prebuilt ddnet client
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `./DDNet: /usr/lib/libcurl.so.4: version `CURL_OPENSSL_3' not found (required by ./DDNet)`
21:37 <+bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> classic
21:38 <+bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> from ddnet.tw?
21:38 <+bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> lemme check
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> BLURB
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> god damn it
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I was so sure
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜¦
21:38 <+bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> PREFER_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON xd
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry deen
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what the problem there is
21:39 <+bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> np heinrich i guess most linux users can help themself
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 oh it's a debian thing
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/2433
21:40 <+bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> yea could reproduce it on deb10 too
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we can work around that by building with a specific version of libcurl not provided by the debian package
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> blurb blurb blurb
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> meh
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well what do you want to do about it? ðŸ˜›
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Schulzer> may i ask, what was the intention for changing the freeze hammer?
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We really should have written an announcement about it
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```[1:57 PM] Learath2: This makes keeping dj for hammerflying out of freeze and recovering a failed hammerfly a little easier. Makes deepfly consistent (previously people with bad connections couldn't even deepfly at all). Hammering out of freeze also becomes consistent (in the past depending on the order of your client ids, the bottom tee might not be able to hammer you up at al <message clipped>
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> These are the results of the change
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://heinrich5991.github.io/blog/blog/one-tick-unfreeze
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This explains the reasons decently
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> TLDR: Behaviour was very inconsistent
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Schulzer> I don't think we need the difficulty reduction, better player should be rewarded for having more experience and a better feeling for the failed hammerfly, that makes those saves even cooler, now everyone can do it. And the other thing is deepfly is something, that can break so many parts so it was ok being only allowed(necessary) on certain maps, where you know you need deepfly.
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `sv_deepfly` is still a thing to prevent deepflying
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The mousewheel bind to fire already makes those things easier, so the difficulty reduction is only a thing for peopel who don't know about the bind
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> maybe we should actually do that
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ye
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao do what?
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> disable deepfly by default
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> (on every non dummy map)
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> on dummy maps too
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> that would make some r1s impossible to beat
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> enable it on those
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> thats a lot of manual work lol
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and probably mistakes to come
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> not that much work
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> how would u check if deepfly had been used
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> on that map
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> beforehand
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u check if it was possible to deepfly or not
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i dont get it
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> then u dont change anything
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i mean mostly for future maps
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ah
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> isnt that the case already?
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> then sure
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but we should rly put sv deepfly 0 on every non dummy map
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> before ppl make ranks with it
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> some normal maps need exceptions i guess
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> like heartcore
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ye thought about it too
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> at least that would make that part non cheatable
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but thats about the only one i can think of
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but has been used for r1
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yeah
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so what do you think @Learath2
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> suddenly we want to disable deepfly, now that it's become less than horrible?
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because it makes stuff cheatable?
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it was cheatable before
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but it hasnt been used
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> well it was obviously not known
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because switching to dummy when playing with a normal player is a burden
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and doing it with dummy was a preeetty big downside
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yeah
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thats mostly not worth it
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's been known for at least two weeks now
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> not rly
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> just see how ppl reacted with the change
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and I know some people who knew the trick
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yea but its so niche
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> we would have known if people really abused it a lot
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but okay, I like that we're accepting doing backwards-incompatible changes
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't like that we'll have a split between old maps and new maps
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's kinda inconsistent
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ive never seen 2 actual players deepflying
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> show me a demo then
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wdym by split between old and new maps
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> im rly curious to see that
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @snail what do you mean? I tried all that stuff with actual players, and I saw them deepfly and was also deepflying myself
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> im talking in a real run lol
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> not in a testing environment
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and before ur thing
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> before my blog post?
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> aka 2 players using it while actually playing
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yes
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> before ur blog post
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> before I started investigating it, I don't know if there's players that have been using it
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> didnt u need that scrollwheel thing
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how many people have such a scrollwheel
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, we tried it with a normal scroll wheel
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> worked too
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yeah it works with random scroll wheel
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I don't have an unlocked scroll wheel)
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just assumed that it can't be that easy
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which was wrong
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but the id thing made it "random" and anyway it was ultra niche
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> if 2 actual good players used it to deepfly it would have been known in no time
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do we teach this?
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that deepfly is disabled on maps newer than X?
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I know we already have some gameplay differences including deeplfy on some maps, which is bad enough
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> just disable it on every non dummy maps
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> dummy maps are different, and heartcore might probably be the only exception
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> even old ones?
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> pros will know about it
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't only want to reach pros, but okay, "dummy maps" seems like a fairly simple rule
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> well heartcore is the only exception i can think of
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> same
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do we have a setting that identifies dummy maps as dummy maps already?
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> there is a dummy server xd
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 @Jupstar âœª also seems to have noticed ðŸ˜„
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does anyone remember what was the use for `CTeamsCore`?
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> 12.7.1 ?
