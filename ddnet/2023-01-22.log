00:23 <+bridge> <HestiaSpider> why would you give me your ip just stream on twitch lol
00:24 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD hadn't thought of that maybe I'll do at a later time
00:25 <+bridge> <HestiaSpider> alr also is the ai available ? I mean can i use it and modify it ??
00:26 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> https://github.com/Inateblig/KoGAI
00:26 <+bridge> <HestiaSpider> noice
00:26 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> although it only works for UNIX like systems so no windows :P
00:26 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> (because it uses fifo files for communication)
00:28 <+bridge> <HestiaSpider> alrightt
00:28 <+bridge> <HestiaSpider> looks cool asf
00:28 <+bridge> <HestiaSpider> is the ai good btw xD
00:29 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> it was ok. I just started reworking on it so idk if it is now (cause I haven't trained it long enough yet)
00:30 <+bridge> <HestiaSpider> i mean you could accelerate the game so it goes very fast and trains fast too ??
00:30 <+bridge> <HestiaSpider> maybe you could use a server to make it train h24 on it
00:30 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> already thought of both for now I train on my pc on x1 speed with 20 envs
00:32 <+bridge> <HestiaSpider> alr alr
00:32 <+bridge> <HestiaSpider> fair enough

17:45 <+bridge> <TeePlayer> I have observed an unusual issue with quads in the latest version of DDNet (16.7.2), as shown in these screenshots (first ingame, second in editor). The issue is not present in the previous version (16.6). Can someone please take a look?

17:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this isnt a bug in ddnet but in the map
17:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it uses an alpha value > 1 for the light
17:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its basically undefined behavior
17:51 <+bridge> <TeePlayer> alpha is between 0 and 1

17:52 <+bridge> <TeePlayer> alpha is between 0 and 1
17:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> send me the map pls
18:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Patiga does ur tool find alpha values > 1 ?
18:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and do we auto clamp the envelop alphas since a few versions?
18:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in editor
18:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and rgb
20:20 <+bridge> <судный день.> oh my god high priority issue
21:32 <+bridge> <Themix> yo, weird problem, my friend sees game in transparency in entities and without (for example normally there is no star behind the block) anyone knows how to fix this?

21:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> use other entities maybe
21:40 <+bridge> <Cipy29> normal ss for reference
21:40 <+bridge> <Cipy29> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1066819704360030249/screenshot_2023-01-22_22-40-29.png
21:45 <+bridge> <Themix> yea, theres nothing wrong in game settings or any assets, maybe some console command? the problem is tiles are like half transparent
21:50 <+bridge> <furo> Well, `cl_overlay_entities` is probably on a value that isn't 100 or 0. There's a also a slider for this in the DDNet tab (Overlay entities).

21:59 <+bridge> <Themix> first ss is 0, second 100
21:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can u try to rename %appdata%/ddnet to have a new config directory to see if its config problem?
21:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can later rename it back(always close all clients)
22:00 <+bridge> <Themix> just tiles everywhere in the game in entities or w/o are transparent, quads are fine
22:36 <+bridge> <Themix> hmm, what should i do?
22:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> clean config basically
22:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and see if that fixes ur issue, then we know its a config problem
22:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and can analyse further
22:47 <+bridge> <Themix> deleted config and whole game, reinstalled, still same problem xD
22:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Update GPU drivers
22:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What's your hardware
