00:00 < bridge> <TsPiggy> you could also grab a few screenshots and manually line them up in photoshop or something to get the offset
00:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @barlars: it’s unlikely that you catch me while I have this chat open. Just ask away.
00:17 < bridge> <barlars> i wanna make a map for your score saved fng server
00:18 < bridge> <barlars> actually working on it rn
00:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oof sounds like work. I don’t enjoy being picky but I am. Don’t put in too much work I might not use the map .\_.
00:19 < bridge> <barlars> ok then thanks
00:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can also create issues here to discuss the map so we don’t have to abuse this ddnet channel https://github.com/ddnet-insta/fng-maps-06
00:34 < bridge> <zhn> nevermind ddnet client renders font glyphs of the same font differently depending on screen resolution
00:35 < bridge> <zhn> will not be consistent anyway
01:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Would be nice if ddnet was only using fixed width fonts
01:08 < bridge> <hectavoxel> whats the point of variable fonts in ddnet tbh
01:44 < bridge> <zhn> beauty
01:47 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i mean unless theres a good reason for the font to be changing width smoothly, i think itd not only be lighter on ddnet, but more visually more solid within the ddnet vibe to just have several font files for weights
01:49 < bridge> <zhn> we cant
01:49 < bridge> <zhn> remember we have bring all chinese and japanese symbols
01:49 < bridge> <zhn> have to*
02:32 < bridge> <pioooooo> easy ��������
04:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> sorry about that
04:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> although source han sans is very much variable tho. so we are good for VF
06:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i have no idea how i did this but im trying my HARDEST to make this work
06:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> again, it's going through the group a layer is in and taking every tile layer that isnt itself as a list member
06:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> 
06:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i   dont know how to treat it when moving around layers. i  dont know why it treats each list item as a layer (this crashes the program btw). but i WILL get this to work somehow
06:54 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1335850794892660796/2025-02-03_00-51-17.mp4?ex=67a1ab80&is=67a05a00&hm=c943030be55cf4aa085dd4c3c0e430300eedd3274fa7c7cea5aacd1b8f81062e&
07:01 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ok i fixed the layer issue. apperantly i accidentally sent in the entire layer as a value and not just a name 😭
07:50 < bridge> <zhn> wdym sorry xd
08:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> sorry for needing to read chinese
08:12 < bridge> <zhn> :justatest:
09:19 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like you used the same UI element IDs for your new popup as for the existing layers list. You need different UI IDs for the entries of your new popup, or you'll activate both buttons at the same time.
09:21 < bridge> <hectavoxel> Yeah, I realized that pretty quickly. Now my problem is trying to align the Guide list with the Layer list
09:21 < bridge> <hectavoxel> since they're not in the same place, and it's only looking at tile layers, I need to think of a smart way to set the ID number to the layer number
09:22 < bridge> <hectavoxel> And then when I do that I need to think of a smarter way to retain the ID# for the chosen layer when any given layer moves....
09:22 < bridge> <hectavoxel> 😭
09:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> ah its just a preview
09:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> :feelsbadman:

11:07 < bridge> <0xdeen> sigh, probably too many players for me to render, so I have to retake the screenshots :/
11:10 < bridge> <meloƞ> Are they all individual screenshots? Hard work :o
11:11 < bridge> <0xdeen> yes
11:16 < bridge> <pioooooo> community skins are not supported?
11:17 < bridge> <0xfaulty> Wow, I always thought it was an automatic renderer based on map and database data 😨
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://x.com/MathMatize/status/1886083625348743285
11:25 < bridge> <0xdeen> I just added them, taking screenshots again, but some skins failed because old ddnet client can't load them

13:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> proosita is indeed legend
13:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I was talking about Rosita, who did you mean?
14:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Rosita also goes by proosita because you know pro player
14:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh now i get it ...
14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki>    fn main() -> u64 {
14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki>         return fib::<u64>(10);
14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki>     }

14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki>     }
14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat got recursive generics working and also i am progressing nicely on porting the llvm bitcode generator to rust (independent from the llvm api)
14:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html
14:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Variable-width integer (VBR) values encode values of arbitrary size, optimizing for the case where the values are small. Given a 4-bit VBR field, any 3-bit value (0 through 7) is encoded directly, with the high bit set to zero. Values larger than N-1 bits emit their bits in a series of N-1 bit chunks, where all but the last set the high bit.
14:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
14:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > For example, the value 30 (0x1E) is encoded as 62 (0b0011’1110) when emitted as a vbr4 value. The first set of four bits starting from the least significant indicates the value 6 (110) with a continuation piece (indicated by a high bit of 1). The next set of four bits indicates a value of 24 (011 << 3) with no continuation. The sum (6+24) yields the value 30.
14:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> teeworlds vibes
14:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> what if u pass a string there
14:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
14:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> no strings yet
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> but yeah i am missing traits and trait bounds
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> nobody made rust in 1 week
14:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
14:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> u will be the first one
14:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I saw the issue that it was stuck in a loop, wanted to fix it but in the end didn't find a branch where generics were xd
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's not a valid code in rust, right?
14:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> ofc not
14:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it would need trait bounds for comparison and subtraction
14:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> but this works in rust
14:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> 
14:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> ```rs
14:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> pub fn fib<T: Copy + Add<i32> + PartialOrd<i32> + Sub<i32, Output = T> + Add<Output = T>>(
14:59 < bridge> <kollpotato>     n: T,
14:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> ) -> T {
14:59 < bridge> <kollpotato>     if n < 2 {
14:59 < bridge> <kollpotato>         return n;
14:59 < bridge> <kollpotato>     }
14:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> 
14:59 < bridge> <kollpotato>     return fib::<T>(n - 1) + fib::<T>(n - 2);
14:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> }
14:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> ```
14:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> :justatest:
14:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> dont kill me rustaceans
15:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> but this works in rust
15:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> 
15:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> ```rs
15:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> pub fn fib<T: Copy + PartialOrd<i32> + Sub<i32, Output = T> + Add<Output = T>>(
15:00 < bridge> <kollpotato>     n: T,
15:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> ) -> T {
15:00 < bridge> <kollpotato>     if n < 2 {
15:00 < bridge> <kollpotato>         return n;
15:00 < bridge> <kollpotato>     }
15:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> 
15:00 < bridge> <kollpotato>     return fib::<T>(n - 1) + fib::<T>(n - 2);
15:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> }
15:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> ```
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> in rust u would use num_traits
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think it was long long time ago in std
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> but they decided better not
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://docs.rs/num-traits/latest/num_traits/trait.Num.html
15:10 < bridge> <rosita7660> Eheh 😁
15:11 < bridge> <pioooooo> @tsfreddie multiview doesn't zoom on nightly, is that possibly related to your change to spec zoom

22:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> here is why i dont like auto
22:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would like to store this in a instance variable and struggle to define the type ``auto pServerLogger = std::make_shared<CServerLogger>(pServer);``
22:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> clang helps a lot its ``std::shared_ptr<CServerLogger>`` but still imagine not having clang and not knowing shared ptrs
22:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> black magic
22:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``auto`` is worse than ``goto`` change my mind
22:57 < bridge> <kebscs> make_shared = shared_ptr make_unique = unique_ptr, self explainatory
