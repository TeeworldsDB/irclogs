11:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> who in charge of ddnet bot ?
11:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> jao
12:12 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> jao botter
13:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Marci> hi, how can I change jetpack sound on my server, so it's the hook retract sound instead of gun shoot sound?
13:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Marci> do i have to change in code or is it a setting
13:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Skizer> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
14:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> could just ask me :p i think you found that on my server
14:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> code
14:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Marci> okey thanks ðŸ˜„ but how come it's not the default when I compile your server?
14:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because I programmed it in a way that there is a setting for it
15:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> I would like to have 2 seperate displays for teleporter in the editor, 1x for normal tele and 1x for cp teleporter. Currently both use the same display and overlap, if the map is large you always have to look for yourself which number you have and which not
15:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> Also, it would be cool to have an 'undo' button. Sometimes it would be very very helpful to just undo the last step.
15:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> And it would also be cool that if you change the layer size of the game, all the layers in the map will adjust
17:41 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> there is undo in the editor
17:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> u mean cl_editorundo?
17:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> i need a button in the editor for this
17:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hi, killing while super on server crashes me for some reason
17:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> crashes server*
17:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> can anyone reproduce?
18:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, I have about an hour today, does anyone need anything done?
18:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll review #3772
18:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3772
18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> oooo
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I know something that has been waiting for a long time. I'll do the ban reasons for global_ban's
18:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> the ban reason was working after you introduced the function
18:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> why was it changed anyway
18:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it was always just the name of the guy
18:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> no it wasn't
18:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> im pretty sure we used the reason field as ban reason
18:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nah it was always like its now
18:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ðŸ¤¨
18:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @murpi I made the thing, I'm fairly certain it never worked ðŸ˜„

18:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so yeah
18:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> possible that it crashes
20:07 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> @Learath2 any chance I can book your next free hours to look into getting the client updated to 0.7 ?
20:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> chillerdragon: I only have free hours in single hour increments, I'd rather not waste them on things that are impossible
20:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> how did this ping me even tho my name isn't anywhere mentioned?
20:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/843557241080643614/unknown.png
20:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i doubt updating would be a good idea, maybe additionally support 0.7 protocol
20:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> ChillerDragon: hey honey
20:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what is ur ingame name
20:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> what server and did you have a dummy on?
20:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i remember some bugs with dummy and mentions
20:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> nothing that matches what was said lol
20:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> ger1 and i just connected my dumy
20:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> ger1 and i just connected my dummy
20:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that wont help tho, do u have a demo on?

21:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @heinrich5991 is there any working https master server rn?
21:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, the default one should work
21:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://master1.ddnet.tw/ddnet/15/servers.json
21:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (just delete any serverlist_urls.cfg and you should be fine)
21:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> uh @heinrich5991 sorry, I was going to review your PR today but I instead worked on the global_ban thing, it took longer than I thought :/
21:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't worry. thanks for working on the global bans ðŸ™‚
21:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar âœª
21:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ty
21:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I also forgot to eat in the meanwhile
21:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so I'm slowly starving
21:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> defs slower than ur server ðŸ˜„
21:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> needs a few ms more to fetch the list
21:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wdym, fetch the list?
21:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar âœª http request is slower? or the serverlist takes longer to update?
21:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 2nd
21:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it takes longer until i see the server list in the browser
21:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmm
21:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's 1st for me
21:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyway
21:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's now behind cloudflare. that makes it slower? ðŸ˜¦
21:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, its not alot, but its noticable if u used the other before
21:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the other was instant, this is like half a second maybe even less
21:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok maybe around 100-200ms
21:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> hard to tell with eyes xD
21:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> take a video and count frames
21:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i can try
21:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah around 100ms
21:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but dont have video of the old list to compare
21:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can use https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/temp/servers-2021-05-14T17%3A34%3A27%2B02%3A00.json as a benchmark
21:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah looks instant
21:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in the ddnet.tw one i see the "fetching whatever text it says" for these 100ms
21:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but as said not horrible, just notiacble if u used to the heinrich.de one
21:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> guess we can add a second server not behind cloudflare for the non-ddos times
21:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Anyone got an idea about low fps with a Radeon GPU? https://steamcommunity.com/id/572194324/recommended/412220?tscn=1621012892
21:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, just tell ppl with problems to use gfx_opengl_major 1
21:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its either just restarting windows, which helps in 50% of cases
21:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or drivers
21:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or update windows
21:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> one even said the steam version only is low fps, the one from website is fine
21:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> one used desktop fullscreen to get smooth fps also
21:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and if nothing helps there is still gl to dx12 xD
21:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe this is overkill, but what about sending deltas instead of sending the full doc on a 2nd request, maybe the server can cache the deltas for some mins
21:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
21:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess this is useless for 600 servers
21:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> would be hard to cache with cloudflare etc then
21:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what about using a websocket connection
21:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki this probably wouldn't solve the latency problem
21:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and too much complexitry
21:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> once connected it doesnt have delay?
21:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. what do you want to solve here?
21:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it would add more latency probably ðŸ˜„
21:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
21:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok nvm
21:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was just having random thoughts about the latency thing
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for me the latency is *much* lower with https master server
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess its not a problem then
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this doesnt apply here right https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/dns-prefetch ?
21:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen Jupstar was comparing my server with cloudflare's
21:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >

21:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ‘€
21:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im gonna test this http thing
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does it need a cmake flag?
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess not
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki if you click refresh twice, you already have a connection to the https server open
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sometimes it feels like 100ms and sometimes like 200
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its rly instant
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dns-prefetch wouldn't help, that's HTML
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like it
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> specially useful for internet tab
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tho
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ASI shows yellowish orange
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it should be read
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> red*
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the worst ping is yellow which doesnt feel like it would be bad xd
21:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's an optional TODO, provide ping estimates between the 7 regions, i.e. a 7x7 ping matrix. excluding the diagonal and assuming symmetry, those are 24 pings we need
21:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
21:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like a interesting problem to solve
22:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen  https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3772#issuecomment-841337811
22:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this can be interesting for the future,  idk how the json looks but i guess it can make for good graphs

22:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> samsung putting the stacks of cash
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) on Thursday raised its planned investment in non-memory chips to 171 trillion won ($151 billion) through 2030, joining a rush of firms ramping up investments amid a global semiconductor shortage.
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Countries have also been working to bolster chip supply chains as the chip shortage affects production in industries such as autos. South Korea on Thursday said it would offer bigger tax breaks plus 1 trillion won ($883 million) in loans for its local chip industry.
22:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 where does the latency come from btw?
22:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, haven't tried to measure
22:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's cloudflare in front of an nginx serving a static file
22:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> usa person said the cloudflare often doesnt even load, or takes alot of time
22:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i guess we'll have mirrors anyway?
22:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah but also had it with heinrichs one apparently
22:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> cloudflare should be the one mirroring the file around the world
23:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for me the first start takes long
23:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> after i have it once its fast as i said
23:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ~100ms
23:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar âœª in the client?
23:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i send the person a client with https master servers yeah
23:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'll ask the person to test it a bit, maybe it was also just the first connect or smth
23:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno how fast cloudflare is mirroring
23:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if its instnat or smth
23:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but why is the first connect so slow ðŸ˜¦
23:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, is it not for u?
23:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> when i close client and start its not really fast
23:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe half a second this time actually
23:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe only i u didnt connect for longer time
23:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> now its pretty instant for me too
23:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, I start in the main menu ^^ maybe that's why I didn't see the difference
23:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but started when i first wrote and was slow, and had this like 3 times today already ðŸ˜„
23:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'll give more feedback the days when others also test it
23:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'll just ask them if they had any trouble
