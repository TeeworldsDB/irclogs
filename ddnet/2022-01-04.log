00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i have a pretty strange feature request: i wont bother with github if no one likes this idea but
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> 
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> imagine you join team and ur speedrunning a map with someone, and the map sucks so u have to reset a lot. wouldn't it be nice if you could set one tee to always have strong after they kill even if the other tee lived longer? that way any player can kill to reset the run and it wont change the order of strong/weak for runs that depend on a specific order
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i hate having to make sure i or the other player kills, and then i have to wait for the other player to kill if the order is screwed up and i need strong
04:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> or just fix strong/weak bug :YEP:
04:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> player who kills gets strong
04:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> >that way any player can kill to reset the run and it wont change the order of strong/weak for runs that depend on a specific order
04:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> strong player always kill = no problem xd
04:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like on dummy maps, the main always kills -> instant start
04:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i rq idea
04:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
04:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> would be nice to decide to reset as weak but w/e
04:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, its hard to do anyways since in > 2 player teams u have weak on some and strong on others
04:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how would u handle such a case?
04:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and i everyone explicitly tells on which player to have weak/strong, it might not work with the results of other players
04:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think such a command is neither  very useful at all nor nice to implement
04:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i say just remove weak
04:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> remove strong
04:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Never, some maps rely on it + u know about physics change in tw
04:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> /ddrace
04:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> remove those map
04:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> problem solved
04:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> remove those maps
04:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> could still impact runs on other maps
04:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well the some maps rely on it is bad argument cus u can easily just edit them
04:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but the physics change ig
04:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> kinda sucks its like that especially for something that in my opinion is an annoying feature
04:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> We could of course add a map setting to give everyone strong
04:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have such a thing in my mod
04:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because such setting can only affect newly created maps
04:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but still would suck for other maps and then everything is weird because it differs from map to map probably
04:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think a map setting with strong for everyone would be better than nothing
04:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i feel the same, especially for driving
04:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> map setting for /spec enabled is also similar to it
04:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just a little less straightforward
04:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
04:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if you'd like i can create a pr tomorrow
04:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it would fuck up prediction tho, so probably that has to be taken care of first
04:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> annoying anyways, some servers use weak, some dont, the client doesnt know about that tho and assumes its always there
04:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i dont get it why not every map has /spec
04:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> some concider it a cheat maybe
04:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> its already in the game
04:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> cheat or not
04:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> its already here
04:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea, but do u need it in every map?
04:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u can do shotgun cheats on some maps
04:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not sure
04:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> with /spec
04:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> also that
04:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> idk
04:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> its nice for when you need to hammerfly good
04:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> shotgun bug imo should be fixed too
04:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> ye since ranks with it got removed
04:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> someone should also fix that another shotgun bug that makes the sg fly annoying cuz the laser doesnt appear sometimes
04:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> just give everyone strong and add /weak
04:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nice idea, but still affects other ranks
04:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> it will only make them faster right
04:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> unfair for old ranks, i mean
04:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> at this points we need ddnet 2
04:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> at this point we need ddnet 2
04:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if the old ranks are not such a big problem, then a command to actually swap as you like would be the best solution i think
04:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yeah probably
04:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> f4
04:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> weak best
04:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> Colo-Colo:
04:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> swap strong and weak still keeps weak nobo
04:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> Souly:
04:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> both strong sux
04:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> f3
04:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> what about both weak
04:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> not
04:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> both strong best
04:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> nobody cares about reverse speedfly
04:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
04:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> do 2long without strong
04:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> impossible part
04:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> not
04:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> pirofly should be banned
04:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u just have to hook a little later
05:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> ye but its impossible
05:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> way easier with weak
05:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i want sv_weak as a setting
05:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> so new maps can disable it
05:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like in fddrace :p
05:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> but yours is broken
05:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not at all
05:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> idk on bombay it shows the stronghook icon on all tees
05:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> really?
05:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> ye
05:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> isnt that what it should do
05:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> at least last time i checked it was like that but cant confirm cuz im banned
05:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i wonder how tho
05:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because the client shouldnt know about all-strong
05:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> idk mybe send the ids below
05:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> but i think that all players had weakhook id 0 above heads too
05:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :ww:
05:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> so its rather not that
05:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea, then its probably that, thought so too
05:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> @fokkonaut add /eyeemote to f-ddrace or i ban u
05:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> would it be a good idea to have an option to be able to display a selected amount of the shown debug hud elements at all times?

14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, don't extract them
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> can you stream them out of the tar.zstd files directly?
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i thought using the with open it closes the files right?

14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the whole thing is a bit awkward with this huge number of json files

14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my tmp
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is too small
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz i never thought i would use too much when creating the partitions xd
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder if i can create a tempdir outside of /tmp
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i should buy another ssd
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Don't extract it to a filesystem at all if possible
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I have updated 15.8.1 sources again, sorry
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it will be a bit weird for ppl that already updated
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> import tarfile
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most aur helpers ask you if u want to clean build
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and use zstdcat into tarfile I guess

14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> used*
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh shit
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my system started swapping
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill try to do it in pure rust
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know that much python
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Hi, I don't know where to write any request but it would be great to have hats as accessories so hats wouldn't be part of the skin anymore and you could wear them with any skins at your convenience
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> You wouldn't have to remake every single skins to add a Christmas hat for example
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not every hat fits on every skin tho xd
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Most skins are standardized
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> So I think it wouldn't be a problem? D:
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> You could choose to wear one or not and people who possess the hat skin could see it just like skins
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This would be nice, but we probably should do it in context of implementing 0.7 type of modular skins
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Would 0.6 skins still work ?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Or will we have to dismantle them to pieces ?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We'd have to make 0.6 skins work aswell, it'd be an insane endeavour to chop up old skins
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> I like the idea of having body parts but I think 0.7 skins are terrible, ugly, doesn't even have the same shape anymore
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> But maybe that's only me ðŸ˜„
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I don't remember them being too disfigured
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> If you could put both tees side by side you'd see the gap in matter of styles
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> true
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> but that's a really cool idea
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I've had tee hats as an idea in my head for a while. Like, one extra body layer over the eyes so that the eyes dont clip over them. It's make tee skins wearing helmets really cool as well.
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I've had tee hats as an idea in my head for a while. Like, one extra body layer over the eyes so that the eyes dont clip over them. It'd make tee skins wearing helmets really cool as well.
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> ðŸ˜„
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> I hope someone can and is devoted to code it
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iydrss> heyyo
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iydrss> where located ranks for servers?
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> I think France or Germany
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iydrss> this is ?
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <iydrss> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/927973186396635196/unknown.png
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> there aren't really any i would ssy
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> just the feet placement makes it weird
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> and overally resolution is highier
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> colors are different
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> coala is actually a koala in 0.7
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> So i might not be able to code, but I sure know what I would do if I could change the current skin template.
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I doubt this entire thing would become the new standard, but it gives nice dimensions for what *could* happen if we added onto tees.
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Also yes the new emotion placement is purely just an idea but I would imagine it'd replace the :tear::zzzz::mmm: expression (which is simply squashing the face assets)
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> The theme of the emotion would be eyes closed, neutral expression
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> 
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i also added some concept sketches for how these would be implemented, and just a tiny idea for if everyone agrees to add this emotion idea

18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> So i might not be able to code, but I sure know what I would do if I could change the current skin template.
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I doubt this entire thing would become the new standard, but it gives nice dimensions for what *could* happen if we added onto tees, and used these ideas in separate templates.
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Also yes the new emotion placement is purely just an idea but I would imagine it'd replace the :tear::zzzz::mmm: expression (which is simply squashing the face assets)

18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ah nice tail idea ðŸ˜„
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> I think it shouldn't be included in the skin.png
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> So it can be used just like a skin
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Yeah, that's true.
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Though, there should be a way to pair certain hats and skins, since some designers would probably make a hat for a certain skin, whicb wouldn't work for any other.

18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> I think it would be cool to let people pick their hat not to worry if it fits or not
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I guess.
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 perhaps a bug in http2/3 code in apple's curl?
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you force it to use http1.1?
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki you can try the streaming API of https://docs.rs/tar/0.4.38/tar/
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it probably allows you to read the tar files without extracting them
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> TIL about WTF-8 https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wobbly transformation format ðŸ˜‰
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sounds funny
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye i wanted to use tar and <https://docs.rs/crate/zstd/0.9.0+zstd.1.5.0>
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill continue tomorrow
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds good
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should be possible to do in a streaming way
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> streaming file by file or even streaming json?
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know if serde can do that
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> file by file
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a single file is ~400KB, you can load that into memory ^^
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye xD
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> although loading the whole serverinfos just to count players is probably still wasteful and takes a lot longer than trying to extract the player count manually
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i wanted to expand it further with more data
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tho idk what data to graph
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah yea
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> gametype distribution by player count
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if the http could report skins and more stuff would be cool
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> working on it ^^
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the most famouns skin on a given minute
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> famous*
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I actually have a POC https masterserver, but it still needs all the details ^^
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robin720> Hi, idk if it is a bug in code or something but whenever i press mouse1 which may fire instantly, it has a few milisecs delay. Could you please check if you didnt do any mistake in coding for version on mac? It has been happening since last update
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robin720> And it happens even on my own server and only with fire so it should not be high ping
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> About the dead eyes being replaced with the closed eyes, it's a nice touch and I would approve that change
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> About the whole concept, similar to 0.7, you should be able to pick them up separately, not including them in every single skin, that would require... too much time to rework.
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :justatest:
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> what the fuck-8
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe ddnet needs barrels? ðŸ˜› https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMYEE8lvlvA
