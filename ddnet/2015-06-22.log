03:31 <@deen> android client should look much nicer now
07:44 < eeeee> https://github.com/eeeee/ddnet/commit/b8e40a244af4e242dc568aa34854c5754c75a39a
07:44 < eeeee> didnt test it much yet, but seemed to work with both vanilla and ddnet client (with security tokens)
07:45 < eeeee> looks kinda weird too, shows you a gray screen briefly and spams console with errors
07:46 < eeeee> hopefully i'll have time next weekend to finish it up
07:54 < eeeee> not sure if i need to explain but it just sends empty snapshots with security token in the gametick field to whoever wants to connect (without reserving any slots) and waits until they reply with the ACK to the right gametick (security token)
07:54 < eeeee> after that an actual slot is reserved and the connection is reset and proceeds normally
08:19 <@EastByte> eeeee: wow, it works with the vanilla client right?
08:28 <@EastByte> oh well didn't read
10:35 <@EastByte> eeeee: it's pretty awesome
10:35 <@EastByte> but I noticed two things:
10:36 <@EastByte> 1. the NETMSG_INFO is only sent on connect and therefor completly lost, so we don't have client version+password
10:37 <@EastByte> 2. SNAPEMPTY can cause a client crash when no map is loaded (which is the case)
10:38 <@EastByte> I already worked out a fix by sending a mapchange+con_ready directly after NET_CTRLMSG_CONNECTACCEPT
10:39 <@EastByte> CServer needs to be modified aswell (sending another mapchange to the real map)
10:41 <@EastByte> a pre mapchange also fixes the prediction error messages + gray screen
10:49 <@deen> I added the video of the (unfortunately short) livestream because I found it pretty amusing to listen to Hallowed & Aoe: http://ddnet.tw/tournaments/41/
10:49 <@EastByte> you recorded it?
10:49 <@deen> Hallowed did
10:49 <@EastByte> oh its on yt
10:49 <@deen> well, i put it on YT^^
10:49 <@deen> But I asked him before if it's ok
10:49 <@EastByte> oh...
10:50 <@deen> eeeee: sounds great
10:51 <@deen> i noticed that reserved slots can still be taken up by people just connecting, which of course happens all the time^^
10:51 <@EastByte> haha
10:51 < ochristi> aoe is fun
10:52 <@EastByte> and hallowed's 8th class english... as he said
10:56 <@deen> and of course our old DDoSer insulting Hallowed in the chat, and then Hallowed adds him as a friend instead of muting him, haha
10:57 <@EastByte> hallowed mentioned it was on purpose^^
10:57 <@deen> oh
10:57 <@EastByte> but I guess it was a lie
10:59 <@EastByte> https://youtu.be/u6ITe4Z1oHw?t=6m
11:01 < eeeee> does the pre mapchange work if the client doesn't have the map downloaded?
11:02 <@EastByte> well I used dm1
11:04 <@EastByte> eeeee: this is what I did https://gist.github.com/east/f765b71a6a935342ad57
11:06 < eeeee> yeah i tried dm1 as well but i feared of other crazy shit happening on non-standard maps
11:07 < eeeee> well anyway would be great if you can figure it out
11:08 < eeeee> i have to sleep unfortunately
11:08 <@EastByte> do you mean using the real map?
11:08 <@EastByte> instead of dm1
11:08 < eeeee> yeah, i'm not sure what would happen if client starts http download or something
11:09 <@EastByte> hm could be problematic
11:09 <@EastByte> we'll also need to modify the ddnet client
11:10 <@EastByte> e.g. to receive the client version
11:10 <@EastByte> I'll check that out, have a nice sleep eeeee :>
11:10 < eeeee> k thx
11:10 <@deen> good night eeeee, thanks for the work =)
11:11 < eeeee> maybe i'll dream up some way to force another NETMSG_INFO
11:11 <@EastByte> haha sure
11:12 <@EastByte> but I think this feature should rather be on demand instead of permanent
11:12 <@EastByte> I'm smelling a lot of client bugs
12:12 < Nimda> Solo Future by Gridwyn just released on Solo at 2015-06-22 12:08
12:46 <@EastByte> the result can only be true (1) or false (0) I think?
12:59 <@deen> result of what?
12:59 <@EastByte> of (!m_pPlayer->m_ClientVersion)
12:59 <@deen> i lost a few lines, had no internet for half an hour^^
13:00 <@EastByte> oh
13:00 <@EastByte> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L1218
13:00 <@EastByte> I don't understand the purpose of that line
13:01 <@deen> me neither, looks wrong
13:02 <@EastByte> I noticed it because of a warning in eeeee's repo
13:02 <@EastByte> there it is just !m_pPlayer->m_ClientVersion >= VERSION_DDRACE
13:04 <@EastByte> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/d8533eea
13:04 <@EastByte> deen: it's your fault :P
13:04 <@EastByte> it was !m_pPlayer->m_IsUsingDDRaceClient before
13:04 <@deen> ah, so that's a workaround to show checkpoint diffs in non-ddrace client
13:05 <@deen> then that code even works, but of course can be rewritten nicer
13:05 <@EastByte> so it was disabled the whole time?
13:05 <@deen> no, it should be fine
13:05 <@deen> i think?
13:05 <@deen> it's true when you have vanilla client
13:06 <@deen> Like this:
13:06 <@EastByte> well it is, but what's the not operator for?

13:06 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 4f32331 def: Clean up code a bit
13:06 <@deen> that should do the exact same thing
13:07 <@deen> the not operator just inverts it, so if you have vanilla it's 1, otherwise 0
13:07 <@deen> and VERSION_DDRACE is 1, so that works^^
13:07 <@EastByte> oh
13:07 <@EastByte> so clientversion 0 is vanilla?
13:07 <@deen> yes
13:08 <@EastByte> k

13:08 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/engine/shared/protocol.h#L100-L109
13:08 <@EastByte> but you cannot simply logical invert a version number xd
13:11 <@EastByte> deen: btw. it's possible to hide the loadingscreen on connect serverside
13:11 <@deen> yes, the type system should prevent that^^
13:12 <@EastByte> I guess it's even possible to reduce the connecting time < 0.5 sec
13:14 <@deen> nice

17:31 < Savander> hi
17:36 < Savander> i just thought about race server and it'll be similar to "solo" server but in different category of maps
17:36 < Savander> without feature from ddrace like freeze
17:37 < Savander> generally race servers, using only grenades
17:37 < Savander> tons of maps with different gameplay.
17:39 < Savander> lol
17:39 < Savander> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ9qsTI0KWk
17:40 < Savander> look at this map
17:40 < Savander> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8KI_pRXF1U
17:40 < Savander> typical race, but very difficult
17:41 < Savander> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtM1BmU5O44
17:47 < o_be_one> hi all :)
17:47 < Savander> hi :))
17:57 <@EastByte> hm, I'm the worst racer
17:58 < Savander> i have small collection
17:58 < Savander> of race map :P
18:00 < Learath2> cant be worse then me
18:27 < BeaR_> hey (:
18:30 < Savander> hey 
18:33 < Savander> it's possible to don't reset bullets while kill?
18:34 <@EastByte> yes it's possible
18:34 < Savander> how?
18:34 < Savander> i can't found a command
18:35 <@EastByte> it requires some modification I guess
18:35 < Savander> that's i know
18:35 < Savander> it works on simply race
18:35 < Savander> but i thought, i can setup it on ddnet too
18:35 < Savander> :/
18:35 < Savander> it should be on race
18:37 <@EastByte> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/game/server/entities/projectile.cpp#L148
18:37 < Savander> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lo6A5ntMPg
18:37 < Savander> for this
18:40 <@EastByte> well it's not easy to fix
18:40 <@EastByte> since there are teams in ddrace
18:40 < Savander> :/
18:40 <@EastByte> pOwnerChar->Team() is accessed
18:42 <@EastByte> nevertheless, abusing selfkill as teleport cheat is simply wrong^^
18:42 < Savander> it's race mate :D
18:42 <@EastByte> would you do that in reallife?
18:43 < Savander> nope, but all racers did it
18:43 < Savander> and will do on "race"
18:43 <@EastByte> yes it's probably a feature now
18:43 <@EastByte> like in ddrace maps all kind of bugabuse
18:44 < Savander> so, you think
18:44 < Savander> we should implement it yeS?
18:44 < Savander> we shouldnt*
18:44 <@EastByte> if we want to implement vanilla race, yes
18:45 < Savander> ddrace have a lot of usefull features (64 slots, pause etc)
18:45 < Savander> race don't have it, and it's too much work to implement it
18:45 < Savander> (fast_download too)

19:17 < BeaR_> new map looks cute (:
19:59 <@deen> yep, iMTG maps always look nice
20:07 <@EastByte> and again I failed because I was too lazy to look through the part first
22:54 < laxa> perm banned from TS boss and kerem
22:55 < laxa> dunno those guys, but I have no time to deal with problems right now
23:06 <@deen> what problems?

23:29 < Savander> haha
