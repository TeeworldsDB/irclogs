17:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 got a fix for the beep issue already? @Silex has it too
17:30 <+Learath2> Oh yeah, let me try the codepage thing
17:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/fibtx4kys3o2bblv/artifacts/build64%2FDDNet-11.5-win64.zip
17:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @â™ªâ™« || @Silex  try this for the beep
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or anyone else who has the beep ðŸ˜›
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> @Learath2 seems to be working fine at least for "Ä»Ã¥Ò• | Duck"
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Silex> sadly nothing changed to me
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Silex> still the beep
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> its not about disable notifications on windows?
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> sometimes i had that too
18:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Silex> but it seems to be a little bit better
20:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @â™ªâ™« should I call you â™ªâ™« or xse or Elouan or what? ðŸ˜„
20:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> @deen Elouan is my real first name, â™ª is my nickname on ddnet â™« is my dummy and xse is an old nickname i use on irc and as username on my computers, call me whatever you'd like xD
20:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> the stylesheet needs to be added on the forum too
20:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> can someone improve /times
20:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> how?
20:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> i would like to see how many finishes are made by the tees name you enter behind
20:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> or total finishes maybe if you only write /times
20:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> https://ddnet.tw/players/
20:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> for example /times Talatin  (on the map fly to the moon) last 5 times of 48
20:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> /mapinfo has total finishes already
20:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> true but idk, i thought it was cool to see how many finishes someone has made on a map. (i was not the only one).
20:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> @deen  https://ddnet.tw/ranks/ needs the stylesheet too, wasn't able to add it here 'cause this directory isn't available on the repo
20:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> happens every 30 min
20:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and /stats/ once per night
20:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @â™ªâ™« it still flickers a bit btw :/
20:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> now on white theme instead of dark
20:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> Yeah i guess it ultimately depends on how fast that script executes, since the custom css is only tweaks for the main css i wasn't able to add either one or the other, they both have to be loaded..
20:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> It can only flickers sometimes only if the "bright" theme is active because the browser loads css-halloween after the main css and starts to display it untill the script executes. Could add "disable" directly in the html but in that case the flicker might appears sometimes only on the "dark" theme
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> I'm not sure if there's an ultimate solution, like i could make two separate "complete" css file but in that case someone with js disable won't get any css
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> did not found a better idea yet
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> having two completely separate css files would fix that yeah but i don't like the idea of "that website won't be displayed correctly you need javascript"
21:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> don't know maybe there's a better solution i'll ask people that know more than me about that i'm really not used to web devellopement
21:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> how is it possible that novashocks dummy connects on a different ip than his main tee
21:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> he has no ipv4 ip because they are rare
21:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ddnet only uses ipv4
21:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> thus his isp will route him through an 6to4 tunnel
21:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> which has multiple outgoing ipv4 addresses
21:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and he happens to get another one assigned
21:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> ah good to know
21:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> (at least that's what I guess)
21:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @â™ªâ™« Well, one solution would be to do it serverside, but I don't think we should do that. What about putting the halloween-css.css after the js, wouldn't that make the script run before it?
21:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> (I also have no idea of web dev)
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> actually maybe putting the js at the bottom and  removing the "DOMContentLoaded" eventlistenner would help, that event waits for the main page to be loaded to trigger the script, otherwise the js can't see what's after him on the page ( such as the switch )
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> i'm gonna try that
21:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> hm nope it's even worse ðŸ˜„
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I don't think I know any other way to fix the beep :(
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> since when is the sgbug (catapult) removed? :feelsbadman:
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Silex which version of windows are you using?
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> i know the reason for removal but it was funny XD
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Learath2 why don't we use IPAC as teeworlds protocol, against DoS
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Silex> @Learath2 10
21:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you start the game from cmd and use chcp 65001 before running it?
21:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Learath2 COULD BE A GOOD IDEA
21:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/515261282769829906/maxresdefault.jpg
21:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've never heard of an IPAC protocol
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> it was only an april fool: rfc1149
21:26 <+Learath2> IP over Avian Carriers :D
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/515262378892591124/6bcpzp1vxvz11.png
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> bug fixing is hard, let's go bikeshedding
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen i think what @Silex has isn't the beep so I guess that pr works
