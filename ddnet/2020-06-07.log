03:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> Is there a feature to add multiple ghosts (for example demos from other players) into one demo or even live gameplay? So that you can compare 2 or more tees
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > Your VDS is constantly reading/writing to disk, and it may be causing some performance problems with the machine overall. Please let us know if this is expected, and whether it can be resolved. 
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> From our ddnet.tw hoster. I optimized things a bit, the ddnet.tw/players script was actually writing quite a lot to disk on every request for no good reason

14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> TIL `void *ptr = bitand ptr;` is valid C++ code
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 why would you think that'd be invalid?
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It probably takes a sociopath to write bitand instead of & but other than that it looks fine
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I didn't know/realize that you could do it
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which part though? The pointer pointing to itself or the ugly alternative names?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the ugly alternative name
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, still to this date have no idea why these exist
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm guessing some odd characterset that's missing symbols
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> TIS-100 is quite fun
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> every zachtronics game is fun
