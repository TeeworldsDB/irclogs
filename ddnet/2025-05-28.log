00:06 < bridge> <kebscs> yes, map on local server for testing
00:09 < bridge> <cankick> oky
00:10 < bridge> <cankick> i think you should release it üíÄ
05:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> +
09:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is the interpolation off for those?
10:01 < bridge> <kebscs> Idk
10:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon why is roby rossbit?
10:20 < bridge> <kebscs> Don't think the interpolation is a prediction issue
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It is
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I explained it here
10:20 < bridge> <kebscs> Does it also happen with low ping?
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No, the client basically always is 1 snap behind the server
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So ping doesn't really matter
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It happens with cl_predict 0 tho
10:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Same as with demos
10:23 < bridge> <kebscs> So if it happens without prediction, I don't see why revert the pr
10:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It didn't happen with prediction on tho
10:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Also your PR introduced tele prediction for only 1 exit. I defs don't blame you here. But we should make this consistent
10:24 < bridge> <kebscs> Can't predict multiple exits bcs they're random
10:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I cannot accept that we cannot find a proper solution to tele prediction even tho we own this code, nobody can stop us from adding pseudo random tele
10:25 < bridge> <kebscs> I've linked an issue where Deen says let's do at least 1
10:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes, as said I don't blame you
10:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But srsly, what kind of solution is this?
10:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We __can__ fix it
10:25 < bridge> <kebscs> Idk, better than none at all
10:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think inconsistent is worse
10:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> psuedo random is the same as (unknown system dependent psuedo) random
10:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> A user that is not programmer does not understand why it sometimes works and sometimes not
10:26 < bridge> <kebscs> If noone wants to work on it I'd rather have consistent 1 tele
10:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> This doesn't sound consistent :dTeuMonkaW:
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'd prefer we either fix the issue or don't touch it
10:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Whatcha mean?
10:29 < bridge> <kebscs> Just opinions
10:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> Ah sry wrong message reaction. I was talking about the introduced behaviour by #10275
10:30 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10275
10:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> 10254***
10:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> Phone hard
10:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it has got squishy circruitary inside, needs hard to protect it
10:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean, ppl with 60hz probs don't see it so much. But I defs saw it after like 10 seconds of playing a teleport map
10:31 < bridge> <melo∆û> I'll try it out when I'm home on 10K fps 500 something hz on my dad's Mac :nouis:
10:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> fix: add 1000 tick/s
10:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
10:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> :dTeuMonkaW:
10:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> He has a 500hz display?
10:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Holy
10:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> Ye he smoked smth really good when buying that
10:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> :KEKW:
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I defs wonder how noticable the diff is.
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 144 vs 240 is defs noticable, but less than 60hz to 144hz.
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean makes sense, but yeah
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Will be interesting if I'd enjoy a 500hz upgrade üòÑ
10:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> I noticed a difference going down, ergo 500 down to 240
10:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
10:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> You notice the suuuuper slight delay in your mouse movement, it's weird xD
10:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I see, yeah I assume 2D stuff generally seems to profit more from higher refresh rate
10:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1377203459279032342/20250528_103418.jpg?ex=68381c2b&is=6836caab&hm=113501794aa5f94812d64116945f8fa1dc5b9be2fa92f804c67eb2b6ed802c09&
10:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> E.g. in CS2 playing with 60hz is much less worse to me than in teeworlds xD
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Probs bcs the camera view is _kinda_ fixed
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In 3D too much going on
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok I assume heavy spinners still notice it right away
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe i'm just too noob to notice üò¨
10:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What is that?
10:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lambda man?
10:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> haskell man
10:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ maybe u suck in cs and thats why you dont care about refresh rate
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean I defs notice it
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's just in teeworlds, having tearing or delay feels even worse
10:40 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> thank you
11:19 < bridge> <zhn> was trying to find original teewars topic, can't find the link i wanted. seems im gaslighting myself
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> monthly bump for #9787
11:36 < chillerbot> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9787
11:46 < bridge> <learath2> I guess that one can be merged, did you make sure the teehistorian bump is still happening?
12:12 < bridge> <kebscs> 10 year old issue that noone picked up, but we **can** predict multiple teles, so lets wait instead
12:12 < bridge> <kebscs> this community so cooked üíî
12:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 yes i go from 9 to 10 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/48b3b0e468de874fddb4647ceb37107f4a83785d/src/game/server/teehistorian.cpp#L27
12:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 you can also comment "please rebase" on my prs and my rebase bot will rebase it then you can see that there is still a historian diff
12:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> What about #1233 btw? Super old issue and furo rewrote the entire docker script a while ago.
12:19 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1233
12:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> question is what is the Dockerfile for?
12:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> #1751 wasnt reproduced in ~6 years either it seems
12:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
12:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> Maybe we should clean up issues at some point :dTeuMonkaW:
12:21 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1751
12:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> 1874 as well (I don't want to spam the bots reaction here)
12:28 < bridge> <learath2> macOS is probably not possible now, until I finish some other things, but wrapper scripts would still be nice
12:29 < bridge> <learath2> The Dockerfile is supposed to be an "easy" way to build ddnet for linux and windows. My very original goal with it was to completely automate the release process in a reproducible manner
12:31 < bridge> <learath2> did anyone even try reproducing it? give it a go, if it doesn't happen I can close it
12:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki I made a cool macro which allows defining variants for different opcodes and their asssembly representation for my new ir :poggers2: (there's still a lot of copy pasting tho :\)
12:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```rust
12:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> opcodes! {
12:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     Mov8rr = "mov {dest}, {src}", (dest = r8, src = r8);

12:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
13:40 < bridge> <Assa> @gorp_tw friendly reminder
14:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 well if you want the dockerfile to work it should be added to the CI i guess
14:32 < bridge> <learath2> I probably wouldn't want that running every single time. CI is already sloooooooow
14:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> how hard would it be to make a btree+ memory mapped key value store
14:41 < bridge> <learath2> Sounds like something someone would have already made üòõ
14:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes, in C https://github.com/erthink/libmdbx
14:46 < bridge> <learath2> Upon thinking about it a little, it shouldn't really be too hard to roughly implement one. Optimizing it idk
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 this one uses a lot of "unlikely" sprinkled at ifs
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> so its def optimized on purpose
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> #define likely(x)       __builtin_expect(!!(x), 1)
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> #define unlikely(x)     __builtin_expect(!!(x), 0)
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> if (unlikely(fd < 0))
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> {
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki>     /* Do something */
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
14:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
14:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> could we use [[unlikely]] in ddnet

14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks does it change if the seed of tele is decided at the start of a run?
14:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> Full prediction, teleporters are pseudo random, the ~~server~~ start tick is the seed
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's good that you picked this issue, and i support it by asking maintainers to give a final opinion on how we want to approach tele prediction.
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I don't feel like this issue got major attention yet from all maintainers, so I tagged them all, and if they ignore this, then they simply have no opionion I guess.
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I support prediction for everything, I personally just feel like just adding a half backed prediction is not much better then none at all. But if other maintainers say otherwise so be it.
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So please don't give up just because I am rather strict in this case
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah the exact implementation detail doesn't matter, it's more about using a non random seed
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> the thing i want the most: make replay bots as hard as possible to do
14:56 < bridge> <learath2> Eh, idk if we have much use for it. Especially on modern hardware the branch predictor is almost as good as us
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> so my question is: does pseudo random make it easier?
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think no, e.g. with a random seed it's still almost impossible, except if you literally do the TAS on the game server you are on
14:57 < bridge> <learath2> Making it predictable in anyway will make replay bots easier definitely
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But with any non predefined seed replay bots should have no chance
14:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah, but maybe there is a way that makes it annoying
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would use some combination of server random seed + start seed or smth
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But they cannot predict stuff like the server tick (not easily at least), or even a real random seed
14:58 < bridge> <kebscs> I get you
14:58 < bridge> <learath2> Well we have to send the real random seed to the client. No? At which point now they can predict it
14:59 < bridge> <kebscs> but i mean that this game should move forward even a little bit
14:59 < bridge> <kebscs> 10 year old issues are just bad
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Since he said "replay" bot i assume it's pre recorded
14:59 < bridge> <learath2> None of the current tas bots are suited for this kind of thing btw. They are all very dumb input replayers
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> well its not like the dev is dead. its just ppl volunteer and tackle issues they want
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> cant blame anyone
15:00 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly I think it's fine to make it easily predictable
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> A bot can already just observe the outcome of the teleport and react accordingly if it wants. I'll write my opinion on the issue
15:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> im also in favour of adding prediction to everything
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> are weapons predicted? like sg and such
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guessy e
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> freeze is missing
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'd like to have that too, since I play lot of solo xd
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> wdym by freeze pred
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> u dont move like u used to
15:02 < bridge> <kebscs> i think it correctly stops you, just the ninja skin isnt applied
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So that u instant freeze when u touch freeze client side
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> back in old days u moved and teleported back
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> when frozen
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> hm
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah maybe just visual
15:03 < bridge> <kebscs> but sounds and particles should be predicted too, but arent rn
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> is it predicted if a player holds the fire button?
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> that should be predictable as well xd
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> DDNet: Oracle edition
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> || made in java ||
15:05 < bridge> <kebscs> laser/hammer unfreeze is predicted so it works
15:06 < bridge> <kebscs> right now only teleports and freeze lasers arent predicted

17:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> i'm not familiar with a mod called zahar8350
17:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
17:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> what server did this happen on?
17:06 < bridge> <always> i think thats his nickname
17:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> there's already a person with that exact username in this discord, and they haven't sent a single message
17:06 < bridge> <melo∆û> from the text i thought it said the moderator's nickname is zahar8350 because he called himself "Nice" - maybe language barrier ._.

19:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's glorious
19:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> of course "greater than or equal" is "not less than"
19:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's arguably just as reasonable of a way of expressing the relation as the common way, if not even more so
20:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> think of how common the phrases "no more than" and "no less than" are
20:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and you wouldn't expect to hear "greater than or equal to" in everyday speech
20:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you use atleast or atmost
20:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but english is a speaking language not a
20:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> progarmming languaage
20:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and theres no point beinginventive in notation of operators
20:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and theres no point being inventive in symbols of operators
20:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> depending on the age of the language it is ... understandbale
20:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it is that old
20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> why not
20:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> natural made horrors beyond your comprehension:

20:48 < bridge> <Ewan> is it your first time hearing about mumps
22:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> no
22:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> at least not the desease
22:23 < bridge> <Ewan> im confused
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hello confused haha so funny
22:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when u coding, is your inner monologue more like full sentences, or more like "mhh yeah, this shit, mhh, bit of this"
22:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> It's full sentences but not normally related to what I'm typing
22:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Well sometimes now I don't bother internally articulating my thoughts
22:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I know what I'm thinking I don't need to make it english
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I code with emotions
22:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> That's probably very bug prone
22:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Passionately overflowing with user input
23:30 < bridge> <kebscs> ^ why build failed?
23:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Makes no sense to me, I reran with whatever the github verbose option does, let's see
