00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Is that related to physics?
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> broken round rules
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> I think yes, I sent only one example from code
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> collision.cpp -> CTRL+F ->  "= clamp((int)"
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Demo viewer now has tooltips, in regards of Chairn!

06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Toggle keyboard shortcuts```
07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> whoever made that clamp is not so much of a genius, you could've already perform rounding onto the parameters of the function itself
07:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> and rounding should always take the closest whole number, idk if round_to_int is a custom function or not
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:ISS_(Impulsive_Save_Syndrome)
07:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah can the editor like, **HAVE** ctrl+s as save?
07:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> or if it does can it notify me when it DID save?
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it should, when the screen stops lagging it‚Äòs done üòÖ
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I think we should take more advantage of the `1 new mention` function in the editor, to communicate a bit more. 
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Like, saying if you saved a map, or something else.
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Like I just found out from this convo that ctrl + s worked.
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Exactly
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i always wondered- what's else will be added into ddnet next, if anything's planned?
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012625428541866054/unknown.png
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I assume people have to make the things that are going to be in the next version idk how much planning you can have
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I‚Äòm not using the ddnet next release, not sure what it‚Äòs for
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I can only assume version 17.0, but that is a long ways from happening.
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> lol intended lags
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> is the appdata folder on linux `~/.ddnet/` or still `~/.teeworlds/`?
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> –Ω—É –Ω–∞–π–¥–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ –≤ —Å—É—Ä—Å–∞—Ö –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ –≥–¥–µ –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è `inp_mousesens` –∏ –ø–æ–º–µ–Ω—è–π —Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å–µ —á–∏—Å–ª–æ–≤–æ–µ –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ –∫–∞–∫–æ–µ —Ç–µ–±–µ –¥—É—à–µ —É–≥–æ–¥–Ω–æ, —è –Ω–µ –¥—É–º–∞—é, —á—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ —Ç–µ–±–µ —Å–∏–ª—å–Ω–æ –ø–æ–º–æ–∂–µ—Ç, –Ω–æ –ª–∞–¥–Ω–æ
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> custom, its literally `(int)(x + 0.5)`
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> casting doesn't do any rounding check
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> imagine it just like removing the .xx
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> so that's why (int)4.9 == 4
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> and round_to_int is right
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> I can't find it?
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012657502237765683/unknown.png
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> looks like you play on phone
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> yeah, that's nice but before I could filter out for example everything over 100 ping, and then sort by number of players to see where I can find people to play with. I can scroll past stuff, just it seems weird that there's this downgrade.
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> yeah, that's nice but before I could filter out for example everything over 100 ping, and then sort by number of players to see where I can find people to play with. I can scroll past stuff so it's not a big deal, just it seems weird that there's this downgrade.
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is a compromise we had to make. We traded the convenience of that for more safety against ddos. Malicious hosters were using the fact that clients ping every server to collect ips. Then they used these ips to either ddos servers with spoofing or targetted players in runs specifically
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Devs bad, they remove stuff
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We did it just to annoy people because we are the prime evil
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @ShaneR old
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012668673938423858/Untitled-2022-08-22-11401.png
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> and what's new now (ig it works like that)
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012668738501357598/Untitled-2022-08-22-1141.png
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> no IP leakage anymore
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> (if anyone ask what I've used, it's excalidraw, pretty cool for that)
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I think server instead sends everything while registering, but idk about that
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ùïµùñîùñäùñë> How players get the latency of the servers
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you get it only when you've joined it
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> afaik it gets cached
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ùïµùñîùñäùñë> so it's not the real ping?
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ùïµùñîùñäùñë> on the server browser
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it is
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> only yuo get that ping if you joined the server
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> overwise you get the region (EUR, etc.., can be wrong but people will correct me in case)
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ùïµùñîùñäùñë> Yes ok but it's the old cached ping not the current
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but I'd say it's not a "real time" ping
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ùïµùñîùñäùñë> OK thanks
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> maybe this one is more accurate (server sends, master doesnt fetch)
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012675538504142918/Untitled-2022-08-22-11411.png
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> correct and that‚Äòs the main reason we removed the ping filter. when your favorite server one time had high ping, you never see it again
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ùïµùñîùñäùñë> maybe the ping should be in cache temporarily?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can add it to the internet tab i guess
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, I think we need some algorithm here to give an accurate~ish ping at normal times. Maybe expire the outlier pings after a while
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cache ping on join, ping on leave and maybe a ping from mid session for like 5 sessions per server ip. Then we can discard outlier values every hour until we have a small enough range of values
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I wouldnt do it on leave, imagine getting kicked out due to ddos and it sets your ping to 999 :D
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> would only work if we wait for the pong_ex
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and dont handle timeouts as 999 for that
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's where the outlier pruning comes in, after an hour the outlier ping of 999 would get pruned from the cache
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah yea
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> The system that I'm going to be building would stop DDOS attacks
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluestripe: :bluestripe: :bluestripe:
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> How so
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Without even breaking the game compatibility
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Smart, but careful so
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Nice the new mode is to randomly add as friend with a nick, then the bot renames itself and sends you that as "System message"
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012726879347822632/Screenshot_20220826-161346_Discord.jpg
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yknow i always wondered about the arrangement of the settings bar: why is languages its own tab? i feel like you could place it in the empty spot of General and it'd work
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> but again, the whole concept of **rounding** is to get the closest whole number
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I told you its not as easy as you think. But sure go ahead, please let me know some details
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> What, I guess if you make a client for it
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> velzen client (the ddnet client that mines eutherium)
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> @ReiTW yeah sure I'll give you some more details on that right now I need to take care of my children
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `round_to_int` was as in round to the integer part of the float
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :uhoh: y tho
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> for whqt purpose
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> for what purpose
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> That's what round_to_int does
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 0.0-0.4 = 0
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> ahm, no what learath said makes sence
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Math 4th class
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> ahm, no what learath said makes sense
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 0.5-0.9 = 1
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's fast, it gets an int, why not? üòÑ
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> lol ok
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I mean, what is used for doesn't rly matter :p
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not the closest whole number, it's the whole part. `round_to_int(2.9f) == (int)2.9f == 2`
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Huh
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Round_to_int would return 3
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> so it takes away the float extension parts
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it shouldn't, unless I'm misremembering the code
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> so its floor(2.9f) then
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> It does (int)(f + 0.5f)
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> So basically
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, it is closest int
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> probs not an actual code term but its a yes math term
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Yes
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> More accurate rounding than simple casy
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Cast
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No, because floor(-2.9f) = -3, (int)(-2.9f) = -2
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ohh
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> that's what I thought this function works, since normally rounding takes the nearest whole number off of a float:
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> 0.5 and above rounds up to 1, a whole number closest to the float, otherwise (0.499x and below) 0
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> an int cast always rounds towards 0
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Closest whole integer towards 0
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I thought round_to_int was just a int cast, but apparently it's not
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> towards 0, oh
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> now it makes sense
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> basically float2int function
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No, that's how I thought it worked. Apparently it's not
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> eh
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `round_to_int` apparently rounds to the closest whole integer
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I meaaaaan return value from float2int and subtract 1 from it
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :trollge:
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doesn't work properly that way üòÑ
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We add 0.5 to positive numbers, and subtract 0.5 from negative numbers, then we cast to int
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :uhoh:
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Imagine passint 1.0
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Cast to 1
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Then returns 0
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Cuz of ur method
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> i mean, you can have conditions for it
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> It's heavier than the current method
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> yeah, since taking away the float part is as easy as it sounds
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I love rust, and btw if u fancy doing guis with imgui, egui looks rly close, but actually better
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And smth curious is that modding in ff14 uses imgui.net for guis
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> So it got me into a spiral of learning it
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Too sad i have to use c# and not rust to mod it tho
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> üó£Ô∏è
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> also doesnt rust have like, ninnou to deal with ui and graphics related stuff?
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Whats ninnou
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh wait. its nannou. i confused the name for a fish
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://nannou.cc/
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never heard of it
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats for artists
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not gui
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/emilk/egui
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im using this
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> inspired by imgui
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but well, it has all the goodies rust provides at compile time x)
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.egui.rs/#demo
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> demo
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Not like it's the 50th time hearing that u love rust :uhoh:
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012735548810612747/unknown.png
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well and not the last probs
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> yup
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I'll try it one day sure
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im doing some internal tooling for my company with rust and egui
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i tried to try it
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :uhoh: :thonk:
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> its not a good starting language
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it isnt
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz it shows all your novice errors
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but not novice as in syntax, but as in things you have to consider when coding
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea thats what i mean
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well "it isnt" isnt true
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you go and learn programming the hard way with rust
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imho you end up in good shape
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> im terrible at code optimization, even for DDNet xd
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but to appreciate rust you need to know the pains of c and c++
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and for that you need to go past hello worlds
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/puffin
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good stuff
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Ryozuki Imgui is damn so cool to use
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> i'll definetly look at the rust one
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can use imgui on rust too but egui is cooler
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and not a ffi binding
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know what? Starting out with rust might not be the worst idea. I bet the borrow checker might be easier to get used to for a complete beginner than a veteran
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you know what you are doing is safe but you just havent figured out the correct lifetimes to let the compiler know you just get angry. A beginner will never think they know better than the compiler üòÑ
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and even ppl that know what they are doing do things wrong sometimes
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ultimately
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its hard
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because new ppl dont learn pointers until late
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and in rust ur kinda forced
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (to use references )
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> depending on where you learn tho
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sometimes pointers are the 1st advanced thing you learn
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most ppl will encounter their first fight with the borrow checker by doing simple for loop with a iterator
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> damn
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> lmao
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> them being oblivious of what a iterator is
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> actually true (happened to me)
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well my suggestion for a beginner language is and always will be C if you want to actually learn programming. Rust is a close second. So the pointer thing is not an issue atleast in my brain
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> for me C isn't a hard language, but people's code makes it harder to work on
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> also it's a very small language to learn
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The low level stuff I think you just have to learn if you want to be a good programmer. You can use the standard library later
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ReiTW
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012743189058289664/unknown.png
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ofc if you read u understand
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but new ppl dont tend to read compiler errors
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thee is probs a example that makes more sense
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i wanted to make up smth fast xd
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah c is a good first language
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i agree wholeheartedly
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I started with C
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it makes you appreciate rust more
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its a good thing
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> thanks to Neox who gave me motivation xD
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> thanks to Neox who gave me motivation xD (Neox is the NX|City creator & Monster too)
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This error message is worse than I'm used to for the rust compiler actually. I wonder why there is no special case for it
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also think that before i learnt C ididnt rly know shit
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mutating the container you are iterating over accidentally is common enough to warrant a special message rather than a isn't 'Copy'
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its cuz you are kinda doing 2 things
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes, remove the std lib which is something "added" to the language and it's a very small language to learn
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since i dont do for x in &a but for x in a
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> using std after is ez af
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i moving a
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you do the help it says
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> + you never learn std
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you can simply search functions etc.. online
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012744117341651014/unknown.png
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> for x in &mut a?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> .into_iter() would work sure but it does the same right?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nono
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u cannot mutate while iterating
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually had an argument with my OS prof over this. He asked the signature of a specific linux function, execvpe or sth
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> bruh
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Who even programs like this. Do you know the signature of execvpe off the top of your head?
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> bro
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I've done a C exam on paper
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it's worse than yours
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kekw
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if i had to do that
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would simply refuse
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> get up
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and leave
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not worht my time
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did aswell. An Algorithms exam. I wrote a 5 page program
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> everyone in class didn't understand a shit
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> the teacher also did a shit code
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i had a teacher with a "c++ background" teaching java nitpick over the usage of while vs for and continue; etc
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you rly have to hold back to not argue when u are way more advanced than the class you are taking
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz u gotta hold ur laughter
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The java teacher we had got in a 15 minute argument with me over using an array instead of an ArrayList
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Learath2 this is one code from my teacher
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```c
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> petty teachers nitpicking over petty stuff
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```c
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> #include <stdio.h>
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> void read_line(char *arr, int size)
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> {
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>   char *p = arr;
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>   char c;
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>   while ((p - arr) < size && (c = getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF)
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>     *p++ = c;
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>   *p = 0x0;
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> }
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> int main(void)
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> {
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>   char buf[10] = { 0x0 };
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>   read_line(buf, sizeof(buf));
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>   printf("%s\n", buf);
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> }
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> guess the problem
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> told him 100 times, he was like "you're wrong, u have to pay me a pizza lol"
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> he does ugly shit code
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At the end I told him I really didn't care whether he thinks the array is less performant or not, just to give me my points because it is correct code whether he likes it or not
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imho taking java as ur first lang is p bad
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz u go pretyt fast into classes
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and polymorphy
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> being oblivious of what pointers and references are
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u rly dont know what u are doing
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they rly like their animals and dogs and cats
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> smh
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You mean the fact that he'll null terminate outside the bounds of the buffer?
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> exactly
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> even if that's nothing really special, that's bad code
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, can spot it even on a phone
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yea
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> and I even used addr sanitizer
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> to show him; he was like "tf is that, it shows nothing"
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Most professors teaching C don't seem to be interested in the language at all. They learn some and think they are good to teach it
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> he was good I'd say
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think most teachers mostly havent worked on real code outside of academics at all
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> He did a lot of things in the past
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The C guy we had was actually a Java guy
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I think he did a thesis in computer science
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> low level stuff
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> real coders are those with a anime pfp having a furry website and doing crazy stuff
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> always matches the profile
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kekw
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> at least he had very good knowledge about Systems
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://gankra.github.io/blah/
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the example
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Except for my computer architecture prof and the algorithms prof the rest of the computer profs have been very meh at my uni
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> everything that we learned in Systems
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> are actually written here : https://tldp.org/LDP/tlk/tlk-toc.html
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> and he knows well his subject, pretty cool
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Way too arrogant for their knowledge level. Knowing theory really well doesn't qualify you to language lawyer in C
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all teachers are arrogant
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Basically I have a system that asking a small fee when interacting with server
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some have the right to be but most dont
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Any attack would cost the attacker money
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im tired of this stupid crypto project
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like I'll defer to you when we need someone to calculate the time complexity of an algorithm, but don't try to tell me signed integer overflow is not UB in C
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant u just go another place to discuss this
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i need to write my own blog post about atomics when using rust, i always keep coming back to https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/atomics.html
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> This is the developer room
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Please be kind to one another
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I'm still looking for the developer who can help me with this project
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah and you are not a dev
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> I got $2,000 to spend
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> jsut a bullshitter preaching shit
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is not a job offer channel
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and you are certainly not contributing back to ddnet in any way
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually just bothering ppl
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> No I'm not I'm rarely speaking
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Follow the rules be kind
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> 1. Be nice and respectful. No aggressivity, toxicity, putting down others or their work.
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> 2. Speak English. So everyone can understand.
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> 3. Be relevant. This is about Teeworlds.
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> 4. Don't advertise except if it is relevant to the discussion.
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> 
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> Punishments start with a kick and can lead to a temporary ban. If the offense is severe, there will be a permanent ban.

17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know about you but this is the ddnet discord
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not teeworlds
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and im certainly most ppl dont wanna hear ur shit
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it also use wrong type for char c; should be int to detect EOF
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> computer architecture profs are the best (soon i'll be one üòÑ )
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> If those rules don't apply here then basically I can say whatever I want and stay here when I want
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Erik van Velzen> But internally I believe in respect

17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> deen is dev botting, report

17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> wtf üëÄ
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> Rude D:
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> truth hurts
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> Idc but rude D:
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well he is either trying to scam ppl, or just too ignorant
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He is just offering a job, if you are not interested maybe just block him?
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> okay
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He doesn't spam nor does he talk unprompted. He made a claim @ReiTW asked for justification
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> what's even the representation of a char with -1
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> blocked then
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ÔøΩ
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt that U+FFFD
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> dunno
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> dout
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> doubt
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it's a single byte?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specials_(Unicode_block)#Replacement_character
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ah I see
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> funny
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh, that too, missed it on account of the overflow being more obvious üòÑ
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There was a really cool talk I linked here by an Adobe engineer I can't seem to find anymore
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Discords search is so shit :/
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sometimes it works
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sometimes not
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> I think C programmers back in the day thought the more stuff you can fit in the condition of your loop, the better. Even k&r is full of that stuff (although they don't have UB there lmao)
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "talk" mathes "talker", "talking", "talks", "talky". "youtube" doesn't match youtube links
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I don't really understand the concept of UB tho
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Actually unreadable code
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Cipy29 yes
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> imagine that
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I swear ElasticSearch and knn indexes are the worst idea computer science people ever came up with
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Stuff the language doesn't define is UB
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> in a class of people who never did programming before
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> they can't understand a shit
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Like going past your allocated memory
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> i am a developerüòéüòéüòé
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes it allows you to search through billions of things. But what use is it if you cant find the things you want
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @jeti from bair, sector 13
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ok ban
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> @Learath2 kiss me
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Damn my best developper @jeti from bair, sector 13 u're dead online or wut
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> ily bro
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also stuff the language explicitly says is UB
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If the standard doesnt say anything about it, or if it says it's UB it's UB üòÑ
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Using C at all? Believe it or not, UB
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> What do you think a pointer is
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Can it be a value
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> :cammostripes:
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A pointer is an object that points to another
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> cuz someone asked it on Rust discord and they answered : pointers are values, that might be in a variable
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but for me a pointer is a variable or an object storing an address
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> @Learath2 this one? https://youtu.be/ncHmEUmJZf4
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well a pointer is an object which does have a value
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> so a pointer can't be the value itself
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No, it wasnt a cppcon talk. He was talking about CoW and documents
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well colloquially we use it mostly interchangably, we refer to both the pointer object and it's value as "a pointer"
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Ryozuki for you
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But in the standard when you see "pointer" it'll refer to a pointer object
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> as an example or the pointer, they gave me that example : `&1 as *const i32`
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> as an example for the pointer, they gave me that example : `&1 as *const i32`
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Compiler makes assumptions to optimize code, u break those, unpredictable things happen
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In Rust idk. Idk the low level stuff about rust
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yeah I see
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ah im on mobile but there is stuff
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My favourite one is null pointer optimization. If you dereference something without checking it'll assume it's non-null
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Rustonomicon is a good place go learn low leven things about rust
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Garwex> Ah yes, keskonsamuz
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Ryozuki so for you this is a pointer or just a returned address that you can store in a variable
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Garwex> @Ryozuki
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So `int foo(int *p) { *p = 0; if(p) { bingo(); }` will become `*p = 0; bingo(); }`
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> A pointer
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its safe to have a pointer in a variable btw, whats unsafe is to dereference it
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even in C, when talking about normal stuff you'll say that's a pointer. Making a distinction between objects and their values is a very very languagelawyer thing
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yeah well
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its safe to have a variable that js a pointer btw, whats unsafe is to dereference it
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I'll still keep the original definition that's in the book by ritchie
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> it's the easiest to understand tho
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think k&r only ever mentions the distinction 1 or 2 times
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/aliasing.html
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> This book has lots of goodies
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I always recommend ot
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's when you start to read the standard where it becomes an issue. Because there are rules that apply to values and there are rules that apply to objects
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> If it's UB with the 'if' it's also UB without so might as well double down lol
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And this one of the most important things
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The compiler says: Huh he dereferenced it, if it was null this would be UB, but that's insane, who would use UB lol, so p is non-null
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> @Learath2 i found these two
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012760788290777218/unknown.png
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> but i dunno
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What did you search for? Just "has: link"?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> yuh
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Oh that guy is a genius btw
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll dig into all the links I posted later I guess, its not those 2 either, thanks for looking
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> those are the youtube videos you posted without "talk" in the message
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, mind boggling stuff he found
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> wait there was one more
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Learath2 what was the subject
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> the topic
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> CoW, smart pointers, something about hierarchical documents
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I like rust cows
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No cows in C++ unless you make your own, which is turbosad
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Cow<'static, str>
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Rly useful
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> twinbop sux
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://deterministic.space/secret-life-of-cows.html
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cows are even more useful with massive objects that are rarely modified
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i googled "CoW" to see what it is and i got greeted by this:
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012761706407145512/unknown.png
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> wasn't helping :PU_pepeFlowerSad:
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Copy on write üòÑ
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> yea i figured <a:OMEGADANCE:906802381445029919>
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```rust
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use std::borrow::Cow;
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fn describe(error: &Error) -> Cow<'static, str> {
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     match *error {
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         Error::NotFound => "Error: Not found".into(),
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>         Error::Custom(e) => format!("Error: {}", e).into(),
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     }
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> }
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I miss coding :AnyaSob:
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :KannaSip:
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> All I do is math math math math math math math math math math
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My brain is about to leak out of my ears
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I left uni cuz maths but u shouldnt leave xd
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> you think it was a youtube video learath
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I‚Äôm sure it was an Adobe guy too
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He talked about how they handled undo/redo using cow snapshots in photoshop
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The most important thing is that since Cow<'static, str> derefs2 to &str it may act as a drop-in replacement everywhere, where &str is expected. So, if last error variant was added to an already existing code base, all would just work without any major refactoring.
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     In other languages like C++ you‚Äôd probably have to decide, [either] to return allocating version like std::string everywhere or get rid of the details and suffer from poor ergonomics, where you‚Äôd need to use such [a] method. Even worse, error entry with extra details may be very rare and yet, you‚Äôd need to make everything allocate just to stick it all in.
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     Rust provides a solution that is zero cost for cases where extra details are not needed. It‚Äôs a brilliant example of ‚Äúpay only for what you use‚Äù principle in action.
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Kek
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGcVXgEVMJg @Learath2
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> YES
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> this has to be the one
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Meek detective
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> I saw that one great great video learned a ton of stuff
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Meek is a link stalker
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ill watch it later
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i love searching up stuff and finding it
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> i dont think there is a job for it
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> that im qualified for
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Learath2 by Free CI did you mean CircleCI?
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is an excellent talk for anyone interested in how you can have nice free polymorphism
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Github actions is free. We get macOS, Windows, Linux all for free
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yea but I tried to read your configs
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> this is hell
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yaml
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Before that we had go use like 3 providers for free CI. Travis for macOS, Circle for Linux and some thing with poop colored ui for Windows
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> rn I'm using gitlab ci/cd feature & watchtower on docker to automatically pull the docker image if the hash is different
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> rn I'm using gitlab ci/cd feature & watchtower on docker to automatically pull the docker image if the hash is different & restart the container
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, maybe some government job exists for it?
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But do you host the docker container?
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> only not the image
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, on github they host the workers for free
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ah
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I mean
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you mean the workers
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I'm using the shared runners
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gitlab provides them? Do they have macOS too?
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> as i said, i don't think i'm qualified for it <a:OMEGADANCE:906802381445029919>
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Tips from the NSA :poggers:
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> True learath works for the nsa
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES2_Insane:531555386453655582>
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why not? I‚Äôm sure some on the job training exists for stuff like this. Like some kind of archive office maybe?
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1012763985306718338/unknown.png
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you have personal runners that you can register, or shared runners yes, but you have a limit per month, good luck to reach it
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> meh government jobs are usually for students with background knowledge so they don't have to train them for too long.
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We get 2000 minutes free on github. I wonder how much of it we end up using
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We get PRs too, those would add to the time used
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ig you can find statistics somewhere
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We also run our builds on CI and we build both debug and release
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> + tests
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh wait, that‚Äôs only for private repos. We get infinite free time for public repos üòÑ
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is hard to beat
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ho lol
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> that's cool
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, idk how much we use
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if it‚Äôs more than 400 minutes
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ryozuki no rust academia
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wot xd
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ur anime title
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They should teach the stacked borrows on academia
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Well i mean, it came from academia
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/stacked-borrows/
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The paper
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> where do u even always find all the links, are u like copy pasting the rust discord here? XD
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> No
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Years of research
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I just remember em xd
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When I have some time I really need to work with something like logseq to organize my knowledge
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ye its nice
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like that polymorphism talk. I really needed it but the only things I remembered about it was that it was am adobe guy and it had sth about cows in it
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 2 tags I could easily search for in a kniwledge cloud
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/kniwledge/knowledge/
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If u dont typo them that is
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I‚Äôm sure logseq can do some fuzzy searching
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> test
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> test
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> /s/test/test2
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> /s/mhh/test2/
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> didnt that work in discord a while ago
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don‚Äôt put a / before or at the end
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> test
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Before is useless, after is a silly mistake by discord, they didn‚Äôt implement it properly
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just wanted to see if thats a message that gets send to the server, but doesnt pop up in irc, so i guess its a client side command ^^
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah it‚Äôs client side from what I gather

21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Is there not a way to run the build checks in ddnet github by yourself?
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> after u contributed once it does
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> SO TRUE AHAHAHA
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> people try to use c as another language, its just "work with ur data nobo"
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if you have a fork they should run ok your fork too
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> congratulations :justatest:
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Ohh... That makes sense.
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i think if ill search for learaths, heinrichs and ryozukis messages in this chat ill end up as master degree student in cs :kek:
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> anyways i think im done with my PR, besides some high level optimization which i have no idea how to handle
