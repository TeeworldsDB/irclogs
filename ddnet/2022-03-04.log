00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Wait what?
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Isn‚Äôt skins.tw former Teeskins? Did they closed their source?
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Ah I did not knew that https://github.com/ChillerDragon/Teeskins
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> but this repo seems to be dead
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Ah I did not knew that  but this repo seems to be dead, only your mirror exists
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://github.com/orgs/Teeskins/repositories
00:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> not in touch with skins.tw, we don't want to host all skins
00:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and we shouldn't try to absorb every TW related project üòÑ
01:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> is there a way to force default zoom on a ddrace server?
01:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I would say no, since we always send the GAMEINFOFLAG_ALLOW_ZOOM flag in every Gameinfo snap. (but maybe I'm wrong)

01:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> ohh sad :( ok thanks for the reply
01:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> @louis wtf
04:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <XBDM> We are under attack.
06:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> @louis @louis
06:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Headshot> what??
06:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Headshot> first time i hear of this
06:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> same
07:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ok i will throw bomb and move
07:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> maybe tried put ADS in skins.tw like Experiment to see how effect in ppl can be ok or always annoying... and money , ppl stop use skin.tw or not

09:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you are making ur own os and making a keyboard controller, this website is bliss https://www.kbdlayout.info
09:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ËªäÈ≠Ñ> Hi developers, It seems that only 45% of DDNet clients' Korean is translated, can I contribute to the translation?
09:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes you can
09:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you go to your game folder, go into the data folder
09:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there go into languages
09:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and then find your language file
09:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> korean.txt
09:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think the format is quite intuitive
09:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet/data/languages/korean.txt
09:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when you are done send it here
09:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (the file)
09:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ËªäÈ≠Ñ> In fact, I've already completed translation
09:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you have github you can make a pull request, or you can send it to me and I can make that pull request
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> crediting you
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet>
09:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ËªäÈ≠Ñ> thanks
09:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ËªäÈ≠Ñ> Could I put my nickname on the contributor list?
09:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you make the PR with your own github account then you will be on the contributor list
09:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/graphs/contributors
09:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes
09:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> you can also just send me the file if github is too complicated
09:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ËªäÈ≠Ñ> ok
09:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ËªäÈ≠Ñ> I've never used github before, so just sending
09:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ËªäÈ≠Ñ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/949221481496346624/korean.txt
09:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks, will be in the next release!
09:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i enabled a beta feature, easier to see diffs :poggers:

23:11 < ***> Buffer Playback...
23:11 <+bridge_> [11:52:35] [ddnet] <Wohoo> What about adding horizontal flip to skin if tee is facing left or right?
23:11 <+bridge_> [11:52:36] [ddnet] <Wohoo> Some skin like dragon are not symmetrical.
23:11 <+bridge_> [11:52:37] [ddnet] <Wohoo> Most of 2d platformers game do this on client side, then can be further improved with animation switch
23:11 <+bridge_> [12:01:26] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im against it
23:11 <+bridge_> [12:01:36] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it will feel too unatural
23:11 <+bridge_> [12:01:41] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its just that skin
23:11 <+bridge_> [12:02:52] [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3797859/9839628/d0deae0e-5a34-11e5-947c-c7884a0498ab.gif

23:11 <+bridge_> [12:03:15] [ddnet] <Jupstar> vanilla already talked about it quite a bit
23:11 <+bridge_> [12:04:33] [ddnet] <Jupstar> tsfreddie made some good points about the shadow
23:11 <+bridge_> [12:04:46] [ddnet] <Jupstar> the shadow couldn't be flipped, else it looks weird
23:11 <+bridge_> [13:01:25] [ddnet] <Wohoo> I was more like about last movement, not mouse.
23:11 <+bridge_> [13:01:26] [ddnet] <Wohoo> But shadow are embedded at the moment, so not swappable

23:11 <+bridge_> [13:02:05] [ddnet] <Voxel> doesn't 0.7 have disconnected shadows?
23:11 <+bridge_> [13:05:30] [ddnet] <Wohoo> Light is left to right, shadow is embedded in right side of body
23:11 <+bridge_> [13:05:30] [ddnet] <Wohoo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/949276397988364309/16463954927403149235578292506680.png
23:11 <+bridge_> [13:07:06] [ddnet] <Wohoo> Some skin have shadow painted receiving light from top.
23:11 <+bridge_> [13:07:06] [ddnet] <Wohoo> Others angled from top-left

23:11 <+bridge_> [16:10:35] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah i know why the title shows like that
23:11 <+bridge_> [16:50:52] [ddnet] <Wohoo> GG
23:11 <+bridge_> [16:51:17] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its a bug in one extension
23:11 <+bridge_> [16:51:20] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill fix it later xd
23:11 <+bridge_> [17:36:58] [ddnet] <Wohoo> What bug? Title in page seems good
23:11 <+bridge_> [17:37:12] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Wohoo in discord
23:11 <+bridge_> [17:37:30] [ddnet] <Wohoo> Ok
23:11 <+bridge_> [17:46:02] [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Since this is a server option and at least the DDNet clients follow it, you could request the feature. Problem is I think that you would have to disable /showall on the server in parallel, otherwise you could just bypass the zoom policy and see other players further away (you would also have to make m_ShowDistance configurable, because currently it is hardcoded and much larger than default zoom). 
23:11 <+bridge_> [17:46:03] [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I just wonder what exactly this is supposed to do, do you want to make the map harder?
23:11 <+bridge_> [17:50:19] [ddnet] <Wohoo> @c0d3d3v FNG doesn't allow you to change zoom, because it is a tactical advantage
23:11 <+bridge_> [19:21:32] [ddnet] <RadziSzop> ya but dyncam is ok :feelsbadman: ?
23:11 <+bridge_> [19:21:52] [ddnet] <RadziSzop> css question: how often do u use css grid instead of flex? (%)
23:11 <+bridge_> [19:28:11] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> heinrich alive

23:11 < ***> Playback Complete.
23:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> oh seems hard, well my intention was make a fun map in which doing zoom out would ruin the surprise cause you could see the next stages without finish the current first. But anyways i want it for a custom server, is there a posibility that i could modify a file to do it? i don't know too much about this things.
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> i also disabled /pause and /spec with acces_level command
