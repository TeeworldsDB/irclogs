00:10 < laxadedi> If you want to avoid downloading allt he files again, I can pull req for you instead
00:10 < Chairn> deen: do i have to make a new branch?
00:10 < laxadedi> no
00:10 < laxadedi> just push to master and then make a pull request on github
00:10 < laxadedi> by comparing your fork to the DDRace64 branch
00:11 < Chairn> https://github.com/Chairn/ddnet/commit/ea52c68d2c3f91aa0007b990408f0139aafbc070
00:12 < laxadedi> you need to pull req now
00:12 < Learath2> or deen can just cherry pick and be done with it :P
00:13 < laxadedi> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/compare
00:13 < Chairn> i dont get the pull request
00:13 < laxadedi> use the link
00:14 < laxadedi> compare DDRace64 to your own DDRace64, then you'll see at least your commits in the difference
00:14 < laxadedi> just create a pull request for that
00:14 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Chairn opened pull request #238: Zooming will work as in game for editor using numpad. (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/vYmvt
00:15 < Learath2> \o/
00:15 < laxadedi> Wow ! You have CI on ddnet now ? 
00:15 <@deen> Chairn: congrats, now you can watch circleci building it: https://circleci.com/gh/def-/ddnet/69
00:15 <@deen> laxadedi: it automatically happened, i did nothing^^
00:15 < laxadedi> oO ?
00:15 <@deen> well, i added CI, but the PR-integration happened automatically
00:16 < laxadedi> I can be proud of my little brother now
00:16 < laxadedi> he can PR on github
00:17 < laxadedi> but can't help daddy and mommy to fix the printer problems
00:17 < Chairn> ...
00:17 < laxadedi> :D
00:17 < Chairn> im not a technician as you have already said
00:17 < Chairn> everything is green in CI
00:17 < Learath2> NO all the people who can use computers are technicians 
00:17 < Chairn> i guess that means it's good
00:18 < Learath2> i got a nice old tv i have to fix somehow 
00:18 <@deen> Learath2: open, replace e-cap, close, done
00:18 <@deen> or what's broken?
00:19 < Learath2> No idea will see tomorrow :)
00:26 < Chairn> thx for your help guys ;)
00:31 <@deen> Chairn: didn't understand one line: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/pull/238/files#diff-84a9f7becf198e6130d1b6d2710123dcR2292
00:34 < Chairn> you have to spam to trigger it several time
00:34 < Chairn> now you can old
00:34 < Chairn> hold
00:35 <@deen> you can hold to clear the brush?
00:35 < Chairn> ah no
00:35 < Chairn> this is useless to clear it as long as you hold
00:36 < Chairn> but it's a change i made for sth else at the origin
00:36 < Chairn> i
00:38 <@deen> i still don'T understand
00:39 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #238: Zooming will work as in game for editor using numpad. (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/vYmvt
00:39 < Chairn> when you hold right click, it clears the brush as long as you hold
00:39 <@deen> yeah, but why is it not enough to clear the brush once?
00:39 < Chairn> now it clears it only once
00:39 < Chairn> before it was clearing it undefinitely
00:41 <@deen> don't think it huts to clear it indefinitely
00:41 < Chairn> as you wish

23:34 < laxa> deen: is that possible to get a command to get current client version ?
23:37 < laxa> if I have an old client, I have no way to know right now which version I have
23:43 < laxa> bug, if you use tab while in console and in game menu, tabs are switching too :p
23:55 < laxa> Why does it needs mysql to build client now ? :(
