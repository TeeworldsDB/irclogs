10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3633
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> did u ever used it?
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok too bad, i'd like to know how compatible it is to teeworlds ðŸ˜„
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (from rendering point of view)
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if i made a game i would use https://bevyengine.org/ or do it from scratch
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ill never do a game cuz i cant do art
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well a 2d game from scratch... ok
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but 3d with physics is really alot of work, and except for educational purposes not really worth it ðŸ˜„
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> atleast not as solo dev ðŸ˜„
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah xD

22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i bet its memory related
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> memory issues everywhere

23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 1: Perhaps, but I often know via information not available to the compiler (it might be to a SPARK proof) that overflow won't happen and I don't want to check for it.
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 2: Programmers can't be trusted to do this kind of free-form reasoning correctly, as attested by the unending stream of security vulnerabilities arising from undefined behaviour in C and C++ codebases.
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The push for safe languages is motivated by pragmatism, not theoretical purity.
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good quote :greenthing:

23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love how ppl try to argue that UB is good due to it being more perfomant oftentimes
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That's exactly why languages have UB, isn't it?
