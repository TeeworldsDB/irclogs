02:33 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master cb0209d Dennis Felsing: Reapply "Only make grenades explode once (fix by timakro)"
05:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Im 'corneum> as a mapper we have the possebility to speak to the player via tune_zone_enter, which is a cool thing, but... its show a server message. its a bit bad for lets say new players who dont really understand where to look at especially whe the server is full ad there are may server messages ayway. so i was wondering if it is possible to put these tips into broadcast but only as long as youre in the zon <message clipped>

07:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 can u explain further how it is broken? i would expect something better from a dev than "it's broken"
07:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> @Im 'corneum braodcasts overwrite each other .-.
07:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> 
07:43 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> 
07:43 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> So the map broadcasts can get overwritten by the clock. Or they can overwrite Moderator broadcasts and map releases and so on
07:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Im 'corneum> @ChillerDragon  hmmm. I thought about that and thought to myself.  What are the odds?
07:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> They increase by adding this stuff.
07:46 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> I have to fight a lot with this Problem in ddpp. What i did Is i implemented a broadcast importance. So irrelevant broadcasts like a clock cant overwrite map broadcasts.
07:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> 
07:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> But what Is stronger? Map or Moderator?
07:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> And idk if my System would fit into ddnet
07:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> Imo broadcasts are great. But in a serious mod they should only appear in a small amount
12:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> grenadesar refixed ?
12:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> grenadesar?
12:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki as far as I understood from @Learath2, forcing the vote doesn't work, it has no effect, it doesn't even output anything
12:40 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> "grenades are fixed?" @heinrich5991
12:40 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> currently the double explosions do not happen
12:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> if you know a map that's broken due to this, please report it to me or @snail
12:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> great move!
12:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i like it
12:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> #makeDDNetVanillaAgian
12:43 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <n000b> Can someone explain that double explosion problem.
12:43 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> nades can double
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> im not sure when exactly but i think if the lifetime is low or 0 and its close to collision or something
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> if the grenade hits the wall at the same time as its lifetime running out, you'll get two explosions
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> one from the collision and one from the "timedeath" of the grenade
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> *you'd
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> (in the past)
12:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <n000b> Hmm nice
12:46 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <n000b> What about "cheated ranks"?
12:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> died "delete em" xd
12:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <dIeD> Ye just remove the ranks from every map with rocket
12:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> xd
12:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @n000b I have decided üòõ that it's unlikely that there are many of them so far
12:49 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i also think that the influence isnt too bad
12:49 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> and i hope it
12:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <n000b> Okay, best decision I guess
12:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> we should probably take a look at "Quintessenz" and "Binary", as reported in the forums
12:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <n000b> Yeah I saw
12:57 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Matodor> with what version of tw used datafile version 4?
13:00 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> it was before "copied refactor to trunk" üòÉ

13:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> *before the end of 2007
13:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Matodor> :thonkery: then I will not support version 3

17:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> you are more hipsterish now than we üòÑ
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> Just wondering if I have missed something, but is there anywhere published on GitHub source of e.g. https://ddnet.tw/status/ ? main part of website is of course under https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web , but is there a way I could find what generates the not-published-there ones?
18:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I bet, it's under status folder
18:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> oh, this one is just one directory deeper
18:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> or rather in /stats/server/...
18:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> depends on what you are looking for
18:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/blob/master/www/status/js/serverstatus.js
18:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> or not, what i found is https://ddnet.tw/stats/server/
18:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> I'm looking for anything that would produce output being index.html/.php file
18:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> If i remember, it's generated every few minutes by his scripts
18:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> check ddnet-scripts
18:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> that serverstatus.js is responsible for information
18:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> about VPS
18:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I mean, no game servers
18:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> http://www.wasz.ovh/img/FMymzMqP116149
18:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/879213ca1fb8615dd67b0cff85d6712be90903d6/servers/scripts/ddnet.py looks like releases page >.>
18:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> @Soreu the rest is generated by scripts in ddnet-scripts
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> @Learath2 yea, the thing is I can't figure out which one creates what üòõ
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> tell me which one you are looking for üòõ
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> also, is there any simple way I could run it locally to test whole website?
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> idc about missing data from e.g. database
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> ```
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> # m h  dom mon dow   command
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> */20 * * * * /usr/bin/nice -n 19 /usr/bin/ionice -c 3 /home/teeworlds/servers/scripts/update-everything.sh

18:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> #* * * * * /home/teeworlds/servers/scripts/print.sh```
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> one of them
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> probably update-status.sh
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> but I don't see it üòÑ
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> update-everything.sh runs other scripts
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> q.q
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I know, right. but can't find that file
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> maybe private
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> including the ones that generate the webpages
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/update-everything.sh
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> oh, here
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> update-local builds the vote files and the map archives
18:11 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/ddnet.py#L563
18:11 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> here you go
18:11 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> I think I just reminded myself why over year ago I gave up on writing redesign üòõ
18:11 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> ranks.py generates /ranks üòõ
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> Yeah not really easy to redesign when the site is written this way
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> you might aswell rewrite the whole thing at that point
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> not my skill
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I remember our bootstrap version
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> xD
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> It was quite nice
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> generating web pages with python, while smart, is not the best idea
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> though, the mess in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/tree/master/www drives me crazy when sitting in editor
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> finding damn index.php file took me a while
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> and it's sorted alphabetically xd
18:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Yeah, it should be rewrite from scratch. But, i don't think that anyone would do it üòÑ
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> @Savander that's why I know about ~7 projects of redesign
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> and I started at least 3
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> One with me I guess
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> of redesign/rewrite*
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> I guess you could reskin it maybe üòõ
18:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> ye, union of lazy developers and such things @Savander
18:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> heh, it's better to make new DOM
18:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> than messing in current one.
18:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> @Savander sure but we already stated "Ain't nobody got time for that"
18:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> @Learath2 wanted to go with changing just css file, but still needed to make few changes to templates
18:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> few changes shouldn't be too hard @Soreu, just needs some digging
18:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> and tbh, writing new articles have to be pain in ass at the moment üòÑ
18:17 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> new articles?
18:17 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> with current system
18:17 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> ya
18:17 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> the blog posts?
18:17 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> ya ya
18:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> oh do I see some twig or sth there?
18:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> if anyone is interested, this is how it looks after whole night of digging:
18:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> some templating engine, thought the index page was also generated by python üòÑ

18:19 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I though its Nunjucks
18:19 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> tbh
18:19 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> could be anything üòÑ You know I don't know hao2 web
18:20 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I learnt Nunjucks few days ago
18:20 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I really like it
18:20 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> üòÑ
18:20 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> https://github.com/savander/nunjucks-scss-browsersync-boilerplate/
18:20 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> and before anyone starts screaming that ppl won't like it, that: http://v2.ddnet.tw/WIP/ was made during whole day of edits based on comments from commuity (old big group on skype), I'm just trying to recreate it in working way
18:20 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I made simple Automatization, like reallly simple
18:21 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> but works perfectly for me üòõ Pro designing
18:21 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I mean, I don't know what people expects from teeworlds site
18:21 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> probably they will never like any changes
18:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> And second, the question is, if we want to follow trends
18:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> or we want to stay behind
18:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> üòõ
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> Well, due to the part of always someone not liking something, I was damn surprised back then when everyone in the channel participated in my fun of figuring out nice new design, and everyone (in the group) at the end liked it
18:24 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> still no idea how that happened xd
18:24 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> old style from 2014 for reference
18:24 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/406137205904637992/Screenshot-2018-1-25_DDraceNetwork.jpg
18:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> my impressive logo skills üòÉ
18:26 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> have seen far worse looking websites üòõ
18:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> and the current one neither looks bad, I just like to improve how stuff looks üòâ
18:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> tbh
18:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> we don't need to follow super extra new trends
18:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> but hookrace.net
18:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> looks perfectly fine
18:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> just flat white color, with good fontface
18:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> we don't need anything more üòÑ
18:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> It's not a joke, i really like it
18:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> me2
18:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> but i also like ddnet.tw
18:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <n000b> @Soreu help designing maps xd
18:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> @n000b that was too much time-consuming üòõ
18:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Soreu> (not like I wouldn't like to back on that)

20:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> votes are votes

20:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=6058&start=20
20:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> If it was configurable, why we deleted it ?
20:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> lul
20:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Maybe next time, ask people before implementing such things ;p
20:46 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> or at least before releasing new client
20:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> it was in the beta aswell
20:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> so people complained?
20:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> nope
20:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> if yes, why you didn't removed it before? or make pull
20:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> if no, why now
20:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> lol
20:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> I have another question, why so important? üòÑ
20:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> Is just emojis
20:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> It's not just emojis
20:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> i complained in beta
20:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> no one listened
20:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I mean, it's overall problem
20:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> About new features
20:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> others complained as well
20:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> and remvoes
20:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> very often, they are made jsut because you want to üòÑ Then people complaining
20:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> first ask, then do üòõ
20:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> It's not wasted dev-time as someone else coded it, people complained, we remoed it
20:49 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> It's not wasted dev-time as someone else coded it, people complained, we removed it
20:49 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> it's for people
20:49 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> not for devs
20:49 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> imo
20:49 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> people were not harmed by emojis
20:49 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> stop talking about emojis
20:49 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I;m talking about overall problem
20:49 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> with new features
20:49 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> it's just like, boom
20:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> without asking, very often. Only sometimes there's some kind of post on forum, with question
20:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> which feature was just like boom? please inform me, we don't have many devs nor do we have much time to waste
20:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> It would be much better üòõ
20:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Anyway, it's your project
20:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 new hooktrhough
20:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> we were lucky it survived imo xD
20:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> people also hated it
20:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> If you are going to complain about it, you should give examples üòõ
20:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Then I should list every feature here
20:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> they are discussed here, with devs
20:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> no with real people, which uses it
20:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> ;p
20:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> new hookthrough is a bugfix tho, the old one didn't even work as intended
20:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> I just want one @Savander üòÉ
20:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> devs are no real people
20:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> ok
20:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> üòõ
20:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> don't think like, devs playing few hours every day
20:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> and the amount of devs is pretty small
20:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> I play every day, from 1 am to 5am with @heinrich5991
20:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> true
20:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> find us on any fine server that hosts "Back in the days 1/2/3" or "Stronghold 1/2"
20:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> üòÑ
20:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> that's why devs shouldn't make community decisions
20:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> okay guys, you are taking everything too personal
20:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I don't continue discussion here
20:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> üòâ
20:55 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <n000b> Xd
20:55 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> have a nice day
20:55 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <n000b> No u
20:55 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> Who said anything personal üôÅ
20:56 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> You say devs don't play, we have like what 4 active devs, 2 of us play every night, Ryozuki is always around, that makes 3/4
20:57 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> You want to discuss something, then don't want me to reply to any of your arguments
20:59 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> and you leave me hanging... whatever, I'll keep working
21:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> rip savander
21:02 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> lol you made him quit
21:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> and all I used were rational statements that included no insults, no words with bad connotations or even a bad tone
21:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> I guess I was supposed to lie and say things I didn't believe in
21:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <n000b> Well it was more about how can 3 people think what is best.
21:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <n000b> But you know, I don't really care.
21:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> then he failed to get his point across, not like I told him to stop arguing
21:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <n000b> Haha
21:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> I'm completely okay with discussing things
21:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> i play more than "few hours"
21:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> my steam records actually 1500+ hours
21:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> It's not a discussion if I'm not allowed to talk tho
21:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <n000b> @Ryozuki concerning numbers?
21:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <n000b> But I got also like at least 1000 hours I guess, but I am still noob
21:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> i play before tw was even in steam
21:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> so thats not the real time
