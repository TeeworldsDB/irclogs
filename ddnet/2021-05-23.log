17:54 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> oh no :/ did zcatch stats reset?
18:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Kernel debugger from the future, look at that time string ðŸ˜„

18:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what are you doing? ðŸ™‚
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nothing interesting, trying to debug a bsod
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oculus is causing so many video mode changes that I think it's hitting some very unused codepaths
18:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "nothing interesting" said the master hacker ðŸ˜›
18:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well I'd only be a master hacker if I manage to find the bug without any symbols ðŸ˜„
18:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> otherwise I'm just a fool wasting time
18:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hey, atleast I'm learning more about windows drivers and how they work
19:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was going to look into setting up gpu passthru to finally get rid of windows completely today, but then I started to wonder whether the VM would be detected by anticheats
19:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 what r u planning to play
19:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well I only play league and genshin impact nowadays
19:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
19:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:

19:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but as anticheats get more and more draconian it might be an issue, even now idk if these games like to work under virtualization
19:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lucky i dont play many tripla a
19:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good thing about being a niche gamer
19:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "gamer" :monkalaugh:
19:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I also play indies, but those are already almost always released cross platform
19:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (since it actually takes no work to do a linux release with any modern engine)
19:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmmmm, SteamVR is also shit on linux, maybe I do have to keep the windows
19:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly? theorically steam tries hard to support linux
19:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> altho they could do better and be conformant with their steam client
19:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it sadly ignores lot of stuff
19:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i cant make the chat floating without making the whole steam floating
19:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not steam, steam upgraded most of their stuff, the problem is the vr vendors not having good drivers
19:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because they dont use proper tags or whathever
19:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hints
19:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I once planned on making a cli "steam client" using steamcmd
19:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/5533
19:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here my issue
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> steam works like shit with tiling wms :/
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> first is steam, second is chat
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/846073869763739648/unknown.png
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this sux
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The guardian popup at login will make a billion bell sounds if you move your mouse outside it
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my trick is to float everything and then select the main steam client and put it non floating manually
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (if you have focus follows mouse enabled that is)
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> focus on mouse hover is the best of twm
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine having to click tofocus
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> normans :monkalaugh:
19:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fwiw I've been trying to stop using the mouse at all
19:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for_window [window_role="pop-up"] floating enable
19:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for_window [window_role="bubble"] floating enable
19:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for_window [window_role="task_dialog"] floating enable
19:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for_window [window_role="Preferences"] floating enable
19:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for_window [window_role="About"] floating enable
19:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tbh steam could fix this so ez
19:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they just have to give the proper window roles
19:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk why these massive companies don't hire one developer just to do these small issues
19:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's just one more developer and they would be making commonfolk happy all the time
19:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz twm users are 1% of 1% of 1%
19:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't mean just this
19:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are many small odd issues here and there like this
19:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a website is chatting :monkalaugh:
19:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <ab.com> any chance the developers could make it so if someone is using a 2 monitor setup, when u swap from the game to say, google or discord on the other screen, the game stays, mine just goes down to taskbar
19:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> microsoft windows problems :monkalaugh:
19:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <ab.com> oof
19:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @asterbros make the game windowed
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> borderless windowed
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <ab.com> ok ill give that a try
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <ab.com> yes it worked
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <ab.com> ha hahahhahahaha, went from 1500+fps to 64+-
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <ab.com> wtf :DDD
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vsync on?
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> turn off
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and try it borderless
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <ab.com> vsync of, its bordeless window
19:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <ab.com> take of fullscreen so i dont have the original bug but keep brodeless so it doesnt fps drop
19:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the fullscreen minimizing the game when u alt tab is normal btw
19:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its how fullscreen works
19:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on windows*
19:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 since when does the console have color? xd
19:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <ab.com> yah, just anoying since i have to tab back into game then press windows+shift+-> to switch to other screen every time
19:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki mh, last version or so
19:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u happen to know what does gfx_async_render_old
19:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> only god and @Jupstar âœª knows what the `gfx_` options do
19:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @asterbros if u have a gpu try enabling opengl 3.3
19:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe only jupstar knows what they REALLY do internally
19:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/846076667494662204/unknown.png
19:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <ab.com> btw (i know this is for developers) but is nvidia optimus not changing between 2 g cards automaticaly normal?
19:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh nivdia optimus
19:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i heard it has bugs here
19:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 was it chairn?
19:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> smth about 32 bits
19:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> everyone has issues with optimus
19:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sometimes for whatever reason it just doesn't trigger the dGPU
19:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <ab.com> i have to manualy make my game turn to dgpu from igpu so my laptop screen gets real fps
19:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <ab.com> and if it doesnt it reads 250fps +- but displays at about 40
19:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <ab.com> :`(
19:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know about such tech
19:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sry
19:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <ab.com> all cool
19:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Noooo someone took my idea of a spotify terminal interface and made it real
19:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i know about it since ever
19:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui
19:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its in rust
19:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz u know
19:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust
19:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> everything is in rust lately
19:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
19:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll make one in C
19:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just so it annoys you ðŸ˜›
19:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 the other day  iwas reading lwm or the web were ppl discuss about the discussions on the linux kernel
19:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there were some serious C holy warriors
19:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they found anything other than C horrendous
19:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no room for discussion
19:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was amazed
19:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but
19:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> way more hardcore
19:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well don't forget most of the people contributing to the kernel are OLD
19:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> than u
19:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
19:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> old people are old people no matter whether they are tech people or not
19:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 there is one guy that is mad that rust docs are in markdown and not in hand drawn ascii
19:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddd
19:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean we can write a tool to do markdown -> ascii if he likes, it's not rocket science
19:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Markdown is actually pleasant to read in plaintext even so idk what he is on about
19:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://lwn.net/Articles/853423/
19:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here is the shithole
19:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually interestin discussions
19:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but some are like wanting to kill urself
19:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you are trying to convince someone who doesnt know how rust works and makes x assumptions about how a code he seen works
19:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and process to shit on it
19:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g he things the ? that makes a early return error hides stuff and that u cant handle the error
19:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (he was corrected but i doubt he cares)
19:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also that RAII helps unwind on errors
19:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> removing human error
19:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they actually prefer gotos these devs
19:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and following them around 40 files
19:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kek
19:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i also found a rly old dude calling "smiley code" using a lambda |_| x.something
19:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz he doesnt know that _ is used when u dont care about the input parameter
19:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hilarious
19:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "smilley programming"
19:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I sort of agree with Zijlstra there, a second language is raaarely a good idea
19:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Since Zijlstra also described the kernel rst docs as "crap" and "unreadable garbage" I'm not sure anything except hand-written ASCII would satisfy him, but perhaps others would be happy with that.
19:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 this guy also hates rst
19:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah that point he makes idk what he is on about
19:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> old guy stuff
19:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they guy i answered on hacker news got his comment flagged lmao
19:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/846080591798992946/unknown.png
19:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it rly was a comment that doesnt fit hn standards so i understand it
19:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> > The more you make it look like (Kernel) C, the easier it is for us C people to actually read. My eyes have been reading C for almost 30 years by now, they have a lexer built in the optical nerve; reading something that looks vaguely like C but is definitely not C is an utterly painful experience. 
19:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> See this is what I suffer from aswell, I do wish Rust had taken less steps away from C but c'est la vie. I accept that
19:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like that rust is big away from C
19:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm talking about just the syntax here
19:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i find that C makes the programming field stall and not progress
19:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if they want to completely part with it then completely part with it, if not don't take a few baby steps and leave it in this confusing state for older programmers
19:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the argument that i did X for 30 years in programming is a bit bad, since programming is a thing that moves really fast
19:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you shouldnt be stuck
19:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or you die with it
19:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > I wouldnâ€™t be shocked if this was all some conspiracy by Google and Microsoft to make a personal computing unusable so that everyone has to use their cloud offerings.
19:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some ppl believe this xdd
19:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wouldn't be shocked either. I'd be a little surprised
19:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> These capitalists, you really need to be careful about them. Very very crafty people
19:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is in the context of pushing rust to linux causing this
19:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt google use linux itself
19:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see how rust would lead to that, but if anyone is capable of destroying something for profits using the silliest means it's Microsoft and Google
19:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Zijlstra is like the final boss, a bigot to his core lol
19:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
19:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Linus' comments seem on point though, rust is a little too eager to die
19:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i bet Zijlstra doesnt read websites that use more than basic html
19:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wait
19:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he probs doesnt even read websites
19:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its all mail
19:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> living in the 80
19:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean the rust wrapper in the kernel, but even rust itself is a little too eager to die
19:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what does that mean
19:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> eager to die
19:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The kernel needs to try it's very best to keep working under any circumstance, you can't just panic when something doesn't seem right
19:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Does it prevent spotify ads?
19:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that has been discussed tho
19:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the rust compiler devs are willing to work on making it a better fit, and more stuff
19:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, hence why I said Linus' comments seem on point
19:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and seems the people getting rust into the kernel agree with the sentiment
19:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you dont use std you also dont do any allocations
19:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which is somethign they want
19:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this integration will be great for both rust and the kernel imo
19:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
19:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rust will get to improve as a systems language and the kernel will get experience with integrating another language
19:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for now the target is just drivers
19:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> >  The Rust version of the semaphore driver is around 50% bigger than its C counterpart
19:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is one more concern I'd have, hopefully rust will get some more facilities to allow smaller binaries
19:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> linux runs on some veeeeery tight spaces, the core shouldn't be allowed to get too large
19:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder why that is
19:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, who knows except the guys who made the thing
19:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah, cant see the code xd
19:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd guess it's either some standard library cruft or some error handling cruft, assuming the original driver is also compiled by LLVM the IR generation is usually equivalent or better for rust
20:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/LLVM/clang/
20:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/also//
20:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/rust/drivers/android/allocation.rs
20:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found it
20:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think this is the binder
20:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
20:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont use spotify myself
20:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i listen to youtube autoplay, with a adblocker and a user script to accept "are you there?" by annoying youtube
20:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and thus my experience is flawless
20:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yt only works best if u know what songs u want to listen to
20:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/xcWbzTdypd/
20:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is the script
20:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol noi
20:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> youtube knows me really well
20:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i always find hidden gems
20:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i bet they know me way better than spotify xd
20:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe cause u use it a lot more
20:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but for me youtube algorithm isn't good for songs
20:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its great for playlists
20:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
20:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess its cuz i only listen to music on yt
20:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont rly watch videos
20:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cause it has basically every song unlike spotify or sc
20:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @Ryozuki wtf but why
20:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> scuffed music experience
20:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ??
20:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how is it scuffed
20:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> high quality youtube audio
20:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think its much worse
20:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> lol
20:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> why dont you just use spotify or any music platform?
20:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> instead of scripts, adblock
20:40 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> Ryozuki:  ah useful script i guess but it never really bothered me so much
20:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> and all that stuff
20:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because i dont want to pay for music
20:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> you dont have to
20:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I dont pay
20:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont want ads
20:40 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> where did u slap that script in?
20:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> on desktop its 30 seconds every 30mins
20:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> on mobile its bad I agree
20:41 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon violentmonkey extension
20:41 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon come back to irc
20:41 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> element is so nice
20:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> those 30 secs are not worth
20:42 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon weechat better
20:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> People who listen music on youtube are weird imo
20:42 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> uhm
20:42 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon did u know matrix is kinda centralized, since everyone uses the main servere
20:42 <+Ryozuki> it always happens with federated stuff
20:42 <+Ryozuki> its sad
20:42 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> well
20:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im a weirdo then
20:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im also a weeb
20:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> :YEP:
20:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing: fits
20:42 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> its kinda convienient that there are main servers imo
20:43 <+Ryozuki> defeats the federated purpose
20:43 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i dont mind some centralization
20:43 <+Ryozuki> imagine the fbi closes it
20:43 <+Ryozuki> all will lose it
20:43 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> one could argue ddnet is very centralized
20:43 <+Ryozuki> cuz nobody rly federated
20:43 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> its still cool
20:43 <+Ryozuki> actually ddnet is very open about its data
20:43 <+Ryozuki> so its easy to recover
20:43 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> if fbi closes it we open new
20:43 <+Ryozuki> btw u should leave freenode
20:44 <+Ryozuki> come to libera.chat #ddnet

20:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
20:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but its buggy on windows, and thats something weird with windows as it doesnt even work with dx12 :/
20:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and for some reason its better in debug mode xD
20:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it makes the client not continue the simulation, before the current graphics buffer isnt completly handled... so basically wait for it to finish(which creates delay, as the simulation is then outdated)
20:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if you lucky u can request different cards with vulkan, but not with opengl
20:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wat
20:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> theres not much difference tbh
20:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> unless u are an audiophile
20:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u know some headphones play some kind of music better than others
20:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some excel at bass
20:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and some on x shit
20:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is specially noticeable on electronic music xd
20:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> atleast for me
20:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hm yes
20:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it depends
20:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also on how the song is mixed
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <ab.com> i dont know what that means ðŸ˜„ vulkan could mean, a program, manufacturer or a gawk gawk 3000 machine to me ðŸ˜„
21:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that means currently not possible
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> except u didnt mean related to ddnet
23:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar âœª for a friend of mine, the borderless window mode doesn't work if they select the full resolution
23:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it takes ages to tab out and in (on windows)
23:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seems that despite the borderless window mode being selected, it's using fullscreen
23:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> got any idea what might cause this?
23:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (selecting a lower resolution with borderless window on fixes the problem, and it's actually a borderless window then)
