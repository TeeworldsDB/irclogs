00:19 < bridge> <teero777> @murpi can you fix the bot to show the @ of the person instead of their account name?
00:25 < bridge> <kebscs> ok im so smart i managed to do laser door prediction
00:26 < bridge> <kebscs> @essigautomat full laser overhaul ü§ù
00:31 < bridge> <teero777> no
00:31 < bridge> <teero777> you didn't
00:31 < bridge> <teero777> abdhisuzadhibfpsz asdbhohuisfd
00:31 < bridge> <teero777> @kebscs you didn't manage dynamic doors sent from the server
00:32 < bridge> <teero777> do not pr until you did
00:32 < bridge> <teero777> This means you need to keep track of all doors and check which doors the server sends and if it sent one last tick and didn't send it this tick then you need to remove it
00:33 < bridge> <teero777> do not pr without doing this
00:33 < bridge> <kebscs> wdym?
00:34 < bridge> <teero777> if the server decides to remove a door entity. like some modded servers may do
00:34 < bridge> <teero777> then you need to also remove that door in the collision
00:34 < bridge> <teero777> meaning you need to compare all the doors from the previous tick to the ones sent this tick to know which doors appeared or dissapeared
00:35 < bridge> <kebscs> do you have a server that does that?
00:35 < bridge> <teero777> a modded server may do that
00:35 < bridge> <Assa> üòç
00:35 < bridge> <teero777> and not managing this clientside would cause prediction errors and thus limits moddability
00:35 < bridge> <Assa> nice
00:35 < bridge> <kebscs> yes but do you have a server so i can test this?
00:36 < bridge> <teero777> i already did door prediction like a year ago but it was annoying to fix this so i stopped
00:36 < bridge> <kebscs> or which mod exactly does it?
00:36 < bridge> <teero777> no just write good code
00:36 < bridge> <teero777> i dont know
00:36 < bridge> <teero777> no.
00:36 < bridge> <teero777> make one if you need one. dont be lazy
00:37 < bridge> <louis> does that need to be in prediction
00:38 < bridge> <louis> cant the modded server send switch off event or smth
00:38 < bridge> <Property of Souly> teero crashout 2025
00:38 < bridge> <Assa> what about not sending door status every tick? wtf
00:38 < bridge> <Property of Souly> wrong reply
00:38 < bridge> <Property of Souly> teero crashout 2025
00:38 < bridge> <Assa> also if modded servers break prediction, it's nothing new xD
00:39 < bridge> <teero777> go fuck yourself. stop writing bad/incompatible code. you are just pushing away future problems.
00:39 < bridge> <reitw> I don't understand a shit but I support Teero
00:40 < bridge> <kebscs> how can i tell its incompatible when theres no server i can test it on
00:40 < bridge> <kebscs> üëç
00:40 < bridge> <teero777> like think? xd
00:40 < bridge> <reitw> There's a DDNet-Server.exe on your game directory lmao
00:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I do agree with Teero that prediction should work as similar to ground truth as possible
00:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but I also agree that servers shouldn't be doing dumb bullshit
00:41 < bridge> <teero777> this isn't dumb bullshit tho. a server can basically place blocks which is revolutionary
00:42 < bridge> <iamhardliner> yeah, thats what players are for
00:42 < bridge> <teero777> doors are just stoppers
00:42 < bridge> <louis> since when can a server place blocks
00:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Wait, time to turn Teeworlds into a game about breaking and placing blocks?
00:42 < bridge> <teero777> meaning the server can place stoppers
00:42 < bridge> <Property of Souly> i remember louis having an idea like that once
00:42 < bridge> <teero777> with the proper door prediction implementation it can be.
00:43 < bridge> <teero777> atleast the physics parts. it would be a little wonky tho
00:44 < bridge> <Assa> The variable door length tile is already in the making
00:45 < bridge> <louis> it wont be anything close
00:45 < bridge> <louis> u can skip doors so easily
00:45 < bridge> <Assa> ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
00:46 < bridge> <louis> u cant do that withoyt adding a new tile
00:46 < bridge> <louis> theres no way to arbitrarily remove door entities in ddnet, why should prediction expect a  server to do that
00:46 < bridge> <Assa> I can! would just break backwards compat.
00:47 < bridge> <louis> im pretty sure any mod should use switches to control removing doors and such
00:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> not if the server says you can't!
00:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> since we're talking about modded servers apparently
00:47 < bridge> <louis> theres a difference between backwards compatibility and breaking 100s of maps
00:47 < bridge> <kebscs> i mean the entities gets destroyed, i just destroyed placed doors in destrucor
00:47 < bridge> <kebscs> whats the problem
00:48 < bridge> <Assa> it's just a fine line ... like a door
00:51 < bridge> <soulyvevo> pretty sure i made an issue on it
00:52 < bridge> <soulyvevo> on some older clients there was some thing that caused highier resolution skins to have colors applied incorrectly
00:53 < bridge> <soulyvevo> and by incorrectly i mean it just applied the color without doing that weird brightness balance
00:53 < bridge> <soulyvevo> seriously can we just remove that
00:53 < bridge> <soulyvevo> why would brightness be adjusted like that
00:54 < bridge> <soulyvevo> it doesnt even let you have a fully white skin in some cases
00:54 < bridge> <soulyvevo> and in most cases it makes the skin really pixellish or completely breaks color cobtrast
00:54 < bridge> <soulyvevo> and in most cases it makes the skin really pixellish or completely breaks color contrast
01:00 < bridge> <teero777> moddability?
01:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> #7777 mentioned?
01:00 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7777
01:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i guess its not source level
01:01 < bridge> <teero777> destructor? xd
01:01 < bridge> <teero777> you are not telling me you are keeping door entities in the entity linked list are you?
01:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (where should they be)
01:02 < bridge> <Property of Souly> how would this be practical tho
01:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> teero crashout before gta6 is crazy
01:02 < bridge> <teero777> they do not belong there xd
01:02 < bridge> <teero777> the only thing they do is modify the collision to place stoppers with a switchnumber
01:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> reminds me of the time i trolled him while keeping a boxes collision within bounds of a rect
01:02 < bridge> <Property of Souly> gta6 meme in 2025 ü•Ä
01:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> reminds me of the time i trolled him with keeping a boxes collision within bounds of a rect
01:02 < bridge> <louis> its like if i wanted 0 gravity i would use the tune, i wouldnt add gravity y vel to every player every tick
01:03 < bridge> <teero777> linked lists are awfully slow and you just made the prediction 2000% slower on braintee if that is what you did kebs
01:03 < bridge> <louis> dont encourage modability for jank stuff like door
01:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im so productive (renaming variables)

01:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> remove 2 lines vs add 20
01:06 < bridge> <kebscs> how else do you keep track of the doors
01:06 < bridge> <kebscs> if not in list
01:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1355694601322627222/image.png?ex=67e9dc7c&is=67e88afc&hm=63bcb7a05611babd1792fef0bb54990ff2334b58a2707e7ed28c5c88894a87ce&
01:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ):
01:07 < bridge> <property of fingers> bot is open src
01:07 < bridge> <teero777> make a seperate list that is not a linked list. it should not be a prediction entity.
01:08 < bridge> <teero777> since the actual prediction is just the stopper prediction
01:10 < bridge> <kebscs> kinda is an entity
01:12 < bridge> <louis> actually infclass engineer places arbitrary doors @kebscs
01:12 < bridge> <louis> not sure if its the same implementation but maybe u can test that
01:12 < bridge> <Assa> 257* ü´†
01:12 < bridge> <louis> or i think some infclass guy might place doors
01:12 < bridge> <Property of Souly> wtf why
01:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> memory was the issue, idk what gray bars mean
01:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> all the infclass entities show as blue for me
01:13 < bridge> <Assa> 255 in Switch layer + 1 in game + 1 in front
01:13 < bridge> <louis> yeah idk what they use for the lasers, probably isnt doors then
01:13 < bridge> <learath2> heh, do those 2 even work properly?
01:13 < bridge> <teero777> doesn't make any diff xd
01:14 < bridge> <louis> im curious what mod you have planned that uses arbitrary placed doors
01:14 < bridge> <Assa> unfortunately, yes, thats what my bugfix PR is for
01:14 < bridge> <learath2> (I personally wouldn't block a PR fixing ddnet/ddrace doors prediction without trying to handle runtime placed ones)
01:15 < bridge> <learath2> ((I would prefer one that does that too EXCEPT if it comes at a large performance/compatibility penalty))
01:20 < bridge> <kebscs> i mean it just places stop tiles when doors are on screen
01:20 < bridge> <kebscs> and deletes them when they arent or disappear
01:20 < bridge> <kebscs> and its only once on spawn/despawn
01:28 < bridge> <TsFrediman> yes
03:07 < bridge> <oxyzo.> yay door prediction
03:07 < bridge> <oxyzo.> i dont need to see teleporting monstrosity every time

14:04 < bridge> <teero777> sry im just mad
14:06 < bridge> <learath2> Anyone has any idea to curb join spamming? I was thinking of just not sending server messages with joins anymore
14:06 < bridge> <learath2> But that's very suboptimal
14:08 < bridge> <teero777> you can just group them like normal messages but not only group the last message
14:08 < bridge> <learath2> Issue is that the bots slightly change their names when joining
14:08 < bridge> <learath2> So they don't stack
14:08 < bridge> <teero777> oh right
14:10 < bridge> <learath2> Another thought I had was throttling joins per ip
14:11 < bridge> <teero777> you could also make 0 point players not have a join message
14:11 < bridge> <learath2> This takes a query to get, but I guess it's a cheap one
14:12 < bridge> <teero777> that's true.
14:12 < bridge> <learath2> This has to be fixed somehow, it's very annoying :/
14:13 < bridge> <teero777> you could make a new hud element for joins that is not so disrupting
14:13 < bridge> <teero777> next to the kill hud for example
14:14 < bridge> <teero777> although i think many people would be against it
14:14 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah this is what I was trying to say with my first idea. But is it prominent enough? The only reason we want the messages is so people can see who joined. DDRace players are very trained to just ignore the kill feed
14:15 < bridge> <learath2> I guess I should first investigate whether these clients are joining from one ip
14:15 < bridge> <teero777> the thing that annoys me the most about it is that it disrupts any conversation you have in the chat
14:15 < bridge> <teero777> yes probably
14:22 < bridge> <kebscs> Is it really that much worse? Because tick isn't implemented it just skips them in the loop
14:23 < bridge> <kebscs> And they're in entities list to keep track which one is deleted so the modability you talked about is preserved
14:25 < bridge> <kebscs> And there's never that many doors for it to be performance issue
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> where are they deleted?
14:38 < bridge> <kebscs> idk i guess the entity list handles that
14:38 < bridge> <kebscs> bcs if i move my screen away from the doors the destructors get called
14:46 < furo> @learath2 The client library they use sends `NETMSG_CLIENTVER` with a DDNet version string containing a link to the npm package (`https://www.npmjs.com/package/teeworlds/v/${version}`), but I guess if you start auto banning that they will fix it ;D
15:01 < bridge> <teero777> isn't this only the case if you don't have /showall?
15:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why is this not an obvious thing?
15:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> theres no reason to be leaving and joining 50 times per second
15:07 < furo> That's already the case. If you do too many repeated connections you will be unable to join due to `Too many connections in a short time`.
15:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> then why no banned ):
15:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> i know of 5 ways to dodge that message without touching the code
15:11 < furo> Go on
15:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> i wont leak ways to prevent our safety measures xD
15:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> i wont leak ways to dodge our safety measures xD
15:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> make a pr which prevents em ;D
15:14 < furo> Send in dm :)
15:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> sry i dont dm bots, they scare me
15:14 < furo> Okay, keep your secrets then :(
15:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wdym dm you
15:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> lmao
15:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> furo: i sent dm
15:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> dm'ing those bots is a tedious thing but its possible
15:17 < bridge> <kebscs> hmm in fact it does lag if i put 1000 speeders
15:17 < bridge> <teero777> speeders? xd
15:17 < bridge> <kebscs> doors*
15:18 < furo> @melo∆û Thanks for the tips, I'll create my spam bot now.
15:18 < bridge> <melo∆û> FUCK
15:19 < bridge> <teero777> the server only keeps track of the doors because it needs to send the info to the client.
15:21 < bridge> <kebscs> and how can the client keep track of them to delete doors if not needed?
15:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
15:29 < bridge> <kebscs> nvm it lags even without prediction code
15:29 < bridge> <kebscs> the prediction code doesnt actually change much
15:31 < bridge> <kebscs> ok i get no fps difference with prediction on/off
15:32 < bridge> <kebscs> hmm in fact it does lag if i put 1000 doors
15:38 < bridge> <kebscs> both 140fps with 1000 doors
15:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Did you compile in release mode? 140 FPS seems pretty slow in either case
15:41 < bridge> <kebscs> tested both on debug
15:41 < bridge> <kebscs> ill try release
15:41 < bridge> <robyt3> Debug mode is not meaning to compare performance
15:41 < bridge> <robyt3> Debug mode is not meaningful to compare performance
15:42 < bridge> <robyt3> Always compile in release mode for profiling
15:42 < bridge> <robyt3> (and set all limits in the client to unlimited)
15:43 < bridge> <kebscs> alright ty
15:43 < bridge> <kebscs> thought its the same since the same code is running
15:43 < bridge> <kebscs> and isnt optimized out so maybe better
15:43 < bridge> <kebscs> and isnt optimized out so maybe better to test
15:44 < bridge> <robyt3> Could be very different code when compiled in release mode
15:45 < bridge> <kebscs> yeah i mean when in debug both implementations arent optimized
15:45 < bridge> <kebscs> so they run closer to truth?
15:45 < bridge> <kebscs> maybe but ig i was wrong
15:45 < bridge> <robyt3> But in release maybe the existing was optimized but the new code is not
15:46 < bridge> <kebscs> on release its 270-300
15:47 < bridge> <kebscs> for both
15:47 < bridge> <kebscs> release with debug info but probably doesnt change anything
15:51 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, that should be fine (and required if you want readable info when profiling)
15:53 < bridge> <robyt3> If you have a test map you could also benchmark with `ddnet_(old|new) "connect localhost; benchmark_quit 60 /absolute/path/to/bench_(old|new).log"`
15:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Then wait 60 seconds
15:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Then you have the frametimes in the log file and can graph those
15:54 < bridge> <kebscs> probably dont need, i look at the in game fps and graph and i cant tell a difference
16:00 < bridge> <robyt3> Is there a good way to determine how much skin should/could be loaded at most? I would go with a simple fixed number of maximum 256/512 skins being loaded at once for starters. Probably just half that number of 32 bit versions. But if it was possible to determine the approximate amount of free VRAM I'd maybe try to more dynamically fill at most 20% of available VRAM with skins.

16:02 < bridge> <kebscs> why loading only as much is needed, when joining a server doesnt work?
16:05 < bridge> <robyt3> What do you mean? Because of the map?
16:05 < bridge> <robyt3> I'm adding lazy loading/unloading to skins in general
16:05 < bridge> <kebscs> why load 256/512 skins when can only load 64 at most, 1 for each player
16:06 < bridge> <robyt3> For example because
16:06 < bridge> <robyt3> - 128 players
16:06 < bridge> <robyt3> - menus shows more
16:06 < bridge> <robyt3> - skins shouldn't immediately be unloaded/loaded again
16:07 < bridge> <robyt3> Skin loading will be very fast and has zero FPS impact at 240 FPS for me, but should still be avoided
16:07 < bridge> <kebscs> ah right
16:07 < bridge> <kebscs> makes sense then
16:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @tater

16:16 < bridge> <teero777> chiller hes sleeping i think xd
16:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its middle of the afternoon watafak
16:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the tclient website says latest version is 10.2.0 and the download links lead to 10.1.2 whats up with that

16:20 < bridge> <teero777> i dont think he'll be online for some time
16:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> working on a remote means it fetches the skins even when theyre never rendered which is quite annoying as the sshfs is ... really slow (despite both machines having a >1gbps internet, sshfs is just bad xd)
16:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> means that the majority of loading time is skins
16:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also funny thing that opening assets causes a loading screen which doesnt respect my ui color and has the old background

18:18 < bridge> <chairn> it's less clear within gdb though

18:21 < bridge> <chairn> yes

18:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ^ gonna try it now
18:44 < bridge> <robyt3> Otherwise, does running in gdb with ASAN not work?
18:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont like running under gdb x-x
18:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but i dont know
18:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if they step on eachother
18:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> everyone segfaults wehn reading from 0 tho
18:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and if it doesnt then it just reads a garbage value which... is fine
18:46 < bridge> <robyt3> No, it's undefined behavior, the compiler is free to do other things like calling random functions
18:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> from derefencing a nullptr?
18:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk why a compiler would... do that
18:46 < bridge> <chairn> because optimizations
18:47 < bridge> <chairn> it may elude the next function call as well
18:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh i guess so if type shenangns
18:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (eg std::optional)
18:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but thats an int
18:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and everything after it doesnt have to be run and doesnt much care about previous state
18:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also its volatile so the compiler cant optimize it away
18:48 < bridge> <Assa> while this looks funny, It actually makes sense if you are able to understand the contexts. Is anything marked in this positions unclear for you?
18:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `. It is allowed to compile code that dereferences a null pointer into code that formats your hard disk.` hilarious
18:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if it makes it more certain can force it to never be inlined and extern c it
18:55 < bridge> <kebscs> I fixed everything, just looked funny

20:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think it should be called just tater
20:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but tater is a person
20:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or is it totar
20:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or sjrc6
20:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg

20:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> horrible
20:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its totar on discord cuz tater was taken probably
20:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @robyt3 btw can i add handle abort = 2 into the thing
20:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @robyt3 btw can i add handle abort = 1 into the thing
20:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> handle_abort=1
20:49 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, makes sense I guess if this also makes ASan catch `abort`

21:11 < bridge> <pioooooo> i mean i can bind but it doesn't work
21:15 < bridge> <robyt3> Mouse wheel works different than other keys, when you move it it presses and immediately releases the key
21:16 < bridge> <pioooooo> yeah so i would expect a hammer from my dummy
21:16 < bridge> <pioooooo> `bind mousewheeldown "+fire;+toggle cl_dummy_hammer 1 0"`
21:17 < bridge> <pioooooo> which it doesn't
21:18 < bridge> <robyt3> `+toggle` only works with keys that are held down, but mouse wheel is never held down

21:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh that's so annoying I love it

22:33 < bridge> <pioooooo> maybe i should change the msg
22:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well probably since thats how i read it /shrug
22:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think this entity here
22:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1356003756314988836/image.png?ex=67eafc68&is=67e9aae8&hm=b182419289fd812b4a375ab131511ff312809c756b5c54d902f2262a83ab57e4&
22:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is the favourate group
22:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but obviously it doesnt work
22:35 < bridge> <pioooooo> this is the "adding group of 0 favorites"
22:35 < bridge> <pioooooo> so it is invalid
22:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh maybe
22:36 < bridge> <kebscs> what is a favourite group
22:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ^
22:36 < bridge> <pioooooo> `closing favorites group while it is empty, discarded` good?
22:37 < bridge> <pioooooo> my wording is bad
22:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> discarding empty favorite group as it is empty
22:37 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> discarding empty favorite group
22:37 < bridge> <pioooooo> okay
22:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1356004583427670036/image.png?ex=67eafd2e&is=67e9abae&hm=f9cbe80f14dfef316495479e20668b7858d515770dab6c8aad590cfa3af8a6a3&
22:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think its supposed to accept an argument

22:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @pioooooo are you just doing this or making them actually do something
22:39 < bridge> <pioooooo> no
22:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (it wasnt a yes/no)
22:39 < bridge> <pioooooo> im just fixing this
22:39 < bridge> <pioooooo> i mean
22:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> okay
22:39 < bridge> <pioooooo> :]
22:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ;}
22:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im going to make them do something
22:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> there are people who want "custom communities", "tags" or whatever
22:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this feature is already here, if unused
22:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wait...
22:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Solly (bun bun) hmm the favorite groups make exec parsing stateful ._.
22:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe fav groups are meant to let you have multiple ips per sevrer
22:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> not really?
22:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what aboutputting it in one command like ``add_favorite_group gaming 127.0.0.1:8303``
22:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you cant determine whether an add_favourate was in a fav group
22:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> as for if its good or not to do so
22:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah if something new was being added thats how i would do it
22:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im stil tryna figure out how add_fav_group is used
22:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> agh the browser no longer shows 7 connections ):
22:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon it also means removing favourate groups
22:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if they do nothing
