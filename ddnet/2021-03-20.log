00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> exactly
01:08 < madness_> Hey
01:08 <+madness_> does anyone know how to code something which will automatically laser you if you jump into freeze tiles?
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> :think_bot:
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that'd be a bot and not allowed on ddnet servers
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think he means serverside
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> (hopefully)
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> yeah just get dummy and press ur bind and it will laser u ;)
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> yeah just get dummy and press ur hf bind and it will laser u ;)
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> yeah just get dummy, press ur hf bind and it will laser u ;)
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> ^ With your laser out, ofc.
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> ^ With your laser out, ofc, turn off and on your hammerfly bind for easy lasers (hold the hook while aiming at a hookable if you're forced to stay hooked to something)
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> would be nice to have a join qeue instead of reconnect
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> would be nice if auto reconnect would not get one banned :D
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> that too
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think imade a gothub issue a few weeks ago for that
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gothub
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :nouis:
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> akchualy
21:06 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: that's an old setting still persisting, find the github issue and fix your config variable ;)
22:28 <+ChillerDragon> yea heard something like it. But if the min value was high enough it would auto fix the variable wouldnt it?
22:30 <+ChillerDragon> hehe nice comment https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3453#issuecomment-758105354
22:32 <+ChillerDragon> cant find the issue i might be faster searching the var
