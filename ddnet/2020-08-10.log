00:09 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> Yes, and it was quite hard for me to find out which file was causing the include to winuser.h
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Hey, my server still gets flooded with (connecting) players, it took them a bit but after some days after I initially fixed the ddnet tokens, it still happens. How?
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/commit/11139517273d831bfff9451f2fb17d99a5ff3167
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I really need help at this point, to me it seemed to work
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/blob/1edb14df728b2bcbdd0e5d57fc2d7f9b8bff3ea0/src/engine/shared/network_server.cpp#L97-L111
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> one problem is probably there
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `sha256_update(&Sha256, (unsigned char*)&Addr, sizeof(20)); //omit port, bad idea?`
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only hashes sizeof(20) = 4 bytes
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that is just the address type, so it is the same token for everyone
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut ^
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Huh? I got this from ddnet
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice, that's how you find a ddnet vulnerability
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Whats the problem here?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/2f760e3e40b58a838191e60127a84bafa7bf70ea
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sizeof(20) is 4
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you're only hashing the first 4 byte of the NETADDR struct
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why did learath do thaz
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz 20 is a int right, sizeof gets the size of the type
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why is 20 there
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably meant 20 instead of sizeof(20)
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 ðŸ‘€
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> still questionable code, but might work
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks for looking into it @heinrich5991, also good for ddner :)
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> has been in the code for 2 months
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ddnet*
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sizeof(20)??? god I'm dense
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 why is the port omitted?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> because that's what @timakro did
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's because the masterserver uses 2 different ports to communicate
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yep
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> teeworlds 0.7 also hashes the port
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro can you elaborate why this is necessary?
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the hacky way tokens are handled in the register code only stores one token per master server ip
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> What learath said. It's just using the same token logic for the connless master server communication as for communication with regular 0.7 clients
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> We could differentiate there but I was just lazy ^^
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the regular 0.7 server also hashes the port together with the IP address, that can't be the only thing
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 but 0.7 tokenmanager handles all tokens per ip+port
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah but we don't have to, right?
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the way we did it is very much a hack
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that is, *I* can't think of a new attack that this would enable
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> If it's coming from the same ip it should be fine
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, what I said above, I can't see any new attacks that this opens up
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, what I said above, I can't see any new attack vectors that this opens up
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's something that should probably be mentioned in the PR though
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that we no longer hash the full net address
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> You can hijack other teeworlds players in your LAN :)
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh yes CGNAT
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so there is a problem there
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> never heard of that
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> another time that shows that just because we don't see a problem doesn't mean there isn't onbe
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I should really not compromise on security ðŸ˜¦
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> CG what
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro where the provider does the NAT
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when you don't get a full IPv4 address anymore
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but share it with others
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Wow
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so we should hash IP address and port
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Didn't know there is something like that
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "carrier grade network address translation"
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't have the time to patch it up
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess we have enough 0.7 clients that disabling it until a fix is not feasible?
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> That's insane, it's bad enough that you have to pay enormous sums to get a static ip at your home
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro it's mostly a consequence of not having enough IPv4 addresses
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yep, if only ipv6 was widely supported ...
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm living in a dorm of my university where I get a static IPv4 for free, but we don't have IPv6 .. its wild
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm curious how you would fix it, I don't even know why the masterservers use different ports. I just remember being stuck on this for a while until I figured it out and then just went the quick route (like usually with this project ^^)
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, waay to many 0.7 clients
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the masterservers use different ports so that they can "check" whether you have ports forwarded
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if they just reply back on the same port, the NAT will route it back (because it's seen as part of the same UDP "connection")
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so they use a different port to check if outside clients could possibly connect. not bulletproof, some NATs separate by IP address not IP address and port
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Ah makes sense
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> You should just omit the port for master server communication then, this should be relatively easy to do. Just gotta figure out a not too painful path to pass that information down. Unless the master servers use CGNAT this will be fine
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> The core reason why this hack (and also some others) are required here is that the vanilla 0.7 servers use randomly generated tokens and store them. I decided to use ip hash tokens everywhere because I didn't want to include the logic for storing tokens.
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 Zwelf : We don't bundle sqlite3 on Linux and Mac? On Mac build I get "You must install SQLite3 to compile DDNet"
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro My home connection is with Vodafone atm and they don't offer IPv6 either...
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its rare to not have sqlite3 in linux
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont have ipv6 either
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, for Linux it uses the bundled one correctly
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ok, this seems to work: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2550
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh well, another linking error on Mac:
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```

19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Weird that this pops up now, I don't remember changing anything recently with curl
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 @heinrich5991 any ideas?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen are you still linking with compiler-rt properly?
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I thought so, didn't change anything
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 linking clang or linking DDNet?
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 linking curl or linking DDNet?
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because I didn't change curl since May 1
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> uhm, I think it only gets linked while linking ddnet
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i have a problem that appeared about 2 years ago.
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> so i never close my client.   sometimes when i leave my pc for an hour i logout but its still running. when i come back, login and try to go back in my client it instantly crashes. it is only after i lock/unlock my pc and i figure that a little time has to pass.  its not a big deal to just restart the client but sometimes i loose mapping progress
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I googled for the issue and found my own fix, yay: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/e8bd8459a6f556594f48f33f4d145033bc89d46f
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No idea why we removed it again, I guess I'll try readding
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or maybe I'll rebuild osxcross first
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> might be a local clang update somehow disabling it
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 @Learath2 I see:
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Manually-specified variables were not used by the project: CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE. is it related?
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh that's quite odd
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did we change something about cmake?
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We removed it because it creates executables that won't run on newer macOS
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `___isOSVersionAtLeast` isn't in the flat namespace anymore so dyld won't find it
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hi if u touch a startline in practice mode and /r before touching the ground, it will tp you back behind the startline and also reset ur time at the top of the screen to the server time
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and if u touch startline again it wont put it to 0:00
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> might be a little bug
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and if u touch startline again it wont put it to 0:00 but you are still technically racing cause you can't join another team
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 any idea how to fix?
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis so then you can't finish?
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen you can link verbosely to see if compiler-rt is getting pulled in
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> @deen
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> Hello how i can start translate game for Ukrainian
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> ?
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @deen ye u cant finish in practice (it doesn't say "your team finished in 00:00 but because you're in practice mode blah blah") it acts as if u never touched start
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™ check in data/languages/ukrainean.txt
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> thats where?
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> on guthub?
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> where DDNet.exe is
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> on github?
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> oh
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can edit it and restart client to try it
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> on files?
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, file. when it's done, upload on github.
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> bruh but where that
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> on data
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> oh
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> sry
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> :lel:
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen the docs say you can try
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ``` echo "int main(void){return 0;}" | xcrun clang -xc -o/dev/null -v - 2>&1 | \ grep "libclang_rt" 1>/dev/null && echo "Success"```
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, that's not working
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I rebuilt osxcross and compiler-rt though
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just a ./build.sh; ./build_compiler_rt.sh
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And did you execute the commands build_compiler_rt.sh tells u to?
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Told me nothing:
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ./build_compiler_rt.sh
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ## Building compiler-rt (release/10.x) ##
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> looks like it failed I guess
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So I guess I have to rerun this every time my system clang is updated then
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> @deen why that not setup
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> a languege
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> on game
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't understand
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> im added some words
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> but we dont replace on game
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> did you restart the game after editing and saving the file?
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> yes
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you should only edit the text after ==
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not the original english text
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> im maked that
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> im edited after==
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> example
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> ```
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> Kill=Ð’Ð±Ð¸Ñ‚Ð¸
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> ```
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> Look that?
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Looks very wrong ðŸ˜„ It should be
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Kill
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> == Ð’Ð±Ð¸Ñ‚Ð¸
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> ?
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astralâœ¨|CryingðŸŒ™> lol wut
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u need to follow the correct format
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> just replace words
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bruh
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 they pipe all errors to /dev/null, thus I missed interesting stuff like:
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> fatal: Unable to create '/home/deen/git/osxcross/build/compiler-rt/.git/index.lock': Permission denied
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 didnt read the whole conversation, why cant I just use sizeof(Addr)m
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?"
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> *
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> timakro and Learath2 said their 0.7 compatibility code relied on the port not being hashed
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 so i can use  the sizeof(addr) instead? i only use it for ddnet connections, not for 0.7 ones
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I believe sizeof(addr) is what caused your undebuggable issues before, because addr contained padding bytes
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 22 or sizeof(addr)-2 would work
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> as i said, i only use it for 0.6
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> should be no problem there
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> my issue had another cause and was only on 0.7
