00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea ðŸ˜„ shortly after ours
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wonder if @unique_2 and @Alisa started playing another game ^^
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wtf, is that a terminal game?
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> people still make & play these ?
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <califrniatbb> I'll help 10 individuals how to earn $20,000 in just 72 hours  from the crypto market. But you will pay me 10% commission when you receive your profit. if interested send me a direct message via WhatsApp by asking me HOW for more details on how to get started
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <califrniatbb> \> +1 (2297781881
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it was a terminal game, but people added graphics
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's also Nethack, which I also occasionally play:
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `ssh nethack.alt.org` or just `nethack` if you install it (should be available in all distributions)
04:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so cool that it's based on ssh
04:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> er started via ssh
05:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lifesy> .
08:39 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 how much did the ddnet master code change on the server side? Where would I hide players? still in server.cpp?
08:47 <+ChillerDragon> got it should be fixed now https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/commit/9147109dca56c8d53b23dd2285616ffe4b47a4bb

09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: looks good to me
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/sg6tia/is_waylands_integrated_vsync_an_issue/
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> is vsync not an option for tw?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> when laser bounces does anything change about its properties (not about length or anything but how it's calculated in the engine)
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> what?
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> when u bounce laser before it hits someone in freeze they can do a nade jump no matter what
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if its an instant hit, it depends on client id
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> are there multiple tees neer the target?
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> are there multiple tees near the target?
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no, just one
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait ill make a video real quick
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/984497321398141068/stronghamma_2022-06-09_11-40-20.demo.mp4
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> interesting
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> so much undefined features xD
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah and im not sure how the nade jump works in the first place
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cause usually you have to nade the tick after the jump for it to work (if you do it while unfrozen on same tick, it just acts as a jump)
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe the order they are executed in is different if you are frozen?
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Was that always like that? @louis  or did you figure that out only recently
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its always been like that
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Not Keks  xD Microsoft also uses discussions to put them on a graveyard <https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/issues/2757#event-6780113000>
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Not Keks  xD Microsoft also uses discussions to put issues on a graveyard <https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/issues/2757#event-6780113000>
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> This is another example of the weak hook issue. Even though the weak hook strength is fixed in 0.7, the player collision of tees still relies on the character order. Maybe @Not Keks's fix for the collision also works on this
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I just noted that teleport laser is really strange on teleport surfaces
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> i always wondered if one day the copy-dummy will be improved, as it is rn, only a few people with a very good network can plays solo parts with it (so it's kind of "unfair") for the others, it makes a little latency related to the network and it breaks the real position where the tee should be
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> We have a PR open to improve it, just needs some more testers maybe
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> oh, well that's nice
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> i thought it shouldn't be possible to improve it ^^

21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Anyway to import a ghost into the same map if the map got changed by 1 tile?
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD thats actually a good point. I also tought about that already, but now it is even more relevant since we are on the way to change all maps, with irrelevant blocks
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> In principle you could just rename your ghost file, using the hash of the new map
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> we could maybe add an option to allow also ghost with mismatching hashes
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> How do i find the hash of the new map though?
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> are you on windows?
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> look into the downloadedmaps folder in your %appdata%/teeworlds directory (or ddnet directory)
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> there are all maps with there hash
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> the go in the ghosts folder... find your ghost and change the hash after the _
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> the go in the ghosts folder... find your ghost and change the hash after last the _
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> kk ty
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> doesnt work
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> could a single input be used and the input be "multiplexed" for the dummy? i am curious how the dummy copy is implemented.
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> like client sends one input. the input gets doubled server side. for perfect sync, no matter the ping
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> example freez-bar in freeze active @Not Keks .
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I also thought about making it a bit transparent if you sit in freeze, but I think that is maybe also strange
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/984571240595456010/unknown.png
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> the inputs are just copied 1:1 and send to the server in the dummy connection
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> but the tick that was send to the server differs in this PR
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> the dummy maintained a different tick then the player
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I will just add the allways on freeze to the next PR, and see what the nightly tester say
