00:01 < laxa> heinrich5991: on this chan, Nimda announces server status (going down/up) / map releases for ddrace / new peak of players.
00:01 <@deen> for ddrace?
00:01 < heinrich5991> I thought nimda was noother's bot?
00:01 < laxa> It is
00:01 < laxa> but this one is my own copy
00:01 < laxa> nimda is opensource
00:01 < heinrich5991> why not ddmax then?
00:01 < heinrich5991> ah
00:02 < laxa> and I made those plugins myself :)
00:03 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network CHN went down!
00:03 <@deen> Maybe the status message is not such a good idea^^
00:03 <@deen> I have 80% packet loss to China
00:03 < laxa> I don't care, it's not my idea xD.
00:04 <@deen> The japanese guy on China was pretty good
00:05 < laxa> deen: learn to use IRC and give us some sweet +v please!
00:05 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network CHN went back online!
00:06 <@deen> don't see a need
00:06 < laxa> the day a spammer comes, you can just do !lockdown

00:54 < laxa> deen: 2 new demos for Hall of Fame.
00:55 < laxa> [School] Hook + Petjack 2
00:57 <@deen> laxa: not uploaded yet?
00:58 < laxa> Need to record + encode + upload
00:58 <@deen> ok, i thought you meant they're finished
00:58 <@deen> Wait, did someone upload Steff fastrun 2?
00:58 <@deen> We don't even have that map, do we?^^
00:58 < laxa> yes xD
00:58 <@deen> hahaha
00:58 < laxa> It's ddracemax RACE server
00:58 < laxa> and not even #1

01:09 < Savander> good night guys

01:11 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network CHN went down!
01:13 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network CHN went back online!
01:14 < laxa> deen: new feature idea !
01:15 < laxa> file like autoexec.cfg that get executed each time you join a server :p
01:15 <@deen> hm
01:16 <@deen> so you can say something immediately or why?
01:16 < laxa> so I could do that : say /emote happy 999; /showall; 
01:16 <@deen> yeah, that might be difficult
01:16 <@deen> If you find a solution to find the right time for doing that, I'd do it
01:16 <@deen> also: these commands would get printed on vanilla servers
01:17 < laxa> then, make it like it
01:17 < laxa> mod_autoexec.cfg
01:17 < laxa> one file for each mod
01:17 < laxa> so you can say hi to everyone :)
01:17 <@deen> hm
01:17 <@deen> not sure if i like that
01:18 < laxa> It's just an idea.
01:18 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network CHN went down!
01:18 <@deen> I'm off. Good night

14:53 < KinG_> hi all hi deen  :P
14:53 <@deen> hi
14:53 < KinG_> deen:  will it make diffrence if i upgrade ram to 1GB?
14:53 <@deen> no
14:53 < heinrich5991> hi KinG_ :)
14:53 <@deen> they can promise you what they want
14:53 <@deen> we only need 150 MB
14:54 < KinG_> hi heinrich5991 
14:54 < heinrich5991> :)
14:54 < KinG_> deen:  so should i pay them to not share the resources?
14:54 <@deen> hm
14:54 <@deen> i don't know
14:55 < KinG_> so we just need ram not cpu right?
14:55 <@deen> we need cpu too
14:55 < KinG_> u mean cpu is the lagging problem?
14:55 <@deen> with 4 players it uses 20% cpu
14:55 <@deen> that's not normal
14:56 < KinG_> cause there is only 1 cpu ^^
14:56 <@deen> no
14:57 <@deen> it's because they share 1 cpu between many people
14:57 < KinG_> i k
14:57 < KinG_> i mean if i tell them and pay them not to share just we use the resources will it be enough?
14:58 <@deen> probably
14:58 <@deen> but the lags may also be network related
14:58 < KinG_> no
14:58 < KinG_> the datacenter we buy vps from don't lag it gives 0.00%packet loss
14:58 <@deen> but high ping
14:59 < KinG_> i ping 57 in ddnet persian  and 63in persian pro i never had ping under 63 in persian pro
14:59 <@deen> ok
14:59 <@deen> then just bad from europe maybe
15:00 < KinG_> i think lag is just because there is so much swap and the read,writhe/sec is too low from hdd
15:03 < EastByte> deen: how about setting up a timer in ddnet srv which measures the time needed for a tick
15:04 < EastByte> we could easily find out whether the process is hanging
15:09 < _KinG> deen: can u give me root password plz?
15:11 < _KinG> deen:  u there?
15:12 < _KinG> nvm bor acmeback
15:12 < _KinG> cameback*
15:19 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network Persian went down!
15:20 < _KinG> i know
15:20 < Savander> xD
15:21 < _KinG> it'll be okay by night
15:21 < _KinG> the ram problem will be fixed i guess ^^
15:35 <@deen> EastByte: don't know if that's necessary
15:37 < EastByte> hm what actually happens if the swap is accessed
15:37 < KinG1_> what do u mean?
15:37 < EastByte> does it waste cpu time?
15:38 < EastByte> I think so
15:38 < KinG1_> not actually i guess it's just the HDD that work slower
15:39 < EastByte> if cpu instruction wants to access memory which actually is swapped
15:39 < EastByte> it needs to wait until the data is in ram
15:39 < EastByte> which would increase cpu load
15:39 < EastByte> or not
15:40 < KinG1_> every thing ^^
15:40 < heinrich5991> when the program accesses a memory page that is currently swapped out, the cpu hits an unmapped memory page. the os catches the attempt to access that page and halts the process. it then tries to read the page from the hdd into the memory. the seeking on the hdd will be the longest part of everything. when the page is in RAM again, the program continues
15:40 < EastByte> ah, yes
15:40 < heinrich5991> (the os might need to swap out a page that's currently in use to create space for the swap-in)
15:41 < EastByte> but the os can give control to another process in that time I guess
15:41 < heinrich5991> yes
15:41 <@deen> hi
15:41 <@deen> EastByte: yes
15:41 < EastByte> so you can't find out whether a process hang due to swapping
15:41 < KinG1_> hi again
15:41 < EastByte> heinrich5991: oh I though deen were talking
15:42 < EastByte> was*
15:46 < EastByte> deen: I like the idea of the tick time measurement, you could compare your servers of reliability for example
15:46 <@deen> EastByte: hm
15:46 < EastByte> since 90% are virtual servers :P
15:50 < EastByte> heinrich5991: you should take part at the ddnet tournament today :)
15:50 < EastByte> it's a novice map I guess
15:51 < EastByte> ya
15:51 < heinrich5991> novice = easy? :)
15:51 <@deen> No, Kobra 1 +2 were Novice
15:51 <@deen> but Kobra 3 is Brutal 5 stars
15:51 < heinrich5991> that sounds hard
15:51 < EastByte> you are kidding^^
15:51 < KinG1_> WTF
15:51 < EastByte> Quick Tournament #20 with the Novice map "Kobra 3"
15:51 <@deen> haha
15:51 < KinG1_> brutal 5 stars? :O
15:51 < KinG1_> stop kidding ^^
15:51 < heinrich5991> oh EastByte, I played with you quite often, right?
15:51 < heinrich5991> you're east in-game?
15:51 < EastByte> yes
15:51 < EastByte> well, was not that often
15:51 <@deen> play together in tournament!
15:51 < heinrich5991> oh, hi east :)
15:52 < EastByte> hi heinrich5991 :D
15:52 < heinrich5991> nah, he's pretty good, I'm not
15:52 < KinG1_> deen:  i added 1 core cpu lets hope it'll work
15:52 < heinrich5991> I just play for fun :)
15:52 <@deen> KinG1_: ok
15:52 <@deen> KinG1_: i just heard from some persian players that they like DDNet Persian but it lags too much
15:52 < EastByte> heinrich5991: on a map like that, skill is not important
15:52 < KinG1_> i know
15:53 < KinG1_> lag is just the ram thing it gives 0%packet loss
15:53 < heinrich5991> EastByte: is the map already out?
15:53 < EastByte> nope
15:53 < heinrich5991> okay
15:53 < EastByte> released at 20:00 were the tournament starts
15:53 < EastByte> the winner is the team which finishes first
15:54 < heinrich5991> meh
15:54 < heinrich5991> if that works, fine :)
15:54 < KinG1_> and deen  persian pro wants to take down the ddnet evilsaeed juast told me himself he made a mode on windows and if he public it noone will come to play in ddnet but he is definitly wrong cause the mode he have got bugs and cheats like /solo,,,/r  or when u pause the tee disappears thats bullshit
15:54 < EastByte> and if the ddos protection doesn't kick us out
15:55 < heinrich5991> I dunno, I *should* really be learning for my exam in three days :/
15:55 < heinrich5991> but I guess at 20:00 I could spare some time
15:55 < KinG1_> deen:  and don't forget to run one server just for tournoment plz vps will be up in a few mins
16:01 < KinG1_> deen:  u here? &_&
16:02 < Nimda> [DDNet]Network Persian went back online!
16:02 < Savander> heinrich5991: , maybe you know
16:02 < Savander> and you can help me
16:02 < heinrich5991> Savander: what's your question?
16:03 < KinG1_> Savander:  i gtg just tell deen  to run 1 server just for tournament i'll be back to play kobra3 ^^
16:03 < KinG1_> bye all
16:05 < Savander> second
16:05 <@deen> yes
16:06 < laxa> deen: any new plugin for nimda idea ?
16:07 <@deen> laxa: make a teeworlds client as a nimda plugin and remote controllable from irc
16:07 < laxa> lol
16:07 < laxa> Seems too hard for me!
16:07 < EastByte> I can add an api to my bouncer :)
16:08 < EastByte> then we could do cool stuff like chatting with ingame people
16:08 < EastByte> or mirror the tw chat in an own irc channel
16:16 < heinrich5991> fisted and eeeee did that once
16:17 < heinrich5991> however they just piped the teeworlds server's output into IRC
16:17 <@deen> laxa: the server side demo recording didn't work out
16:17 < laxa> I read that :(.
16:17 <@deen> laxa: servers lagged every few seconds on GER with just 100 players
16:17 < EastByte> heinrich5991: I did it once aswell :)
16:18 < EastByte> but my self written irc lib was rubbish
16:19 < EastByte> and the ingame players won't ever understand that messages are coming from irc
16:19 < EastByte> deen: I bet it's the storage access :P
16:20 <@deen> EastByte: definitely
16:21 <@deen> i would need to make that threaded like the logger
16:21 <@deen> and don't like the idea of that
16:21 < Savander> https://github.com/savander/zcatch/commit/2a54f759145f86fce4ad2a333de6d9cd911d8861 <-- Ranking (don't look at "src/game/server/entities/ranking.cpp" (second file), my mistake :P)  and i have problem with http://pastebin.com/45CrB42N  (From gdb) ... have no idea what's going on.. maybe you know?;/ 
16:22 < Savander> can you check? please guys :cc
16:22 <@deen> Savander: this again?^^
16:22 < Savander> ye
16:22 < Savander> still this!!
16:22 < Savander> xd
16:22 < Savander> :(
16:22 < EastByte> I need to prepare a presentation for tomorrow
16:22 < EastByte> sry :D
16:22 <@deen> i still believe the CRanking isn't initialized properly
16:22 < Savander> :(
16:22 < Savander> but i don't know
16:22 < Savander> i did it same
16:22 < Savander> to ddrace
16:22 < Savander> :P
16:22 <@deen> otherwise it makes no sense that it segfaults on accessing m_pServer
16:22 < Savander> (i guess)
16:24 <@deen> i can't even compile it
16:24 <@deen> src/game/server/ranking.h:6:30: fatal error: mysql_connection.h: No such file or directory #include <mysql_connection.h>
16:24 < Savander> lol?
16:24 <@deen> you should add other/mysql
16:24 < Savander> i add
16:24 < Savander> added
16:24 < Savander> maybe ...
16:24 < Savander> wait
16:25 < Savander> yya
16:25 < Savander> i forgot
16:25 < Savander> -.-
16:25 < Savander> to commit it
16:25 <@deen> is CONF_SQL set to true?
16:25 < Savander> you mean?
16:25 < Savander> bam server_sql_release?
16:26 < Savander> or what xd
16:26 <@deen> gamecontext.cpp:2069
16:26 <@deen> #if defined(CONF_SQL) m_Ranking = new CRanking(this);
16:26 <@deen> #endif
16:26 <@deen> i don't see CONF_SQL being set anywhere
16:26 < Savander> em, i don't know
16:27 < Savander> it's black magic for me (defined etc)
16:27 < Savander> as i said..
16:28 < Savander> i copied it (mysql) from ddrace, and i looked into source how it was used
16:28 <@deen> but you have to set CONF_SQL in bam.lua
16:28 < Savander> ah
16:28 < Savander> ye, so yes
16:28 < Savander> i copie bam.lua too
16:28 < Savander> ;P
16:28 <@deen> no
16:28 <@deen> it's not in there
16:28 < Savander> Sooo?
16:28 <@deen> so add it!
16:29 < Savander> it is!
16:29 < Savander> release_sql_settings.cc.defines:Add("CONF_RELEASE", "CONF_SQL")
16:29 < Savander> debug_sql_settings.cc.defines:Add("CONF_DEBUG", "CONF_SQL")
16:30 <@deen> you forgot to commit that i'd guess
16:30 < Savander> ehm
16:30 < Savander> hmmm
16:30 < Savander> i have 2 folder
16:30 < Savander> so maybe yes
16:30 < Savander> xd
16:30 < Savander> -.-
16:33 <@deen> i go afk a bit
16:36 < Savander> deen: now.. :c

16:50 < EastByte> 17 users!
16:52 < laxa> Just received a 50 euros donation <3
16:52 < EastByte> for ddracepro?
16:53 < laxa> for the teamspeak server
16:53 < EastByte> ah
16:53 < laxa> it's been about more than a year that some french people are on it
18:26 <@deen> !ddnetpeak

18:26 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 464 users online at 2014-09-14 20:25:02
18:27 < EastByte> yay
18:32 < nicetee> gz, can u help me? why when i connect to some servers my client download only 30% of map?
18:32 < nicetee> i use ddnet clien v.5.0.2
18:33 < EastByte> on every server?
18:33 < nicetee> nope
18:35 < heinrich5991> might be some fast download feature of either client, server or both
18:35 < nicetee> hm
18:35 < nicetee> ._.
18:36 <@deen> nicetee: it's a problem with fast download
18:36 <@deen> and packet loss i think
18:36 < laxa> deen: it also happens without.
18:36 <@deen> oh
18:36 < nicetee> how to fix it?
18:36 < EastByte> too much packet loss I guess
18:36 < laxa> it happened to me atleast on gores server from Qshar, being blocked on download.
18:36 <@deen> just escape and download again?
18:36 < nicetee> not work
18:37 < nicetee> all time download 30%
18:37 < nicetee> on ddnet servers work perfect
18:37 < laxa> what server ?
18:37 <@deen> oh, that's weird
18:38 < nicetee> i dont remember name
18:38 < laxa> <_<
18:38 < nicetee> same error in my server
18:38 < nicetee> i use xxlddrace
18:38 < laxa> IP ?
18:38 < laxa> and port
18:38 < nicetee> 1 sec
18:39 < laxa> !twp nicetee
18:39 < Nimda> No nicetee found online.
18:39 < laxa> just do that : !twp yournick when you are on the serv er
18:39 < nicetee> 188.40.138.137
18:39 < nicetee> port standart
18:40 < laxa> working for me
18:40 < nicetee> if map more than 30kb
18:40 < nicetee> ~
18:40 < nicetee> oh /_/
18:41 < nicetee> my client download 31 kb and stop downloading
18:46 <@deen> only with ddnet client or every client?
18:48 < nicetee> only ddnet
18:49 <@deen> then it probably is fast download related
18:49 < nicetee> how to disable?
18:49 <@deen> you can't i think
18:50 < nicetee> oh
18:50 < EastByte> is there a players per team limit today?
18:52 <@deen> no
18:52 < EastByte> okay
18:52 <@deen> but i'd really wonder if a team with more than 2 wins on Novice
18:52 < Savander> deen: can you try now? (You know.. this "ranking".........."
18:52 < Savander> or not
18:52 < EastByte> right
18:52 < Savander> Tournament soon
18:53 < Savander> so no
18:53 <@deen> Savander: i tried, but it said i don't have enough players for rank
18:53 < Savander> huh??
18:53 < Savander> noo
18:53 <@deen> how many need to connect?
18:53 < Savander> not for rank
18:53 < Savander> i conosole
18:53 <@deen> how do i use it?
18:53 < Savander> write "last"
18:53 < Savander> and press tab
18:53 < Savander> set it to 1
18:53 < Savander> then just kill your dummy
18:53 < Savander> (endround)
18:56 <@deen> you set m_Ranking in gamecontext.cpp
18:56 <@deen> but then you set a new one in CGameController_zCatch and don't initialize that
18:57 < nicetee> how to change gametype in sorce? /ddnet/src/game/server/gamemodes/gamemode.h right?
18:58 < Savander> hm
18:58 <@deen> nicetee: no idea
18:58 < Savander> aaah
18:59 <@deen> Savander: i think you need to pass the m_Ranking pointer (after initializing it!) to your zcatch object
19:00 < Savander> so i should
19:00 < Savander> delete CRanking *m_Ranking;
19:00 < Savander> from zcatch.hj
19:00 < Savander> and use 	GameServer()->m_Ranking->SaveRanking(m_WinnerClientID);
19:00 <@deen> Oh shit
19:00 < Savander> (don't know i thinking :c)
19:00 <@deen> Savander: yeah
19:00 < Savander> okay, thanks <33
19:00 <@deen> Has anyone seen Hallowed1986 yet?
19:00 < Savander> I'll try
19:00 < Savander> nope
19:00 <@deen> Damn!
19:01 <@deen> Maybe he doesn't even know it's a tournament today
19:01 < Savander> Maybe
19:01 < EastByte> Maybe
19:01 < Savander> no skype?
19:01 <@deen> offline in skype for 3 days
19:02 < Savander> lul.
19:02 < Savander> so i don't kknow
19:02 < Savander> maybe he streaming
19:02 < Savander> right now?
19:02 < nicetee> #ifndef GAME_MODE_H
19:02 < nicetee> #define GAME_MODE_H
19:02 < nicetee> #define GAME_NAME "DDraceNetwork"
19:02 < nicetee> #define TEST_NAME "TestDDraceNetwork"
19:02 < nicetee> #endif
19:02 < EastByte> nicetee: why you don't just try it?
19:02 < nicetee> i change GAME_NAME "DDraceNetwork" to GAME_NAME "DDrace"
19:03 < nicetee> and when i login as admin i can use only 1 comand
19:03 < nicetee> after this commands not work :o
19:03 <@deen> nicetee: yeah, that's the rcon spoofing protection
19:03 < Savander> deen: !!
19:03 < Savander> WORKS !<3
19:03 < Savander> thanks 
19:04 <@deen> nicetee: and now your client doesn't know that the server has rcon spoofing protection
19:04 < nicetee> :o
19:04 <@deen> it was necessary because people were attacking ddnet servers like that
19:06 < heinrich5991> deen: you can send the logout signal after an rcon command
19:06 <@deen> heinrich5991: exactly what we do
19:06 < heinrich5991> k nvm then
19:07 < nicetee> so, i cant change gametype? right?
19:07 <@deen> nicetee: remove line 1140 in server.cpp
19:07 <@deen> then it works but you lose the protection
19:07 <@deen> otherwise you need to update your client as well
19:07 < nicetee> oh no
