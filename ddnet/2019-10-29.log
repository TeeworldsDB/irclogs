09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <teini94> what about a /hide command to hide the sleep emotes (for example on dummy maps)
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you can disable them client side
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cl_afk_mark or something like that
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bois! I just failed my first graded homework from university!
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> It was literally hello world in java xxxxxxxxD
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So what did you do, write it in TW-style C++ instead?
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hopefully you didn't try to get remote access to the grader's system. I remember some student got expelled for trying that on an assignment ðŸ˜„
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Lol i got a nephew who said to the school the security wasn't good
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Then they didn't do anything about it so as prove it wasn't good he broke into the system.
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> The he got expelled:kek:
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Responsible disclosure is key :P
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They mitigate issues with the school security in a very straightforward way here. They only let us sumbit programs on paper
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon how do you fail a System.out println anyway?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd its me @Learath2 i manage to fail a lot of things
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This class is excessively boring. Given I'll start attending all the classes, I'll have a lot of time to work on ddnet :P
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Nice to hear ðŸ™‚
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> meh, I started getting such a horrible ping to ger.ddnet.tw
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd usually call my ISP but I don't even know how to state the fact that their routing is shit in italian
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Whis> Use tracerouteng to check
