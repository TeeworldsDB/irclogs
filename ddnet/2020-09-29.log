05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> With those ^ & soon assets changer, maybe `config_directory.bat` could be renamed to `assets_directory.bat` / `assets_and_config_directory.bat` or possibly there could be two with such names, pointing to exactly same place - just to reduce the confusion
06:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats true
06:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> would make sense
07:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Feels like downloadable game tiles are on the way too ðŸ˜„
07:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I would love to add some custom assets in the future as I use katana pickup as a taxi sign and it confuses players, have to explain every time what it is.
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 ðŸ‘€
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ‘€
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 here starts the meta war
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah variable naming I think we all mostly would agree on
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i meant PascalCase
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tbh
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt remember the name
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let's add a default editor to the ddnet project. Now that would be a war
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vim obviously
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> all lower case, pointers end with _
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> every english word is seperated by _
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> all lower case, pointers end with _
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> every english word is seperated by _ 
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> pointers end with every english word? ðŸ˜„
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my vim supports :Format and uses clang format
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i forgot
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont even need the script
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i just hate discord xd
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> english words seperated by _ is snake case
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> snake_case ðŸ˜„
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats how i started learning cpp xd
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then there is the kebab-case, which is very :extremenouis:
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but honestly i hate it
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a point that points to for example the middle of an array wouldnt be prefixed with a a right? i guess it is just a pointer
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah, that's just a pointer
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> decayed pointer
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth like that
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, it's actually not possible to know the difference between two pointers one of which pointing to an int and another pointing to an array of ints
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder who made backend_sdl.cpp and decided to ignore all the naming rules
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not at compile time anyway
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i wonder who named it backend_sdl if 99% of the code there is opengl xd
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what other backends they were planning ðŸ˜„
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> directx 6
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> directdraw
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ohgod
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly, the way the gfx code is laid out never really made much sense to me
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tbh the whole codebase makes no sense to me
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> same
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but u live with it
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The whole base has some pattern it follows atleast
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Graphics is like 5 different classes
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is graphics trully threaded?
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Btw this thing we do of swapping on the worker threads is a completely unsupported setup
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> igraphics, ienginegraphics, cgraphics, cgraphics_threade, cpgrahics_threaded_lockfree, cgraphics_threaded_lockfree_vulkan
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> SDL says it's undefined behaviour to swap on any thread except the main thread
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sometimes having isomething and then csomething becomes tiresome specially to add things
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i guess its useful somewhere..
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 interesting, normally its undefined, if it doesnt hold the opengl context
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 wasnt it ok to swap where the opengl context is?
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki it's nice to have a defined API between two components. I kinda like interfaces honestly
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but usually those interfaces are only implemented by 1 class
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in our small projects yes
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah im not talking about firefox here
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> OpenGL is fine with it, SDL introduces some OS specific complexities that arent safe on other threads though. Like `NSWindow:update` on macOS
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki yeah only one class implements them but it gives a nice clean interface. I guess that could also be achieved by formatting the class in such a way that it's declaration can be used as documentation
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This way we have a kernel which I also like actually. idk I have a soft spot for singleton patterns, mostly because pompous ivy league "engineers" don't like it
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> learath is based
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/760408288683622430/unknown.png
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Help me with my crusade against the academics or as I like to call them the backseat engineers
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh i also hate some academics
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some teacher refused to use return inside forloops
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and stuff like that
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder if that guy actually programmed
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki makes control flow much easier
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if you only have one place to return, easier to reason with
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He refused because technically it breaks the rules of structured programming. ^^
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though even knuth himself said a single exit point is not too important. When the guy who made the paradigm says it's pointless, I think it's time to quit your fanboyism
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I misremembered, it was Djikstra who came up with structured programming
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That man was the prime example of a toxic academic
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Knuth is really the only academic that seems to understand the actual complexities of the field
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Funnily enough, one of the first people who seems to think the early exit is not an issue seem to be the C++ people. (RAII helps a lot with the issues that early exits can cause)
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen 
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> "Then the info text would also fit in 5:4 again"
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what info text isnt fitting?, i cant find anything
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> our code is not academic :justatest:
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah its probs only with video recorder
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nvm
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki we shouldn't stop until we can prove that ddnet runs, we should move to haskell so we can actually do that
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i rly want to learn haskell
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i remember having problems with the rls i think
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i rly need a rls
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i rly need a lsp
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk whats happening to me
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rls -> lsp
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª yes, with video recorder
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder why the RLS doesn't implement the LSP
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u mean rust one?
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> RLS is going to be abandoned probs
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust-analyzer is taking over
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its better
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u should use it
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't do much rust to care anyway
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> based
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish I had more to use haskell on, it's actually not too bad to code on and I'd love a reason to learn more
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt hedgewars made with haskell
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so u can prove hedgewars
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> runs
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder where the hedgewars guy that was in the irc channel is
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only good candidate for a ddnet/teeworlds rewrite seems to be rust nowadays
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sadly, I wish we had a little more choice
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well competing against c++ is hard
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> D always looked quite promising to me, but I don't like it's runtime much
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i guess modern ppl prefer languages to be higher lvl
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why do people want their languages to be glorified english? :pepehands:
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 elixir or haskell
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is there a difference
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The difference is that I never used elixir ðŸ˜›
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think elixir is based on erlang
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the "super escalable language"
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or so i read
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability.
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how they managed to make a "massively scalable soft real-time" VM
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki only the hedgewars server
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which is usually neither scalable nor good for real-time applications without a JIT
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> fine or too ugly
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/760413893964070922/screenshot_2020-09-29_10-12-53.png
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what changed?
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 2 rows
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the buttons
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Skip the 2 rows I htink
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Swap*
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the Date
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> being rounded
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> inside that darker thing
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks bad imo
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it also triggers me that the dark thing with the stats is a bit smaller
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> white text on white button is worst xd
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª so you're that "nameless tee" guy I keep seeing on DDNet ðŸ˜„
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno @deen, only if he has purple skin ðŸ˜„
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nono, in my mind all nameless tees I ever met are just you
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> my 100 dev clients always open
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i wish file://
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> could just highlight the file in the directory
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/715519f34099a82640faf748531ebedf0916e596
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i tried it, but it wants to open the demo file ðŸ˜„
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª I bet there is an OS specific way to do this that we can wrap in a system.h function
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah probably
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> probably not on Linux
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah yep, not on linux
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well true, tho there are probs libs for that too
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe the X desktop specification gives a way to do it
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but can just use the current approach for linux as fallback
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> It won't select the first layer of a group with shift click if you had a layer of the group selected before.
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/760438796453281792/screenshot_2020-09-28_14-51-11.png
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @mind ^^ done while waiting for lunch
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Learath2 could you make it so editing attributes on multiple layers doesn't apply things that the user didn't touch? (for example trying to just resize layers makes them all black with 0 alpha)
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I've been having trouble with that actually
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the color sliders can be tied together as long as you can resize independently
16:53 < MalwareTele14> hi
16:53 <+MalwareTele14> hi ChillerDragon
16:54 <+MalwareTele14> is anyone here
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, many are on Discord
16:54 <+MalwareTele14> hi?
16:56 <@deen> hi MalwareTele14 
16:57 <+MalwareTele14> anyone wanna play among su
16:57 <+MalwareTele14> *among us
16:58 <+MalwareTele14> deen do you wanna play among us
17:00 <+MalwareTele14> deen wanna play
17:10 <@deen> Nope, not really
17:10 <@deen> This channel is mostly for DDNet development discussions
17:10 <@deen> You could try in #off-topic on https://ddnet.tw/discord
17:13 <+MalwareTele14> i dont have discord
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Axaris> something like this would be useful to have on block
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Axaris> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/760539356619997274/marker2.gif
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Axaris> something like enemy marker would be useful to have on block

18:50 <+ChillerDragon> if you forget who your enemys are they are not ur enemys
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> omg ddnet now has the 0.7 map based background?
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> epic
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Patiga in next release yes
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> just built it and thought it was 0.7 coz it looked so awesome ^^
19:21 <+ChillerDragon> @deen wow idk baut the animation
19:21 <+ChillerDragon> its a light animation and you guys seem to have removed the light so there is no point in keeping it?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not about the light
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> about the clouds moving
19:21 <+ChillerDragon> oh
19:22 <+ChillerDragon> but the light is still there is it?
19:22 <+ChillerDragon> and i also saw the clouds jumping its horrible
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, but I stopped the light from jumping around, made the change in brightness subtle
19:22 <+ChillerDragon> i wonder what caused this
19:22 <+ChillerDragon> why is there a random light in the sky ? :D
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, look at envelope 20 for example, they move one way for 5 min and then jump back to start instantly
19:22 <+ChillerDragon> jumping back to start should be out of sight
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> dunno, I just made a minimal change, I thought someone said it was supposed to be a lamp
19:22 <+ChillerDragon> everything else is weird
19:23 <+ChillerDragon> i said its a lamp
19:23 <+ChillerDragon> but there is not lamp
19:23 <+ChillerDragon> so its light from a removed lamp in the sky lol
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but it's not out of sight since we have a large area of the map that we use for menu positions probably
19:23 <+ChillerDragon> hm
19:24 <+ChillerDragon> well im lazy rn so either you do it ur self or u ping me tomorrow
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I tried, but I'm horrible with editor. so I created issue for you to remember
19:24 <+ChillerDragon> issue?
19:24 <+ChillerDragon> or just a comemnt?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> github issue
19:24 <+ChillerDragon> ah issue
19:24 <+ChillerDragon> so big
19:24 <+ChillerDragon> men im spamming u without contect
19:25 <+ChillerDragon> i just red 2 words from my github ping that i saw on my phone xd
19:25 <+ChillerDragon> !remind #2953 16 hours
