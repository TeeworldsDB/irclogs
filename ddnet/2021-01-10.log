04:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> HMM when im logged in and give timeout to someone else, would he be logged in then? :O
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Learath2 it sounds that if u would come to holland you could get a nice job. My sister got a job in the IT for a pretty big TV/telephone company. And she just followed a course of 3 months. After 2 years her salary is doubled and that without any experience.
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Problem for you is that you need to get in a normal day life rhythm.
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @n000b i dont think its easy to go to some random country right now and get a job
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even more with a pandemic
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:45 <+ChillerDragon> ryo botter confirmed https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610275355.png
11:47 <+ChillerDragon> nice effort to look into upstream configs @Kaffeine
11:48 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait u didnt
11:48 <+ChillerDragon> yea would be nice if you could do it tho @Kaffeine :) makes the code bases less different
11:51 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon nobo
11:51 <+Ryozuki> its cuz i was watching agdq
11:51 <+Ryozuki> and they mentioned it 
11:52 <+ChillerDragon> ur :robot: confirmed
11:52 <+ChillerDragon> :ban:
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Ryozuki probably not, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have a chance to succeed in getting a job.
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I added CConfig backport commit. I also kept the old API to reduce the changes for now (g_Config is used in 2500 places) and to not break others open PRs.
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 here? how would we extend our versioning scheme to more than one client?
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (for f-ddrace client in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3439)
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should it send a fake-ddrace version message and we add another field at the end for the client identifier?
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, what did we use in the clientver message? An int?
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's also a string in there
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we could use that as well
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but strings tend to get gnarly 😉
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> by any chance is there some mystical API available to get the information that's present on ddnet.tw?
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Дядя Женя you can download the full db somewhere
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> That's not really optimal for me
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then no, there's no API
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Question is how do we use the int. I think other clients should always report the latest ddnet client version they “support”
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> also it doesn't have latest finishes and other info
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don’t like checking client version to check if the client supports a feature but it’s the best we have
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, so I tell fokkonaut to use the ddnet version int, and to use a different string in the string and hope that we never have to distinguish between f-client and ddnet? ^^
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's true @ latest finishes. no, there is no such API (yet)
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess, I can’t really think of anything better. I guess we could use an uuid maybe?
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we could add another UUID for client identification
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I guess we'll wait for a use case to come up?
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> btw could you share a code with me for escaping characters in ddnet.tw urls?
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I don’t think there is much value in doing it early
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Дядя Женя it should be in ddnet-web
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or also in ddnet-scripts where we generate the pages
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it replaced characters with -%d-
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://ddnet.tw/players/-104--101--105--110--114--105--99--104--53--57--57--49-/
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yep, I'm correct 🙂
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `"".join("-{}-".format(ord(x)) for x in "heinrich5991")`
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What does it do with -?
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> escape, probably? ^^
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> ерч
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> thx
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have finally made it to fourier analysis. After wasting 2 months on taylor series and stupid convergence stuff
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’m on pace to become a math PhD in 2077
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3463 I like the non-scaling better, can I r+ this?
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep go ahead
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought about it and I don’t like the text changing size either
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut I answered on github btw: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3439#issuecomment-757494837
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then please you do it @heinrich5991
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 0.7 clamps the playerflags
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> while unpacking
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 should we maybe consider moving the aimline to ddnet playerflags?
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have to support the old way, sure and it will be redundant but maybe in another 10 years we can phase out the vanilla flag we stole 😛
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds good
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> still needs the capability tho
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so we can send the flag via the input
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't want to introduce a way for the input to get out of sync
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aaaaah I remember why I didn’t do it, we don’t have anymore flag space in ddnetplayer
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😦
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, then that gets shelved until someone™ implements the solution to that problem
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Snap objects can’t get out of sync tho, no?
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, but player input sent in different packets can
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I was just commenting that I still want to keep the aimline flag in the player input
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aah, I see what you mean. No way to do that without either extending input or using a flag that might belong to a vanilla feature, no?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> vanilla restricted itself with the flags
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for 0.7 we can be sure that vanilla will never add a flag there
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it would get dropped by old 0.7 servers
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, no need to bother with a ddnet playerflag then
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 can you give me a quick pointer where the protocol translation takes place?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish there was one such place. For game messages it’s in CGameContext, for system messages it’s in CServer. You should be able to grep for FromSixup to find the relevant parts
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ty 🙂
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For network level translation it’s very messy and mostly in UnpackPacket
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm interested where the player flags get capped for 0.7 clients
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the snapshot
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I renamed the functions sorry
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> SevenToSix is what you want to grep for
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But you sure we clamp the flags? I don’t remember capping them
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I need the other way
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. anyway, I'll find it I guess
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the aimline flag is sent to clients somewhere
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and I guess 0.7 checks that the character or wherever that flag is doesn't have anything out of range
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway if I do cap it it probably would be capped in CPlayer
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> kk 🙂
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `PlayerFlags_SixToSeven` apparently I don't cap it but I only send the ones that I know work 😄
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sorry, I know I've made a rather large mess with the 0.7 stuff, couldn't really keep the changes in a single place :/
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (not sure if it was avoidable tbf, a single part of the code where all the translation happens means you sometimes don't have all the necessary information anymore or you need to unpack stuff that was already packed)
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pacman 6.0 will allow parallel downloads
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://asciinema.org/a/Dkr5ocECp6dV294KVD8CopvzC
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice 🙂
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> although ­-- wouldn't pipelined suffice?
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thisd is rly nice specially if u have 600mbs internet
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz most mirrors are capped to 11mb/s
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i cant fully use my internet
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ehm
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i run that mirror tool often
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if the mirrors only support 11mb/s, that's probably their choice
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> adding more connections to the pool means they either upgrade their protection against that or you abuse that they forget it
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/reflector
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (unless you download from mutiple mirrors simultaneously)
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would be cool to use multiple mirrors in the parallel download
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> man
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> literally all gpus are out of stock
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this sucks
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why i cant buy
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> capitalism failed me
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even stuff like RX 5700 XT is out of stock
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gg
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the 3070 is overpriced rn at 800€
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats the price for the 3080...
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> capitalism probably says that you can have your 3080 if you're willing to pay enough
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true xd
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did  covid rly affect that much gpu manufacturers
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt it rly automated
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> ppl mine btc again cuz there is no liquid coins left to buy :D
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> so all gpus get sold hehe
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think the series 3k is the best for mining
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> usually amd gpus are better for that
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> or actual mining hardare
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> w
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ethereum is at 1k€
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> underpriced
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to invest in it
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the project is cool too
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u know what a dapp is
17:53 <+ChillerDragon> nah
17:53 <+ChillerDragon> i know dabbing
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apps that uses the power of the network
17:53 <+ChillerDragon> is it this smart contract thingy?
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
17:53 <+ChillerDragon> apps running decrentralized
17:53 <+ChillerDragon> ye
17:53 <+ChillerDragon> i never heard the term dapp tho
17:54 <+ChillerDragon> johnny dapp
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dapp = decentralized app
17:54 <+ChillerDragon> ye
17:54 <+ChillerDragon> i dont get why IOTA didnt work out too well
17:55 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon here is a cool dapp
17:55 <+Ryozuki> https://pooltogether.com/
17:55 <+Ryozuki> its a lottery where u dont lose money
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> woot
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> im in
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> how can i not lose lol
17:56 <+Ryozuki> it depends on the growth of the coin to give rewards
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> wow
17:56 <+Ryozuki> aka eth
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> so holding eth is the same 
17:56 <+Ryozuki> e
17:56 <+Ryozuki> ye
17:56 <+Ryozuki> cuz u have a chance
17:56 <+Ryozuki> to win the lottery
17:56 <+Ryozuki> if u hold it there
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> it sounds so fishy xd
17:57 <+Ryozuki> there is like a sub coin made from eth called dai
17:57 <+Ryozuki> that tries to be equal to a dollar in value
17:57 <+Ryozuki> stablecoin
17:57 <+Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dai_(cryptocurrency)
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> ah i see pooltogether is like betting on the eth going up but only one gets the return from all
17:58 <+ChillerDragon> so you essentially gamble to not get paid ur eth price raise
17:58 <+ChillerDragon> stable coin so boring
17:58 <+Ryozuki> but stablecoins are needed
17:58 <+Ryozuki> for some stuff
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> i prefer spending money in btc and still my wallet value increases xd
17:59 <+Ryozuki> xd
17:59 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon where do u buy
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> my mom
17:59 <+Ryozuki> where does ur mom buy
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> some fishy sites
17:59 <+Ryozuki> xd
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> they probably exit scammed already
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:59 <+Ryozuki> is ur mom a hacker
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> she had some old coin from 2017 hype
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> more hacker than me :D
18:00 <+Ryozuki> that must be an interesting experience
18:00 <+Ryozuki> my parents know nothing
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> well ok she doesnt know either
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> was joke
18:00 <+Ryozuki> xd
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> but the btc stuff trze
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> true
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> i probably will buy some janky alt coins on coinbase soon
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> ah wait
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> binance i mean
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> i wanna gamble ::D
18:01 <+Ryozuki> xd
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> imagine investing in lottery if you can gamble alt coins instead
18:02 <+Ryozuki> xdd
18:02 <+Ryozuki> but most alt coins fail
18:02 <+Ryozuki> ethereum didnt fail cuz they look like they rly put effort into the project
18:02 <+Ryozuki> i guess u have to look beyond just the name
18:02 <+Ryozuki> and get informed
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> getting informed is not gambling tho
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> most lottery tickets fail too
18:04 <+Ryozuki> ah u just want to gamble
18:04 <+Ryozuki> xd
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> ye
18:04 <+Ryozuki> ok
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/synthetix-network-token/
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> like this boi can be a nice gamble
18:04 <+Ryozuki> hmm
18:05 <+ChillerDragon> mark my words best gamble coin 2021
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> invest 11 euro now and hope to be a millionair soon xd
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> (im not a financial advisor lul)
18:06 <+Ryozuki> xd
18:07 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon this reminds me of the IANAL
18:07 <+Ryozuki> "i am not a lawyer"
18:07 <+Ryozuki> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL>
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> ye classic "my laywer made me say it" terms
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> also "educational purposes only"
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> for like ETHICAL haxxing xd
18:08 <+Ryozuki> its avoid accusations
18:08 <+Ryozuki> The expansion may be used by non-lawyers who are seeking to avoid accusations of unauthorized practice of law and are not making any recommendation to the particular addressee of their remarks. 
18:08 <+ChillerDragon> i used it in my tw coding tut xd
18:15 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon isnt it better to buy a sub 1€ for lot of coins
18:15 <+Ryozuki> that feels more gambly
18:25 <+ChillerDragon> idk lots of coins sounds like lots of work xd
18:26 <+ChillerDragon> all in is more gamble fun
18:26 <+ChillerDragon> all my savings of 11 euros
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Do you really think its the best idea to use the normal playerflags in 0.7? Because I thought things like that should have been avoided, in 0.6 it makes sense because it works on every server, not in 0.7 though
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut ^^
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 @heinrich5991 https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/issues/4
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> drama in microsoft
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are pulling the embrace extend extinguish
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> good thing, then i will fix up F-Client and actually test it out
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 you cap them too
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in the netobjhandler7
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> iirc
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 We dont need the anyplayerflag capflag, do we?
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh eh, yea we do, srory
