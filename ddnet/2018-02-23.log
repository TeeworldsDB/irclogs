04:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Road to zero issues
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ðŸ˜ƒ
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Wow looks like u got holidays or smth? ðŸ™‚
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> lecture-free time in uni probably?
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> new schedule, I'm so busy I added a day where I marathon code ddnet stuff
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> having a clantag with special characters makes u not have same amount of visible characters right?
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not make it the same
22:25 <@deen> because I guess we just count the number of bytes used
22:25 <@deen> and "special characters" probably need more bytes in utf8
22:25 <@deen> compared to ascii
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its a problem if we could only count "visual" characters for clan length
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and maybe als name length?
22:26 <@deen> Yes, that's a problem, then we need to change the protocol
22:26 <@deen> and old clients won't work
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah :/
22:26 <@deen> and people would have huge names
22:26 <@deen> so you'd still need a limit for bytes, albeit larger
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also, it's usually a good thing to limit these kinds of things by storage size
22:27 <@deen> But just limiting by storage size is not enough, see WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
22:27 <@deen> which doesn't even fit into the field
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure if that one is such a big problem â€“ but okay...
22:28 <@deen> since we can render the text to determine length, maybe an idea would be fixed storage size and additionally limit rendering length, but then that's harder to predict for players
22:36 <@deen> but for ddnet i would propose not changing it
