00:30 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> bruh i didnt even change that file at all
00:30 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1341552492919521320/image.png?ex=67b6699f&is=67b5181f&hm=6269bfce1b5123003dc9214a3457175286d027efdaaea79a4294a469780022f6&
00:31 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> oh wait im probs using the wong compiler verson arnt i lol
00:33 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> yep im using make not cmake thats the problum
01:24 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ok nope the problum is afl++ suddenly doesnt like the games code
01:24 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> anyone have any idea why?
01:25 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> it works fine if i build it normaly
01:28 < bridge> <Ewan> you'd need to share some info about your setup because i don't really know the steps to get where you have
01:28 < bridge> <Ewan> your WSL dev env & stuff
01:31 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> what about WSL do you need to know
01:31 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> its just the defult ubuntu one
01:32 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> could it be because i did make clean all?
01:32 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> wait no i did that when it did compile i beleave
01:34 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> is it ment to compile with c++ 13?
01:34 < bridge> <Ewan> no
01:34 < bridge> <totar> actually I disagree it should absolutely be fuzzed.
01:34 < bridge> <Ewan> the whole point of fuzzing
01:34 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> i mean it will be
01:35 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> i was asking if i would need to disable it
01:35 < bridge> <totar> it crashes sometimes if you send certain checksums
01:35 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> so it doesnt have to guss a checksum
01:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't know what your build process is. the most reliable way for me is to generate makefiles with `cmake`, compile with `cmake --build folder`, and delete `folder` whenever i run into weird build issues
01:36 < bridge> <Ewan> if you run make again, you could be working with old makefiles
01:36 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ah ok thanks
01:36 < bridge> <Ewan> you had to have changed something though
01:37 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> yea but idk what aside from the compiler to afls compiler
01:40 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> hmm nope that didnt work
01:40 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> hmm
01:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @totar: in case Cans was too shy to write you he could see tees and hooks appearing where they shouldn’t with the new anti ping
01:56 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> im gonna save my changes and remove the repo and pull it agien i think
02:03 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ok not even that worked hmm
02:23 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> what verson of c++ is it ment to use?
02:24 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
02:25 < bridge> <Ewan> c++13 isn’t really a thing
02:26 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> hmm i was gussing that from the path that it was that
02:26 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1341581521554898944/image.png?ex=67b684a8&is=67b53328&hm=7dc4b7c17131e152c33e1f54f4b9e5f42ae2e2991150f58da27b6c75abad73a0&
02:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i couldn't tell you the issue
02:26 < bridge> <Ewan> so my input probably is not helpful
02:26 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> fair
02:34 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ok looking at the cmake file it looks like its ment to use c++ 17
02:37 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
02:37 < bridge> <Ewan> idk how it got 13 tbh
02:37 < bridge> <Ewan> but it's not C++13, it's GCC 13
02:38 < bridge> <Ewan> in ubuntu repos? must be
02:44 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ah ok
02:44 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> its gcc 13
03:00 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> do you think i should update GCC?
04:10 < bridge> <Ewan> worth a shot
04:19 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> there doesnt seem to be a update?
04:28 < bridge> <Ewan> apt-install gcc-15
04:29 < bridge> <Ewan> or w/e
04:29 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s ubuntu so this thing is going to just be obtuse
04:29 < bridge> <Ewan> they’ll never have the very newest version of most packages because it’s a stability concern
04:41 < bridge> <Ewan> i also want to clarify i don't even know the cause of this issue
04:41 < bridge> <Ewan> i'm literally guessing
04:41 < bridge> <Ewan> uneducatedly
05:10 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1341622954898755614/image.png?ex=67b6ab3e&is=67b559be&hm=536c8b52eaf871f1e21f804d53d07b20edd59b898dd966e90c9cc1ed6b45d191&
05:16 < bridge> <Ewan> depends on which ubuntu you're on
05:18 < bridge> <Ewan> 24.10 and newer package `gcc` as gcc 14, 24.04 uses 13
05:19 < bridge> <Ewan> crazy typo
05:19 < bridge> <Ewan> gcc-14 :feelsbadman:
05:53 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> yea no it will probs be easyer to completly wipe the vm and reinstall
06:06 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> and thats what i am now doing
07:39 < bridge> <0xdeen> @alex0006 Thanks!
07:41 < bridge> <oxyzo.> Choo Choo 🚂 :nouis:
07:59 < bridge> <Bota> 🚂 🚂
08:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
08:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> morning stack enjoyers and others
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> guys
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> 1 day
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> for rust 2024 edition
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> big moment tomorrow
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> biggest day of the year
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> forget ur birthday
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust 2024 better
08:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> rust 2024 in 2025
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> :nouis:
08:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> @avolicious make sure to update ur stack to rust 2024 on day 1 or we wont talk ever again
08:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
08:48 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> turns out afl++ doesnt like my code changes and thats why
08:48 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> no clue why not though
08:53 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ok turns out afl++ doesnt like std::pair
09:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kekw:
09:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 do you know what's the point of setting `dword ptr[rbp - 4]`?
09:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1341683124593229834/image.png?ex=67b6e348&is=67b591c8&hm=954d923c2f78e27808813f5b6f3d60b40cd6fa39bcc443ef34c2c5cfcdf9d937&
09:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> only clang does this
09:50 < bridge> <pioooooo> Is auto cursor going to be included in 19.0? I think it's still breaking multi-view zooming now
09:50 < bridge> <pioooooo> zoom level is noodle code X_X
09:51 < bridge> <kebscs> 19.0 no 128 player support :/
09:52 < bridge> <zhn> :justatest:
10:03 < bridge> <0xdeen> yes, very sad. no one wants to merge the PR :/
10:03 < bridge> <0xdeen> yes, everything in master is included. Can we fix it?
10:12 < bridge> <pioooooo> so bad we cannot have 64 dummy players in a same server
10:13 < bridge> <kebscs> I dont think the comments are blocking othet than 1 about debug dummies
10:14 < bridge> <kebscs> They're mostly like "can you add comment for this class"
10:32 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1341703902021812285/image.png?ex=67b6f6a1&is=67b5a521&hm=e41a976cb9f85b1ba8c9129c2098b60375b491f3e7dea1eb367aa17128408080&
10:32 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> yippie my code is added
10:32 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> where is my developer role🤓 <3
10:35 < bridge> <astramast> guys ! The next update is POGGERS :poggers2:
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> is the pr ready?
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> last time i saw someone said stuff missing
10:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> it has conflicts rn
10:40 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> yea all here did a great job for the mappers
12:08 < bridge> <kebscs> could someone review <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9488>
12:27 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> would be good if we can push it in to this update so people dont get dissapointed.
12:27 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> its already one of the best updades in a while + that feature will be godly
12:55 < bridge> <learath2> Nope
12:58 < bridge> <oxyzo.> what does this do:nouis:
13:22 < bridge> <kebscs> @ryozuki didnt think you would insta merge, but my only worry in that pr was if adding m_SpectatorCount to that net object is fine
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i reviewd it
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
13:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i seen that pr before already
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> looks fine to me
13:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if this gets in 19.0 tho
13:24 < bridge> <kebscs> alright ty, idk much about the protocol if that was fine
13:24 < bridge> <kebscs> but the spec info seem to be sent anyway so i guess its ok
13:25 < bridge> <kebscs> @tsfreddie <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9488/files#diff-95a9207711f0fa572be4148ea6239216afd4ff86cfbb4e8510463ad21bba2f12L321-L326>
13:25 < bridge> <kebscs> is it fine, since its yours netobj
13:25 < bridge> <kebscs> is it fine? since its yours netobj
13:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> this pr is dope https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9700
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> @pioooooo heya, looks like ci is stuc here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9582 can you push a dummy commit or smth to make ci run again?
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> @pioooooo heya, looks like ci is stuck here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9582 can you push a dummy commit or smth to make ci run again?
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> or rebase against master
13:30 < bridge> <kebscs> ill rerecord showcase vid and this can be in 19.0 i guess
13:31 < bridge> <kebscs> servers get restarted with latest commit anyway so it would work just no hud icon
13:31 < bridge> <Solly> ^ i made clang crash i didnt know that was a thing that i could do xd
13:31 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1341748902927401011/message.txt?ex=67b7208a&is=67b5cf0a&hm=1fe8b14e87efcc71833c5419b549ff79e4a36ad5697bdddc3dfa89cac0c705b4&

13:31 < bridge> <totar> never seen a PR this big merged without comments lol
13:31 < bridge> <Solly> woaw what nice numbers
13:31 < bridge> <Solly> +800 -400
13:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i looked at it, and it looks nice to me
13:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> deen too
13:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> not my fault ppl dont review long prs
13:32 < bridge> <totar> I think deens check mark just means he likes the concept
13:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
13:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> feel free to review it
13:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> one thing i didnt know is u can do "250us"
13:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> like a literal
13:33 < bridge> <totar> I don't understand 0.7 skins enough to have an opinion about any of it
13:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats nice
13:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> it doesnt only improve 0.7 skins
13:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Skin loading and refreshing
13:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> affects 0.6 too
13:34 < bridge> <totar> I think it's overall more complicated than it would otherwise be without 0.7 skins
13:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
13:35 < bridge> <totar> I did review it quite a bit yesterday
13:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i am pro remove all sixup and stuff and become standalone
13:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u gotta live with it xd
13:35 < bridge> <totar> wdym by this?
13:35 < bridge> <totar> like move to 0.7 entirely?
13:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> that i dont care about 0.7 compat and i would remove the hack to support it entirely, and then improve or add to our protocol to add those features
13:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> without hacks
13:36 < bridge> <Assa> like move to ddnet entirely.
13:36 < bridge> <totar> ah
13:36 < bridge> <totar> I think that ship has sailed
13:36 < bridge> <totar> I agree tho
13:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> and yeah im also pro break compat if it improves
13:36 < bridge> <totar> yes I was just about to say that
13:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> if its physics related its different i think its ok to be more conservative
13:37 < bridge> <Assa> I am also greatly in favor of it, as I'd have a million features breaking compatability where I'd like to bang my head against a wall
13:37 < bridge> <totar> but people will say we are killing mods based on 0.7 or old 0.6 versions if we actually do that
13:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> well thats their problem xd
13:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> what mods?
13:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> they can update their mods
13:37 < bridge> <totar> the pvp mods are not based on ddnet codebase, even if they're 0.6
13:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> they can use a pvp client kek
13:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah the reality is ppl just play ddnet 99%
13:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> or derivatives like gores
13:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> why are we limiting ourselves to the 1%
13:38 < bridge> <kebscs> true
13:38 < bridge> <Assa> @ryozuki any ideas about adding a modding api instead?
13:38 < bridge> <Assa> opinion*
13:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont know a good design but i would liek it to be wasm based
13:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> so i can mod in rust
13:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> the code is too interwined to do a good api imho xD
13:40 < bridge> <Assa> We once had the N-Client and N-Server, I remember, where you had API hooks and were able to write lua code, this was amazing
13:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> what would that api have?
13:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
13:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> some ideas:
13:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> - easily add custom packets
13:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> - a remote gui api
13:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> - but the most important, how do you change physics? its too inside the core of that ddnet is
13:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually custom packets only useful if u have a client too
13:41 < bridge> <Assa> most mods don't use custom physics, which do?
13:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> OH
13:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> server should be able to provide "plugins" to the client
13:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> so they can add the custom packet handling
13:42 < bridge> <totar> dd-pg works like that
13:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
13:42 < bridge> <Assa> RCE incoming?
13:42 < bridge> <totar> it uses WASM
13:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> KEK incoming
13:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> wasm is sandboxed
13:42 < bridge> <Assa> 👍 WASM is also used like that Godot browser things in gamejams right?
13:42 < bridge> <Assa> sounds good
13:42 < bridge> <totar> @ryozuki based on what you said it sounds like you would enjoy working on dd-pg, it's all the things you said xd
13:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah but its a big codebase and i have not much time
13:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can barely review stuff :d
13:43 < bridge> <totar> bigger than ddnet?
13:43 < bridge> <totar> is it?
13:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> someday ill look at it thoroughly
13:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i already know ddnet codebase a bit
13:43 < bridge> <totar> ah yeah
13:43 < bridge> <totar> that's true
13:43 < bridge> <Assa> @ryozuki can you review my PR please ? 😛
13:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> what #
13:43 < bridge> <totar> I'm afraid of your PRs
13:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
13:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> im afraid too
13:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> physics
13:44 < bridge> <Assa> In the latest I just ADD new stuff, no physics breaking promised!
13:45 < bridge> <robyt3> But you are rewriting an existing branch, so you'd have to carefully ensure that nothing about that behavior has changed
13:45 < bridge> <robyt3> But you are rewriting an existing if-branch, so you'd have to carefully ensure that nothing about that behavior has changed
13:45 < bridge> <Assa> Also I added the PR in order to avoid physics breaking in another 🙈
13:45 < bridge> <Assa> it's a new tile with a new tile ID, and the old tile with the old tile ID does old tile ID stuff, that's the only if-branch
13:46 < bridge> <robyt3> Just saying from the perspective of a reviewer
13:47 < bridge> <Assa> yes, you are right, I ensured this and I clicked the button for `[x] Changed no physics that affect existing maps`
13:48 < bridge> <thatscantbetruth> how to log ingame chat in realtime?
13:48 < bridge> <Assa> 9670 @ryozuki
13:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> logfile i think
13:49 < bridge> <Assa> ./ddnet_server >> ddnet_log.txt
13:49 < bridge> <Assa> `./ddnet_server >> ddnet_log.txt`
13:53 < bridge> <kebscs> @0xdeen can #9488 be in 19.0? ive included up to date showcase video
13:53 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9488
13:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> LoL haven't got a chance of taking a look at it. But I think it is fine.
14:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> wait
14:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9709
14:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> why was merged?
14:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
14:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess cuz main has the same commits
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> github is so buggy xd
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i had smth similar too
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and melon too
14:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> :saddybear:
14:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> But yeah github is a bully
14:59 < bridge> <urg_> quick question out of curiosity i checked the translation status and the dutch on says it is 96% done i finished the language packet for it but what is the missing 4% for?
15:00 < bridge> <urg_> maybe added things that haven't been added to the translations yet?
15:00 < bridge> <learath2> Possible. You can take a look at the language file. Any empty lines are missing ones
15:02 < bridge> <urg_> just checked all of em are filled in
15:02 < bridge> <urg_> no blanks
15:04 < bridge> <urg_> but for example auto-sync camera isn't in the language file yet cuz it is a new feature, so maybe that is why?
15:05 < furo> You can see the missing ones here, https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/data/languages/dutch.txt
15:06 < furo> Oddly enough it seems like the previously translated credits got removed somehow.
15:06 < bridge> <urg_> aha i see
15:07 < bridge> <urg_> well i will probably just finish these and copy over the credits i still have from the last time i finished it
15:08 < bridge> <urg_> turns out making a backup text doc of the finished thing was a good idea i guess DX
15:14 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> Show fps as a button
15:27 < bridge> <learath2> Hmm, maybe someone completely re-did it some time ago?
15:32 < furo> Nah, probably some bug in the twlang script. https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/b9b290a6ff06bfb355cf034ed053cd84e4b3d63e#diff-07781fd22372ce6d6811f5e4dcafa3dd6fa34006a62c98f662b53580a700d5bcR2060-R2062

17:29 < bridge> <kebscs> 🥳 spectatour count being added
17:30 < bridge> <kebscs> 🥳 spectator count being added
17:30 < bridge> <kebscs> so language scripts should probably be reran to inlcude Localize("Show number of spectators")
17:48 < bridge> <kebabsellerr> If there's developers on this channel, when my account on forum will be approved?
17:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki nice commit names :lol:

17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i heard about it
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> what does it do
17:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it overwrites last commit

17:53 < bridge> <Solly> any1 know why
17:54 < bridge> <Solly> uhm icons can be stretched like this
17:54 < bridge> <Ewan> a bug perhaps
17:54 < bridge> <kebabsellerr> still waitin
17:54 < bridge> <Ewan> developers aren’t forum admins
17:55 < bridge> <Solly> caused by me but i dont know the difference
17:55 < bridge> <Ewan> perhaps there’s a mistake in your code
17:55 < bridge> <Ewan> that could be it
17:55 < bridge> <Solly> ```cpp
17:55 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->SetColor(m_Color);
17:55 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->TextureSet(m_Texture);
17:55 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->QuadsSetRotation(m_Rotation);
17:55 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->RenderQuadContainerAsSprite(m_QuadContainerIndex, 0, 
17:55 < bridge> <Solly>             X - Size().x / 2.0f, Y - Size().y / 2.0f, Size().x, Size().y);
17:55 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->QuadsSetRotation(0.0f);
17:55 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->SetColor(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
17:55 < bridge> <Solly> ```
17:55 < bridge> <Solly> color = white
17:55 < bridge> <Solly> m_texture = direction (no change)
17:55 < bridge> <Solly> rotation = 0, 90, 180
17:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> why would u register on the forum
17:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> i dont think anything happens there these days
17:55 < bridge> <Solly> ```cpp
17:55 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->SetColor(m_Color);
17:55 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->TextureSet(m_Texture);
17:55 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->QuadsSetRotation(m_Rotation);
17:55 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->RenderQuadContainerAsSprite(m_QuadContainerIndex, 0, 
17:56 < bridge> <Solly>             X - Size().x / 2.0f, Y - Size().y / 2.0f, Size().x, Size().y);
17:56 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->QuadsSetRotation(0.0f);
17:56 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->SetColor(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
17:56 < bridge> <Solly> ```
17:56 < bridge> <Solly> color = white
17:56 < bridge> <Solly> m_texture = direction (no change)
17:56 < bridge> <Solly> rotation = 0, 90, 180
17:56 < bridge> <Solly> quad container index is what it used to use
17:56 < bridge> <kebabsellerr> just to be here
17:56 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe you should change it to work
17:56 < bridge> <Solly> ```cpp
17:56 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->SetColor(m_Color);
17:56 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->TextureSet(m_Texture);
17:56 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->QuadsSetRotation(m_Rotation);
17:56 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->RenderQuadContainerAsSprite(m_QuadContainerIndex, 0, 
17:56 < bridge> <Solly>             X - Size().x / 2.0f, Y - Size().y / 2.0f, Size().x, Size().y);
17:56 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->QuadsSetRotation(0.0f);
17:56 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->SetColor(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
17:56 < bridge> <Solly> ```
17:56 < bridge> <Solly> color = white
17:56 < bridge> <Solly> m_texture = direction (no change)
17:56 < bridge> <Solly> rotation = 0, 90, 180
17:56 < bridge> <Solly> quad container index is what it used to use
17:56 < bridge> <Solly> (Size() == vec2(same, same))
17:56 < bridge> <Ewan> nah but
17:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> so no point
17:56 < bridge> <Solly> ```cpp
17:56 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->SetColor(m_Color);
17:56 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->TextureSet(m_Texture);
17:57 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->QuadsSetRotation(m_Rotation);
17:57 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->RenderQuadContainerAsSprite(m_QuadContainerIndex, 0, 
17:57 < bridge> <Solly>             X - Size().x / 2.0f, Y - Size().y / 2.0f, Size().x, Size().y);
17:57 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->QuadsSetRotation(0.0f);
17:57 < bridge> <Solly>         This.Graphics()->SetColor(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
17:57 < bridge> <Solly> ```
17:57 < bridge> <Solly> color = white
17:57 < bridge> <Solly> m_texture = direction (no change)
17:57 < bridge> <Solly> rotation = 0, 90, 180
17:57 < bridge> <Solly> quad container index is what it used to use
17:57 < bridge> <Solly> (Size() == vec2(fontsizedir, fontsizedir))
17:57 < bridge> <Ewan> is there a transformation matrix in use w the quads interface
17:57 < bridge> <Solly> you raise a good point
17:57 < bridge> <Solly> ill check
17:57 < bridge> <Solly> but it only happens sometimes
17:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> github changed email style. now there's a header who left the comment
17:57 < bridge> <Solly> guess it could be not reset by accident
17:57 < bridge> <Solly> but then why would there be a rotation aswell
17:57 < bridge> <Ewan> happens with text color and stuff all the time
17:57 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
17:57 < bridge> <Solly> seems superfluous to have rotation and transform matrix
17:57 < bridge> <kebabsellerr> idk, they said me to visit this channel
17:58 < bridge> <Solly> we on the discord are too young to be usin the forumns xd
17:58 < bridge> <Solly> is there a dedicated ddnet form
17:58 < bridge> <Ewan> rotation often is a part of the matrix
17:58 < bridge> <Ewan> idk what they’re doing tho
17:58 < bridge> <Solly> yeah but if theres both then it would be turning the rotation into a matrix then mult with other matrix
17:59 < bridge> <Solly> i either see
17:59 < bridge> <Solly> * matrix with convenience multiply by rotation, translate etc
17:59 < bridge> <Solly> * only rotation translate etc, matrix created every frame
17:59 < bridge> <Solly> * just matrix
17:59 < bridge> <Solly> or expect to see
17:59 < bridge> <Solly> i dont see transform matrix btw
17:59 < bridge> <Solly> im gonna go stare at the old one for ages
17:59 < bridge> <Solly> also only happens on my l440 not my pc
18:08 < bridge> <Ewan> weird

19:31 < furo> @oxyzo. Sure, I can do it.
19:34 < furo> @oxyzo. Could you translate the credits to Russian as well? It was only in English as a placeholder. This string that is, `Russian translation by bla bla`
19:35 < bridge> <oxyzo.> so ill translate after "==" right?

19:35 < bridge> <learath2> Curious, when does gc get triggered with something like this?
19:36 < furo> Yes, translate the text after `==`. You can send it here.

19:55 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> Can i get my developer role? Sry for asking again
19:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> The last time I ask for roles learath gave me the music bot role at the time and that role didn't have access to the whole server other than a bot channel. I was there for three days before learath found out I was mostly gone.
19:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Good time

20:02 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> @learath2 i would like to have the developer role after the work i have done
20:03 < bridge> <learath2> Which was your PR?

20:05 < bridge> <Ewan> show fps where
20:05 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> In graphic tab
20:05 < bridge> <oxyzo.> its as a button now
20:05 < bridge> <Ewan> i see
20:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I think tagging a PR is more effective than explaining
20:05 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> :)
20:05 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> Not home
20:05 < bridge> <oxyzo.> before it was only an f1 command
20:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> i dont think changing 5 lines of code should guarantee you a dev role

20:31 < bridge> <TsPiggy> We already talked about it in #off-topic
20:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Still pog nonetheless
20:32 < bridge> <Ewan> There was a problem loading the remainder of the diff.
20:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Also basically means tf2 mods are now allowed to be published on steam
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> > I think this is the sendoff for TF2.
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> > And of course Valve continues the tradition of mods instead of keeping it locked forever.
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> a comment i guess its true
20:33 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I mean the game is old
20:33 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Too old
20:33 < bridge> <TsPiggy> It's about time

20:34 < bridge> <TsPiggy> The last few years update for tf2 are made by community anyway, it's not like valve are really putting stuff out for tf2 anyway
20:35 < bridge> <TsPiggy> The last few years update for tf2 are made by community anyway, it's not like valve are really putting stuff out for tf2.
20:35 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Although imagine someone just made a free overwatch with tf2's code and published it on steam.:justatest:
20:37 < bridge> <kebscs> So overwatch? :kek:
20:37 < bridge> <kebscs> Its free as well
20:37 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Ah forgot they transitioned
20:38 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I was stuck on overwatch 1 I guess
20:40 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Blizzard is back in china btw. Partnered with netease again. Although realistically they can only choose netease even the deal fall-off before.
20:41 < bridge> <TsPiggy> China was blizzard-free for a year. good time
20:42 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
20:43 < bridge> <kebscs> Isnt netese marvel rivals developer?
20:43 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I was still working at netease when the deal break-off happened. Blizzard was asking a 2 year profit projections up front for all currently running services in china. This is pre-microsoft so they knew exactly what they want

20:46 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Yes, but that rivals was not announced, and I'm like 20% sure it was meant to be mobile overwatch for blizzard but the deal fall through so they picked it up for other IPs
20:46 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I'm on phone
20:46 < bridge> <Ewan> we have ddnet for android now, no biggie
20:46 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
20:49 < bridge> <TsPiggy> The mobile deal they also wanted 100% profit for non-china regions but the game are developed by netease themselves with no additional funding from blizzard. And they know netease would not even be allowed to profit in china because of the current policy in china. So they basically asked for the game to be made for them for absolutely free.
20:50 < bridge> <TsPiggy> So we are blizzard free for a year, poor wow players got their account nuked
20:53 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I still remember the morning that deal was public our company cafe was offering "green tea blizzard" drinks, green tea basically means bitch in chinese
20:53 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I was late that day and it sold out tho

23:21 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> @robyt3 what does `CStun::CProtocol::OnPacket(NETADDR Addr, unsigned char *pData, int DataSize)` do exsactly?
23:25 < bridge> <robyt3> STUN is for network connectivity checks
23:25 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> hmm do you think thats why my fuzzing is failing
23:26 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> im parsing data generated from connecting to a random server
23:26 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> in hopes of pretending like i joined the server
23:28 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't think STUN should be necessary to connect
23:30 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> hmm ok so ill ignore all stun packets ig and try that. including not logging them
