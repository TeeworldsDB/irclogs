13:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe in C++, C compilers crap out on the unicode characters usually

15:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> why would someone do that?
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> I mean I don't even see the reason why emojis should even be in any encoding
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> i mean you can find tons of useless stuff like that, instead of optimizing existing useful programs developers often keep adding more and more useless programs/features.. That's how today you get a web browser/DE/... that uses 1G of memory to do basic stuff, whereas programs from many years ago can do the same exact fucking thing using just 10Mo, that's why i have stuff like electron and so on :D
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> Otherwise i kinda like having emoji in unicode ðŸ˜‹

16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u guys cant have a moment of fun
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> not when the first thing i see in a readme is "npm" ðŸ˜„
16:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki vim has a conceal feature you might be interested in ðŸ˜„ https://github.com/enomsg/vim-haskellConcealPlus
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> (I used it with Haskell for a while a few years back)
16:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> it looks quite funny but confuses the students if they're trying to learn Haskell
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ˜®
19:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <rdn> Sorry for my noob questions: How do I disable `add_vote "Option: Shutdown server" "shutdown"` I thought by adding a # in front. But somehow it is still there. And are commands like `down` or `ninja` require `sv_test_cmds` set to 1?
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and just remove that line you dont want
19:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <rdn> ah thanks. I think I see my error now. The autoexec_server.cfg adding it regardless of my custom config
19:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <rdn> ah thanks a lot! I think I see my error now. The autoexec_server.cfg adding it regardless of my custom config
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should submit my final exam with emojify
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> should i learn programming on Python? owo
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i want to find every solutional way to make my own game
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> (that was why i was working on an animated mountain source)
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Cellegen python is fine as a first language. if you want to make a small 2D game it might be good enough too
21:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @deen or python is even the best for machine learning
21:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> with the really big dedicated library
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd that emojy code
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @ChillerDragon we miss you in teeworlds:feelsbadman:
22:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @ReiTW | Blizzard sure, you can wrap any C library, so the sky is the limit
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eeh, I think I disagree that python is a good language to learn on, I feel it promotes laziness
22:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you are going to be hobby coding forever, sure. If you want to do anything serious in the future I'd pickup a fundamental language
22:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because you'll tell yourself you'll learn the fundamentals, after you learn a bit of python you'll get in the mood of "who needs fudnamentals, the python standard library does it all and there is a library for everything"
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> if you're focusing on algorithm, it's better to go with python
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> which is why it was chosen in France to be taught in school
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which is an okay thing if you'll only code as a hobby. It's a horrible thing when you refuse to learn how linked lists and hashmaps work and want to work in a professional environment.
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ty for the info deen
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, python is an amazing language if you want to do numerical analysis and algorithms
22:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i just want to know basic languages and after could come complicated onces
23:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and maybe i will think about learning it to become a programmer who knows
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i started with python long time ago
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like trying things so i didnt stop there
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sometimes im in the mood of coding in C and sometimes i just wanna do python
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :frozen:
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i still need to learn a functional language but im lazy
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki https://people.southwestern.edu/~potter/HaskellCode/hutton.pdf can be worked through in a day or two
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill check it
23:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and SICP of course
23:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 why can't you write a linked list or hashmap in python? if you just want to get stuff done in any language, you'll use libraries instead of rewriting elementary algorithms
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen you won't is my point
23:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Knowing how these things work is very important imho. And also imho the best way to learn them is to implement them
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i gueesss i can learn unity's basics after
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so i wont think that all i'll do is programming all the way
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> :monkaS: wait
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> didnt i hear that you can make tw anims with unity?
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i rly dislike unity 3d, btw it uses c# which is a programming language
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> godot uses gdscript and lately u can also use c# or c++, gdscript looks like python, its also MIT licensed
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://godotengine.org/
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> sounds interesting
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont want to sound rude but before making a game u should learn to program nicely
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> thats what i planned for ;)
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we will see if u surrender early
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> nah, i did learn something in school so i wont
23:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> u should learn C first
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> its one of the oldest languages, still commonly used today, and the stuff u learn there will apply to most other languages u learn afterwards
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> especially C++
