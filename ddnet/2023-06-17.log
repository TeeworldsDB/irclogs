11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet 2 in rust
11:33 <+bridge> <neben> Is there a public repo?
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
11:33 <+bridge> <gerdoe> twrust is coming :poggers2:
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> he is ashamed of his poc code
11:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> there is, but its a bit outdated xd
11:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ChillerDragon i even shared it here
11:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lmao
11:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> after u asked
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok i forgot
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg how did i manage to break highliting text in webchat
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this project is getting out of hand
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> time to abandon it
11:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xD
11:34 <+bridge> <gerdoe> xd
11:36 < ws-client> <22> @neben there are actually a lot of projects
11:36 < ws-client> <22> watf why my name 22
11:36 <+bridge> <gerdoe> real 22
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is stuff by zwelf that is game logic
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is ancient nim rewrite by deen
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is 3d version of da game
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is teeworlds on switch
11:37 <+bridge> <gerdoe> huh?
11:37 <+bridge> <neben> Omg tw on Switch
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/Byebyesky/teeworlds-switch
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wip
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not playable yet
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> none of the projects hit a useful maturity but there are a lot
11:38 <+bridge> <neben> Ah thats a shame
11:38 <+bridge> <neben> They all sound good
11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the best of them all
11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is ofc my rewrite of tw client
11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/video.php?t=ruby_tw_gui.mp4&u=chiller
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> who needs teeish textures when you can have green squares
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or my rewrite in rust
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/video.php?t=tw_in_rust.mp4&u=chiller
11:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> tw in nim: https://hookrace.net/public/platformer/platformer-finished.mp4
11:45 <+bridge> <neben> Thats very nice projets
11:46 <+bridge> <neben> Thats very nice projects
12:33 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't understand
12:33 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> why does chiller bot change everyday
12:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> hes very anon
12:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ChillerDragon: nice projects xd
12:35 <+bridge> <gerdoe> epic xd https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/index.php?u=Animepdf
12:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in my ddnet project i mostly focused on performance xddd
12:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> effective performance
12:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and im way to inactive sadly
12:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> here sneakpeak :lol:
12:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1119576404485476383/comp.mp4
12:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> arctic frost is relatively big map
12:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
12:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and it always loads so slow on ddnet
12:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so i wanted the fastest map loading xddd
12:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ddnet and ddnet-pg both also connect to a server 
12:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> twgpu only loads the map
12:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so ddnet vs twgpu is probably not a fair comparision, since ddnet's network code is so bad
12:39 <+bridge> <gerdoe> pg?
12:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> "playground"
12:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i call it like that for less confusion
12:39 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ah
12:39 <+bridge> <gerdoe> you comparing your project twgpu and reference impl
12:40 <+bridge> <gerdoe> got it
12:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah ðŸ˜„
12:42 <+ChillerDragon> pog loading speed
12:42 <+ChillerDragon> @ChillerDragon what changed where?
12:43 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> idk
12:44 <+bridge> <gerdoe> what backend do you use?
12:45 <+bridge> <gerdoe> vulkan?
12:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes
12:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i ported the vk backend to rust
12:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ˜¬
12:45 <+bridge> <gerdoe> huh xd
12:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> try hard, bcs no auto tools yet
12:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the funny thing is, i had to fight the borrow checker relatively few times ^^
12:46 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> does webgpu mean website can secretly mine cryptos or crunch AI using user's machine now
12:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but ok the vk API is unsafe
12:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes
12:46 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> epic
12:46 <+bridge> <gerdoe> my brain comes up with vulkano (https://vulkano.rs/) when it hears rust and vulkan xd
12:46 <+bridge> <gerdoe> what a time we live in xd
12:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah, but i prefer real vulkan. bcs im low level enjoyer
12:47 <+bridge> <deen> Yes, they could always mine, any way of calculation can do it, pure javascript too
12:48 <+bridge> <gerdoe> so you didn't make any wrapping around vk api? epic
12:48 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> webgpu could make them take more resources i assume?
12:48 <+bridge> <deen> yes, probably a bit faster
12:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yep i used `ash`
12:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ash-rs/ash
12:49 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> oh no, rust again
12:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it is more like the c++ vk bindings probably tho
12:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bcs of type safeties
12:50 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> every time i see rust i would just hate myself
12:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ddnet uses tru c-vulkan-api
12:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ˜‚
12:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> hate rust not yourself
12:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but hate c
12:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> more
12:51 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> k, back to work
12:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and java even more
12:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and delete python from your brain, since u hate it most
12:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> gl, i hope the next 16h are nice for you
12:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> working
12:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> <<
12:52 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i still use python for somethings
12:52 <+bridge> <gerdoe> :justatest:
12:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> :banhammer:
12:52 <+bridge> <gerdoe> no 14 hours work day pls
12:52 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> python string is a tiny easier to work wtih
12:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> py what?
12:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> never heard of it
12:53 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> compared to javascript i guess
12:53 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't usually work 10+ during weekends
12:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in javascript, everything is a string xD
12:53 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i kinda like the negative index in python
12:54 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> and the range index
12:54 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> don't know what they are actually called
12:54 <+bridge> <gerdoe> yeah pretty good sugar for len(arr)-n
12:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> besides QOL stuff & bad generics & missing async closures and stuff like that (list is long)
12:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i'd say rust is best language... at least it has the potential
12:54 <+bridge> <gerdoe> len(arr)-n-1
12:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sadly 99% of all features are nightly
12:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> :lol:
12:55 <+bridge> <gerdoe> im waiting for stable rust abi
12:55 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i just found out C# has the negative index things like last month
12:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mhh, i guess u can operator overload in rust and cpp
12:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so u could do the same
12:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok in rust its no overload
12:56 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
12:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> before @ryozuki kills me
12:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> its implementing a trait
12:56 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> what is a trait
12:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> basically an interface
12:57 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> like C# interface or TS interface
12:57 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> or none of them, just an rust interface
12:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> its not directly comparable to any c-like language i think
12:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but its also no real magic
12:57 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> fair enough
12:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> some "global" traits like add
12:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> are just there to tell the compiler "hi, when i use + i actually mean add-trait"
12:58 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> k
12:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah, so now in your 30 minutes free time u have daily
12:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> learn rust
12:59 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> UI leak

12:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i like the background, well done midjourney
12:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ˜¬
12:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> here midjourney generated:
12:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1119582181111635978/bg.png
12:59 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> just some skybox someone bought
12:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xDD
13:00 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't think it is midjourney
13:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah, but i acutally like it
13:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i like space stuff
13:02 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1119582758231081071/image.png
13:31 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> remember the "looking for group" channel? i think we need a "looking for unban" channel more
13:31 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> or somethinf
13:38 <+bridge> <learath2> It's in the works
14:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> not true
14:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> itâ€™s just dynamic types
14:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> you have numbers, strings, and objects

14:39 <+bridge> <vinson7987> how can i solve these problem when i update my system
14:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> everything
14:41 <+bridge> <robyt3> No idea, we downgraded the Windows version used in the CI for this in #6725
14:41 <+bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6725
14:42 <+bridge> <vinson7987> why these problem appear
14:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> Libs in windows mismatch what the linker looks for
14:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> Version discrepancy or something
14:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> Mysterious
14:45 <+bridge> <vinson7987> i dont want to del this version
14:46 <+bridge> <vinson7987> the message said "xxx.lib.rule" is not generate successfuly

14:50 <+bridge> <chairn> @ChillerDragon did you timeout ?
14:51 <+ChillerDragon> @chairn no i pro
15:08 <+bridge> <vinson7987> how can i solve this
15:09 <+bridge> <itube> He suck
15:09 <+bridge> <itube> (@chairn)
15:09 <+bridge> <itube> ask chinese developer
15:09 <+bridge> <itube> (@vinson7987)
15:33 <+bridge> <deen> This change fixes it, no need to downgrade VS: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/2c03973dac21615fb600f69ae771e1e54e3e1e8f
15:36 <+bridge> <murpi> Wait, really? :thonk:
15:37 <+bridge> <learath2> Did you give up on it in the last 2 weeks or so? ðŸ˜„
15:37 <+bridge> <murpi> The ticket system?
15:37 <+bridge> <learath2> yep
15:38 <+bridge> <murpi> No it's pretty much done and works. I just didn't get any feedback on it, so I assumed it's not something we want :/
15:43 <+bridge> <murpi> my goal was to reduce our workload, and if it's not utilized for that purpose, it would merely be another location that requires monitoring
15:55 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> should I report this somewhere? there was a guy that joined the server posted some link and left
15:55 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhFXji3kVuA
15:55 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> I think this is not allowed
15:58 <+bridge> <murpi> Doesn't look like a bot to me
15:58 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> @murpi so it's only a joke?
15:58 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> idk, I opened a ticket on kog I think it's a botter
15:59 <+bridge> <gerdoe> xd
15:59 <+bridge> <gerdoe> this guy just compares himself to a bot cuz he's too pro
16:19 <+bridge> <bencie.> ask n9, hes a master at this joke :troll:
16:20 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> idk it seems like slats is a well known hacker in kog
16:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> just like n9
16:25 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1119633992086466692/Screenshot_2023-06-17_162504.png
16:27 <+bridge> <gerdoe> hn okey
16:27 <+bridge> <gerdoe> seems he is unknown botter in ddnet :greenthing:
16:29 <+bridge> <Opulently1110> yeah lol, but that's impressive even for a bot even if it's not a bot it's impressive

19:47 <+bridge> <botondus> im banned from the discordo btw
19:47 <+bridge> <botondus> probably because of the things i tend to say
19:48 <+bridge> <botondus> its the end of my journey
19:48 <+bridge> <botondus> thank
19:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bye
19:48 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> @ChillerDragon wtf why no !c
19:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> heinrichs likes to have rules that destroy fun of others

19:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> chillerdragon has no revolutionary blood sadly
19:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ;~;
19:50 <+bridge> <gerdoe> still waiting for options
19:50 <+bridge> <beautemps> yeah i started tw in 2020 ðŸ˜„
19:52 <+bridge> <beautemps> no idea what was that but if it was benevolent, then it's sad
20:13 <+ChillerDragon> wot 2020
20:13 <+ChillerDragon> newfag
20:53 <+bridge> <botondus> surprised you only have 700 ddnet points
20:54 <+bridge> <botondus> still not a noname \:/
21:05 <+bridge> <funman> There is suspicion that he could be cheating but nothing proved. He is a good player either way.
22:39 <+bridge> <steinchen99> doubt it is
22:39 <+bridge> <steinchen99> A bot doesnt move their aim so slow
22:43 <+ChillerDragon> ye its either an impressive bot or a average pro
22:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> depends on how many tries he needed
22:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the afk king is defs hard

22:51 <+bridge> <BillionRay> yo guys, im going crazy trying to make my own component that draws stuff. For some reason, even though I am using the right coordinates, when I call the IGraphics routines, they are drawn elsewhere.
22:51 <+bridge> <BillionRay> For example I try drawing a circle in players.cpp:CPlayers::RenderHookCollLine and it draws it correctly, i write the same code and it gets the same coordinates in my own component, but it is drawn elsewhere. Anyone help me with this?

22:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u need to set the screen

22:52 <+bridge> <BillionRay> ahh
22:52 <+bridge> <BillionRay> weird I don't see it done anywhere else
22:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> most components rely on the one set by the maplayers
22:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> most components rely on the one set by the maplayers.cpp
22:54 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Are you referring to this func?

22:54 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Or is there a corresponding SetScreen?
23:01 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Thanks a lot brother, i was losing my sanity over this. Simple fix was to just change the render order of my component before the mapping changed.
23:48 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> cyber what now?
