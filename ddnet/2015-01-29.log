00:25 < Learath2> deen: why exactly do you 3xx to the 404 page ?
00:26 <@deen> i don't know, i guess nginx does that
00:26 <@deen> ah, because the 404 is on another subdomain!
00:26 <@deen> I'll fix that
00:28 <@deen> Learath2: happy now?!
00:29 < Learath2> very saves around 2 seconds on a map that doesnt exist deen
00:36 <@deen> great
00:44 < xRoThx> deen:  http://prntscr.com/5yc6bj
00:45 < xRoThx> Asked him if it was him & why
00:45 < xRoThx> and it was just a test
00:45 < xRoThx> they picked mine because its the best for the test, its the safest 
10:48 < BeaR_> sup?
10:53 <@deen> hi BeaR_ 
10:54 <@deen> seen the bug on github?
10:54 < BeaR_> huh, no
10:54 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/140
10:54 <@deen> If you want to fix anything :P
10:54 < BeaR_> :p
11:05 <@deen> Looks like we lost our main tester =/
11:06 < BeaR_> hm?
11:06 < BeaR_> ah map testing
11:07 < Nimda_1403> Lime by Ama just released on Moderate at 2015-01-29 11:04
11:10 <@deen> laxa: rename Nimda?
11:11 < laxadedi> deen: I would need to restart her
11:11 < BeaR_> 'her' (:
11:11 < laxadedi> deen: btw, even if I am no longer in teeworlds business, if you want my 2 cents, I kinda agree with leute_ggl
11:12 < laxadedi> BeaR_: yup :D
11:12 < laxadedi> you said yourself you want quality, then it takes time, and mapper knows it
11:13 < laxadedi> I always felt like too many releases on ddnet
11:14 <@deen> laxadedi: These maps have all been tested already, so they would be released anyway.
11:14 <@deen> From their descriptions most of them even sound ready for release
11:14 < laxadedi> Well
11:14 <@deen> So we should release even fewer maps?
11:15 < laxadedi> It's just my opinion
11:15 < laxadedi> Make a release schedule or something
11:15 < laxadedi> and take only the best
11:15 < laxadedi> 1 map for each category each week for example
11:15 <@deen> But we can't test a map for weeks, having the tester fix everything, and then not release it...
11:15 <@deen> That's ridiculous
11:16 <@deen> If the testers don't want to release the maps they should say so before making the tester change everythign
11:16 <@deen> I don't understand why people feel so hurt when more than a map per week is released
11:17 < laxadedi> Hum
11:17 < laxadedi> Just make a schedule about release
11:17 < laxadedi> then
11:17 < laxadedi> well
11:17 <@deen> I did, didn't I?
11:17 < laxadedi> yeah
11:17 < laxadedi> but I mean
11:17 < laxadedi> for ddnet in general
11:17 < laxadedi> if you release something
11:18 < laxadedi> say maps are released at 18:00 for ex
11:18 <@deen> maps are released when i have time
11:18 < laxadedi> make a script to release at specific time ^^
11:18 < laxadedi> well, I don't think that would change that much
11:19 < laxadedi> but I don't like to see map release at 2:00 in the morning
11:19 < laxadedi> and again, just my personal opinion
11:20 <@deen> I think the number of map releases should only depend on the number of good maps we get
11:21 <@deen> if it's more, we should release them, otherwise not
11:58 < BeaR_> wow, this demo stuff is really weird ^^
12:28 < BeaR_> deen: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/9ea846033be97b25b68c7e8769b9ee86993f6896 what does this change do?
12:29 <@deen> BeaR_: i think it only writes the map file when we actually want to keep the demo and does no flush on each output?
12:30 < BeaR_> deen: does it also change something in the binary layout of the demo?
12:30 <@deen> no
12:31 <@deen> (i hope not)
12:32 < BeaR_> the problem with the slicing bug is that it can't correctly detect the end of the demofile and starts reading some weird data, which can't be decompressed, following with closing the file handle but it will still go on reading data from the closed handle, which caused the assertion
12:34 < BeaR_> (not sure if it should read the whole demo at all..)
12:35 <@deen> =/
12:48 <@deen> damn, radeon drivers suck even with newer gpus...
12:48 <@deen> getting about 20fps in teeworlds
12:49 < BeaR_> on linux?
12:49 <@deen> yeah
12:49 <@deen> so I'm back to nvidia now
12:49 <@deen> only problem i have with nvidia is that the mouse sometimes gets stuck and it's a legacy driver already
12:50 <@deen> but it runs so much cooler
12:50 < BeaR_> can't run ubuntu on my laptop (hybrid gpu) as it would drain my whole battery power in <1hr cuz of the gpu driver /:
12:50 <@deen> yeah, that's great
12:50 <@deen> for linux i only want intel graphics. it's good enough for teeworlds and never had a problem with them
13:05 < BeaR_> heh, the actual problem the demo is corrupted lel
13:06 < BeaR_> normal playback also fails there
13:06 < BeaR_> but the demoplayer will stop ..
15:11 < Nimda_1403> DDNet CHN went down!
15:12 < Nimda_1403> DDNet CHN went back online!
16:34 <@deen> Hm, should probably just shut down the servers
16:34 <@deen> People are so angry about every decision I make
16:34 < o_be_one> hey
16:34 <@deen> They complain that I release way too many maps
16:35 < o_be_one> there some things that have really surprised me on the ddnet V3ROYAL ..
16:35 <@deen> while we had 0 novice maps in the last 30 days
16:36 <@deen> o_be_one: yes?
16:37 < o_be_one> just some really curious friendships
16:40 < o_be_one> well i'll know more soon, no doubt about that, but ddos are not done in a random mind i think
16:43 <@deen> don't talk to the ddosers please, except if you want to cause more attacks
16:51 < bear__> btw can l propose some older ctf maps made by me for the vanilla server?
16:52 <@deen> I guess you could do this here: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewforum.php?f=19
16:52 <@deen> but our testers don't test much
17:07 < Nimda_1403> Genericore 2 by Ã…mol just released on Brutal at 2015-01-29 17:02
17:40 < o_be_one> deen, how i can get fast emote on ddnet ?
17:40 < o_be_one> i want to switch my servers to ddnet bin but need fast emote
17:42 <@deen> EastByte: any idea?: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=991
17:42 <@deen> o_be_one: sv_emoticon_delay 0
17:42 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/settingscommands
17:45 <@EastByte> hard to find what's the reason
17:45 <@EastByte> they didn't say that there is an alert popping up so webgl should work
17:45 <@EastByte> maybe not enough gpu memory
17:46 <@deen> i only tried on a single phone and it worked there
17:46 <@EastByte> same here
17:47 <@EastByte> but it's not meant to be used on smartphones^^
17:47 <@deen> not?
17:47 <@deen> i think that's the main use case
17:47 < o_be_one> deen, is it included without patching now ?
17:47 <@deen> o_be_one: what does that mean?
17:47 <@deen> what included?
17:47 <@EastByte> deen: webgl support is pretty new for mobile devices
18:00 < o_be_one> deen, the fast emote is in official ddnet release now ?
18:09 <@deen> yes
18:09 <@deen> has always been
18:09 <@deen> (i think)
19:36 < o_be_one> tried on 6.5, its not an instant emote
19:41 <@deen> huh?
19:59 < eeeee> deen: sounds like you need a vacation
20:14 <@deen> well, i didn't do anything for ddnet for weeks or months
20:14 <@deen> now that i try to do something everyone complains
20:16 < o_be_one> deen, what the problem ?
20:18 <@deen> o_be_one: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=990
20:21 < o_be_one> hard
20:22 < o_be_one> hi_leute_gll is tester ?
20:23 <@deen> he was the main tester
20:23 < o_be_one> ok
20:23 < o_be_one> i think you need to find something in the middle with what you think and what they think
20:24 <@deen> what i think is in the middle already
20:24 <@deen> i get shit from both sides
20:24 < o_be_one> ok
20:24 <@deen> one side says i release too many maps, the other says i don't release enough
20:24 < o_be_one> you have just 10 maps to release ?
20:24 <@deen> and both hate ddnet and stopped helping now
20:24 <@deen> we have about 30-40 maps to release
20:24 <@deen> some are there for months
20:25 < o_be_one> why you dont start an "alpha server" open to public with only not released maps ?
20:25 <@deen> what good would that do?
20:25 <@deen> they would still complain about the same
20:26 < o_be_one> mappers can see players playing their map and seeing if its liked (maybe you can add a way to vote for the map, on the website why not)
20:26 < o_be_one> non non they'll think that you listen all 
20:26 < o_be_one> and they will be happy to have the possibility to try maps and say if its bullshit or not, and this will let you the time to release maps at a correct delay
20:27 < eeeee> not sure if public testing is a great idea
20:27 < eeeee> not everyone would realize that map is an alpha version
20:27 < eeeee> and some people would get stuck, etc..
20:27 < eeeee> also no records
20:28 < o_be_one> well this idea could be enhanced, but DDNet has to select good maps, and there is 2 parts at this time that are not happy. So is it needed to take part of these complaints ?
20:28 < o_be_one> i have just release 1 or 2 maps, but my map dev has just sayed "hey friend come test my map on r0x.fr !"
20:29 < o_be_one> some players has came, first time it was a little buggy, my mapper has updated it very fast and now the map has 30 players everytime
20:29 < o_be_one> i have not the DDNet experience with all this amount of new map
20:29 < o_be_one> but DDNet is a quality DDrace TW, so for that it needs to find a way to test faster and release only good maps
20:30 < eeeee> guess DDNet just needs more testers
20:30 < o_be_one> sure but why there is no more testers ?
20:30 < eeeee> maybe make it somehow easier to test
20:30 <@deen> eeeee: yes, but the testers are discouraged because they personally get insulted for every bug they didn't find
20:31 < o_be_one> anonym test ?
20:31 < eeeee> should we anonymize the testers then?
20:31 < eeeee> yeah
20:31 < o_be_one> and tester have the possibility to go out of a bug without the need of restart ?
20:31 <@deen> of course
20:31 < o_be_one> nice
20:31 < o_be_one> we need an "admin forum" on ddnet lol
20:32 < o_be_one> how its organized ? Mapper is here to test with testers ?
20:33 < o_be_one> and what the problem with map release, there is many servers and all players can vote change map ..
20:33 < eeeee> maybe we should test some novice map to see how it works
20:33 < o_be_one> "What about ddnet "trash" servers. Don't get me wrong. It should be another type of server, but without points. People could upload there maps which are highly discussed if they should be added or not. And if a lots of people are playing these maps in the next days and weeks it could be a good indicator if we should add this map. "
20:33 < o_be_one> good idea from kamillentee too
20:34 < o_be_one> i want to test
20:34 < o_be_one> but on something managed by ddnet
20:34 < o_be_one> not on my own servers
20:34 < eeeee> so you would add the map after everyone has played it and got bored of it :P
20:34 < o_be_one> just cause i havent the mood to up the map and test it, and i want to test with other testers
20:35 < eeeee> we should identify all points of friction in map testing
20:35 < eeeee> and try to eliminate them
20:35 < o_be_one> there is 2 main testers, so there is some other testers, how many ?
20:35 < eeeee> like it should be easy to edit the map and reupload to testing server
20:35 < o_be_one> yes sure its a hard work, already read about testing a map on ddnet
20:35 < o_be_one> the howto
20:36 < eeeee> maybe we can make it possible to edit the map while you're connected to testing server and then save positions of all players (like /save), reload the new map and /load
20:36 < o_be_one> "Broken said today the best way to get a map released is to lick deens balls" lol ! (read on forum)
20:37 < o_be_one> yeah good idea to enhance map fix
20:37 < eeeee> in fact should be trivial to just update the map without any game restarts
20:37 < o_be_one> and why not a testing points system ?
20:38 < o_be_one> engage to test, if you find some bug, you earn some testing points
20:38 < o_be_one> go challenge test !
20:38 < eeeee> hmm no i take that back. trivial only for vanilla but ddrace laz0rs and shit might get tricky.
20:40 < o_be_one> you need to make something to make testers test
20:40 < o_be_one> and mappers natural selection
20:41 < o_be_one> so mable a release score for mappers
20:41 < o_be_one> so good mappers will be released faster than new
20:41 < o_be_one> but new could be released too if they are good
20:42 < o_be_one> maybe we can brainstorm of something balanced with this system, but who can enhance the release time and simplify tests
20:42 < o_be_one> cause a map without bugs or only 1 or 2 is more funny to test that a noob buggy map ...
20:42 < o_be_one> and there is the funny of the map to take into account
20:42 < o_be_one> (my english is so bad :D)
20:43 < eeeee> idk if people who only want to gain more of some useless points would make good testers
20:43 < o_be_one> it depends on how ou attribute theses points
20:43 < o_be_one> you can give a testing point only to the two best bug finders of the map
20:44 < eeeee> who would decide the best bug though?
20:44 < o_be_one> it will give a full testing rush
20:44 < o_be_one> you select the one who has find most of the bugs
20:51 < eeeee> leader of the 2 testers team? :P
20:52 < o_be_one> lol its like a joke, but if someone is dedicated to test team, he can finds more testers
20:53 < o_be_one> and check if the map testing works good or do something to help to enhance it
20:53 < eeeee> don't think we have such a person
20:54 < o_be_one> ddnet is organized only around devs and mappers, cause its the first need of this project ; but at this scale it needs more "team leaders" i think
20:55 < o_be_one> on r0x.fr ive opened new ranks to get more team leaders and thats why we have grown like that
20:55 < eeeee> i wonder if it would help if we just got more players
20:55 < eeeee> can we ask some mappers to make tutorial maps?
20:55 < eeeee> oh i have an idea
20:55 < eeeee> lets make a mapping contest
20:55 < o_be_one> why not to prevent map repetitive bugs
20:56 < eeeee> for a best tutorial map
20:56 < eeeee> then we can try to spread the word about ddrace and get more players
20:57 < eeeee> yeah repetitive bugs should be prevented ofc, can prolly look at forums to find out what those are
20:59 < o_be_one> yes its a real problem to talk about something we dont know :(
20:59 < o_be_one> thats why i want to try to be a tester sometime, to learn more and help
20:59 < o_be_one> i cant stop to have a community mind, i love that ^^
21:23 < Nimda_1403> DDNet South Africa went back online!
23:13 < Learath2> If the maps are tested just release them dont keep the mappers waiting
23:14 < Learath2> Why would people get mad about releases
