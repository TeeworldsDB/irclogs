09:45 < EastBite> deen: 6 mbyte/s down 1.2 mbyte/s up :D 
10:16 <@deen> EastBite: nice, same as me
10:21 < EastBite> deen: and it looks like both direction can be stressed at the same time
10:21 < EastBite> without packetloss
10:23 < EastBite> oh I'm such a hacker I found out that this condition can't be true: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/shared/huffman.cpp#L118
10:27 < EastBite> afk
12:36 < EastBite> deen: I have some cool idea
12:55 < EastBite> okay not  that cool, but interesting to implement
13:39 < Savander> meh
13:40 < Matodor> @deen, hello
13:42 < Savander> new idea ;o: Limited hook by time
13:43 < Savander> something like, when you catch someone, hook will be released later or earlier
13:43 < Savander> xd
13:50 <@deen> EastBite: yes?
13:50 <@deen> Matodor: hi
13:50 <@deen> Savander: that's how it is already^^
13:50 < Matodor> You can ask a few questions?
13:50 < Savander> now
13:50 < Savander> no?
13:51 < Savander> so how
13:51 < Savander> ?
13:51 < Savander> to set time
13:51 <@deen> Savander: ah, you want to set time, ok
13:51 <@deen> Savander: but it's very unintuitive i think
13:51 <@deen> Matodor: hm?
13:51 < Savander> heh
13:52 < Matodor> deen: Я добавил поддержку DDNet клиента к своему серверу, в игре количество игроков 1/64, но в списке серверов отображает как 1/16. Все проверил, вроде правильно. p.s goolge translate :D
13:52 < Matodor> sry :D
13:52 < Matodor>  I added support DDNet client to your server, the number of players in the game 1/64, but in the server list displays as 1/16. All checked, like correct. p.s goolge translate: D
13:53 <@deen> Matodor: you added 64 players to your own server?
13:53 < Savander> for hard parts, why not. With message "Your hook hold time was reduced to 2 sec, or increased to 10 sec" or smth like that
13:53 < Matodor> yes
13:53 < Matodor> in game snap how 64, but serverlist 16
13:54 <@deen> Matodor: there is a 64 player serverlist package
13:54 <@deen> Matodor: all 64 player servers use it
13:54 < Matodor> I know
13:54 <@deen> aaaah
13:54 < Matodor> SendServerInfo(&Packet.m_Address, ((unsigned char *)Packet.m_pData)[sizeof(SERVERBROWSE_GETINFO64)], true);
13:55 <@deen> ddnet client only requests 64 player info in some cases
13:55 < Matodor> which?
13:55 <@deen> yes, your gametype or server name have to include 64
13:56 < Matodor> :D
13:57 < Matodor> @deen: added to the name of the server 64, but nothing
13:57 <@deen> Matodor: what's the server name?
14:01 < Matodor> ?
14:01 <@deen> Matodor: i want to see it myself
14:01 <@deen> Matodor: is the server online?
14:01 <@deen> are you responding correctly to the GETINFO64 packets?
14:02 < Matodor> yes
14:02 < Matodor> server not registered
14:02 < Matodor> only localhost
14:02 <@deen> ok, then i can't test
14:02 <@deen> i would guess you don't respond correctly
14:03 < Matodor> if i join and exit -> in serverbrowser 1/64 info
14:03 <@deen> you're using ddnet client?
14:03 < Matodor> yes
14:04 <@deen> have you seen the code in server.cpp SendServerInfo()?
14:05 < Matodor> i can send code
14:05 < Matodor> @deen: http://pastebin.ru/ixeBpdxb
14:06 < Matodor> checked everything, like transferred correctly
14:08 <@deen> weird
14:09 <@deen> does the client receive the packet?
14:09 <@deen> you should add debug messages to see where the problem is
14:11 < Matodor> okay, thx for help, will test
14:11 <@deen> Matodor: ok, I'm afk for some time
14:12 <@deen> EastBite and Savander can help :P
14:13 < EastBite> I'm currently not here either
14:13 < EastBite> oh wait
16:50 < Matodor> @deen: here?
17:58 <@deen> Matodor: hi
18:05 < Matodor> hi, why the condition is not satisfied if (Packet.m_DataSize == sizeof (SERVERBROWSE_GETINFO64) +1 && mem_comp (Packet.m_pData, SERVERBROWSE_GETINFO64, sizeof (SERVERBROWSE_GETINFO64)) == 0) ,
18:06 < Matodor> ?
18:09 <@deen> hm?
18:09 <@deen> maybe your GETINFO64 definition is wrong
18:10 <@deen> so the size is wrong
18:10 <@deen> Matodor: 
19:00 < Matodor> deen: i copy from ddnet 
20:14 < Matodor> deen: the condition if (pEntry && m_ServerBrowser.IsRefreshing())  not satisfied, why (client.cpp) ?
20:15 <@deen> Matodor: you send normal requests too, right?
20:15 <@deen> Matodor: first a normal request, then a 64 player one
20:16 <@deen> not immediately the 64
20:16 < Matodor> condition 	if (strstr(Info.m_aGameType, "64") || strstr(Info.m_aName, "64")) - work
20:16 < Matodor> but next no
20:16 < Matodor> pEntry = m_ServerBrowser.Find(pPacket->m_Address); 				if (pEntry && m_ServerBrowser.IsRefreshing())
20:27 <@deen> i don't know
20:28 < Matodor> :)
20:39 < Matodor> @deen: problem in condition (m_ServerBrowser.IsRefreshing()), if comment it = work
20:40 < Matodor>  maybe it's because the server tab in LAN?
21:21 < Savander> Matador, yes in LAN Tab, it not works correctly
21:43 <@deen> ooooh
21:43 <@deen> damn
21:43 <@deen> for me the entire LAN tab never worked in teeworlds^^
21:43 <@deen> so i never tested
21:51 < Savander> heh
21:52 < Savander> i will try
21:52 < Savander> fix it
21:52 < Savander> xd
21:52 < Savander> maybe i can
21:52 < Savander> LOl
21:55 <@deen> Savander: good luck =)
21:55 < Savander> haha
21:55 < Savander> thanksxd
22:19 < bor> hi dean
22:20 <@deen> hi bor
22:20 < KinG_> hey deen
22:20 <@deen> hi
22:20 < bor> i hope i'm not interrupting your work do you have free time ?
22:20 <@deen> sure
22:20 <@deen> what's on your mind?
22:21 < bor> so king and i wanted to run a ddnet server and he said we should speak to you about that
22:21 <@deen> =)
22:21 < KinG_> ?:|
22:21 <@deen> I would love an official DDNet server in Iran
22:21 <@deen> Do you want an official one or one of your own?
22:22 < KinG_> wtf
22:22 < KinG_> deen
22:22 <@deen> yes?
22:22 < KinG_> we want an official server
22:22 <@deen> =)
22:22 <@deen> then it's pretty easy
22:22 < KinG_> but
22:22 <@deen> you have to get a good VPS, like the Persian Pro is using
22:22 < KinG_> we still don't have a vps
22:22 <@deen> but with Linux, and preferrably KVM
22:23 <@deen> 512 MB RAM are enough
22:23 < KinG_> how much ram exactly you want?
22:23 <@deen> traffic should be ~ 500 GB / month
22:23 < KinG_> we got unlimited
22:23 <@deen> 22:22 < KinG_> we want an official server
22:23 <@deen> 22:22 <@deen> =)
22:23 <@deen> 22:22 <@deen> then it's pretty easy
22:23 <@deen> 22:22 < KinG_> but
22:23 <@deen> 22:22 <@deen> you have to get a good VPS, like the Persian Pro is using
22:23 <@deen> 22:22 < KinG_> we still don't have a vps
22:23 <@deen> 22:22 <@deen> but with Linux, and preferrably KVM
22:23 <@deen> 22:23 <@deen> 512 MB RAM are enough
22:23 <@deen> 22:23 < KinG_> how much ram exactly you want?
22:23 <@deen> 22:23 -!- bor [webchat@144.76.79.25] has joined #ddnet
22:23 <@deen> 22:23 <@deen> traffic should be ~ 500 GB / month
22:23 <@deen> KinG_: awesome
22:23 < KinG_> WTF?!
22:23 <@deen> KinG_: I want 1024 MB, but 512 would be enough probably
22:23 < KinG_> so
22:24 < KinG_> 1gb is enough huh?
22:24 <@deen> yes
22:24 <@deen> i need root access to the server, then i can set everything up
22:24 < KinG_> bor?
22:24 < bor> yes ?
22:25 < KinG_> about the root access
22:25 < KinG_> u aggree?
22:25 < KinG_> agree*:|
22:25 < bor> sure , just one question 
22:25 < bor> is there an option for us to install it our self and you are offering to install it for us or is it mandatory to have you install it for us ?
22:26 <@deen> only i can do it
22:26 <@deen> there is no automatic installation
22:26 <@deen> i do it all by hand, you can see what i do here: http://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts
22:27 <@deen> and the servers often need manual help, which i also do
22:27 <@deen> when the databases get desynchronized, or when a new map is released, or a tournament is starting
22:27 < bor> in case i happened to be able to do it can i do it myself ?
22:27 < bor> i do have some experience with programming and compiling stuff on linux
22:28 <@deen> bor: nice
22:28 <@deen> bor: but i really like to set it up myself. most of the stuff isn't written down anywhere, i just do it from my head
22:28 < bor> ok no problem 
22:28 <@deen> and i need to synchronize it with the other servers anyway, and you have no access to them
22:28 < KinG_> deen
22:28 <@deen> KinG_: 
22:29 < KinG_> how many servers can u run on the vps?
22:29 <@deen> KinG_: just DDRace or what?
22:29 < KinG_> ddrace
22:29 < KinG_> and if there is a tornoument
22:30 <@deen> i think with 1 GB we can run more servers than we will need
22:30 < bor> which linux do you prefer , centos or ubuntu?
22:30 <@deen> 10-15 servers should be no problem
22:30 <@deen> debian, centos, ubuntu, in that order
22:31 <@deen> What's with the Persian Pro servers?
22:31 <@deen> Weren't you helping with them, KinG_ ?
22:31 <@deen> will they keep running?
22:31 < KinG_> actually
22:31 < KinG_> deen they aren't nice guys
22:32 < KinG_> i don't work with them
22:32 <@deen> KinG_: ok
22:32 < KinG_> they attacked our servers (persian gulf)
22:32 <@deen> wtf
22:32 <@deen> i help them defend from attacks and they attack themselves?
22:32 < KinG_> yes
22:32 < KinG_> but
22:32 < KinG_> bor can protect servers
22:33 <@deen> awesome =)
22:33 < KinG_> he know what to do
22:33 < bor> its more like a warzone in iran datacenters :(
22:34 < bor> not sure when they are going to learn competing peacefully 
22:34 < KinG_> and i'm sure that the first one that attacks our servers are these persian Pro guys
22:34 <@deen> Well, our other servers are also getting attacked a lot recently
22:35 < KinG_> deen u remember the tornoument for planet venus?
22:35 <@deen> yes
22:35 < KinG_> the attacked caused me and Chicken to fail
22:35 < KinG_> also milk and ninja_valik failed too
22:35 <@deen> last tournaments i had to stop completely because of attacks
22:35 <@deen> now we have no more tournaments
22:36 < KinG_> why?
22:36 <@deen> i have threats from people
22:36 < KinG_> like?
22:36 <@deen> when we start tournaments again, they will attack us
22:36 < bor> there is something very wrong with my internet :|
22:36 <@deen> bor: yeah, looks like it
22:36 < KinG_> dude u can pay a bit more to data centers so they can add a hardware protection 
22:36 < KinG_> or
22:37 <@deen> well, it's not just a bit more
22:37 <@deen> i pay 60 $ / month now
22:37 <@deen> and with protection in all countries, i can't even imagine what that would be
22:37 < KinG_> u can add a firewall system that blocks the any incoming connections that is more than legal
22:37 <@deen> firewalls can't handle these attacks, they are too big
22:37 < KinG_> actually they can
22:38 <@deen> nope!
22:38 <@deen> maybe 10 GBit/s works, but they will just add traffic until it fails
22:38 < KinG_> for test i attacked bor with 1gb port
22:38 <@deen> anyway, i'm working with the german hoster on a ddos protection
22:38 <@deen> yeah, but 1gb/s is not much
22:38 <@deen> our server does fine with 10 gbit/s
22:38 <@deen> but more is bad
22:38 < KinG_> so
22:38 < KinG_> i guess
22:39 < KinG_> iranian servers will fall so easily
22:39 < KinG_> 1gbit
22:39 <@deen> i don't know if anyone will attack iranian servers
22:39 <@deen> chile had no attacks so far
22:39 <@deen> it's mainly the german server that gets the attacks
22:39 < KinG_> Persian Pro will attack
22:39 < KinG_> i know that guy
22:39 <@deen> tell him to talk to me
22:39 <@deen> i can talk him out of attacking
22:39 < bor> some iranians hate competition , they can't stand there seeing some other person having a server
22:39 < KinG_> he attacked persian gulfs servers cause no players were playing in their servers
22:40 < KinG_> and now
22:40 < KinG_> cause of their attacks
22:40 <@deen> yeah, i know, we had these problems already in iranian ddnet long ago
22:40 < KinG_> persian gulf is gone
22:40 <@deen> =/
22:40 <@deen> what was his name again?
22:40 < KinG_> Persian PRo
22:40 <@deen> i mean the admin
22:40 < KinG_> evil saeed is the owner
22:41 <@deen> ok, he's not online?
22:41 < KinG_> his name is written by font
22:41 < KinG_> but it's evil saeed
22:41 <@deen> yeah, i know
22:41 < KinG_> i don't know
22:41 < KinG_> u want me to check?
22:41 <@deen> i would like to talk to him
22:41 < KinG_> i'll be back soon gonna check if he is online or not
22:42 <@deen> when do you expect to get the server?
22:42 <@deen> I'm pretty happy about it
22:42 <@deen> Iran used to be our second largest server, right after German
22:43 < KinG_> iran got so pro players
22:43 < KinG_> like chicken
22:43 < bor> we were considering it in the past week and will probably get it online by the end of next week
22:43 <@deen> yeah, chicken hosted the first Iran server
22:43 < KinG_> yep
22:43 <@deen> but no more money =/
22:43 <@deen> expensive to host in iran
22:43 < KinG_> yes
22:44 < KinG_> we pay 24$ for a 1gb ram server
22:44 <@deen> mhm
22:44 <@deen> that's pretty expensive for Iran
22:44 < KinG_> gonan check persian servers will be back
22:45 <@deen> Chile is even more expensive, i pay 28$ now
22:45 < bor> i pay 52Euro for 16GB of ram in germany 
22:45 <@deen> bor: nice, you live in germany?
22:45 < bor> no i live in iran but have some servers in germany 
22:45 < bor> for my website
22:46 < bor> i am one of sponsors of this ddnet server 
22:46 <@deen> ok, nice
22:46 <@deen> but good ddos protection is expensive in germany
22:47 < bor> thankfully i don't have a lot of problems in germany , my website competitors don't consider me a thread yet
22:47 <@deen> yeah, online gaming is very ddos prone
22:48 <@deen> everyone in teeworlds gets ddos attacks
22:48 < bor> my website is a torrent leecher 
22:48 <@deen> bor: oh, haha
22:48 <@deen> bor: and you're running that in Germany of all places, hahhaha
22:48 < bor> cheapest i could find , i get 6TB of hard for that 52Euro 
22:48 <@deen> Germany is the country where most people get fined for torrenting in the entire world :P
22:49 < bor> interesting , i've seeded more than 60-70TB in the past year
22:49 < bor> not a single abuse 
22:49 <@deen> ^^
22:49 <@deen> nice hoster then ;)
22:49 < KinG_> deen i suggest you to download yahoo
22:50 < KinG_> all of iranian guys got yahoo 
22:50 < bor> its Hetzner 
22:50 <@deen> or they don't care because you live in Iran and not Germany
22:50 < bor> i don't have yahoo 
22:50 <@deen> KinG_: nah, teeworlds + irc + skype is fine for me
22:50 <@deen> already too much^^
22:50 < bor> yea i agree , i used to be on a lot of messenger apps , but i got tired of them all and removed all but telegram and skype 
22:51 < KinG_> u can't contact with iranian peoples so easily without yahoo
22:51 <@deen> KinG_: they can contact me in irc
22:51 < KinG_> he is offline
22:51 < KinG_> i checked all servers
22:51 <@deen> for me it's good enough to have contact with you 2
22:51 < bor> its 1am here , its no surprise he is offline , the question is why aren't we offline :P
22:52 < KinG_> u can call us owl deen xD
22:52 <@deen> Night owls =)
22:53 < KinG_> yep
22:53 < KinG_> always online
22:53 <@deen> Anyway, it's awesome that you want to do DDNet Iran
22:53 < KinG_> i'm tired of playing
22:53 < KinG_> i just want to play in ddnet
22:53 < KinG_> and got 200 ping in german
22:53 <@deen> but ping to GER is too bad?
22:53 <@deen> hm, yeah
22:53 <@deen> Chicken sometimes has 90 on GER
22:53 < KinG_> for me it's bad
22:53 < KinG_> chicken got 70~90 on german
22:53 < KinG_> and in iran he got 20
22:54 < KinG_> ti saw a guy with ping 2 in iran
22:54 <@deen> Yeah, we have many with ping 3-4 in Moscow
22:54 < bor> i have 86ms in iran :|
22:54 <@deen> and ping 4-7 in GER
22:54 <@deen> well, only 2 with ping 4-7 in GER^^
22:54 < KinG_> and when i asked that guy where are you buying internet from why is your ping like this he said what is ping :|
22:54 <@deen> the situation in south america is really sad
22:54 <@deen> KinG_: haha
22:55 <@deen> in south america they get better ping on GER than on Chile server
22:55 <@deen> 200 on GER, 300 on Chile
22:55 < KinG_> so many noobs these days
22:55 <@deen> even though Chile is much closer
22:55 < KinG_> chile is worse than iran
22:55 <@deen> more expensive too 
22:56 <@deen> but noone understands english in chile, so i can't find someone to buy a server
22:56 <@deen> and they're all about 15 years old i think
22:56 < KinG_> lol
22:56 < KinG_> xD
22:56 <@deen> you know chile had 0 teeworlds players 1 year ago?
22:57 < KinG_> well .....
22:57 <@deen> and then a popular livestreamer discovered the game
22:57 < Chicken_> hey
22:57 < KinG_> lol
22:57 < KinG_> chicken here
22:57 <@deen> hi
22:57 <@deen> and he played ddrace for 3 hours
22:57 < bor> hi
22:57 < KinG_> wattup nob?:D
22:57 <@deen> and suddenly chile has the biggest teeworlds community after europe, but they're all kids watching his stream^^
22:57 < KinG_> never mind chile
22:58  * Chicken_ slaps Chicken_ around a bit with a large fishbot
22:58 <@deen> Chicken_: we get DDNet in Iran again!
22:58 < KinG_> hopefully we are living in iran
22:58 < Chicken_> That's nice!
22:58 <@deen> Chicken_: Haven't seen you around for some time. Still playing?
22:58 < KinG_> yep

22:59 <@deen> and i don't like talking
23:00 < KinG_> deen u havn'e mic?:O
23:00 < bor> why not ?
23:00 <@deen> i prefer to read, don't know why
23:00 <@deen> (and write of course)
23:00 < bor> talking is a lot easier than typing 
23:00 < KinG_> yep
23:00 < KinG_> so easier
23:00 < bor> you already typed a lot of code , don't you think your hands deserve some rest ? :P
23:00 <@deen> haha
23:01 < Chicken_> I'd prefer typing and reading.
23:01 < KinG_> chicken is goshad never comes to ts
23:01 < KinG_> xD
23:02 < Chicken_> I don't use ts until I don't need to.
23:02 < Chicken_> I need to*
23:02 < Chicken_> never mind.
23:02 < KinG_> u never come to ts to play with me
23:02 < Chicken_> who is gonna host the ddnet?
