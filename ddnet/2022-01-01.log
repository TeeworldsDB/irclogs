02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> what if you have no internet
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> its probably harder to find a cable from phone to pc than to find the software :kek:
04:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> nobo just take the usb cable from your charger
04:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> don't you have a charger with an usb cable
04:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> don't you have a charger with an usb cable in it?
04:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> don't you have a charger with an usb cable in it?
04:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> no its usb c to usb c
04:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> i guess it works for mac
05:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> tf
05:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> your charger doesn't use usb-a port?
05:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> bad charger
05:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> your charger doesn't use usb-a port and doesn't have usb-a to usb-c cable?
05:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> no it uses a wall outlet
06:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i have a usb c to usb c
06:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but my computer also hasa usb c
06:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> so it works
06:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> nouis
06:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> either you misunderstood or i'm not explaining it correctly
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> I need some help!
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> https://github.com/ST-Chara/ddnet-pvp/blob/master/src/game/server/gamemodes/block-down.cpp#L31
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> How to change the victim team! Please someone help me
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @TeeFlowerFell-Sans what exactly do you mean?
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> In single team gamemodes like ddrace everyone is in team red
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> If the blue team tee died, set it to the red team
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> @fokkonaut
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> help me please.
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I think CPlayer has a m_Team
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which you can change
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> oh,Thanks you
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @TeeFlowerFell-Sans DoTeamChange() should also work
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why doesnt it work?
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sorry for the confusion, there are two kinds of teams (tw teams like red, blue, spectator as well as ddrace teams)
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> purple team
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shiro.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/926808154786918450/20220101_130328.jpg
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shiro.> Hey, does anyone know how to fix this ? 
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shiro.> When i want to render a videos, it does those weird green lines in all screen, and the demos is slow af, like 0,5x
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TeeFlowerFell-Sans> @fokkonaut i want make victim(CCharacter) to TEAM_RED, but DoTeamChange(CPlayer *pPlayer, int Team, bool SendChat)
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill join soon
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/rtgwcf/in_2022_yymmddhhmm_formatted_times_exceed_signed/
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> In 2022, YYMMDDhhmm formatted times exceed signed int range, breaking Microsoft services
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/926823860488265769/unknown.png
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdddd
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> when did cl_run_on_join get added, lol
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 15.8
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What for? and why only chat commands.. xd
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> while server settings are open in the editor and a command is selected
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> results in not being able to save as something  with [m]  kinda hard with .map if you ask me
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> because  pressing [m] makes it jump back into the server settings
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah>  got fixed one or two times already but its back again
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> read the release notes? I use it for showall 1
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Sorah let me check
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks, fixed: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4557
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> If thats the only purpose you could have also just merged my pr from a few years back, implementing a showall button like show others :)
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There are not really any commands besides showall that one would want to use everytime he joins a server.
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Also, with the showdistance thing we have this is quite useless anyways, except for people who want to record all players
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen Why can I not find cl_port in 15.8?
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> only nightly for now i think
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> \o/
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen idk if it can be done mod wise but it would be wise to remove sp someone and his surroundings from the final picture on EUR xd
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (nazi stuff ya know :monkaS: )
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> wtf
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i didnt make it
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i just found this cool geometry and took the centre spot
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> Mods can remove or move tee around
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> I'm more worried about trolls taking up the entrie server before normal players can join and capture.
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> @Brokecdx- allah loves you.
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Alhamdullilah
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 Your tip with pressing F1 and moving the cursor away from border did not help. The bug with this "invisible border" has come again
