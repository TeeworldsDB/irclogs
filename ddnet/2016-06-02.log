14:50 <@EastByte> hm for the first time I have highping on GER
14:52 <@EastByte> icmp ping is normal though
14:53 <@EastByte> oh wait maybe it's because I'm on RUS
16:59 <@deen> EastByte: haha, happens to me all the time too
16:59 <@deen> because on GER I have 25, on RUS 60, so the color of pings looks pretty similar in server browser
17:00 <@deen> also, Persian now reachable for 2 days without break, yay

17:06 <@deen> EastByte: oh? sounds like something that needs to be fixed in client
