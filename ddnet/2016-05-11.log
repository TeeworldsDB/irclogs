16:12 < o_be_one> hello
16:13 < o_be_one> deen: have you some OS stats to see wich one is the most used to play ddnet please ?
17:01 <@deen> not really, only download stats from website
17:02 <@deen> and linux people might just be building from source, so that's not representative
17:12 <@deen> and many people update instead of downloading new versions
17:30 < o_be_one> arf can you maybe add something in maybe client informations ? You can detect if its a "hacked" client, you can maybe add "ddnet version = 9.0.2 linux" deen no ?
17:30 < o_be_one> and with this, add it to your website stats
17:31 <@deen> i don't see why that's so important
17:34 <@deen> 90% or more is windows anyway :P
17:44 < o_be_one> ahah ok, i'm more and more on stats, i think they can show many good things to enhance stuffs ^^

20:57 <@deen> Learath2: A new libcurl error! Want to look into it?  https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=3621
21:05 < Learath2> deen, i mean i could look into it but will just need to get more info then that
21:05 < Learath2> will wait
21:06 < Learath2> ill give it a check
21:10 < Learath2> yeah need a backtrace to figure it out as that message being printed means STATE_ERROR is set which means the client should fallback normally
21:10 <@deen> i can reproduce it with neither the bundled libcurl nor my system one
21:10 <@deen> (with a broken nameserver)
21:10 < Learath2> cant* ?
21:10 <@deen> can't
21:10 <@deen> sorry^^
21:11 < Learath2> ill give it a try aswell
21:12 < Henningstone> can neither nor == can't either or ;)
21:12 < Henningstone> sorry for the offtopic though
21:42 < Learath2> nah couldnt reproduce
21:42 < Learath2> neither windows nor linux
