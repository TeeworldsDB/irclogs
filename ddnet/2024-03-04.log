01:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn dont use the master branch
01:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the master branch is waiting for #7777
01:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> use this boi https://github.com/ZillyInsta/ddnet-insta/tree/hotfix_map_reload
01:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1709511668.png
01:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im sure it looks nice
01:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Looks like i have to replace irc with matrix in the backend just to get images working. That sounds painful
01:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @zhn yea sorry for the crashing master its a ugly situation. I did not expect anyone trying to run it until i resolve it. I am waiting for this pr to get closed https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7822
02:24 < bridge> <zhn> it will never get merged ig xd
02:25 < bridge> <zhn> thanks for hotfix_map_reload
02:36 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller this seems like a you problem
02:36 < bridge> <Ewan> all my hd skins work well
02:37 < bridge> <Ewan> oh you mean the SD skins
02:37 < bridge> <Ewan> fair enough
05:33 < bridge> <Ewan> most humble chillerdragon moment

07:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> What is your opinion on extracting the git conflict and build issue solvings out of the merge commit?
07:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> So far I have been merging my forks with ddnet and solving the caused build errors and git conflicts in the merge commit to keep the master building at all times
07:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> But then all my manual changes of adapting to new ddnet systems. Such as rewriting http/jobs in my components end up in the merge commit.
07:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> It becomes annoying to review because its one big merge diff plus my changes and the commit message is just merged. I did a quick duckduckgo search and did not find any concepts for merge conflict handeling.
07:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 is there a portage command to rebuild all the world
07:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> when i get my new cpu it will be next gen zen4 i think
07:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lerato you solved that one already right? What was the fix? ``error C2011: 'IStorage': 'class' type redefinition``
08:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: it was just an image with grey background and drawn image from Tutorial map xd
08:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pro @milkeeycat 
08:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ;-;
08:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I think i got the istorage thing. I see something in the CMakeLists. So far my custom merge driver for CMakeLists.txt has caused more issues than it has solved -.-
09:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> Ive only seen that Happen when windows.h is included without the `WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN` Definition attached
09:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yeye my pipeline finally finished it was the windows.h thingy and the fix in the cmakelist with WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN that got killed by my bugged merge driver
09:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I finally finished merging with ddnet and fixing my CI after the merge and im already 2 commits behind again. Classic. Merging 5 ddnet forks is a full time job ffs

11:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I need more 'bout layers, groups and tiles
11:42 < bridge> <teero777> okay.
11:42 < bridge> <teero777> what do u need
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Chillerdragon: is there no online GUI tool that can generate the CSS of an animation?
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Also I could swear I messages you for something but can't find it. Maybe I dreamed of you
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah right I was about to type it but stopped, just wanted to talk about what you want to improve SD skin quality of existing skins
11:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks would u use arbitrarely sized integers?
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> to give more optimization opportunities to the backend
11:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> e.g i6, i12, i18
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Chillerdragon: the skin db already supports hd
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So you just need to change the url
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Nothing more xd
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> llvm can do stuff knowing some bits arent used
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Does it really offer optimizations? I cannot directly imagine it, but sounds interesting. Ram usage optimizations?
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> it does, for example bool is a i1 in llvm
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> and llvm can do stuff
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> the frontend too
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> for example rust can do niche optimizations on i1 cuz it has 7 bits
11:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> free
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> > undef' values are things that do not have specified contents.
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> > These are used for a variety of purposes, including global variable initializers and operands to instructions. 'undef' values can occur with any first-class type.
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Undef values aren't exactly constants; if they have multiple uses, they can appear to have different bit patterns at each use. See LangRef.html::undefvalues for details.
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Let's say it like that: I'd recommend you to not use built in types toooo often
11:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> its related
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That kind of defeats type safety
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> E.g. a position and size can both be vec2 but maybe
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Pos and size are better types
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But honestly often in also too lazy xd
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe for normalized floats they are interesting.
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> E.g. if you don't need the precision of u16
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> For gpus
11:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw llvm supports f16, f32, f64,  f128 iirc
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Epyc xd
11:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1214164446310826024/image.png?ex=65f81dc2&is=65e5a8c2&hm=35af0a83d61be380f02e872483dad3a099504341529f0b29394d032f6bbf157e&
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mhh tbh the annoying part is alignment
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And for runtime optimizations it's hard for me to imagine how llvm can optimize anything... For booleans ok
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But i6 vs i8
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Dunno xd
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U the compiler guy now
11:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk either
11:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it may find something
11:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://llvm.org/docs/Passes.html
11:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> there are the passes llvm can do
12:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> No boobie Anime mousepad ? Fake Setup
12:24 < bridge> <BlackHole> it worked in spectate mode before that?
12:25 < bridge> <learath2> Something like `emerge -avt --with-bdeps=y --emptytree @world` should do it
12:27 < bridge> <BlackHole> it worked in spectate mode before that? (sry for ping)
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> is it smart enough to recompile gcc or smth first
12:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if it matters tho
12:29 < bridge> <learath2> It doesn't, portage will take care of the order
12:39 < bridge> <learath2> If you want to be extra sure that everything gets built using gcc that has been built for this system, you can split it in 3.
12:39 < bridge> <learath2> ```
12:39 < bridge> <learath2> emerge -avt gcc-config gcc;
12:39 < bridge> <learath2> emerge -avt --emptytree --with-bdeps=y --oneshot @system;
12:39 < bridge> <learath2> emerge -avt --emptytree --with-bdeps=y @world;
12:39 < bridge> <learath2> ```
12:39 < bridge> <learath2> However that ends up compiling gcc 4 times üòÑ
12:40 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe 6 even now that I think about it
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn xd
12:48 < bridge> <learath2> I guess you can sprinkle `--exclude gcc` there
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ idk bout gui css tools prolly they exist. The thing I want to improve is standard skins not looking worse than mapres in game. Can the skin db url do that for me? How do i use it? I do not want extra skins just my current skins in high res
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Which url do i use for that?
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dunno put /uhd into it somewhere
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well at the end
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Same for community URL
12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i assume no docs on it?
12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> those were just raw http file listings right? So community urls adopted the pattern of creating a /uhd folder?
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ but then i have to turn on download skins
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and it will download all the garbage skins i do not want to see
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but if it can replace the current skins i guess id just have to host my own skins with uhd of standards right?
12:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does it really download skins i have and replace them?
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U can also put the skins in config directory
13:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Yes but thats what the issue is about
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But u can also host them
13:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I don't think thats nice
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah but I didn't know u hate downloaded skins
13:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then id have to put them in every config directory thats way too much maintenance
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I am open for an uhd option inside the client
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But actually I'd prefer if the client ships as few skins as possible
13:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Hosting is fine if the feature works that it automatically replaces my local skins
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> E.g. many of the current shiped ones are really ugly
13:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ yes just replace the current ones with uhd?
13:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ffs i think auto scroll broke
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well we could‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But note that the remakes are not always pixel perfect
13:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did you send an image?
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Did u try the svg repo in ur client already?
13:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well you should
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just for testing ofc
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> To see differences etc
13:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> It does not seem to download
13:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i assumed it would only download skins from others that the client does not already know
13:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i want to see my own skin in high res
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is ur skin even HD in DB?
13:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Not all are in there yet, which we can change ofc
13:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If we have an svg version
13:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://skins.zillyhuhn.com/skin/uhd/greensward.png
13:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> looking at the code verifies my theory it calls find skin and only if it does not find it locally it triggers a download
13:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet ships sd greensward so it does not download hd greensward
13:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/doc/map.md#:~:text=for%20example%20in%20the%20game%20layer%2C%200%20is%20air%2C%201%20is%20hookable%2C%20etc where can i find full list? :thonk:
13:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea so if the skin downloader would replace sd skins with hd skins then that would be good enough for me. I would consider that user friendly enough.
13:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if that already works let me know how jopsti
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah yeah true
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> One more reason to not ship skins xd
13:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Tbh chiller there are other problems anyway
14:31 < bridge> <matodor> ChillerDragon want a `greensward.tee.skin` domain? üòÑ

15:21 < bridge> <matodor> year ago
15:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Chiller, hard to say, because I still don't have a solution for these problems either, not even in my head. But skins are not unique enough, like for example a hash comparison
15:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> There are actually multiple issues I have
15:21 < bridge> <matodor> why ip grabber?
15:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok idk if the blog is being red my internet is too bad :D but nim is in the title and the frame im stuck on shows hookrace.net
15:22 < bridge> <matodor> just redirect to discord server
15:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ name has been the uuid for skins since the beginning of time 
15:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @matodor yes it redirects to discord.
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Chiller yep
15:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> greensward should be replaced by uhd/greensward
15:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ez as that
15:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg i really broke auto scroll with the last update its sooo annoying to chat like this xd might as well use matrix

15:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Show screenshot once u reach 1 fps

15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Map
15:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i can make a map with 1 block

16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Except ofc he already committed his files once
16:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk i just assumed that all git operations create an entry in the reflog
16:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so it doesnt help against ``rm`` but maybe it can revert ``git reset --hard``
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @milkeeycat u can also use patigatus21's tools in web. Except you want to learn the rendering stuff
16:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or look in that web editor
16:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i already made something which can draw basic shapes + with textures
16:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i think the hardest part is behind
16:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :clueless:
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean that sounds good, vanilla rendered all tiles one by one too
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> As a first step. You could try that out
16:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i was going over all tiles and was calling Graphics()->DrawRectExt() xD
16:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sounds OK. If u only do that for visible tiles
16:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Should run okish on normal zoom
16:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i wouldnt say it was ok :justatest:
16:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ill try again later
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes, never give up
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Unrespectable
16:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> u mean which are not off screen?
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Exceptable
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
16:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> at first i was reading ALL of them
16:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but then i decided to add check if they are in a view
16:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Render no tile xdd ez fix
16:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U already did?
16:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i couldnt understand how to get coodinates of user camera
16:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> like top left and bottom right
16:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but there's Graphics()->GetScreen() or smth
16:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i couldve used that, couldnt i? :justatest:
16:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
16:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have 5 more project about tw :kek:

20:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> its pretty solid for now
20:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> better than sway/i3

20:55 < bridge> <capivaracocorico> There could be a tool to make removing friends on ddnet easier
20:59 < bridge> <furo321> Friends are stored in the `settings_ddnet.cfg` at the bottom of the file, so you can just open it with a text editor and remove them that way.

21:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> > This blog post explores an alternative formulation of Rust‚Äôs type system that eschews lifetimes in favor of places. The TL;DR is that instead of having 'a represent a lifetime in the code, it can represent a set of loans, like shared(a.b.c) or mut(x). If this sounds familiar, it should, it‚Äôs the basis for polonius, but reformulated as a type system instead of a static analysis. This blog post is just going to give the high-level ideas. In fol
