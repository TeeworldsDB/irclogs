21:52 < bridge> <imilchshake> Any ideas? Could i be missing dependencies?
22:10 < bridge> <cyberFighter> can u give all of them ai and force them to play ctf 200v200
22:15 < bridge> <teero777> dunno it fails on one of them. i can't be a hoster issue right? normal server works?

22:20 < bridge> <imilchshake> ah sorry forgot to mention: yes, the gameserver itself runs as it should
22:21 < bridge> <imilchshake> are these dependencies just required for development? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet?tab=readme-ov-file#dependencies-on-linux--macos
22:23 < bridge> <teero777> yea
22:25 < bridge> <teero777> you can try but that shouldn't be the issue i think

23:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's so funny lmao
23:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think it works even without breaking physics
23:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @zwelf2 we should test that with your physics üòÑ

23:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean it iterates over so much shit ~2000 times every frame
23:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it checks if the input changed for all these tees
23:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs they are real players xd

00:08 < jtbx> hi all, I'm trying to run the ddnet client but it's failing with "unable to create window: Installed Vulkan doesn't implement the VK_KHR_surface extension". apparently this means vulkan drivers can't be found, I'll look into this later but for now is there a way to disable vulkan at runtime?
00:08 < jtbx> is there some sort of environment variable or command line argument I can use?
00:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> cmake .. -DVULKAN=OFF
00:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> `cmake .. -DVULKAN=OFF`
00:14 < jtbx> yeah I'm doing that now thanks
00:15 < bridge> <learath2> You don‚Äôt need to compile it out. You can switch to opengl at runtime too. Just do `./DDNet ‚Äúgfx_backend opengl‚Äù`

06:56 < Moein> ?
06:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hi
06:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we are still waiting for your response
06:56 < Moein> from where can I obtain fng scores at the end of each round?
06:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> from ewans question
06:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which code base are you currently working in
06:57 < Moein> nothing yet, we want to chose
06:57 < Moein> please guide us
06:57 < Moein> :')
06:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think jopstis fng is best
06:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but not too sure
06:58 < Moein> where is the repo?
06:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you want 0.6 or 0.7 or both?
06:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/Jupeyy/teeworlds-fng2-mod
06:58 < Moein> and do you know my question's answer?
06:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> When 1.0

07:03 < Moein> dude
08:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg pyson is the worst
08:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it took me 5mins to add multi processing to the bash script and i spent hours on porting the same code to python
08:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its literally one character in bash to go blazingly fast on all cpu cores
08:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> at least i managed to max out all cpu cores now... but its probably spent in pyson land trying to compute for loops :D also wtf my progress counter is so drunk

09:24 < bridge> <teero777> what are you doing?
09:25 < bridge> <teero777> btw can I have a chillertube acc?
09:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> will the world ever know who jia tan is

12:14 < bridge> <teero777> True. I'm gonna quit school now
12:14 < bridge> <learath2> Allah willing they are now content with the naming and style and we won't get any more of these massive commits that add nothing but merge conflicts
12:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:15 < bridge> <learath2> Imagine introducing merge conflicts just to make code uglier "GpuId"
12:15 < bridge> <learath2> smh
12:16 < bridge> <teero777> #6775 got completely borked by recent commits of chiller
12:16 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6775
12:17 < bridge> <teero777> Yea it looks ugly asf but ig it's theoretically correct but who cares xd
12:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> going home
12:19 < bridge> <learath2> You may think I'm insane but IMO coding isn't just theory, I feel it has a smidge of art within and these rigid things are ruining that aspect for me
12:19 < bridge> <learath2> Sure functionality above all but there is just something about beautiful code that hits the spot for me
12:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you are always insane
12:21 < bridge> <learath2> It's like telling dali his proportions are off
12:25 < bridge> <teero777> Sometimes optimised code looks so beautiful I get tears in my eyes
12:25 < bridge> <teero777> I'm serious
12:26 < bridge> <learath2> I like the way you think
12:26 < bridge> <teero777> I like it tightly packed :D

12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> it is art
12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust is art
12:28 < bridge> <learath2> See, this brings so much displeasure, if a formatting tool told me this is the best way, I would just not use the formatting tool
12:29 < bridge> <teero777> Please always do if(!c) return;
12:29 < bridge> <learath2> Just opening this file would ruin my morning
12:29 < bridge> <teero777> Sometimes clang format does shit
12:29 < bridge> <learath2> Exactly, the guard pattern is the best, no matter what CS purists say about multiple exit points from functions being bad
12:31 < bridge> <teero777> Like sometimes when I have a lot of vars for the same topic and they have default values Indent the = signs for better readability
12:32 < bridge> <teero777> Like sometimes when I have a lot of vars for the same topic and they have default values I Indent the = signs for better readability
12:32 < bridge> <teero777> What do you think about multilevel inline if statements?
12:33 < bridge> <teero777> Very dirty imo
12:34 < bridge> <learath2> multilevel inline if? like the condition spanning multiple lines?
12:35 < bridge> <teero777> I mean smth like `int a = b >= 63 ? 0 : (c <= 0 ? 31 : 0)`
12:36 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, ternaries. I don't like it if there is more than 2 and there aren't parens
12:36 < bridge> <quet999> And where is the logic of attaching a hook in scripts?
12:37 < bridge> <teero777> what?
12:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> he asked where is the logic of attaching a hook in scripts?
12:38 < bridge> <teero777> I think he's lost
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> :headbot:
12:39 < bridge> <teero777> Imo with long variable names it can get really ugly, especially when having big formulas
12:39 < bridge> <quet999> I mean where is the code associated with the hook
12:39 < bridge> <quet999> I'm lost.
12:39 < bridge> <teero777> Ah that's what you mean
12:39 < bridge> <learath2> gamecore.cpp is where most of it is at
12:40 < bridge> <teero777> Check in gamecore.cpp
12:40 < bridge> <quet999> TILE_TELEINHOOK What is TELE?
12:41 < bridge> <teero777> There are teleporter tiles that teleport the hook to a different position upon hooking them
12:42 < bridge> <teero777> They are orange

17:28 < bridge> <peter0x44> Looking at the hour and then doing the mental calculation 5*minute hand position + 0-4 is annoying
17:28 < bridge> <peter0x44> I don't want to do math to read it
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>       Making system calls can be slow.  In x86 32-bit systems, you can
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        trigger a software interrupt (int $0x80) to tell the kernel you
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        wish to make a system call.  However, this instruction is
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        expensive: it goes through the full interrupt-handling paths in
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        the processor's microcode as well as in the kernel.  Newer
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        processors have faster (but backward incompatible) instructions
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        to initiate system calls.  Rather than require the C library to
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        figure out if this functionality is available at run time, the C
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        library can use functions provided by the kernel in the vDSO.
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        Note that the terminology can be confusing.  On x86 systems, the
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        vDSO function used to determine the preferred method of making a
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        system call is named "__kernel_vsyscall", but on x86-64, the term
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        "vsyscall" also refers to an obsolete way to ask the kernel what
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        time it is or what CPU the caller is on.
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        One frequently used system call is gettimeofday(2).  This system
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        call is called both directly by user-space applications as well
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        as indirectly by the C library.  Think timestamps or timing loops
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        or polling‚Äîall of these frequently need to know what time it is
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        right now.  This information is also not secret‚Äîany application
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        in any privilege mode (root or any unprivileged user) will get
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        the same answer.  Thus the kernel arranges for the information
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        required to answer this question to be placed in memory the
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        process can access.  Now a call to gettimeofday(2) changes from a
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki>        system call to a normal function call and a few memory accesses.
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> interesting
17:29 < bridge> <learath2> You don't do the calculation while reading it. Just by looking at it you instantly know
17:29 < bridge> <peter0x44> I can't do that
17:30 < bridge> <learath2> You can, just need to do it more
17:30 < bridge> <cyberFighter> also i like the ticking sound
17:30 < bridge> <peter0x44> It's not instant for me, reading numbers is
17:30 < bridge> <learath2> Start by memorizing the landmarks, 0 up top, 15 to the right, 30 to bottom, 45 to left
17:31 < bridge> <cyberFighter> minutes do kinda suck tho i agree
17:31 < bridge> <peter0x44> Fuck analog clocks all my homies hate analog clocks
17:31 < bridge> <peter0x44> Who actually finds it easier to read the time from that vs 4 digits
17:31 < bridge> <learath2> Then it's just a matter of how far to the left or right of the landmarks the minute hand is
17:31 < bridge> <peter0x44> Already more effort than reading two numbers
17:31 < bridge> <learath2> Ofc it is, there is a reason we made digital clocks
17:31 < bridge> <learath2> With that attitude yeah, I can see you never being able to do it
17:33 < bridge> <peter0x44> I can do it
17:33 < bridge> <peter0x44> I just don't want to
17:33 < bridge> <peter0x44> Anyway probably not a relevant debate here lol
17:33 < bridge> <learath2> You obviously can't, as if you could then you wouldn't need to do any math
17:33 < bridge> <devinci24> analog is cooler.
17:33 < bridge> <devinci24> Otherwise we wouldn't have overpriced analog watches :greenthing:
17:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i doubt ppl buy 50k watches to know the time
17:36 < bridge> <learath2> expensive watches are more status symbols than anything
