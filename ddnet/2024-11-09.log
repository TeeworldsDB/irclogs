06:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless 132
07:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> After which packet a player is technically connected to a server?
07:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat i would say enter game https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/07/system_messages.html#NETMSG_ENTERGAME
07:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats the last one the client has to send before the server starts sending snapshots
07:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ok, thanks
07:59 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon do you know how to detect krxclient in general?  Like some kind of anti-cheat
08:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes i know some things but nothing i can discuss in a public channel because its a cat and mouse game
08:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for the same reason i will also not include it in the public modification ddnet++
09:04 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon
09:04 < bridge> <woidless> How to get a weapon license
09:04 < bridge> <woidless> I want to use taser
09:05 < bridge> <woidless> I want to use taser
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 read this for a laugh https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/WD-40
09:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless you need a high enough police rank to use the taser
09:56 < bridge> <Aoe> This is super annoying. I have to always change 2x teleports every time I wanna place another cp now.. The new "View" is really nice, but please put all teleports in 1 like it used to..
10:08 < bridge> <Aoe> This is super annoying. Now I have to change 2x numbers every time I wanna place another teleport.. The new "View" is really nice, but please merged all the teleports into one like it used to..
10:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Thanks aoe c:
11:23 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> language barriers boutta be so fun
11:24 < bridge> <learath2> Heh, cute name
11:28 < bridge> <♂S1mple♂> okay?
11:34 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon make it impossible to enter the tournament block in the team
11:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless done
11:53 < bridge> <woidless> And is it possible to implement an anti-cheat, from cheat clints? I even know how to implement it
12:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i thought about building some open source anti cheat but heinrich advised against it and then i also was a bit lazy i dont think it will happen
12:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Why not?
12:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what why not
12:04 < bridge> <woidless> I just know how it can be implemented, can you execute commands in the game console for the player?
12:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not sure what you mean @woidless 
12:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Why heinrich advised against it
12:05 < bridge> <woidless> For example, a player wants to write in the say 105 console can the server do it on behalf of the player
12:06 < bridge> <woidless> So that , for example , this message 105 was sent from the player himself , but it was executed by the server in the console
12:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat i lost the log but i assume it was because anti cheat should be developed in private to not give botters a chance to bypass it
12:07 < bridge> <woidless> ?
12:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ?
12:07 < bridge> <woidless> Is it possible?
12:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i did not understand your message
12:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you mean chat on behalf of others?
12:10 < bridge> <woidless> See
12:10 < bridge> <woidless> The player of my server, for example, wants to write in the game console that opens on f1, he wants to write "say im cheater", can the server write it for him in the console so that it is executed and the command in the console was executed, that is, the message was sent
12:11 < bridge> <woidless> This can help Create an anti-cheat
12:12 < bridge> <woidless> If in 2 words I want to know if the server can execute a console command on behalf of the player?
12:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah no the server has no access to the clients console
12:14 < bridge> <woidless> I just know how the cheat works, for example, a player wants to use balance bot, he clicks on the button on which he linked this function, and the following is performed in the game console "namecheat_balancebot"  If we could keep track of this
12:15 < bridge> <woidless> Then I think it would be easy to create an anti-cheat
12:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes but you can not access that
12:18 < bridge> <woidless> RusskyBlock was able to somehow implement the anti-cheat
12:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes but not by accessing the clients console
12:19 < bridge> <woidless> But here's how
12:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can try asking them for their antibot module they also use a ddnet based mod with an antibot api maybe they use that and are willing to share it 
12:30 < bridge> <woidless> They demand money for the way it works
12:53 < bridge> <Assa> I have some time and motivation, is there a way to add some debug lines in ddnet? I mean something like hitbox, tick-trial, slow-tick options?
12:55 < bridge> <Assa> I have some time and motivation, is there a way to add some debug lines in ddnet? I mean something like hitbox, tick-trial, slow-trails (line from one tick to another) options?
12:55 < bridge> <Assa> I have some time and motivation, is there a way to add some debug lines in ddnet? I mean something like hitbox, tick-trails  (line from one tick to another), slow-tickrate options?
13:56 < bridge> <pathos3005> When your vanilla+ server starts recording demo, does it automatically stop recording when match is finished? I just wanted to double check because I know some mods didn't do this
13:57 < bridge> <pathos3005> Also, can it record/save the statboard `.csv` file at the end of the match also, like when the server command `record` is given at the beginning of the match (possibly by a vote)?
13:59 < bridge> <sollybunny> i only got it after reading half of the page then i snorted like a gremlin
14:04 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1304793726878617621/image.png?ex=6730af5a&is=672f5dda&hm=b325e76cb642895555f75dc85068fea889f9b37823a3a1dd038c513141923eda&
14:05 < bridge> <sollybunny> change this constant to a server config and hope everything just works? lmao
14:05 < bridge> <zhn> line from one tick to another?
14:05 < bridge> <sollybunny> ctrl-shift-d sorta thing?
14:05 < bridge> <zhn> you are too naive :justatest:
14:05 < bridge> <sollybunny> i know it wotn just work
14:06 < bridge> <sollybunny> but i can dream harold
14:06 < bridge> <sollybunny> i mean ill see what happens
14:06 < bridge> <zhn> since tickrate should be synchronized between both client and server sounds kinda unrealistic to make it work that way honestly
14:07 < bridge> <sollybunny> thats why it should be a config
14:07 < bridge> <zhn> by whom
14:07 < bridge> <sollybunny> the server
14:07 < bridge> <sollybunny> it doesnt make sense for the client to have it since.. ther can be multiple clients
14:07 < bridge> <sollybunny> having non matching tickrates will screw everything
14:08 < bridge> <sollybunny> or cause some funny rubberbanding
14:08 < bridge> <sollybunny> or cause some funny rubberbanding more likely
14:17 < bridge> <sollybunny> ah demos would be screwed over by variable tick speeds
14:17 < bridge> <sollybunny> oh not really you can just always play back at default
14:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```c
14:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> MACRO_TUNING_PARAM(GroundControlAccel, ground_control_accel, 100.0f / SERVER_TICK_SPEED, "Acceleration speed on the ground")
14:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> MACRO_TUNING_PARAM(GroundFriction, ground_friction, 0.5f, "Friction on the ground")
14:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> MACRO_TUNING_PARAM(GroundJumpImpulse, ground_jump_impulse, 13.2f, "Impulse when jumping on ground")
14:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> MACRO_TUNING_PARAM(AirJumpImpulse, air_jump_impulse, 12.0f, "Impulse when jumping in air")
14:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> MACRO_TUNING_PARAM(AirControlSpeed, air_control_speed, 250.0f / SERVER_TICK_SPEED, "Max speed the tee can get in the air")
14:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```
14:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> why are these in terms of server tick speed?
14:22 < bridge> <zhn> because if you will really change tick speed, constant physics tunings will screw it up immediately
14:23 < bridge> <zhn> like setting higher tickspeed will give you resulting very fast physics
14:23 < bridge> <zhn> and so on
14:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> thats the idea
14:25 < bridge> <sollybunny> so when these are later divided or multiplied (my head hurts) by tick speed it should be the default tick speed
14:25 < bridge> <sollybunny> uhoh
14:26 < bridge> <sollybunny> i assume tick slowdown wants slow physics as well
14:27 < bridge> <sollybunny> but someone could theoretically want different tickrate with same physics (even though any more just takes up more resources, and any change breaks existing physics)
14:27 < bridge> <sollybunny> you can still change the default tickrate just not at runtime
14:27 < bridge> <sollybunny> you can still change the tickrate (with constnat physics) just not at runtime
14:28 < bridge> <zhn> thats why they're divided
14:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> having less or more ticks still breaks physics
14:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> cuz floating pt error and all that
14:28 < bridge> <zhn> there's another reason for this, code inconsistency
14:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> wdym
14:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> i think its fine if accel is in terms of tickspeed
14:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> just makes changing it at runtime leave out 1 usecase whichever way you do it
14:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> ^ adding the ability to
14:30 < bridge> <sollybunny> i think the slow down (and / speed up) case is more warranted for tas
14:30 < bridge> <zhn> youll just end up moving it from macro to actual usage function
14:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> alot of the times the tickrate is used it comes from a function labeled TickSpeed or GameTickSpeed
14:31 < bridge> <zhn> something like Tune(...) wrapped with TickSpeed() called inside on every query
14:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> u think it should be a tune?
14:32 < bridge> <zhn> wdym
14:32 < bridge> <sollybunny> it shouldnt be able to be changed in tuning sections and also doesnt have to be float
14:33 < bridge> <zhn> what exactly shouldn't be able to be changed in tuning sections?
14:33 < bridge> <sollybunny> tickrate
14:33 < bridge> <zhn> why?
14:33 < bridge> <sollybunny> tickrate (or speed as its called)
14:33 < bridge> <sollybunny> because you then have different parts of the map running at different tickspeeds
14:33 < bridge> <sollybunny> and things like the chat are run of the ticks aswell
14:34 < bridge> <zhn> that's why i proposed to use something that wraps tunings and returns it tickrate-agnostic value
14:34 < bridge> <zhn> so you just call Tune(Name) and it returns you something like ActualTuning / Server()->TickSpeed()
14:34 < bridge> <sollybunny> you could seperate ticks into physics ticks and everything ticks for that to work
14:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> wait wait what
14:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> Name being any current tuning which is then modified by a global speed?
14:35 < bridge> <zhn> ye
14:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> well that can already be done manually, and sure might be useful
14:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> i meant actually changing the tick speed
14:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> for tas sing
14:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> or debug
14:36 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, what's wrong with runtime calculating?
14:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> if you modify tunings you arent actually modfying the tick rate
14:37 < bridge> <zhn> you jump from one to another, i can't really undertand you xd
14:37 < bridge> <Assa> I only want a slower timerate for debugging, thinking about it you could do it with a server and client with cheat engine
14:37 < bridge> <zhn> initial problem was: physics tunings are compile time defined in terms of tickspeed
14:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> this
14:38 < bridge> <Assa> I only want a slower timerate for debugging, thinking about it you could do it with a server and client with cheat engine by slowing the process
14:38 < bridge> <zhn> if you need tunings to be tickspeed agnostic, you should calculate it in runtime, rather in compile time
14:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> you can already cheatengine both the client and server that should work
14:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> we want to change the tickrate
14:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> and have physics slow down and speed up
14:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> we want to change the tickrate (or are suggesting anyway)
14:39 < bridge> <zhn> ah, my god
14:39 < bridge> <zhn> oke i got you
14:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> hehe oke xd
14:39 < bridge> <zhn> i was talking in terms of introducing high-tickrate servers
14:39 < bridge> <zhn> i.e for racing
14:39 < bridge> <zhn> or vani
14:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> i dont see the point in that, are people limited by the tickrate now?
14:39 < bridge> <zhn> physics are limited to it
14:40 < bridge> <sollybunny> well yeah but are people experiencing problems in what they want to do
14:40 < bridge> <Assa> this would actually change physics, at least it would require a patch, I can already find setups which work/don't work depending on position, ticks and subticks
14:40 < bridge> <sollybunny> " I can already find setups which work/don't work depending on position, ticks and subticks" then yeah
14:40 < bridge> <sollybunny> well the position one is obvious
14:40 < bridge> <sollybunny> can the client send input in subticks?
14:41 < bridge> <Assa> no
14:41 < bridge> <sollybunny> if all input is shoved into the next tick then if youre 20% into a tick
14:41 < bridge> <sollybunny> then it shouldnt affect anything
14:41 < bridge> <sollybunny> oh i guess if the sequence is not aligned to ticks
14:42 < bridge> <Assa> yes, gravity is not applied in a subtick* meaning you mostly move in straight lines between ticks
14:42 < bridge> <Assa> if you higher the tickrate, your falling curve will get smoothed out changing the movement behaviour
14:42 < bridge> <sollybunny> well thats tickrate
14:43 < bridge> <sollybunny> im talking about setups failing due to somehow starting on subticks
14:43 < bridge> <sollybunny> or just on a certain tick
14:43 < bridge> <sollybunny> physics shouldnt be dependent on the tick
14:43 < bridge> <sollybunny> apart from moving stuff
14:43 < bridge> <Assa> you con only do inputs on tick, however start and finish times are calculated in subticks
14:43 < bridge> <Assa> you can only do inputs on tick, however start and finish times are calculated in subticks
14:44 < bridge> <sollybunny> map start and finish times?
14:44 < bridge> <Assa> yes
14:44 < bridge> <sollybunny> that seems excessive
14:44 < bridge> <sollybunny> but fine
14:44 < bridge> <sollybunny> doesnt effect setups
14:44 < bridge> <Assa> there are servers tracking the milliseconds, this is calulated, otherwise a 50Hz game couldn't do that, since all times would apply in 0.002 ms
14:45 < bridge> <sollybunny> 0.02s*?
14:45 < bridge> <Assa> there are servers tracking the milliseconds, this is calulated, otherwise a 50Hz game couldn't do that, since all times would apply in 0.02 ms
14:45 < bridge> <Assa> yes 🙈
14:45 < bridge> <sollybunny> i think thats fine
14:45 < bridge> <sollybunny> specially when you cant control the subtick your on
14:45 < bridge> <sollybunny> specially when you cant control the subtick youre on
14:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> and also if you even do subtick precision thats fine it should still be determanistic
14:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> should still be okay to do it in subticks, it should still be determanistic
14:47 < bridge> <Assa> the felt "randomness" comes from minor changes in positioning and chaos, I made a map recently exploiting this
14:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> eg:
14:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> 3 blocks from the map start
14:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> start holding right
14:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> no matter what tick your on the subtick when you cross will be the same
14:48 < bridge> <Assa> here, if you can finish this map without bruteforcing you understand the teeworlds engine.
14:48 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1304804815796174858/CosmicTerrorstaircase.map?ex=6730b9ae&is=672f682e&hm=9ffa0ecaaee81857ed6c407bcbd5a47e46bda1fc553e7033d6d87096e8a9842d&
14:49 < bridge> <Assa> you do the same trick over and over, notice you sometimes make it, sometimes clip, sometimes just die, due to positioning
14:50 < bridge> <sollybunny> if it requires extreme precision, the lack of my bodies precision will come into play
14:50 < bridge> <Assa> exactly
14:50 < bridge> <sollybunny> that isnt ... the engines fault
14:51 < bridge> <sollybunny> i mean if the physics engine could ensure i dont have skill issue. id be delighted
14:51 < bridge> <Assa> no, you can lineupt for each part and make it, you don't have control otherwise over where your ticks are
14:51 < bridge> <sollybunny> the physics shouldnt be dependent on what tick you start a map or setup on
14:52 < bridge> <Assa> it's not the tick (in a sense of which number the tick is), it's the position where you start your input on, since the input is only calulated in ticks, the rest of this parts can lineup
14:53 < bridge> <sollybunny> well yeah... thats not the fault of the game engine
14:53 < bridge> <Assa> well yeah ofc it's the fault of the engine xD but nothing I would fix (or we should fix)
14:53 < bridge> <sollybunny> if you make sure your position is correct, (where an imprecise human would struggle given theyu didnt have a debug ui) then sure a setup will fail
14:54 < bridge> <sollybunny> a perfect human would have no trouble
14:54 < bridge> <Assa> you don't need a debug ui, there are normal client commands to show your position
14:54 < bridge> <sollybunny> a perfect human could also predict the inconsistent tick dependent physics of such a hypotheitcal server
14:54 < bridge> <sollybunny> yeah what i meant by debug ui
14:54 < bridge> <sollybunny> i only ever use it to see if the x position is 53 or 47
14:55 < bridge> <sollybunny> ie lined up to a wall
14:56 < bridge> <Assa> also this ui is kinda* inaccurate, since the comma position only has a rounded multiple of 1/32, but that's yet another topic
14:56 < bridge> <sollybunny> if you use commas for fractioanl parts do u also call the bit which is fractional comma part?
14:56 < bridge> <sollybunny> that makes sense
14:57 < bridge> <sollybunny> o wait is that why its 53?
14:57 < bridge> <sollybunny> and 47
14:57 < bridge> <Assa> yes 😄
14:57 < bridge> <sollybunny> cuz floor(1/32) = 0.03
14:57 < bridge> <sollybunny> what is the actual position?
14:57 < bridge> <sollybunny> cuz floor(1/32 * 100) / 100 = 0.03
14:58 < bridge> <sollybunny> and why can i always stack ontop of someone if that innacurate position matches
14:58 < bridge> <sollybunny> (tested with hf and dummy, as soon as both numbers match i can drop and always lands)
14:58 < bridge> <sollybunny> and why can i always stack ontop of someone if that innacurate position matches
14:58 < bridge> <sollybunny> (tested with hf and dummy, as soon as both numbers match i can drop and always stacks)
14:59 < bridge> <sollybunny> i guess if im aligned to 0.03 through whatever means i did so, then it also aligns perfectly
14:59 < bridge> <Assa> it's just rounded down, you have per tile 32 positions, (or 33 depending how you count)
15:01 < bridge> <Assa> the actual position for 47 is then 15/32 and for 53 17/32
15:02 < bridge> <Assa> I guess this is just truncated, because there is little of no value to show more precision
15:10 < bridge> <Assa> also this map can reliably reproduce the _corner_case_ if anybody ever needs a map for testing 😉
15:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @pathos3005 i do not see replies i just assume you are talking to me. I think demo recording stops correctly with round end but i would also have to test it.
15:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do you need the csv file on the server or client side? For what? The server can already post round end stats to discord or as json to a custom http endpoint. csv and to file is planned but nobody had a real usecase for it yet.
15:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> it appears to have well.. broken
15:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> when i tried to change the tickspeed lmao
15:26 < bridge> <sollybunny> i cant turn antiping off?
15:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> apart from prediction going AAAAAAA, different tickrates are fine
15:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> and when you change the tickrate prediction goes mad for a bit
15:30 < bridge> <Assa> from my understanding, changing for example from 50Hz to 100Hz will apply gravity twice (for example), so what do you mean by "fine" or do you mean just slowing time with cheat engine?
15:30 < bridge> <sollybunny> by fine i mean feels as if you cheat engined it
15:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> but tis really not
15:31 < bridge> <Assa> oh really 🤔
15:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> what i have done just replaces every occorunce of trying to get the tickrate
15:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> with a server settings
15:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> with a server setting
15:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> minus some bits in demos cuz it does that seperatley
15:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> but connection problems, and other players and prediction in general is just borked
15:32 < bridge> <Assa> oh yes, with double the tickrate you send twice as much packages
15:32 < bridge> <Assa> well, at least part of the netcode scales like this
15:32 < bridge> <sollybunny> shoiuldnt be a problem on loopbake
15:32 < bridge> <sollybunny> shoiuldnt be a problem on loopback
15:32 < bridge> <sollybunny> shoiuldnt be a problem on localhost
15:33 < bridge> <sollybunny> i probably shouldve tried changing the constnat first
15:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> changing the constnat works fine
15:47 < bridge> <sannitt.> hi
15:47 < bridge> <Assa> @heinrich5991 I am working on #4523, should I add a MapBug (similar to the double grenade bug) or just fix the bouncing-case?
15:47 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4523
15:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> i dont think the client is getting the updated setting and idk y
15:47 < bridge> <Assa> bad bot
15:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> i dont think the client is getting the updated setting and idk y
15:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> `MACRO_CONFIG_INT(SvTickRate, sv_tick_rate, SERVER_DEFAULT_TICK_RATE, 0, 100, CFGFLAG_SERVER | CFGFLAG_GAME, "Number of ticks per second")`

15:48 < bridge> <sollybunny> in most places no
15:48 < bridge> <sannitt.> is balance bot allowed in kog
15:48 < bridge> <sollybunny> probably not
15:49 < bridge> <sollybunny> "Don't use any tool (client, bot) allowing you to cheat"
15:49 < bridge> <sollybunny> bit of a circular definition there
15:49 < bridge> <sannitt.> o
15:49 < bridge> <sollybunny> but i wouldnt risk it
15:49 < bridge> <sannitt.> u think i will be banned i already use it
15:49 < bridge> <sannitt.> just dont tell them
15:49 < bridge> <sollybunny> just git good
15:49 < bridge> <sollybunny> :)
15:50 < bridge> <sannitt.> im top 170!
15:50 < bridge> <sollybunny> git... better? at balancing?
15:50 < bridge> <sollybunny> (also wow)
15:51 < bridge> <sannitt.> thx for advice ill be sure to think about it
15:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is a client which makes my aim better allowed?
15:51 < bridge> <sollybunny> precision yes, accuracy no
15:51 < bridge> <sannitt.> yes @milkeeycat
15:52 < bridge> <sollybunny> wait really
15:52 < bridge> <Assa> lol, time to make my precision worse and only be able to hook in 8 directions
15:52 < bridge> <sollybunny> that would be making your aim worse
15:52 < bridge> <sannitt.> aimbot client is allowed i think
15:52 < bridge> <sollybunny> i meant if you use the thing i use which multiplies ur mouse position by an amount to fix low precision with low max distance
15:52 < bridge> <sollybunny> "Don't use any tool (client, bot) allowing you to cheat"
15:53 < bridge> <sollybunny> for kog atleast
15:53 < bridge> <sollybunny> and for any competative mode defaintley not
15:54 < bridge> <sannitt.> oh
15:54 < bridge> <sollybunny> i would call aimbot a cheat
16:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> absolutely not - any client modification giving you an advantage is prohibited and will lead to a punishment
16:25 < bridge> <ryumaaaa> Why would you think its allowed <a:AINTNOWAY:1050211099158511626>
16:30 < bridge> <sannitt.> i was bored
16:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Go read a book next time
16:56 < bridge> <sannitt.> im actually ok
16:56 < bridge> <sannitt.> thx for suggestion
17:15 < bridge> <Assa> @robyt3 can you also take a look at my PR? I don't understand what the linter problem there is. This is formatted like anything else in this file
17:16 < bridge> <Assa> ah nevermind it's one line and therefore it doesn't want braces, okay ....
17:26 < bridge> <exosphere___endosphere> why do we need the line
17:26 < bridge> <exosphere___endosphere> ```arm
17:26 < bridge> <exosphere___endosphere> static const vec2 StackedLaserShotgunBugSpeed ​​= vec2(-2147483648.0f, -2147483648.0f);
17:26 < bridge> <exosphere___endosphere> ```
17:26 < bridge> <exosphere___endosphere> in the `laser.cpp` file?
17:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```c
17:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> // The method is needed only to reproduce 'shotgun bug' ddnet#5258
17:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> // Use SetVelocity() instead.

17:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```
17:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> gets used here
17:36 < bridge> <teero777> Hey why are speeders not rendered whe  you have too many
17:36 < bridge> <teero777> Hey why are speeders not rendered when  you have too many
17:36 < bridge> <teero777> Hey why are speeders not rendered when you have too many
17:37 < bridge> <teero777> very not cool
17:37 < bridge> <oxyzo.> they are shy and dont want to be rendered
17:37 < bridge> <chairn> to reproduce a "bug" that was actually used in some maps, so we had to add some code to mimic the bugged behaviour
17:40 < bridge> <teero777> ok it seems to be caused by `m_GLTileBufferingEnabled` when disabled it renders the arrows
17:43 < bridge> <Assa> doey anybody know a map with a huge automatic movement part? I need it for testing
17:43 < bridge> <Assa> does anybody know a map with a huge automatic movement part? I need it for testing
17:43 < bridge> <teero777> lmao
17:44 < bridge> <teero777> that is exactly what i was building rn @essigautomat xddd
17:59 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```c
17:59 < bridge> <sollybunny> m_pEngine = Kernel()->RequestInterface<IEngine>();
17:59 < bridge> <sollybunny>     m_pEditor = Kernel()->RequestInterface<IEditor>();
17:59 < bridge> <sollybunny>     m_pFavorites = Kernel()->RequestInterface<IFavorites>();
17:59 < bridge> <sollybunny>     m_pSound = Kernel()->RequestInterface<IEngineSound>();
18:00 < bridge> <sollybunny>     m_pGameClient = Kernel()->RequestInterface<IGameClient>();
18:00 < bridge> <sollybunny>     m_pInput = Kernel()->RequestInterface<IEngineInput>();
18:00 < bridge> <sollybunny>     m_pMap = Kernel()->RequestInterface<IEngineMap>();
18:00 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```
18:00 < bridge> <sollybunny> why ?
18:00 < bridge> <sollybunny> (cant they just be globals)
18:02 < bridge> <zhn> polluting global space is ":troll:"
18:03 < bridge> <sollybunny> yeah but polluting every class with.. this nonsense
18:03 < bridge> <sollybunny> is stupid
18:03 < bridge> <sollybunny> and makes my brain strain trying to get something from something else
18:04 < bridge> <sollybunny> its like alchemy
18:04 < bridge> <sollybunny> sprinkle some of that file into this interface which is ontop of this thing
18:04 < bridge> <sollybunny> etc etc
18:04 < bridge> <zhn> it makes all classes reusable in any other context
18:05 < bridge> <zhn> they don't depend on globals
18:05 < bridge> <sollybunny> yeah they depend on Kernal()
18:05 < bridge> <sollybunny> and the interface
18:05 < bridge> <sollybunny> s which it gets from it
18:06 < bridge> <zhn> actually it just shadows definition of classes and (probably) makes compiling faster
18:06 < bridge> <zhn> second part maybe not true though
18:06 < bridge> <sollybunny> yeah but cant you just... not do that
18:06 < bridge> <zhn> is there any problem with kernel?
18:07 < bridge> <zhn> you can for example make N implementations of interfaces
18:07 < bridge> <sollybunny> yeah my brain hurts im trying to get CGameClient.m_aClients
18:07 < bridge> <zhn> and use one you need to
18:07 < bridge> <sollybunny> also using virtual means more runtime code
18:07 < bridge> <zhn> like mocking some parts
18:07 < bridge> <zhn> and testing others
18:07 < bridge> <zhn> etc etc
18:08 < bridge> <sollybunny> and also seperating items in classes into more than 1 file kinda defeats seperation of concerns (and kiss)
18:08 < bridge> <zhn> its good design wise, but not used properly since ddnet and tw went open source too early (imo)
18:08 < bridge> <zhn> its literally example of kiss :/
18:08 < bridge> <zhn> everything makes exactly 1 thing, at least was supposed to
18:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> Kernal() acts like a global namespace
18:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> but it isnt
18:09 < bridge> <sollybunny> and interfaces just add another layer to add a definiton
18:09 < bridge> <zhn> it adds a huge amount of flexability
18:09 < bridge> <zhn> its just not used in tw
18:10 < bridge> <zhn> and nailing everything to classes that can be reconsidered is bad imho
18:10 < bridge> <sollybunny> i dont particularly understand. sure you can make another sound interface, then pass it into ?? what
18:10 < bridge> <sollybunny> and if you need to do something more, nothing sstopping you from changing the code
18:10 < bridge> <zhn> and depending on runtime use one you need to
18:11 < bridge> <zhn> ah yeah, good ol switch or if else if else if
18:11 < bridge> <sollybunny> everything is in clases?
18:11 < bridge> <sollybunny> theres alot of that here
18:11 < bridge> <sollybunny> but no
18:11 < bridge> <sollybunny> using inheritence where its needed is fine
18:12 < bridge> <zhn> if you want to refactor it the way you need to, go on
18:12 < bridge> <sollybunny> way too big for me even to try
18:12 < bridge> <zhn> i just can't get problem you are describing
18:12 < bridge> <sollybunny> also cpp beginner lmao
18:12 < bridge> <sollybunny> im trying to get CGameClients.m_aClients
18:12 < bridge> <sollybunny> im trying to get CGameClients().m_aClients
18:12 < bridge> <sollybunny> from
18:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> then get it :Clueless:
18:12 < bridge> <zhn> code link?
18:13 < bridge> <sollybunny> src/engine/client/client.cpp
18:13 < bridge> <zhn> use github links next time :troll:
18:13 < bridge> <sollybunny> i dont remember the prefix for showing files
18:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/master/blob/src/engine/client/client.cpp
18:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> something like that
18:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/src/engine/client/client.cpp
18:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/src/engine/client/client.cpp
18:14 < bridge> <zhn> i mean github link can bring you to exact lines, etc
18:14 < bridge> <zhn> nvm
18:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> that is true
18:15 < bridge> <sollybunny> but this file is just CClient method implementations
18:15 < bridge> <sollybunny> so should apply for anywhere inside one of the functions]
18:15 < bridge> <sollybunny> but this file is mostly CClient method implementations
18:15 < bridge> <sollybunny> so should apply for mostly anywhere inside one of the functions]
18:15 < bridge> <zhn> well, lets say, you want to code client component
18:16 < bridge> <zhn> since you are using global space for everything, you can use literally everything, even server side globals
18:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> im trying my best
18:16 < bridge> <zhn> you are not limited to do what you want, you can even call sound driver from server part
18:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> you just dont include the server globals
18:17 < bridge> <sollybunny> you have client/shared/server like it is rn
18:17 < bridge> <zhn> making it wrapped like this limits you and abstracts you from everything else
18:17 < bridge> <sollybunny> yeah but do you know how to get CGameClients().m_aClients
18:17 < bridge> <zhn> you dont need to include and reinclude every part from definition to get this code running, only to request interface implementation pointer
18:17 < bridge> <zhn> i didn't see it in client.cpp, can you say what lines these are?
18:18 < bridge> <sollybunny> its in gameclient.h
18:18 < bridge> <sollybunny> its in src/game/gameclient.h
18:18 < bridge> <zhn> so whats wrong? its data of all playing players on the server
18:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> how do i get it
18:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> somewhere theres a CGameClients object with the data i want
18:19 < bridge> <zhn> ??, why kernel is problem there then?
18:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> i dont know how to egt it
18:19 < bridge> <zhn> its just undocumented, say tit straight
18:19 < bridge> <zhn> it*
18:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> good code doesnt need documentation
18:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> (most)
18:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> good code != readable code
18:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> gerdoes code is good
18:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> eee yeah
18:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> its just horribly unreadable
18:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> good readable code doesnt need docuemtnation
18:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> :troll_handsome:
18:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> good readable code doesnt need docuemtnation*
18:20 < bridge> <zhn> teeworlds is not the best example of code in first
18:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> im aware
18:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> i dont really care about whether how tw does what it does is the best way to do what tw does
18:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> however
18:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> how do i get the thing i want ):
18:20 < bridge> <zhn> and at second, it is a naming problem, what's problem with kernel?
18:20 < bridge> <zhn> just ask it there
18:20 < bridge> <sollybunny> because its non obvious how i get the thing i want
18:21 < bridge> <sollybunny> i have been
18:21 < bridge> <sollybunny> .
18:21 < bridge> <sollybunny> my brain hurts more
18:21 < bridge> <zhn> from which context? where do you want it to get?
18:21 < bridge> <sollybunny> from a method in CGameClient
18:21 < bridge> <sollybunny> from a method in Client
18:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> from a method in CClient
18:22 < bridge> <zhn> from CClient?
18:22 < bridge> <zhn> why do you need it there in first
18:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> i want to reset prediction
18:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> on a message
18:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> specifically to change the tick rate
18:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> to change the tick rate
18:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> otherwise it bugs out
18:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> :think_bot:
18:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> (or atleast im guessing prediction is messing it up)
18:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> (i was just gonna do it and see)
18:23 < bridge> <zhn> so, whats bad in OnMessage from CGameClient?
18:23 < bridge> <zhn> you can get it there
18:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> its bad that i cant figure it out
18:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> pretend im a python soy boy, and you have to tell me exactly what i write to get the thing i want
18:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> pretend im a python soy boy, and you have to tell me exactly what i write to get the thing i want (and youre chatgpt)
18:23 < bridge> <zhn> cclient is net/protocol wise, you don't really need if you are coding underneath game
18:24 < bridge> <sollybunny> pretend im a python soy boy, and you have to tell me exactly what i write to get the thing i want (and youre chatgpt with a working knoledge of ddnet codebase)
18:24 < bridge> <zhn> its like patching engine to change flag color for example
18:24 < bridge> <sollybunny> well i want to reset prediction when i get the NETMSG_TICK_RATE msg
18:25 < bridge> <zhn> did you code it manually?
18:25 < bridge> <zhn> netmsg i mean
18:25 < bridge> <sollybunny> well i added NETMSG_TICK_RATE yeah
18:25 < bridge> <zhn> you need to change it protocol.py
18:25 < bridge> <zhn> or something like that, in datasrc
18:25 < bridge> <sollybunny> but it works
18:25 < bridge> <sollybunny> but sure
18:26 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```
18:26 < bridge> <sollybunny> else if(Conn == CONN_MAIN && (pPacket->m_Flags & NET_CHUNKFLAG_VITAL) != 0 && Msg == NETMSG_TICK_RATE)
18:26 < bridge> <sollybunny> {
18:26 < bridge> <sollybunny>     int TickRate = Unpacker.GetInt();
18:26 < bridge> <sollybunny>     m_pConsole->Print(IConsole::OUTPUT_LEVEL_STANDARD, "YIPEE", "got tickrate");
18:26 < bridge> <sollybunny>     if(Unpacker.Error())
18:26 < bridge> <sollybunny>     {
18:26 < bridge> <sollybunny>         return;
18:26 < bridge> <sollybunny>     }
18:26 < bridge> <sollybunny>     // this->GameClient().m_aClients
18:26 < bridge> <sollybunny>     // m_PredictedChar.Reset();
18:26 < bridge> <sollybunny>     m_Predicted.Reset();
18:26 < bridge> <sollybunny>     m_PrevPredicted.Reset();
18:26 < bridge> <sollybunny>     g_Config.m_SvTickRate = TickRate;
18:26 < bridge> <sollybunny> }
18:26 < bridge> <sollybunny> ```
18:26 < bridge> <sollybunny> it does indeed say yipee when i change it on server thru rcon
18:27 < bridge> <sollybunny> anyway what should i do then if i shouldnt do it here
18:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> you're recalculating prediction every time ?
18:27 < bridge> <sollybunny> prediction depends on the tickrate, when the tick rate changes the current prediction is invalid
18:27 < bridge> <zhn> move it cgameclient's onmessage, i suppose
18:27 < bridge> <sollybunny> and it bugs out for a time proportional to the change in tickrate
18:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> thus why i thought it was prediction
18:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> i might be completley wrong but this was supposed to just be a see if it works xd
18:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> why are you changing tickrate <a:EssexLemonEat:909223338528890900>
18:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> cuz i wana
18:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kekw: fair enough
18:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> you made me think of that russian game show player who is trapped in said gameshow
18:29 < bridge> <zhn> you better ask @nuborn about prediction part (sry for ping xd)
18:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> but still somehow doesnt hit anvil good enough to win picture of red car
18:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> due to budget cuts or something
18:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> well theres reset methods
18:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> so im gonna try those

19:15 < bridge> <sollybunny> it twas not prediction
19:26 < bridge> <louis> u should learn the basics of c++ if you haven't already
19:29 < bridge> <Assa> also why the hate for python

20:07 < bridge> <sannitt.> how to download bot?
20:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> can i have your ingame name really quick please?
20:08 < bridge> <meloƞ> for academic purposes.
20:08 < bridge> <sannitt.> ur gonna ban me?

20:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> nah it's just when you get caught using a bot client now
20:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> i see this as a way to refer to your public messages
20:09 < bridge> <meloƞ> and shame you publicly

20:11 < bridge> <sollybunny> basics is just knowing how to program in any language with classes
20:11 < bridge> <sannitt.> yea i wouldnt bot lol
20:11 < bridge> <sannitt.> thats for losers
20:12 < bridge> <sollybunny> knowing how to navigate a compleltey foreign codebase where everything is a class and if you drew a class diagram you would summon the spaghetti god... not really

20:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Linux pros, is there a simple way to link a static library with a kernel module 😬
20:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> i only hate python as much as the next guy. basically the only reason i dont like it right now is because how cython is implemented rather than the language itself
20:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> also alot of people learn to code on python. and with the advent of ai which can breeze past any test ever written its fair to understand that ai soy boys and python have become linked
20:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> static link library inside a kernal module
20:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> or other way around?
20:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> is that what you want to do?:

20:28 < bridge> <louis> navigating a foreign codebase is a challenge whether it's in python or cpp
20:28 < bridge> <louis> you just gotta start small and piece it together
20:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> ive been rumaging around lkike a gremlin for a while
20:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> and i still cant find things without a hunt
20:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> but then again thats alot of things
21:07 < bridge> <pathos3005> Yeah the server side -- wow I had no idea about Discord part -- how can I learn about the details?
21:10 < bridge> <pathos3005> Yes sorry, Chiller I was messaging you -- unsure how I can tag you
21:12 < bridge> <pathos3005> But essentially, I imagine some server vote command to look like `vote restart official match; restart 15; record; record_statboard_csv;` or something like that
21:15 < bridge> <pathos3005> But essentially, I imagine some server vote command to look like `vote Start official match; restrict_clan_names; restart 15; record; record_statboard_csv;` or something like that, so clan names are checked, and when disconnect happens, only clan member can substitute (not perfect solution, but still) but the clan part could be future scope
21:16 < bridge> <pathos3005> Then the Linux server uploads the demo somewhere (or even convert to video, as the DDNet client has it, to YouTube API), and the `.csv` file available (I don't think it marks who wins though, especially when disconnected during a match -- can't count all the scores), then some R/Python/etc. script can calculate MMR/ELO using the `.csv` file, then display on the website.

21:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Even if I try to add to compile just one file from library, it yeps about missing `MODULE_LICENSE`, I guess I will have to make a separate version of a library which will contain license in each file :pepeW:
22:24 < bridge> <robyt3> You can run `scripts/fix_style.py` or use Ctrl+K+D in Visual Studio to run clang format and fix this automatically. In this case, you have some spaces in addition to tabs on the lines after those that are referenced in the error messages.
23:25 < bridge> <Assa> that was a badly hidden space 🙈 thank you
