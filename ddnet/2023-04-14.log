10:05 <+ChillerDragon> irc chat is almost as good as club penguin messenger
11:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks how to make clang use clang libc
11:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and not gcc
11:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cmake
11:35 < jupstar> linker flags: -stdlib=libc++ -lc++abi also used -stdlib=libc++ for cpp, dunno if neeeded tho
11:36 < bridge> <Learath2> I'm surprised to report that our graphics backend is more reliable than factorio's 😄
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> How so
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But ours is so simplistic. I'm more surprised how often it not works xd
11:37 < bridge> <Learath2> Factorio will only run fine after I completely restart X11 unless I use the software renderer. No matter whether I do PRIME offloading to the gpu or just use the igpu
11:38 < bridge> <Learath2> Theirs doesn't even launch, stuck at a blackscreen loading
11:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> okay they actually say u need gcc i think to compile llvm
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If software rendering works. It's driver xddd
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Whaaat fbi bro
11:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ok no
11:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i must be missing smth idk
11:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1096369054895317004/image.png
11:39 < bridge> <Learath2> It could be, but no idea at what point. It doesn't even crash or generate any errors anywhere
11:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what do i  need for libomp
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do they use ogl?
11:39 < bridge> <Learath2> Funny both the iGPU and the nvidia driver are both broken the exact same way, makes me suspect X more tbf
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or better, do they use not Vulkan and not dx12
11:39 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah gl3.3 and above on linux
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ah fair point yeah
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Nvidia drivers are rarely broken actually
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Seems like they have enough tests xd
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Uff i can't remember. But i also used it once
11:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i never had issues with fac
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Tho it made my loop slower sad
11:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1096369684028325898/image.png
11:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> could it be
11:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my glibc is bad or smth
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah yeah the good old struggle with c

11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Rust coder with c.
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Non graphics ppl with GPU drivers.
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Java coders with everything
11:48 < bridge> <Learath2> Actually nvm, maybe this computer is just too broken of a setup
11:48 < bridge> <Learath2> Even ddnet doesn't start now 😛
11:48 < bridge> <Learath2> @Jupeyy_Keks how can I pick a gpu?
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Settings -> graphics
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If u mean ddnet
11:49 < bridge> <Learath2> doesn't ever start, so I need a way to pick before I start
11:50 < jupstar_> VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/llvm.json ./DDNet could work for forcing software renderer (lavapipe) i dunno exactly how the .json is called tho
11:51 < jupstar_> might also be in /etc/vulkan or smth
11:54 < bridge> <Learath2> hm, `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 ./DDNet "gfx_backend opengl"` works fine, I'm guessing I somehow broke the driver
11:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> do u use nvidia
11:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> r u on gentoo
11:54 < bridge> <Learath2> am on artix on this laptop
11:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rebuild the nvidia driver after kernel upgrade
11:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk artix
11:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont use normie distros
11:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im a gentoo gentleman
11:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :BASEDDEPT:
11:55 < bridge> <Learath2> I think the issue is the prime offloading, if I try to do anything on the dgpu I have to restart the computer or neither the igpu nor the dgpu works
11:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> whats prime
11:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ah laptop shenanigans
11:56 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah pepew
11:56 < bridge> <Learath2> maybe it's some power management issue idk
11:56 < bridge> <Learath2> but why would running sth on the dgpu break both i and dgpu
11:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> closed hardware problems
11:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if hardware was open source drivers would be easier to make
11:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> blame society
11:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not building libomp seems to allow me to compile
11:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but this grinds my gears
12:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im glad with my new cooling
12:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 80C stable
12:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> compiling llvm for 10 mins
12:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1096380300457680957/image.png
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I still find it rather high tbh
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> My cpu cools better xd
12:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk this is the best i got xd
12:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i have a hyper 210 i think
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I have dark be quite rock pro 3
12:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1096380565504143360/2Q.png
12:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this
12:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with a noctua fan instead
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok mine is like double as big xd
12:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this one is old
12:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ive been using since long
12:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its quite big length wise
12:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> as in
12:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it nearly hits the case wall vertically
12:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but i guess i can get a bigger one to the sides
12:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> + 2 fans? idk if thats worth
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://c.scdn.gr/images/sku_main_images/004334/4334627/20180103131349_be_quiet_dark_rock_pro_3.jpeg
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That's mine xd
12:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U need more radiator space not more fans
12:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> I got 2 chunky fans in the front glass panel
12:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> powering a radiation going full height
12:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> powering a radiator going full height
12:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> exhaust fans are important too
12:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my pc is quite dirty also the front is open cuz things
12:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1096381426183704586/bd09f597-37d9-44a4-bbe5-c34ca27e0933.png
12:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> or else you keep the warmth in the PC
12:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> damn boi
12:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and dont @ me for cable  management
12:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im lazy
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The reason why water cooling works so great isn't BCS water leads heat better than metal, but BCS u move the heat away and have big ass radiators with like 3 fans that cool the heat awaay
12:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> random cables at the front
12:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> no cable management in the back
12:29 < bridge> <DefaultO> Ryozuki is a nerd indeed
12:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this case is quite bad for cable  management
12:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and im lazy to get a new one and change everything
12:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Looks neat tho
12:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I don't see my glass panel. So idc
12:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
12:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah who cares
12:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cable management is only good for instagram gamer girls
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> XDD
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Tru story
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well I have good cpu cable management BCS it was in the way
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But GPU is just plugged in
12:30 < bridge> <Learath2> So llvm can't compile itself?
12:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i got llvm to compile
12:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but i couldnt add the libomp target
12:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or the libc target
12:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk
12:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> llvm are lot of components
12:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS     A semicolon-delimited list selecting which of the other LLVM subprojects to additionally build. (Only effective when using a side-by-side project layout e.g. via git). The default list is empty. Can include: clang, clang-tools-extra, cross-project-tests, flang, libc, libclc, lld, lldb, mlir, openmp, polly, or pstl.

12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i compiled with this
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe i need polly too
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> fck
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh ez
12:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ccache poggies
12:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> polly is the sauce
12:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://polly.llvm.org/
12:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Polly is a high-level loop and data-locality optimizer and optimization infrastructure for LLVM. It uses an abstract mathematical representation based on integer polyhedra to analyze and optimize the memory access pattern of a program. We currently perform classical loop transformations, especially tiling and loop fusion to improve data-locality. Polly can also exploit OpenMP level parallelism, expose SIMDization opportunities.
12:47 < bridge> <Learath2> This is the most annoying thing ever to debug. If I ever try to run anything on the nvidia gpu I have to reboot or no gfx driver will work
12:48 < bridge> <Learath2> No X error, no mesa error, no libgl error, nothing in dmesg
12:49 < bridge> <Learath2> And ddnet vk will use the dgpu without any special environment settings, so that also breaks everything. I can see why linux on laptops is still annoying for people
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sounds horrible indeed. The whole dual GPU situation is out of control anyway
13:14 < bridge> <Learath2> if I'm completely lost debugging it I can see most people just giving up and installing windows or just using the dgpu and wasting their battery
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But maybe with some user friendly distro this wouldn't have happened xd
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Funnily enough I don't have any dual GPU laptop
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Even tho in my family we have quite a few. But gamer laptops disable the igpu often
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Probably to evade trouble like this
13:17 < bridge> <Learath2> actually might be worth trying, I wonder if it happens on ubuntu or pop os
14:30 < bridge> <DefaultO> very generous
14:30 < bridge> <DefaultO> :Cashyx:
14:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :NekoDrink:
14:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so u remember my name
14:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i didnt mention there i was Ryozuki cuz i forgot xD
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Hentai money from @Ryozuki
14:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is my own mony
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Was
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :ddnet:
14:37 < bridge> <Learath2> Ryozuki also draws hentai
14:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks do u know if https://chat.openai.com/ is using gtp4?
14:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i can ask for free
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It has an option in paid version
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But not in free

14:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think ill try for 1 month
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And u have like 25 requests every 3h with it
14:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> wait
14:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> paid is just 25 questions?
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Gpt4
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Gpt3.5 infinite
14:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> meh not worth
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Are u chatting so much with it?
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Tho I don't want to judge if it's worth it at all xd
14:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just wanted to know how good upgrade gpt4 is
14:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U probs won't notice it with normal chatting
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's a bit better in being accurate
14:53 < bridge> <DefaultO> it should take longer to reply than 3.5 tho
14:58 < bridge> <deen> Thanks @Ryozuki !

16:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> actually wanted new gen, but its so expensive rn
16:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and 5000 series gives like 20% more perf for 130€ more
16:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so wasnt really worth it imo
16:30 < bridge> <Ravie> that's not dust, it's volcanic ash from your gpu
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO> that GPU is hanging
16:32 < bridge> <DefaultO> all your setups are utter shit
16:32 < bridge> <hotjop> help!!! me ban
16:33 < bridge> <hotjop> help me< they gave me a ban for nothing

16:34 < bridge> <Voxel> dont ping.
16:40 < bridge> <Learath2> Ye ur gpu seems to be at an angle 😄
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah its too heavy, after a while they deform a bit 😄
17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> without rust bridge:

17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> around 4 seconds faster i think
17:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks i think ur gpu is smaller than mine
17:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 😏
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Since I've seen and build in a 4090 i know how insanely large these beasts are xD
17:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i also built a 4090
17:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> on my sisters pc
17:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
17:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk if its justified them being so big tho
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> My friends 4090 coolers don't even go on xD
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The passiv cooling is so good already at this size
17:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah i didnt see the fans go on
17:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
17:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> at full load 60C
17:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well full load here being playing cyberpunk
18:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Your sister gaminger?
18:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@Ryozuki)
18:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not ddnet tho
18:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my family knows i play this "game about balls moving"
18:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Even better only vanilla teeworlds
18:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but thats it sadly
18:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
18:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Did you pitch it?
18:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i showed it xd
18:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nobody started playing?
18:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ofc i also flaunted "hey look, i contributed to this game"
18:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but well they just say "oh nice"
18:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> My granny is multimap main
18:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nah
18:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I get asked on a daily Basis „did you build this?“ when playin tw in Publix
18:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what
18:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why would they ask that
18:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk maybe they think if it’s not self made why would anyone play Kirby in 2023
18:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And I have glasses
18:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So I lok. snort
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont think glasses mean smart anymore
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i do too
18:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sad
18:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just open ur linux terminal
18:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and type
18:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cmatrix
18:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ez
18:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Then they ask if I hack nsa
18:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also get that a lot actually

22:07 < bridge> <Ewan> idk enough about network to debug very much
22:08 < bridge> <Chairn> we'd rather deal with error message than video... I can't even zoom on the video to see what is written down there
22:08 < bridge> <Ewan> oh really
22:08 < bridge> <Ewan> my bad
22:09 < bridge> <Chairn> think of people not having 4k monitors please
22:09 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
22:09 < bridge> <Ewan> 2023-04-14 14:09:08 I net: failed to bind socket with domain 2 and type 2 (10048 'Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted. ')
22:09 < bridge> <Ewan> 2023-04-14 14:09:08 I net: failed to bind socket with domain 23 and type 2 (10049 'The requested address is not valid in its context. ')
22:09 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
22:09 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not that serious man

22:12 < bridge> <Robyt3> Do you have a line starting with `bindaddr` in your config? If so, remove that line.
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> mm is there a way to dump loaded configs

22:18 < bridge> <Ewan> i get no text matches anywhere a cfg would be
22:18 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1096529917740589136/image.png
22:18 < bridge> <Ewan> but idk how to check otherwise
22:20 < bridge> <Robyt3> Open `settings_ddnet.cfg` with a text editor and search for the text
22:20 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah it's not there
22:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i checked that one by hand
22:20 < bridge> <Robyt3> Then it's something wrong with your network
22:20 < bridge> <Ewan> dang
22:21 < bridge> <Ewan> that's really weird because nothing to my knowledge has changed since it worked
22:21 < bridge> <Ewan> i started it & was ingame and yesterday i wanted to get another client in so i could /practice but it was doing this
22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> for the fun of it i tried disabling the VPN (which is working on a whitelist rn which ddnet *is not on*) and it works
22:23 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, it has been reported before that the client doesn't start when you are connected to a VPN
22:23 < bridge> <Robyt3> maybe something you can change in your VPN settings
22:23 < bridge> <Ewan> well that's the thing it should be unaffected
22:25 < bridge> <Robyt3> Maybe your client tries to bind to the VPN network adapter and can't
22:25 < bridge> <Robyt3> You could try setting the bindaddr to the address of your normal LAN/WLAN network adapter
22:26 < bridge> <Robyt3> Try to start DDNet with `DDNet "bindaddr 192.168.0.100"` (with your local IP address)
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> no dice
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> it works when on the vpn blacklist but i have it whitelist mode since that works way better for be
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> it works when on the vpn blacklist but i have it whitelist mode since that works way better for me
22:38 < bridge> <Ewan> messed up

22:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Zwelf\: maybe u can ban the guy, seems like he automatically retries spamming ^^
22:47 < bridge> <gerdoe> whats advantage of using temporary range loops instead of traditional range loop?
22:49 < bridge> <gerdoe> not an advantage but defference
22:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can u give example code
22:49 < bridge> <gerdoe> difference*
22:50 < bridge> <gerdoe> iterating over pointer array
22:51 < bridge> <gerdoe> ```cpp
22:51 < bridge> <gerdoe> DummyStruct *Dummies[8] = {0}
22:51 < bridge> <gerdoe> for (auto& Dummy : Dummies)
22:51 < bridge> <gerdoe>   std::cout << (Dummy == 0) << std::endl;
22:51 < bridge> <gerdoe> for (auto Dummy : Dummies)
22:51 < bridge> <gerdoe>   std::cout << (Dummy == 0) << std::endl;
22:51 < bridge> <gerdoe> ```
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in this specific case there is no advantage
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the compiler might create the same code for both
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a const reference to a pointer or a copy to a pointer is the same™️
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> except u access its address ofc 😄
22:54 < bridge> <gerdoe> yeah the main usage is to check if there any object and to get any value it contains
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> more problematic is if its an array of objects
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or an array of vectors etc
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> than u create temporary copies
22:55 < bridge> <gerdoe> yup there shouldn't be any problem with array of pointers then
