15:57 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?????
16:55 < ddnet-discord> <deen> @jao Hmm, maybe if you're in /spec, and then go to spectator it  gets stuck?
16:56 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i got that message when i joining /spec
16:56 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> then team -1 in console
16:57 < ddnet-discord> <deen> yeah
16:57 < ddnet-discord> <deen> also, rename the message to say /spec
16:57 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> it doesn't matter, but should be more precise
16:57 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> like
16:57 < ddnet-discord> <deen> and when you join team -1, it should reset being in /spec
16:57 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> "If you want join spectator, use /spec or /pause and kill yourself first
16:58 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> anyway, you have to use console to do that
16:58 < ddnet-discord> <deen> There might be other ways for that to happen
16:59 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> don't know any more :/
16:59 < ddnet-discord> <jao> It didnt work with doing /spec either
17:01 < ddnet-discord> <jao> Also I think I was moved to spec randomly
17:01 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> üò¶ I keep breaking stuff don't I :/
17:48 <@deen> Learath2: hard not to break stuff in DDNet
17:49 <@deen> No tests, spaghetti code, mappers using bugs as features, etc
18:20 < Ryozuki> to much spaghetti :/
18:21 < ddnet-discord> <jao> @Ryozuki when will you implement your tele weapon thing üòê
18:56 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> idk :/
18:56 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> need some graphics and not so interested in now
19:16 < ddnet-discord> <Rico> You mean Portal tele?

22:25 < ddnet-discord> <jao> I got randomly moved to spec and cant rejoin again
22:25 < ddnet-discord> <jao> this seems to be totaly random
22:28 < ddnet-discord> <jao> it should be fixed fast, could be very annoying if it happens in a run
22:43 < ddnet-discord> <deen> @jao remember what server you were on? GER? port?
22:44 < ddnet-discord> <jao> ger 8330
22:44 <@deen> and the time?
22:45 < ddnet-discord> <jao> 22:20~
22:45 <@deen> [17-06-23 22:24:30][server]: ClientID=63 rcon='set_team 35 -1'
22:45 <@deen> Someone used rcon to move you to spec
22:45 < ddnet-discord> <jao> wtf
22:45 < ddnet-discord> <jao> who was it?
22:45 <@deen> [17-06-23 22:29:26][game]: leave player='63:Im 'corneum'
22:45 < ddnet-discord> <jao> i looked but only snail and me were logged in
22:46 < ddnet-discord> <jao> what a guy...
22:46 < ddnet-discord> <jao> he even did it twice
22:47 <@deen> he logged out 3 seconds after doing it
22:47 <@deen> and logged in 5 seconds before
22:47 < ddnet-discord> <jao> great use of rcon
22:47 <@deen> Anyway, not a bug, doesn't belong in this channel
22:47 < ddnet-discord> <jao> yeah nvm this issue then...
22:47 <@deen> I'll remove his mod rights temporarily while some admin can talk to him to figure out what happened
22:48 < ddnet-discord> <jao> k
22:50 <@deen> Learath2: See, no bug of yours :D
23:29 <@heinrich5991> would you be okay with adding a button in the ddnet client that uploads maps from the downloadedmaps folder to my archive if they're missing?
23:29 <@heinrich5991> it would include a warning that the maps are going to be publicly visible and show a list of maps that would be uploaded
23:30 <@heinrich5991> deen: Learath2: EastByte: ^
23:31 <@deen> Hmmmm
23:31 <@deen> heinrich5991: Then you also have to link your thingy on the ddnet.tw website
23:32 <@heinrich5991> that's okay, but I'm not sure how useful that is ‚Äì it still doesn't have a UI
23:32 <@heinrich5991> (apart from the directory listing)
23:32 < ddnet-discord> <RayB.> How do you want to make sure you get the right map ?
23:33 <@deen> heinrich5991: that kind of exposure would lead to some trolls uploading stupid stuff btw
23:33 <@heinrich5991> RayB.: the archive is already there: https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps/
23:33 <@heinrich5991> it doesn't have a concept of "right map"
23:33 <@heinrich5991> hm
23:33 <@heinrich5991> interesting point, deen
23:34 < ddnet-discord> <RayB.> that's actually what I meant. You can just rename maps and troll your system.
23:34 <@deen> and would you actually get interesting maps?
23:34 <@heinrich5991> yes, I guess
23:34 <@deen> I'm not sure what the purpose of your archive is
23:34 <@deen> I think you'd get 1000 versions of a map being mapped
23:35 <@deen> and some people accidentally uploading their DDNet Tournament maps before release
23:35 <@heinrich5991> yep, that's definitely a risk there
23:35 <@deen> Isn't it easier to scan public servers?
23:35 <@heinrich5991> who's got a tournament map before release? the authors and some testers I guess?
23:35 <@deen> and periodacially get the maps that run there
23:35 <@deen> yes
23:36 <@heinrich5991> I also do that, however that seems to miss quite a few maps
23:36 <@deen> and me for taking screenshots etc
23:36 <@heinrich5991> assuming people read warning messages, one could add a paragraph saying that if you're a map author or tester, you should think twice before uploading
23:36 <@heinrich5991> but then, people don't read warning messages
23:37 <@deen> from my experience they would click yes even if you ask them to sacrifice their soul to satan
23:37 <@deen> except when updating client, then they click no in any case
23:42 <+Socialdarwinist> heinrich also collects editions of InfClass maps that cause segfault in clients.
