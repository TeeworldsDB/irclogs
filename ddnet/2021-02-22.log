09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> This might be exactly what i was looking for thanks in regard
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Fox> give me a map of multimaps and 4bigginers sorry for the error in the name

11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Matodor no, all transferred already
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> Why is my lan server trying to connect to master server? It didnt do it before
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> oh its because I ran it from ddnet and not from folder
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, we have a bug for that: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3612
14:01 <+bridge> [freenode] <SaveSaveSave> hi folks, I have made a console command for me, which works like toggle but instead chooses a random number from a range - would ddnet be interested in that?
14:01 <+bridge> [freenode] <SaveSaveSave> because else I would not bother setting up with all the github stuff
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://blog.lastpass.com/2021/02/changes-to-lastpass-free/ I was trying to avoid this for so long but I guess I’ll need to migrate ;/
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyone have any password manager suggestions? Currently I’m thinking of moving to pass and writing the apps for ios and android myself
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> After them notifying me of this change I just changed last pass to keeweb. The have own nextcloud on premise running, so there is keeweb plugin for it

17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I've used Bitwarden for a while, seems ok
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> There is a way to migrate from LastPass to Bitwarden
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and it's OS and you can self-host it, but I haven't done that

19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i use "need" backwards as password

19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> anywhere u go mate you will never be 100% safe
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> anywhere u go or anything u do mate you will never be 100% safe
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> Especially with those shitty usb drives with keypads
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> Better create veracrypt partition, it's portable at least
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> imagine you lose the key XD
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> or the memory on the key fails
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Technoo> oh god
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 also bitwarden. can be selfhosted, there's a third-party impl for the server
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I'll checkout bitwarden but I quite like the simplicity of pass
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> hello i want to compil ddnet but i have cmake errors :WeirdChamp:
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/813530339288023090/unknown.png
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> but i cant download opusfile bcs its .rar folder and when i open the .exe nothing happened
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Try downloading ddnet-libs
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> how
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> wait, why are you building such an old DDNet version?
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 10.8.6 makes no sense
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> i try all xd
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> last to first
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> same prob with the last
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-libs this should be in ddnet-libs directory
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but try it with latest, not 10.8.6
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> k
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> and what i do with this packages?
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> download into ddnet-libs directory
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> ty
