12:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> another great post about them, its not related to the game but to programming project management
12:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> damn massive embeds
12:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Current SDL version is a Dev version I used the next release so it will work as soon as they release it
12:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But it's not impossible that they will still change the api so just remove the version check if you want to try
12:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> New version of ddnet mobile when
12:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> You can make it
12:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> How
12:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> I didnt see any files or projects for mobile version
13:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <nori> jupstar recently added gles backend
14:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <FreZZ7> how can i make my dummy swtich weapon with a bind/ why cant i bind x " +weapon2; toggle c._dummy 0 1" ?

19:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> what's it?
19:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> this
20:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <DisappointMEnt> btw is it hard to make an actual clan feature?
20:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <DisappointMEnt> i feel like currently clans are just names everybody can fake it and it just feels like they are there just for the sake of having clans
20:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Names are easy to fake too, it's just how the game is
20:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <DisappointMEnt> yeah i guess
20:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <DisappointMEnt> why is that anyway?
20:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tried to set gfx_opengl_major 1 in settings_ddnet.cfg?
20:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> funny enough i know a person on win7 who can only use gl 1 and gl 3.3
