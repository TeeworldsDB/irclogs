00:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what about reserving some tiles index for modifications based on ddnet? maybe even visually mark them in entities.png as placeholdes so that modders know those tiles will be unused as ong as possible?
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> Is there anyway to detect ATH client ? I can see ATH uses 2 player flags but what if it doesnt send the flags. Is there any other way to detect it ?
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> yes there is
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> there is a verification packet that only ath replies to
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> look in client.cpp
20:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> @mohsen7s the playerflags + this verif packet will work on every ath version except the newest stealthmode one which has no cheats anyway
20:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mohsen7s> thank you so much @onby
20:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> np)
20:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ATH will not reply to your verification requests unless it's a bw server though
20:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> it will
20:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> just not in stealth mode
20:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> :justatest:
22:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 note that by design, IO stuff won't show up in callgrind
22:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it can only measure things that are bound by CPU
22:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> this callgrind program is so cool xd
23:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ™‚
23:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you aware of valgrind to debug memleaks and undefined behavior, btw?
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> yeah
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> ive known about valgrind for a long time but learath showed me callgrind a week or two ago
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> i had never heard of it
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
23:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> @heinrich5991 u said io stuff wont show up in callgrind, is there some kind of profiling program where io stuff does show up? :o
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but I don't have experience with them
23:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> which program
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I forgot. maybe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gprof
23:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> yee
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> thats what i used to use before i knew about the callgrind thing lol
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> its cool too
23:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you know the flamegraph tool?
23:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that was kinda handy when I wanted to interpret profile results
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> no whats that
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> although perhaps more suited for run-once programs
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I only used it on those
23:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> oo ty ill look into that too
23:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> does it work with the cachegrind output or
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't remember
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry ðŸ˜¦
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's been a while
23:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> np ill google / read stuff
