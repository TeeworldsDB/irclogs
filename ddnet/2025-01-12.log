02:00 < bridge> <samuloll123> Hi guys! how should i start coding the game? I already know a bit c, but i saw its in c++, do you know some good tutorial, or any tips?
02:03 < bridge> <art0007i> i would say look thru gh issues and find something that looks easy then try to do it, if you dont know something search google and anything more specific ask here
02:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @samuloll123: why do you want to code? What do you want to code?
02:34 < bridge> <samuloll123> i really like this game, and im currently learning CS,  and i always wanted to try game development so its looks a good starting point.
02:35 < bridge> <hectavoxel> well, you can always look at the GitHub issues and see if there's any you think you can tackle!
07:54 < bridge> <baby frog> …chatgpt?
07:56 < bridge> <baby frog> i shouldnt have put question mark there
07:57 < bridge> <hectavoxel> Apperantly not. But it might be wrong

07:58 < bridge> <hectavoxel> holy shit im reading this. these are actually awesome ideas
08:11 < bridge> <baby frog> everything except the last paragraph im 95% certain is chatgpt
08:12 < bridge> <baby frog> but i could be partly wrong. i reaaly dont think tho so. im just judging that on the post itself, idk who the guy is
08:12 < bridge> <louis> the ideas are good ideas but i disagree with scriptable aspects
09:20 < bridge> <hectavoxel> @soulyvevo @louis.place

09:43 < bridge> <minem> This is massive:brownbear:
12:52 < ChillerDragon> is the weapon angle not matching the cursor position in demos or maybe even in game a known issue?
12:52 < ChillerDragon> the cursor seems to be behind
12:55 < bridge> <boboczus> you know what else is massive
13:08 < bridge> <coke1465> https://tenor.com/view/big-belly-fat-belly-fat-boy-fat-man-fat-gif-3675389219618087017
13:08 < bridge> <coke1465> i give a guess
13:08 < bridge> <coke1465> i gave a guess
13:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> i dont think this is supposed to be in the developer channel
13:10 < bridge> <meloƞ> Bro why in #developer :pepeW:
13:11 < bridge> <coke1465> bcs idc
16:47 < ChillerDragon> can we expose mobile player status somehow?
16:47 < ChillerDragon> i would like to know if someone is using touch controls or a trigger bot
16:50 < bridge> <kebscs> if they can add a triggerbot, they are gonna flag the mobile flag aswell
16:50 < bridge> <kebscs> if they can add a triggerbot, they are gonna add the mobile flag aswell
16:50 < bridge> <kebscs> if they can add a triggerbot, they are gonna fake the mobile flag aswell
16:54 < bridge> <robyt3> See #9407
16:54 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9407
17:03 < ChillerDragon> ah nice
18:32 < bridge> <alw5> https://learncpp.com
21:38 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> how come there isnt para scrolling in decimals
21:38 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> actually nevermind
22:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1736716468.png
22:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is chilling in kill tiles a new intended feature of practice mode or something?
22:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> yes
22:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> fake github influencer
22:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> i thought you see everything
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he just tested the dev chat
23:08 < bridge> <oxyzo.> next to the indicator of dummy hammer/copy add movement arrows
23:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> So many indicators :monkaStop:
23:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> Do we have a way to render the clientID somewhere else now btw ? Or is it still bound to the left of the name. I'm unable to moderate on high density areas like multeasymap playground or Kobra's First Part because I can't read the ids
23:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> I have to lock spec, press tab and look for the Id in the scoreboard :monkaStop:
23:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> reduce nameplate size
23:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> I'm an old blind man, I need big nameplates :cat_sad:
23:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then go by skin color and use ban hammer in game
23:19 < bridge> <oxyzo.> make other nameplates a little bit darker when you are spectating a person
23:20 < bridge> <0xdeen> @januwu42 Thanks! ^
23:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @meloƞ now that there is click to follow on tees would be cool if in rcon you could refer to the tee you are currently following what do you think?
23:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> Going by skin color is a special take chiller
23:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> Oh a way to act on the locked person immediately?
23:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> good that i am not german
23:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> That sounds cool - I think @animepdf had a proof of concept for a small UI overlay, how is that looking btw?
23:23 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller is trying to emulate american policing strategies
23:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:justatest:572499997178986510>
23:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
23:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when you try to kickvote for "block" and typo it to "black"
23:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> Ah yes. I also hate when I press a instead of o, happens all the time
23:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> Damn autocorrect
23:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> average mobile ddnet gamer
23:25 < bridge> <oxyzo.> yeah a and o are like 40 keys away or smth :greenthing:
23:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @meloƞ who even needs ids when you can type out names like ☯Mڶɴ3☯ by hand https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2169
23:26 < bridge> <oxyzo.> was trying to kick someone for blocking and accidentially type the bible in arabic
23:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> -.-
