10:57 < eeeee> EastByte: so are both issues (creating new connection from spoofed ip to flood the server, packet injection into existing connection to drop clients) solved in 0.7?
10:57 <@EastByte> yes, they are
10:58 < Gabeee> Hey eeeee
10:58 < Gabeee> Are you the ddwar guy?
10:58 <@EastByte> heinrich5991 documented some stuff about the network update here: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/986#issuecomment-153892036https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/986
11:00 <@EastByte> oh fail paste
11:00 <@EastByte> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/986
11:00 < eeeee> last time i looked it hein's stuff didn't use secure prng
11:00 < eeeee> he implemented it for ddnet, not sure if vanilla merged
11:00 <@EastByte> yes, it uses rand() afaik
11:01 < eeeee> that's kinda useless :P
11:01 < eeeee> 10/10 would bruteforce the seed
11:01 <@EastByte> yep, that still needs to be fixed
11:02 < eeeee> so i'm just nitpicking that saying "fixed in 0.7" is not accurate
11:03 <@EastByte> well, I guess it kinda also requires a client update, so yes
11:04 <@EastByte> (I mean otherwise it wouldn't really matter since a prng could be applied at anytime after release)
11:04 <@EastByte> but yes, it's not accurate
11:07 <@EastByte> I wonder how long it will take until Oy takes further steps
13:39 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: I also use state-of-the-art hash functions (md5)
13:51 < masoudd> That's too cutting edge for me
16:35 <+Learath2> heinrich5991, i'd use rot13 in this context
17:25 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] awaysoft opened pull request #417: Add font support for chinese, japanese, korean. (master...add_simplified_chinese_support) https://git.io/vgcMa
19:20 < hellooooo> hello there, is anyone here right now?
19:20 < hellooooo> i really need help for configure router
19:21 < masoudd> why? do you want to run a server?
19:22 < hellooooo> masoudd: no, i just want to have good ping and maybe it is because of router?
19:23 < masoudd> hellooooo: How is your ping depending on a router?
19:23 < hellooooo> on some maps i have really good ping 47 and on some i dont.. 80, 90...
19:23 < masoudd> hellooooo: That's logical
19:23 < masoudd> hellooooo: Or do you mean different maps on the same server?
19:24 < hellooooo> yes, i have ddnet client and i for an example play.. ddrace or something else. in one map i have 47 and second 90
19:24 < hellooooo> if i configure router i can not get some better results?
19:24 < masoudd> hellooooo: different maps in the same server? or different servers?
19:25 < hellooooo> hm..
19:25 < hellooooo> i dont understand your question
19:25 < hellooooo> i am n00bie..
19:25 < masoudd> hellooooo: How do you go from first map to the second? Do you disconnect then connect to another server?
19:26 < hellooooo> yes, like that. disconect from "shiki map" and than i join in second map "kiki:
19:26 < masoudd> hellooooo: That's called "Server". you can change the map of each server
19:26 < hellooooo> but all maps is in the one window list
19:27 < masoudd> hellooooo: Your ping to different servers will be different, depending on where they are
19:27 < hellooooo> so.. nothings gonna be better if i change some ports in router?
19:27 < masoudd> hellooooo: If you are in east Europe and connect to a USA server then of course your ping will be worse
19:28 < masoudd> hellooooo: No. I don't think you can magically change the speed of light
19:28 < hellooooo> i get it. :D
19:28 < hellooooo> masoudd: thanks!
19:28 < masoudd> Just connect to the good servers
19:30 < hellooooo> ok, thanks for the help and tips! bb!
