00:37 < bridge> <kio> open chrome with special conf
00:38 < bridge> <kio> what is this empty class supposed to do? :/

00:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's supposed to do nothing
00:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can check the `#ifdef` above to see what it's supposed to do when discord support is compiled in
00:56 < bridge> <deen> works now?
01:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, I don't see the CORS header in `curl -I 'https://ddnet.org/players/?json2=UnlucksMcGee'`
11:15 < bridge> <deen> fixed, didn't realize that only one location-block can apply in nginx config

15:57 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Can confirm it's working, thank you!
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki ye fzf is the best
17:05 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki try this in ddnet/src xd ``vim $(m="$(rg -n .  | fzf)";echo "$m" | cut -d':' -f1;printf +;echo "$m" | cut -d':' -f2)``
17:13 < bridge> <Voxel> wtf
17:13 < bridge> <Voxel> when will the gameskin svg be added
17:13 <+ChillerDragon> never it virus
17:13 <+ChillerDragon> axaxax
17:13 < bridge> <Voxel> u
17:14 < bridge> <Voxel> also remind me when i get home to fix the uhh
17:14 <+ChillerDragon> i asked you for a change and u ghosted me since december 22
17:14 < bridge> <Voxel> emote svg
17:50 < bridge> <kio> @Learath2 do u use VS?
17:51 < bridge> <Learath2> God no, I would never touch auch awful software
17:52 < bridge> <kio> so u don't know how to do that right? 
17:52 < bridge> <kio> -Open your project in Visual Studio.
17:52 < bridge> <kio> -Right-click on the project name in the Solution Explorer.
17:52 < bridge> <kio> -Select Properties.
17:52 < bridge> <kio> -Select Linker and then Input.
17:52 < bridge> <kio> -In the Additional Dependencies section, add discord-rpc.lib as a dependency.
17:52 < bridge> <kio> -Click OK to save the changes.
17:53 < bridge> <kio> because not being a real Visual Studio project, these buttons don't exist
17:53 < bridge> <Learath2> It wouldn't work anyway. Cmake dictates our linking, we dont even have a vs project
17:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> does vs not come with cmake support?
17:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd guess they do
17:58 < bridge> <Learath2> Not sure if it can edit our cmakelists to add a dependency
17:58 < bridge> <Learath2> I doubt it's that well integrated
17:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oh, I misunderstood
17:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I fully agree with that statement, in light of my earlier misunderstanding
18:14 < bridge> <kio> it's amazing how much ddnet code can confuse me
18:15 < bridge> <kio> Does anyone know how discord RPC built into the code should work?
18:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's in src/engine/client/discord.cpp
18:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it only exposes a `Init`, `Update`, `SetGameInfo` and `ClearGameInfo` function
18:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you ask more specific questions or say what I should talk about?
18:58 < bridge> <kio> they are all empty methods apart from those in the ifdef that I don't understand, then if I remove the calls to the functions I don't know how but the rich present continues to show on my discord, and even if it is shown it is without an image or anything else
19:06 < bridge> <ReiTW> you have to understand how remote procedure calls works
19:09 < bridge> <kio> I run to read me something thanks
19:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the ones in the #ifdef are those that are called
19:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if discord support is compiled in
20:14 < bridge> <Voxel> @ChillerDragon i replied bb
20:14 < bridge> <Voxel> you know i love y
21:04 < bridge> <kio> why my Rich Present is like that
21:04 < bridge> <kio> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1088191388836974693/image.png

21:05 < bridge> <kio> of the regular game without edit
21:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps discord is noticing that a game is running
21:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> without any rpc
21:05 < bridge> <kio> mhh
21:06 < bridge> <kio> ok it's because I had registered the game, but if I remove it it doesn't come out automatically
22:05 < bridge> <Learath2> I thiiink I got mingw working, it was a little annoying to get rust to link with the mingw we are compiling with instead of the one they bundle
22:06 < bridge> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 Q: Could there be an issue with our dependency tree or does everything need to wait on `libddnet_engine_shared.a`?
22:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the final linking needs to wait for that
22:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> other than that, no
22:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I slightly remember that there was something weird about cmake dependencies
22:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but I don't remember it accurately
22:10 < bridge> <Learath2> mh, maybe it's my vm but the entire build stopped waiting for cargo to be done
22:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
22:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe because cargo needs the console?
22:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that'd suck
22:11 < bridge> <Learath2> Okay I got it compiling with mingw so that's good, I'll document the process tomorrow
22:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> cool ðŸ™‚
22:14 < bridge> <Chairn> i think it's just appearance problem on the console
22:14 < bridge> <Chairn> even though rust is running, it still compiles c++ but cannot echo line of compiled file
22:14 < bridge> <Learath2> No, when cargo was done nothing had progressed, it was a slow sync because bad internet
22:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ah
22:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cargo might be slow due to the git index
22:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> use sparse index
22:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its new
22:14 < bridge> <Chairn> that's what it appears to be doing on my windows setup
22:15 < bridge> <Learath2> it might just be hyper-v weirdness with multithreading
23:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 lol
23:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this guy is doing us dirty i think
23:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he made a way to show this code to all ppl
23:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> probs his bot client
23:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well its spam
23:16 < bridge> <Learath2> Looks like he is just changing the name of the client and stuff
23:17 < bridge> <ReiTW> lmao wtf is he doing
23:17 < bridge> <Learath2> rebranding the ddnet client for now ðŸ˜›
23:41 < bridge> <Voxel> LOL
