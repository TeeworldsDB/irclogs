15:08 < goto_die> heyho
15:08 < goto_die> ddnet.tw seems to be attacked
15:08 < goto_die> anyone got the binary releases on a mirror?
15:09 < Henningstone> 9.0.2 is attached to the release on GitHub
15:09 < Henningstone> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/releases/tag/9.0.2 if you don't care about newest version
15:16 < goto_die> I care about the newest
15:16 < goto_die> looks like I have to compile myself
15:16 < Henningstone> that'd be the best solution if you can :P
15:16 < o_be_one> +1, the best is to compile latest !
15:16 < o_be_one> hello all :)
15:29 < Henningstone> btw, page is back
15:30 < o_be_one> rafel is the xrothx v2
15:30 < o_be_one> got many complaints about admin abuse on his servers :/
15:31 < o_be_one> and got "omg your really make admin ******* ???? Wtf !" but they didnt seen that its not my servers ahah :p
15:32 < goto_die> thats why my Server has no Admin Panel
15:35 < o_be_one> its not an admin panel problem, but rcon access problem !
15:36 < o_be_one> new admins are like "oh, he is kind with me, he could be a good admin" but most of tees are just friendly with admins to get more power against theyr enemys
15:36 < o_be_one> its hard for most of players to just stay "solid" against all kind of harassment
15:36 < goto_die> with admin panel i meant rcon
15:36 < goto_die> I just denied rcon via source code
15:37 < o_be_one> in 4 years, i've just known 3 good admins, and i'm happy to keep 2 of them
15:37 < Henningstone> goto_die: not setting a password is the same effect ^-^
15:37 < goto_die> nope
15:37 < Henningstone> lol
15:37 < goto_die> it will generate a random one
15:37 < goto_die> since ddnet 0.234835728332849
15:37 < o_be_one> lol just put a big password (or maybe not set it could work ?) and alow just 1 try (maybe 0 trys could work too)
15:37 < Henningstone> and who should find this out??
15:37 < goto_die> dont remember the commit
15:37 < Henningstone> the random one?
15:37 < goto_die> yeye
15:38 < goto_die> just edit the source and make it like if password = password, deny else deny too :D
15:40 < o_be_one> laul
15:40 < o_be_one> goto_die: what are your servers ?
15:42 < goto_die> just got one
15:42 < goto_die> not that huge
15:42 < goto_die> a starblock server with small source changes
15:44 < o_be_one> nice
15:45 < goto_die> the ppl dont like it because, no admin and the server tells the version of the client to all players
15:52 < o_be_one> goto_die: its good to tell the client version, all should do that
15:52 < o_be_one> cause there's so many players saying "i dont use cheats, i'm on the original TW or ddnet" and they run baumalein, sn0wflake, kclient ...
15:52 < o_be_one> but anyway, not hard to return a fake client version ...
15:53 < goto_die> for users it is for coder it is not
15:53 < o_be_one> no admin point is other thing, and i think its not a good thing
15:53 < o_be_one> theres always something to do ..
15:54 < o_be_one> but i understand people who just doesnt want admins
15:58 < goto_die> no admin = secure
15:59 < o_be_one> not really
16:00 < o_be_one> some players found the way to do what they want with original TW players
16:00 < o_be_one> like killing them, make them telling shits, and other stupid things
16:00 < goto_die> spoofing
16:00 < o_be_one> and there's many shitty tricks like that
16:01 < o_be_one> you cant wait 3 days for a patch ... you have to do something
16:01 < goto_die> i know
16:02 < ReT> Hello
16:02 < ReT> Ddnet client new 9.1 
16:02 < ReT> what
16:02 < ReT> ?

21:01 < Caodym> hi
21:01 < Caodym> ?
21:02 < o_be_one> yo
21:03 < Caodym> i wanna start in code for my own client can i rescue ur help ?
21:04 < o_be_one> oh, sorry i don't code, but here there's good coders ready to help when they have time
21:04 < o_be_one> and if it's for small things
21:04 < o_be_one> (they can't code for you)
21:04 < Caodym> u dont know anythink ?
21:04 < o_be_one> i'm sysadmin, i host servers
21:05 < Caodym> ok 
21:05 < Caodym> i have already see u on the furom :) 
21:06 < o_be_one> oh really ? maybe just for some little things
21:07 < Caodym> yep
21:07 < Caodym> i like ur name :) 
21:07 < o_be_one> je vois que t'es de France d'ailleurs :)
21:07 < Caodym> Oui bonjour 
21:07 < o_be_one> ahah merci ;)
21:24 < Caodym> hello
21:25 < Caodym> i have a question how to compile tw on windows 8 ?
21:25 < Henningstone> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=CompilingEverything
21:25 < Caodym> not for windows 8
21:26 < Henningstone> why not xD
21:26 < Caodym> visual studio 10 ,8,9  only for windows <7 
21:26 < o_be_one> hum
21:26 < Henningstone> then use vs14 that doesn't matter if you do it right ._.
21:26 < Henningstone> (Visual Studio 2015)
21:26 < o_be_one> i've already compiled for Windows Caodym , with Windows 8.1
21:26 < Caodym> it's software ?
21:27 < Caodym> o_b_one u use wich programe for it ?
21:27 < o_be_one> it was like 1 year ago
21:27 < o_be_one> i can't remember :/ (im on linux actually)
21:28 < Caodym> x)
21:28 < Henningstone> o_be_one: good choice :P
21:28 < o_be_one> au pire Caodym avec une VM Windows 7/XP ?
21:28 < Henningstone> for compiling TW??? seems overkill
21:28 < Caodym> n je me suis abituer sa va aller
21:30 < Caodym> Henningstone Dou use vs15 ?
21:30 < Caodym> or otheron e,
21:30 < Caodym> or other one ?
21:31 < Henningstone> I already compiled TW with VS 14.0 yet, yes. It works, but there is a rare chance that it doesn't work the first time
21:31 < Henningstone> but it is easy to fix that if you google :P
21:31 < o_be_one> just to delete a folder iirc
21:32 < Henningstone> yeah smth like this
21:42 < Caodym> so i install vs15 what i need to do ?
21:42 < Henningstone> that would be a good idea if you want to develop on Windows :)
21:55 < Caodym> i already install vs15 now so what i do now ?
21:55 < Henningstone> Henningstone> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=CompilingEverything
22:26 < Caodym> Nope 
22:26 < Caodym> bb i gtg
22:26 < Henningstone> lol
23:12 < goto_die> any coder here right now?
23:12 < Henningstone> I hope :P What's your problem?
23:13 < goto_die> how does the client check showing score or time?
23:15 < Henningstone> I'm not sure what you mean by "check", but the score and time is sent by the server. Have a look at game/client/components/scoreboard.h to see how it works
23:15 < Henningstone> the score is in the snaps
23:18 < goto_die> I just want that ehm if people join on my server that instead of time, score is shown
23:21 < Henningstone> uhm that is a bit difficult, because it is a feature of the DDNet client to convert scores into times, so you can't manage that serverside... that is done here: "game/client/components/scoreboard.cpp, Line 409-420"
23:21 < goto_die> -.-' 
23:22 < Henningstone> did I misunderstand what you want?
23:23 < goto_die> nope
23:23 < goto_die> thats exactly what I already thought
23:24 < goto_die> Is there any way that the client shows score instead of time with enabled cl_ddrace_scoreboard?
23:25 < goto_die> because "if(m_IsGameTypeRace)" means I would have to fake the gametype for that..
23:25 < Henningstone> only if you server is running a non-race-gametype. You could e.g. change the gametype from "DDrace" -> "DDrace." or smth, but idk if that is good...
23:26 < goto_die> this sucks..
23:27 < goto_die> "if (m_ServerRecord > 0)" does this mean if the "score" is lower than 0 it wouldn't show the time?
23:30 < Henningstone> if(!m_ServerRecord > 0) aBuf[0] = 0;
23:30 < Henningstone> that means if the record is greater that zero, it will be just showing nothing
23:31 < goto_die> I should read more than one line..
23:31 < Henningstone> xD
23:31 < goto_die> now I'm fucked :D
23:32 < Henningstone> you can yet fake you fake you gametype :/
23:32 < goto_die> but this sucks :-/
23:32 < Henningstone> yeah that's right ._.
23:34 < goto_die> I just made small server source changes, so renaming the gametype sucks so hard because its still ddrace
23:36 < goto_die> and advertising the people to deactivate cl_ddrace_scoreboard would even suck more..
23:36 < Henningstone> true
23:37 < goto_die> yay lets fake the gametype.. (._.)/
23:43 < goto_die> is it not enough if I change the gamemode in game/server/gamemodes/gamemode.h
23:44 < Henningstone> oh you don't need to change it there. It is enough to only fake it in the serverinfos to be send to the masters.
23:44 < Henningstone> look at "engine/shared/serverbrowser.cpp" for the criteria of a "race gamemode"
23:45 < goto_die> but it works ._.
23:45 < Henningstone> <goto_die> is it not enough
23:45 < Henningstone> what is then not enough??
23:46 < goto_die> I tested it first with  "DDraceFatwork" and it still showed the time
23:46 < Henningstone> because it contains the word "race"
23:46 < Henningstone> Henningstone> look at "engine/shared/serverbrowser.cpp" for the criteria of a "race gamemode"
23:47 < goto_die> okay thanks
