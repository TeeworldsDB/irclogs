00:03 < laxa> I think so
00:03 < laxa> no idea, I am no expert in that field
00:04 <@deen> =/
00:05 < laxa> I'll go back to normal 30 fps videos, it's better. I don't think there is any real difference. I never seen any video with 60 fps on youtube yet beside mine.
00:05 <@deen> your video doesn't work with 60fps for me
00:06 <@deen> and if you get a working 60fps video with good quality that would really be great
00:07 <@deen> I would guess you set your encoder on your computer wrong
00:07 <@deen> bitrate too low probably
00:07 < laxa> yes
00:07 <@deen> 60fps might need twice the bitrate
00:07 < laxa> I guess so
00:07 <@deen> the video is actually 60fps, just checked
00:07 < laxa> didn't thought of that
00:07 <@deen> it looks really smooth
00:08 < laxa> fraps said to me it was taking only 50...
00:08 <@deen> yeah, 60fps with a few frames missing^^

01:15 < Maple> having problem posting image in forum
01:15 < Maple> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=700&p=6215#p6215
01:16 < Maple> oph nvm
01:16 <@deen> 1) use an attachment
01:16 <@deen> problem solved
01:16 < Maple> i was posting a url to the website, not the image itself
01:17 <@deen> i don't like how everyone uses their favorite image uploading site and then half the images won't work in a few months or years
01:19 < Maple> i just dont know how to do it simply otherwise
01:20 <@deen> You click on "Full Editor & Preview"
01:20 <@deen> and at the bottom "Attachments"
01:20 < Maple> aight

02:16 < Maple> sight
02:17 < Maple> ddnet doesnt record half of my runs
02:17 <@deen> just fixed a bug with demo recording today
02:17 <@deen> i hope that was it =/
02:18 <@deen> As a temporary workaround: If you move all your demos away, it should record
02:21 <@deen> you can try the current version from git and see if it fixes all demo recording issues
02:21 <@deen> good night
02:26 < Maple> night
09:21 < Learath2> laxa 60fps does make a differance it looks pretty nice actually
10:41 < laxadedi> deen: ddnet.tw server is overloaded :D
11:52 <@deen> laxadedi: why?
12:54 < laxadedi> on status, cpu goes up to 100% sometimes, what server is that ?
13:03 <@deen> that's the ddnet.tw website
13:03 < laxadedi> Yes
13:03 <@deen> it's just a periodic job running
13:03 <@deen> runs with low priority so everything should be fine
13:03 < laxadedi> What server is the website on ?
13:03 <@deen> and it finishes within a minute but could take 20 min, so I don't see any overload
13:03 <@deen> that's Harmony Hosting
13:04 < laxadedi> oh, you took a 5 euros server for that ?
13:04 <@deen> yes
13:04 < laxadedi> Nice :)
13:04 <@deen> except that from one german hoster you get 90% packet loss on ddnet.tw...
13:05 < laxadedi> Is that a real problem since http is TCP ?
13:05 <@deen> yes, website doesn't even load
13:05 < laxadedi> wow :(
13:05 < laxadedi> anyway, nothing can be perfect I guess, there is always routing problem for some :x
13:06 < laxadedi> make reverse proxy for them maybe ?
13:07 < laxadedi> I thought HH had no routing problem so far
13:09 < laxadedi> Well, I guess a simple reverse proxy on a server with no routing problem would solve anything
13:09 < laxadedi> afk smoke
13:53 < laxadedi> Meow ! <3
13:53 < meow_> sup laxa <3 
13:53 < laxadedi> :D
13:54 < meow_> im about to finish my project soon and i thought about joining webchat for relaxing purposes
13:54 < meow_> just for a few minutes :<
13:54 < meow_> :>*
13:55 < laxadedi> Well, nothing going on, it's IRC.
13:55 < meow_> altough more fun than reading sh!t on the internet
13:55 < meow_> although*+
13:56 < meow_> im kinda tired
13:56 < Maple> laxa hall of fame pl0x
13:57 < laxadedi> I saw the new demo this morning, and now I am at work
13:57 < laxadedi> I'll do that this evening
14:00 < meow_> laxa why are you always logged in with 2 different users?
14:01 < laxadedi> Simple
14:01 < laxadedi> I have mIRC running on my home computer who is turned 24/24 365/365
14:02 < laxadedi> and my irssi running in a screen on my dedi server who is also running 24/24 365/365
14:02 < laxadedi> I use my server when at work or outside of home :)
14:03 < meow_> that explains it :)
14:04 < meow_> next questions is why is your computer turned on 24/7, its electricity wasting, isnt it?
14:04 < laxadedi> yes it is
14:04 < laxadedi> I like to be able to receive messages from steam/skype/hangout even if I am not in front of a computer
14:05 < laxadedi> and it's time wasting to turn on computer and relaunch all your shits when you come back
14:06 < meow_> xD
14:07 < laxadedi> Most geeks let their computer on 24/24
14:07 <@deen> I don't
14:07 < laxadedi> even my mac book is turned on 24/24, but at least he is sleeping on battery
14:07 < meow_> you're calling yourself a geek?
14:08 <@deen> I can't stand any sound in my room, computers need to be off
14:08 < laxadedi> I can't sleep if I don't hear my computer :D
14:08 < meow_> O.O
14:08 < laxadedi> Just joking :p
14:08 < laxadedi> meow_: you think I am not a geek oO ?
14:08 <@deen> even the fanless computers have too loud capacitors...
14:09 < laxadedi> deen: buy a mac, it doesn't make any sound :)
14:09 < meow_> why should i, and that you can't sleep without hearing computer noises i can really imagine it
14:10 <@deen> laxadedi: every mainboard makes sound in my experience
14:10 <@deen> the macs even have fans, don#t they?
14:11 < laxadedi> yes, but they aren't running unless you stress them
14:14 < laxadedi> Well, I could sleep when I was at anqel in the dark and without noise
14:14 < laxadedi> but at my home in France, I have the sound of train + light of screen + computer noise, and that does't disturb me at all.
14:14 < laxadedi> I can sleep in a lots of different conditions :)
14:17 < meow_> thats good bro, i couldn't sleep neither if the screen's light is on nor when i hear any sound except the shitty clicking of my clock. Im sensentive :)
14:19 < laxadedi> Oh right
14:19 < laxadedi> I could hear a clock ticking at anqel when sleeping :D
14:20 < meow_> sometimes my clock wants to troll me and the noise is as loud as a rock concert -.-
14:21 < laxadedi> lol
14:21 < laxadedi> clock is deprecated for me
14:21 < laxadedi> you have a phone or a computer to know the current time
14:23 < meow_> you might think that, but in some cases its easier to take a look on the clock instead of grabbing your phone or looking on the computer
14:24 < meow_> in the most cases my phone isnt around
14:24 < laxadedi> that's bad
14:24 < laxadedi> afk smoje
14:36 < laxadedi> boahhhhh apparently, no fiber until end of 2015 at my parents :(
14:37 < laxadedi> 11.26 km between my city and center of Paris, and I got only 7MB download connection...
14:49 < meow_> same at me, you might think munich is a rich city and well technologized but no, its not. in the local environment still no fiber optics, but a friend a mine has 100kmbit/s just 2 streets down from me -.- fuck this shit
14:50 < meow_> 100MBit/s not 100k xD
14:51 < meow_> And my internet is unstable like when one of my cats hair touch the wlan adapter, explosion
14:51 < meow_> hahahha
14:52 < meow_> or when i throw my headset on my table, disconnect
14:52 <@deen> Sounds like your wlan is weird^^
14:52 < laxadedi> Wtf ?
14:52 < laxadedi> I played yesterday with an online friend at cs:go, he lives in Paris in a little flat
14:53 < laxadedi> he has 1GB connection
14:53 < meow_> :((((
14:53 < laxadedi> #sigh #jealous
14:53 < laxadedi> :D
14:53 < meow_> haha
14:53 <@deen> 1 gbit, right?
14:53 <@deen> not 1 GB/s
14:53 < laxadedi> yeah
14:53 < laxadedi> 1gb
14:53 < laxadedi> same as my server
14:53 < meow_> thats beautiful
14:53 < laxadedi> and when I get fiber
14:53 < laxadedi> I'll only get 100Mbits download / 50 Mbits upload
14:54 < meow_> "only"
14:54 < laxadedi> !fr-en brider
14:54 < Nimda> Translation: bridle
14:54 < meow_> as if its not enough
14:54 < laxadedi> I think most french ISP throttle down optic fiber
14:54 < meow_> thats an harrassment
14:56 < laxadedi> meow_: cs:go at 6:30 tonight ?
14:56 < meow_> but @deen i described my whole sitation kinda exaggregated, its not realy like this but it feels like and every time i disconnect due to ISP issues i fell into high depression
14:56 < meow_> situation*
14:58 < laxadedi> And apparently, someone gave a 85 euros weapon on cs:go to the friend I played with yesterday
14:59 < meow_> lol
14:59 < laxadedi> I guess you never saw it, really rare m4
14:59 < meow_> what's the name of the skin?
15:00 < laxadedi> http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?q=appid:730+M4A4+Howl
15:01 < meow_> i cant, our internally firewalls blocks all what comes from steam
15:02 < laxadedi> lulz
15:02 < meow_> :p
15:02 < meow_> and all those site which have in the meta tags "gaming" are blocked too
15:02 < laxadedi> http://csgostash.com/skins.php?name=M4A4+Howl&id=355
15:03 < laxadedi> http://www.csgostash.com/img/skins/s355.png
15:03 < laxadedi> image should work at least...
15:04 < meow_> nope, both of these links are blocked, but i know the Howl
15:04 < meow_> saw it in exterior FN with StatTrak
15:05 < meow_> my mind was exploding
15:05 < meow_> BRB, smoking
15:11 < meow_> not exterior, i meant condition
15:11 < laxadedi> ok
15:11 < laxadedi> :D
18:47 < laxa> deen: new video, I'll try 60 fps with sound and better bitrate
18:49 < laxa> is there any possibility to integrate the run time while hidding the hud ? Feel like it could be an improvment on video.

21:31 <@deen> laxa: can you build up a small test case for this, I didn't find any bugs in the code last time I looked: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/18
21:36 <@deen> (or look at the code, it should be relatively readable)
21:36 < eeeee> i though about accounts a bit more and seems we only have two options: make it work only for ddnet (trusted servers) with minimal effort (need only some hashing) OR make a tw-wide account system which safely supports rogue servers but that would obviously need the real pubkey handling code
21:37 <@deen> eeeee: why pubkey handling code?
21:37 <@deen> our approach was easier
21:37 < eeeee> i mean if you don't completely trust the server then you essentially would e.g. have the client sign each and every chat message
21:38 <@deen> the client authenticates with the auth-server directly, not over the server
21:38 <@deen> the server never gets any hash or password from the client
21:38 < eeeee> yeah but you only auth the fact that client is connected to the server this way
21:38 <@deen> but the server could ask the auth-server whether that person on its server is actually authed
21:38 < eeeee> but rogue server could still spoof the actual chat messages
21:39 <@deen> yes, but why is that a problem?
21:39 < NICOs> Hi all
21:39 < NICOs> hi deen
21:39 <@deen> hi
21:39 < eeeee> huh i thought like the main reason people ask for accounts is to prevent faking
21:39 <@EastByte> it was about ddnet
21:39 <@EastByte> mainly
21:40 <@deen> we wouldn't prevent faking
21:40 <@deen> but make fakers easily detectable
21:40 <@deen> on any server
21:40 <@deen> the client just asks the auth-server whether that person is actually authed
21:40 < eeeee> say i want to deceive deen by pretending to be EastByte 
21:40 < NICOs> sorry, i don't want to spam, but if there are some testers in this webchat... can them go on ddracenetwork for test a new map?
21:41 <@deen> then I tell you "log in as east please, then we can talk"
21:41 <@deen> NICOs: no testers here, sorry
21:41 < eeeee> so i look up deen's ip somehow (like through irc or skype or sth or just guess his provider)
21:41 < NICOs> ty, i go
21:41 < eeeee> and the i set up two servers on my compter
21:41 < NICOs> Lady Saavik is on ddnet
21:41 < NICOs> i go
21:41 < eeeee> but register them as one ip/port on masters
21:42 < eeeee> then i route everything from deen's ip to one actual server and everything from EastByte to the other server
21:42 <@deen> ok, nice1^
21:42 <@deen> that works
21:42 < eeeee> ^^
21:42 <@deen> eeeee: I see that EastByte was right in saying that we need your help with accounts
21:43 < eeeee> well tbh it's kinda unlikely scenario
21:43 < eeeee> but still might be more plausable ones
21:43 <@deen> yes, but I didn't even consider that possibility
21:44 < eeeee> i only thought about that because i actually did that routing thing once
21:44 <@deen> and there are people recording ip addresses of all players, then correlating them with their join times on servers and sending disconnect spoofed packets from all possible ports to get someone disconnected
21:44 <@deen> so it's not that unlikely
21:44 < eeeee> some kids were trolling our server and i just routed them to fake server
21:44 <@deen> nice
21:45 < eeeee> they thought server was empty and got bored
21:45 <@deen> some kind of shadow-ban
21:45 <@deen> the person doesn't even notice he's banned
21:46 <@deen> I'm still interested in the 256 player code if you have it
21:46 <@EastByte> hm you could even pretend to be ddosed^^
21:46 < eeeee> yeah as far as pretending goes i have lotsa tricks
21:46 < eeeee> have you seen my ServerCrasher software?
21:46 <@EastByte> the official one?
21:47 <@EastByte> I mean the first april joke
21:47 <@deen> aah, the april joke one?
21:47 < eeeee> yeah
21:47 <@deen> i saw the thread
21:47 <@heinrich5991> gimme
21:47 <@heinrich5991> plz :)
21:47 <@EastByte> ^ should be still online?
21:48 < eeeee> binary prolly not online anymore, but you can look at the patch
21:48 <@EastByte> ah
21:48 < eeeee> http://pastie.org/private/pwt45cwd4dh8dl7nabaqw
21:48 <@EastByte> I liked the reaction of some guys: "it works!"
21:50 < eeeee> there's a bug there actually, should be like this http://pastie.org/private/4gn3yklgualtkhbkmwjjeg
21:52 < eeeee> deen: this is the base of 256 player code we used to have https://github.com/fisted/teeworlds/commits/twN
21:53 < eeeee> there might be more up to date code in our private repo but i'd have to get fisted's permission to release it
21:57 < eeeee> also do you guys remember the skin stealing client?
21:58 <@EastByte> hm there are many clients with that feature
21:58 <@EastByte> let me guess, the client you are talking about pretends to steal other player's skins?
21:59 < eeeee> we had some code in ddwar against it. specifically whenever someone uses that to steal a skin it would appear successful to him, but to everyone else he would be visible as "pinky" skin instead of whatever he stole
21:59 <@EastByte> ah^^
22:00 <@deen> eeeee: i think that code is in ddnet server as well
22:00 <@deen> it's just not activated
22:01 < eeeee> yeah feature is a bit controversial but i think it's pretty funny
22:02 < eeeee> and skin stealing is not the trend anymore anyway
22:03 <@EastByte> have you seen the attempts of ddrace bots?
22:03 <@EastByte> the hook flying thing
22:03 <@EastByte> or sticking on tee's head
22:04 < eeeee> we didn't have anything like that back then, and now i'm not playing much so no haven't seen it
22:04 <@deen> or recording other players and replaying it to do solo parts
22:04 < eeeee> tried that though
22:06 < eeeee> i got perfect replay for movement and jumps but never figured out hook
22:06 <@deen> the server doesn't transmit exact hook position of clients to other clients
22:06 <@deen> so you can't do it perfectly
22:07 < eeeee> yeah maybe that's why ^^
22:07 <@heinrich5991> Dune tried that too, but got desyncs due to ping
22:07 <@heinrich5991> have you managed to circumvent that somehow?
22:07 <@EastByte> well you need to guess the real hook position on your own^^
22:08 <@deen> look where the hook lands and interpolate from that
22:08 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: afaik you can tell the server in which tick it'll execute the input
22:09 <@EastByte> deen: or was it different?
22:09 <@deen> not for weapon fire, EastByte 
22:09 <@deen> other inputs yes, i think
22:09 <@EastByte> hmkay
22:09 <@deen> which is pretty bad i think
22:09 <@deen> weapon and jump are desynced
22:10 <@heinrich5991> not so bad for vanilla I guess
22:10 <@deen> weapon is directinput, movement predictedinput
22:10 <@heinrich5991> shooting is always good, jumping however is movement :)
22:10 <@heinrich5991> not so much for ddrace
22:10 <@EastByte> the vanilla argument again^^
22:10 <@deen> Today I wanted to add a function to have a minimal ping
22:10 <@deen> but it failed exactly because of directinput
22:10 <@deen> weapons still happen immediately
22:11 <@deen> would be nice for people who play on multiple servers, to set a fixed ping on all
22:12 <@heinrich5991> ping varies unfortunately

22:52 < Learath2> ofc possible but would show some gibberish to vanilla users

22:55 < eeeee> and it's not necessarily about registering nicks
22:55 < eeeee> just some way to uniquely identify a client would be a start
22:56 < Learath2> eeeee: dont see a way of doing that without the servers cooperation
23:03 < eeeee> well servers cooperation would definitely make it easier, but in client we can control everything so i don't see how servers could interfere
23:06 < eeeee> for the simplest case of ddnet client and ddnet server the easy approach (which only needs hashing) works
23:07 < Learath2> well how do we know if a client is legit 
23:07 < eeeee> would be like 1) on first run client automatically generates random login/pw, stores it in config and sends to server
23:09 < eeeee> 2) then on subsequent connections the client authenticates to server by sending login and hash(login+pw+server_ip+port+salt) where salt is some dynamic thing like time or just passed down from server as challenge
23:09 < Learath2> server_ip as in auth servers ip ?
23:09 < eeeee> game server ip
23:10 < eeeee> if we trust the game server then we don't need auth server
23:10 < Learath2> then we cant have a account system for the whole of teeworlds
23:10 < eeeee> so registration and login could be performed through rcon or chat (transparent to the user ofc)
23:11 < eeeee> and the info on who's logged in would be passed to clients in playerinfo
23:11 < Learath2> its quite easy when the game server is trusted 
23:11 < eeeee> Learath2: yeah as i'm saying, making acc system for all of tw iw like way more complicated
23:12 < Learath2> eeeee: i really see no way of making acc system for whole tw without trusting servers
23:12 < eeeee> and you can't trust servers in whole tw :P
23:14 < Learath2> like could think of some crazy ways of doing it but then not even worth
23:14 < eeeee> we could make clients use pubkeys and then sign chat messages, would probably be good enough
23:14 < Learath2> then everything would look like gibberish to vanilla clients
23:15 < eeeee> fuck the vanilla clients
23:15 < eeeee> so tired of it
23:19 < Learath2> well for trusted game servers we dont even need the hash do we eeeee
23:19 < eeeee> we kinda do
23:20 < Learath2> user auths game server knows who is authed who isnt 
23:21 < eeeee> yeah but you just can't send pw over the network in plaintext
23:22 < Learath2> could just use ssl
23:22 < eeeee> would have to link in ssl 
23:23 < Learath2> oh yep hash sounds way better
23:23 < eeeee> also would be quite a bit of code on server unless we use https
