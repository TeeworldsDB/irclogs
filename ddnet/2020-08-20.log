02:12 < ***> Buffer Playback...
02:12 <+bridge> [02:12:12] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ravie that looks great. thanks for drawing it so quickly, even ðŸ™‚
02:12 < ***> Playback Complete.
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> by the way, I didn't make kitty_x_ninja
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <à¹–Û£ÛœPinxo> it would be nice if the bomb looked like a Bob-Omb xd https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/papermario/images/e/ea/PMCS_Bob-omb.png/revision/latest?cb=20171211040353
04:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> Would it be much work to add proper tiles?
04:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> We have buggy speeders, buggy stoppers, buggy doors, buggy shotgun bullets, buggy death tiles, buggy idk how to call them blue towers that shoot at you.
04:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> 
04:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> I mean at some point it's hard to make proper interesting parts, if all the tiles don't work correctly.
04:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> 
04:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> We need a discussion about what would be useful first. On my most recent map i realised, that not buggy tiles could help at mapping.

04:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> (also konsti just don't talk about this, we can't stay in 2010 forever)
04:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> It's not that hard to fix all these tiles, but it would break a lot of maps. There is just no point in further discussing it, since that would just lead to endless crying from some people.
04:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> like with HT, give us new tiles to work with and keep the old ones
04:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> With enough speed you can just bug through doors. These doors don't help at all xD they are never closed.
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> The old (so far, current) ones, just like old HT could be marked with outdated label in entities the same way it's marked on https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/data/editor/entities/FNG.png (bottom left), and I guess that would be good idea - not breaking old maps while finally having properly working new replacements
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> 
06:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> btw Welf, those are called laser/plasma turrets
06:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and about the doors - I don't remember last time I went for switches to open doors on Kobra map, just ez jetpack speed thru them, or in the latter part open half and bug thru them while going at 45Â°
07:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Margineanu65> pinged ðŸ¤”
07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Margineanu65> @Soreu Thanks.Sorry for ping to
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> np np
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> anyone else want to try merging these 2 fonts? chn3 beijing fails to render
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> should be a bit easier than handling 2 fonts in code
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen i can tell u why ur pr fails
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but can't help you with merging font files xD
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen wrote on github in case im not here soon
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Margineanu65> there's a way to zoom in and out?
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> yeah, settings -> controls
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> zoom in, zoom out
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Margineanu65> ok thanks

10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see one chinese character now
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> xdd
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki i'm trying to fix that, see my PR
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but fontforge is not cooperating, and my code has some bugs where the wrong font is used ingame (but menus work now)
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen  line 1079
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Wrong init
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yay!
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks Jupstar
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you manage to merge the fonts?
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, created a bug: https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/4432
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :watermeron: if we started using fallback font. what are the chance that we can use a ttc with variants instead of just wenquanyi.
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ttc?
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> something like Source Hans CJK
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does that mean different japanese/chinese/traditional chinese chars?
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> yes
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah yea, so we need to use font fallback anyway?
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> a single unicode char should look different under different language
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yep
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> WenQuanYi is sc only, not that I would be the one complaining lol
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie I'm not sure. would be need just one ttc file? how would we tell the difference between japanese/chinese/traditional chinese?
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/745932302860812339/unknown.png
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it is basically multiple fonts combined
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but i'm not sure how you can get different faces in freetype2
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/745932589105414214/SourceHanSans-Regular.ttc
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> first approximation could be by using the user's own locale
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> second one would be sending it over the network so their chat messages/name also renders correctly
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that seems horrible
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> an extra parameter in the language file would do i think
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's the reality of unicode unfortunately
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, i don't like it. text is hard...
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> <a:ghosty:742137614798291046>
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what about the pango library
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt it make it easier
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i guess its not windows
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I'll be fine with SC only tho. but anyway WenQuanYi lacks some of the korean characters. Only use one variant of Source Han will display CJK just fine, only the glyph might look weird to some people.
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> SC?
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> simplified chinese*
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> which is we were using with WenQuanYi.
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/76566b57fbc56606a37ceb3abcfec187e96244cd/src/engine/client/text.cpp#L649
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie is this looking ok?
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/745934029567819776/screenshot-20200820111515.png
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Maybe changing that 0 will do the trick?
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> not bad
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Can you tell if it is ok for korean?
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/745934250959699998/screenshot-20200820111613.png
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think it is fine
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> they can only run into missing char if they chat i think. the UI is fine.
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but the SourceHanSansSC-Normal is quite a bit bigger
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 17 MB
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well they exhausted all 65536 slots of glyphs that's why.
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie unicode contains 1114111 slots
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and that's still not all of CJK chars
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but ttf can't contain more than 65536 glyphs
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> yeah, it is impossible to fit everything into one font
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oof
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i cant imagine the work on making a font like that
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> that's why the Super fonts like HanaZono use two or even three fonts
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> with multiple stages of fallbacks lol
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 65535 is plenty enough for daily usage tho
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> is it possible to delete all glyphs that is already in Deja Vu to reduce the size? I'm not super familiar with font editing.
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> heh, probably, but won't save much I guess, at most 1 MB
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> doens't seem worth the manual effort
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie you have a github account? can you test https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/suites/1074776353/artifacts/14717471 ?
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> what do you want me to test
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the new font
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it should work and look fine with chinese, korean
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> okay i'll take a look
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> Why my ddnet create 41934893189041890 unnecessary cfg ?
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/745940133567791145/unknown.png

11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Plant  this indicates an error in renaming them to settings_ddnet.cfg, probably missing file permissions
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> oohhh ?
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> is this the default installation from steam? did you do anything special?
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> hmm
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> like install with one user, then run with another
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> it's the ddnet from ddnet.tw
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, maybe one time you ran it as administrator?
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> yeaa
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> can i delete all ddnetsettings ?
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, that's the reason, afterwards user can't write to it
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sure, but they contain your settings
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> yeye
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> it create a new ddnet setting every time i change a sett in ddnet
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> because it tries to override the original file
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> change the shortcut settings to always launch game as administrator and should be fine
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nooo, that's the wrong way!
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> crap
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> delete the settings and always launch as user
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (maybe make a backup of the settings)
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> then I'm doing it wrong since....
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> lunch with admin change nothing
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> still create a new one
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rename the whole Teeworlds folder, and try again please
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> rename to what ?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Teeworlds_backup
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> now settings a reset
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> now settings are reset
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @deen rendering looks pretty good. the font weight is a bit thin. maybe use regular instead of normal.
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> actually, \*please\* use regular instead of normal.
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> <a:ghosty:742137614798291046>
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/745943229421322350/unknown.png
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> it still create news
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and we don't need CJKName in Deja Vu anymore do we
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmm
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Plant I'm out of ideas ðŸ˜¦ you can get your settings back by deleting the new Teeworlds folder and renaming Teeworlds_backup to Teeworlds again
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> yeeee i know
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> i gonna reboot my laptop anyway
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plant> thx for helping
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 are you sure about the constexpr patch? I'm not sure I like the ternaries better than the if stmts
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I didn't care about whether to use if/ternaries
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and it's their first contribution, didn't like it breaks anything
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie ok, done
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ’¯
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> love ya.
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > and it's their first contribution, didn't like it breaks anything
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 does ur first contribution give u a pass?
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki your first contribution gets more help from me
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but that has nothing to do with what u said tho :p
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > [11:57 AM] heinrich5991: I didn't care about whether to use if/ternaries
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > [11:57 AM] heinrich5991: and it's their first contribution, didn't like it breaks anything
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I didn't care about if/ternaries
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> given that it's their first contribution, I didn't think long whether we need it or not, since it doesn't break anything
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki where is the problem?
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >  didn't think long whether we need it or not, since it doesn't break anything
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but maybe someday u will not think long a first contribution and it actually breaks something
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well no need to discuss further i guess
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it's fine, though it makes it harder to read, IMHO
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean, usually u should be careful about new contributions, u should trust more actual contributors
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so by my logic it should be the other way around
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its ok
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> repeat contributors should be able to follow coding conventions
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Coddling new contributors is nice, we need more anyway
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so did we come to a consensus whether we can include the steam sdk headers or not?
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm working on an alternate solution
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most repos dont
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should be ready soonâ„¢
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its better to specify a STEAMWORKS_ROOT
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (write our own header)
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 how? wouldn't it end up exactly the same as theirs?
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (only the business logic remains, how and when to use the steam name)
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> APIs aren't really copyrightable IIRC
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're allowed to do interoperability, at the very least in the EU
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 joining a friend by steam is a highly requested feature too
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if its possible
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So including the sdk headers themselves wouldn't be an issue, right?
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki not really possible without some accounts
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also steam has a rich presence, we can use it to show what map u are on
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 why? that doesnt make sense
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually, now that I check the "join friend" api, it looks possible
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamFriends#GetClanTag
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can use this
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to initially fill clan tag too
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 what would you be basing our own headers off of?
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well maybe its to much
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/fec3d76b3e42bf78829119f5a35e082bf1186e9b/src/steam/steam_api_flat.h this is what I use instead of including the headers
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, looks like one of those legal loopholes people come up with on reddit ðŸ˜„
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can't we just ask if we can share the api so we don't need to do this?
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> someone asked it on the steamworks forum already, got no official answer
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and we kinda need to do this anyway, to have a stub library for non-steam
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking of containing this all to one class so we don't need a stub
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I prefer a stub to doing conditional compilation
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> conditional compilation means we need to test one more thing on CI
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> stub brings the steam cruft into the already messy code we have
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where's the cruft in the PR?
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think I contained it to src/steam and src/engine/client/steam.cpp
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does actually look well contained here
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm still not sure I like the shims, I didn't really like the antibot one either tbf
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it allows you to use one binary, simply replacing the dynamic library
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's one more thing we have to keep in sync, I might feel better about it if it was just generated
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had to commit like 4 times the last time I made a change to the antibot code because I forgot to update the shims signatures
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but CI caught it
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's a good failure
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and we don't need to update the API, since steam dictates it
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it? I just stopped whatever else I was doing and commited 3 more times. Then I just went and did something else because I felt exhausted
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I guess atleast this one is a stable API
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's better than a failure in production, yes
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> compiler errors are better than runtime errors
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess, I just see it as an unnecessary hassle and an extra file we need to keep around
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, it's fine, atleast it's well contained
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 don't you need to ship redistributable_bin? that also has the .lib file you need
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> forgot to dllexport symbols from the shim
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is apparently what msvc needs to generate the .lib
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I finally found a name for the issue I was having devising an authentication system
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Zooko's Triangle, a trilemma ðŸ˜›
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have heard blockchain is the solution
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, given we are not implementing a blockchain (nor do we have enough parties to make it even close to not vulnerable to a 51% attack). We need to pick two, so I guess we want human-readable and secure
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > given we are not implementing a blockchain
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> blockchain this blockchain that
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best buzzword
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oddly enough, this is the first time I've seen blockchain actually be the solution to something ðŸ˜„
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/lawful-access-encrypted-data-act-backdoor/
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/id6uet/new_antiencryption_bill_worse_than_earn_it_would/>
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> From now on, you are aloo required to use only repeating XOR for encryption
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 too strong, ROT13 is the only compliable algo
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 too strong, ROT13 is the only compliant algo
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 too strong, ROT13 is the only legal algo from now on
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 too strong, ROT13 is the only legal encryption algo from now on
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Hm... serverside localization. It was implemented infCroya. Though the format was a JSON.
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Hm... serverside localization. It was implemented in infCroya. Though the format was a JSON.
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> would be much better to use terms not english string as keys
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> like "game.mod.infcroya.class.biologist.title"
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> because english string could be changed too (typos, renames and so on) but you will have to use old string as keys forever
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> because english string will be changed too (typos, renames and so on) but you will have to use old string as keys forever
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah,from what i see localization is done usually using keys,not the actual english text as a key
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> gettext-style localization usually uses english, java uses keys
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Either is quite adequate
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But changing the english text is not the samw as changing the keys content
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Imho
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> term-base would require making a list of terms first and (optionally) some kind of terms hierarchy
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> term-based one would require making a list of terms first and (optionally) some kind of terms hierarchy
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> so it's harder to implement ofc especially when in a project the is a gettext one
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> so it's harder to implement ofc especially when in a project there is a gettext one already
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it's an investment in making things less chaotic on the latest stages, ofc tw is fairly stable now
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it's an investment in making things less chaotic on the latest stages, ofc tw vocabulary is fairly stable now
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> though moving from gettext one to terms one would require only altering dictonaries later
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it is still a basic substitute function after all
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> @Jupstar âœª I did som tests on the frame thing. As the gpu work ddnet does is really cheap, at least faster gpus can keep up with the cpu. However, my intel igpu builds up a queue for 4 frames. With a 60hz monitor this could delay the input by one frame when the frametime goes above 4ms. But except for the menus the frametime always stays below 4ms and i guess such delay is fine for the menu.
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here wondering if if i should continue reworking the ui code or not
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> sure xd
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> is it hard to make multi-envelopes quads?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> (just asking)
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why would u use the aspect to calculate the screen size when u have ScreenWidth and ScreenHeight in Graphics() ?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/746035082451484783/unknown.png
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it also does this
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/746035224781258792/unknown.png
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kinda confused
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its to do calculates on the minimum resolution?
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and then it scales it?
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder why
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its to do calculations on the minimum resolution?
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> meh this is useless i guess
18:30 < ***> Buffer Playback...
18:30 <+bridge> [18:24:06] [ddnet] <redix> this isn't useless
18:30 <+bridge> [18:24:07] [ddnet] <redix> the whole ui is based on an internel resolution that is independent from the real resolution
18:30 < ***> Playback Complete.
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @redix about being useless, i was talking about my effort to rework stuff xd
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> okay ðŸ˜„
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > As for packaging, would it be okay to install this shared library (and possibly libddnet-antibot.so) into /usr/lib/ddnet/?
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 it would be okay to do so, weechat does this under /usr/lib/weechat/plugins
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Is this C++ code OK?
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ```
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> int *a;
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> if (1) {
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro>     int b = 123;
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro>     a = &b;
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> }
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> printf("%d\n", *a);
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ```
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Because it compiles without warnings. Would it be OK if this were just a scope instead of an if?
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wouldnt it crash
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It compiles and works ^^
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it feels like it might be undefined behavior
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> like works *usually*
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but could be a point of failure at some point in the future
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro did u use any compiler flag tho
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah I wonder if anyone here knows what the spec says and if it's undefined I wonder why there is no compile warning in gcc
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> no flags
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> use -fsanitize=undefined maybe
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> see if that complains
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> nah works
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen look at my pr, also allows more then one fallback, and can stay like that even if we use only one font soon
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is a very contentious issue actually
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11137516/scope-vs-lifetime-of-variable
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not undefined behaviour is the more accepted view
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro looks like ur code
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like UB
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, I misread that snipped
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> snippet*
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's always ub
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought b was declared outside too
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if it was declared outside then it should be fine
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Note that technically x does not exist beyond its scope however it might happen that the compiler did not remove the contents of x and one might be able to access contents of x beyond its scope through a pointer(as you do).However, a code which does this is not a valid C++ code. It is a code which invokes Undefined Behaviour. Which means anything can happen(you might even see value of x being intact) and one should not expect observable b
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Ah thx, was looking for exactly this stackoverflow post ^^
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my google skills
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Still I want my compiler warning!
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use rust topkek
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ðŸ™„
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby nope, not as straightforward as you'd think
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know any compiler flag for this
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> try using -Wall and all others
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen look at my pr, also allows more than one fallback, and can stay like that even if we use only one font soon
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it's just a block it's well defined, but that if stmt actually makes things very ambiguous in both C and C++
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if both a and b are declared before the `if then i dont see what would go out of scope
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The compilers all agree that it's well defined, so it's fine
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> -Wall doesn't do it (already tried that ^^)
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but the standard never really says anything about the optimizations that are allowed, so one can argue that if the branch isn't taken, it invokes ub by dereferencing garbage
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ohhhh
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> true
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, it's more of a defect of the standard that no one really wants to fix rather than an actual ub any sane compiler would abuse
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I found some other stackoverflow answer stating that if you were to declare another variable outside of the scope it could reuse the same memory and that's probably true if you enable optimizations and `b` isn't used at any later point
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro I don't think you'll get a good warning for this
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe UBsan can help, did you try -Wextra?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> So it seems like the compilers actually check if `b` is used later and allow that
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Nope -Wextra doesn't do it either
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It's probably just as you said, the compilers go out of their way to support this so they don't warn about it
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Note that if you go outside the function EVERY compiler warns you about that without any settings because that simply can't work if the variable lives on the stack
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `MISRA:2012:18.6` I'm guessing if MISRA has a rule for this it's probably not there in any compiler by default
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this looks trivial to detect for compilers though, I wonder why it's not there
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Well it looks like they support this deliberatly
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen https://forum.ddnet.tw/ doesnt resolve to any ip i think
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet.tw does
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/746068424345780264/unknown.png
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen https://forum.ddnet.tw/ doesnt work
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ;forum.ddnet.tw.            IN    A
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u forgot to put something after the A record
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh wait
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nvm
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got confused by dig output
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but it doesnt work anyway
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Novice should really just be called Easy, then everyone would understand it xD
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro hm, why would that be? I see no good use for it
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª true
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Compilers don't keep track of variables using just addresses so it's not address overlap
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u got access to the website? maye u can fix it
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I added an A record for it
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> give it a min
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> If you have
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ```
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> {
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro>   int a;
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro>   do_smth_with(a);
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> }
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> int b;
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> do_smth_with(b);
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ```
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> And you never use `a` outside that scope and you enable optimizations the compiler will reuse the same memory location I'm sure. That should prove that the compiler purposefully checks if `a` is used outside the scope, right?
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> That assumption could be wrong, just got that from another stackoverflow answer
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> works now
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @timakro your thing is undefined xd
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro a could never be used outside the scope though, it's UB
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the compiler is already allowed to do that optimization without even checking
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ok idk that example is not very clear and its probably more complicated than that
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> but the compiler requires deliberate logic to support this use case
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll ask ##c++ tomorrow, they are standard nuts, they'll prolly know
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it won't crash in debug bcs stack variable
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> compiling with optimization gives me a 0 for example
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://godbolt.org/z/h7Txf5
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Margineanu65> ok
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Margineanu65> this is weird
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Margineanu65> i launched steam
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Margineanu65> then ddnet too see if it works
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Margineanu65> then it worked lol
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki works for me, is it fixed?
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> There are more Chinese players than ever before, and more Koreans and Japanese players active also -- please fix the IME :(
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> There are more Chinese players than ever before, even more than Germans, and more Koreans and Japanese players active also -- please fix the IME :(
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pathos we recently made a change to the IME so that the Windows IME can be used. Apparently this is a bit better. But if you can work on a proper fix that would be even greater
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> compiling
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Eyyy Texas and Tom
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Nice
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Good people to add
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> And Dan cao too of course

21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Yeah but typing it is a pain -- Japanese is almost impossible to type
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Korean has gotten slightly worse
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Ryozoozki
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk how to type it
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i probs cant
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> would need to search how on arch linux wiki
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> I explain Korean and Japanese typing briefly here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1030 @Ryozuki
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Just use tab
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not on windows
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I never know if i tabbed the correct squares :feelsbadman:
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @Pathos change os :troll:
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> It doesn't matter if it's on Windows or not, the typing process is still the same
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> IME is just specific to Windows
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> And many Linux distros really suck with CJK
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well on arch u have to setup it urself
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti next release will support CJK for all
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> ETA on next release?
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i'm working on it atm
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> had some build problems
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Ok great, thanks :)

22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lwai> now its back to thick letters why
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its a new font file
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u can replace it with the old one
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lwai> i did and it doesnt work
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lwai> now its not starting
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lwai> ah got it, renaming it to the new name did the deed
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://9gag.com/gag/ax9vKXD
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What happened to the CJK font?
