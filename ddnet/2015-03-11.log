17:32 < EastByte> Congratulations to both
17:32 < EastByte> hi deen, fstd 
17:32 <@deen> hi
17:33 < EastByte> you probably should be friends, just sayin :p
17:33 <@deen> EastByte: No, I prefer hiking and bicycling to climbing :P
17:34 < fstd> you should totally try it ;)
17:34 <@deen> I did, once. It was really fun. But I'm not going to pay for any climbing center or buy equipment
17:35 < EastByte> I rather like indoor climbing
17:35 <@deen> Don't have anything nice to climb outdoor here
17:35 < fstd> where's 'here'?
17:36 <@deen> In the middle of nowhere. Somewhere around Karlruhe
17:36 <@deen> Karlsruhe*
17:38 < fstd> heh, middle of nowhere sounds familiar
17:39 < fstd> not now anymore, but i grew up in such a place;)
