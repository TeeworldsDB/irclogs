22:22 < Updater> hey
22:22 <+Updater> does somebody know how to embed sounds to a map?
22:23 <@deen> yes, Updater
22:23 <@deen> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=2429
22:24 <+Updater> where do i have to put the music file after that?
22:25 <@deen> in data/mapres
22:25 <@deen> then you embed it into the map, and you won't need the music file anymore
22:26 <+Updater> alright, thanks a lot!

22:35 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master d45f857 def: Don't check bam version, who cares
22:47 <@heinrich5991> deen: does it work with a version that isn't the checked one?
22:49 <@deen> works with 0.5, no?
22:49 <@deen> oh, it doesn't
22:49 <@deen> looks like my memory was wrong
22:50 <@deen> so, any way to make it work with 0.4 and 0.5?

22:51 <@deen> heinrich5991: 
22:52 <@heinrich5991> let's see the change
22:52 <+Henningstone> loadfile(filename)  -->  loadfile(filename, nil, options_table)
22:52 <+Henningstone> is the only thing as far as I see
22:53 <@heinrich5991> and something about setfenv
22:54 <@deen> is there a version variable somewhere?
22:54 <@deen> or a way to check version without crashing when it's another one
