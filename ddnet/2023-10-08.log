01:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh i missed a convo
01:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i am also curious
01:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u wanna change this game
01:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> learn C++
01:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> and push forward ur changes
01:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats how it is
01:27 < bridge> <Ewan> who u talking to
01:27 < bridge> <Ewan> discord reply feature is pretty cool
01:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> nobody
01:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> and everyone
01:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> deep
01:33 < bridge> <Ewan> 🥗
01:50 < bridge> <Ewan> are u talking to baby whiny mod guy
01:50 < bridge> <Ewan> whats his fuck
01:50 < bridge> <Ewan> neben
02:23 < bridge> <marmare_314> Can we use something like https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache-apt-packages to improve the CI speed?

03:43 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> Can I have the DDNet and KOG server images so I know what to base the community photo off of? @deen
03:54 < bridge> <murpi> What server images?
04:04 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5654#issuecomment-1751845512
05:01 < bridge> <murpi> Hmm, I was only able to find this logo here which has the same font.
05:01 < bridge> <murpi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1160411539052965888/1.png?ex=65349076&is=65221b76&hm=d11e8bd56f1fc31e006037be6e24318f85ddad9e9dee47e9fa6591de20011606&
05:02 < bridge> <murpi> and the kog logo is probably this here:

08:20 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> When rewrite game in rust
09:07 < bridge> <Ewan> when a small group of volunteers decides to rewrite dozens of thousands of lines of code for pretty much no reason
09:20 < bridge> <teero777> It's called a revolution!
09:20 < bridge> <Ewan> for what
09:20 < bridge> <teero777> idk they don't think stuff is going well and also think they could fix it
09:37 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> but   WHY
09:37 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ddnet works just fine
10:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> because its fun is a valid reason
10:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
10:17 < bridge> <Ewan> this is a very important broadcast
10:17 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1160491144220782642/IMG_2829.JPG?ex=6534da99&is=65226599&hm=0093fe1f09a8e23390fd3e6a0c5e512036c22698339cb92d97b3623eb8def13b&
10:17 < bridge> <Ewan> also relevant
10:17 < bridge> <Ewan> she is a developer
10:23 < ChillerDragon> so important that it is discord only?
10:24 < ChillerDragon> ah its a img my bad thought its a message link xd
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> is the damn signature thing already in effect
10:24 < ChillerDragon> wot signature
10:26 < bridge> <Ewan> discord is adding request signatures to their cdn content
10:26 < bridge> <Ewan> so it expires and maybe can only be viewed on their client
10:26 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ok then do it
10:26 < bridge> <Ewan> special params at the end of an upload link
10:27 < bridge> <Ewan> discord as a file host was fun while it lasted
10:27 < bridge> <Ewan> I’ve uploaded more than my fair share of 100MB 7z archive segments
10:27 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> if ddnet rust rewrite happens i wonder how many changes would happen
10:27 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> like, secret updates
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> refactors?
10:28 < bridge> <Ewan> or like telemetry
10:29 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i mean checking off the issues page
10:30 < bridge> <Ewan> probably not much since that would require amazing coordination
10:30 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i thought parsing the demo file would de the hardest part and rendering that data would be piece of piss. after ive looked at how ddnet does that shit, i think itd be a good idea to rename ddnet-web-demo renderer into demo parser in js :justatest:
10:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> fred hire me to make video games
10:32 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> some days i wish i could inject c++ into my brain so i know how to make good updates for once
10:32 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s not necessarily about cpp
10:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm poor
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s about understanding principles which the code is based on, and the code/its relationships with other parts of itself, and implementation details like whether to use method a or b for whatever
10:35 < bridge> <Ewan> seeing a big code project as just some code in some language is really a harmful and narrow view
10:35 < ChillerDragon> wot no more free cdn
10:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> hi chiller
10:35 < ChillerDragon> hi china
10:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> miss me yet?
10:35 < ChillerDragon> yes veri
10:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> catxplosion
10:35 < ChillerDragon> xd
10:36 < bridge> <Ewan> hru chiller
10:36 < ChillerDragon> gau?
10:36 < ChillerDragon> thats not a thing is it
10:36 < bridge> <Ewan> que
10:36 < ChillerDragon> watafak is que
10:36 < bridge> <Ewan> spanish for what the hell are u talking about
10:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I just drank some monster at 4pm
10:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably a bad idea
10:36 < ChillerDragon> how are you, good and you
10:36 < bridge> <Ewan> bad idea fred
10:37 < bridge> <Ewan> oh cool new acronym acquired
10:37 < bridge> <rem1x> when you guys realize voice chat in client + server? 😄
10:37 < ChillerDragon> i made it up idk
10:37 < bridge> <Ewan> never
10:37 < bridge> <Ewan> bad idea
10:37 < bridge> <rem1x> not bad idea bro
10:37 < bridge> <rem1x> if you talk close at tee
10:37 < bridge> <rem1x> not like for all area
10:37 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i guess thats true
10:37 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i just dream about being able to make anything i want but coding is so `hard`
10:37 < bridge> <Ewan> it would be worse than cod lobbies
10:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nah
10:37 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> you can use dc :poggers2:
10:37 < bridge> <Ewan> coding is easy. developing is hard
10:37 < bridge> <rem1x> bruh native voice in game is better
10:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I already pay so much for bandwidth
10:37 < bridge> <Ewan> planning n shit
10:38 < bridge> <rem1x> its interesting thing, voice if you close at tee
10:38 < bridge> <rem1x> like if they far you don't hear him
10:38 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ppl r gonna micspan
10:38 < bridge> <rem1x> its fixable with mute voice thing
10:38 < bridge> <rem1x> in table mute
10:38 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> imagine how big teehistorian would be with audio storage :justatest:
10:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also protocols and stuff. very hard to make changes without devs yelling at each others
10:38 < bridge> <rem1x> i think its be good integration if its be on ddnet&kog
10:38 < bridge> <Ewan> if it ever comes to ddnet it’ll probably be a reclaimed change from something downstream
10:39 < bridge> <Ewan> some sketchy block server’s implementation or smth
10:39 < bridge> <rem1x> i can try help with it
10:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nope you won't
10:39 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> learn cpp and implement
10:39 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> learn cpp and implement it
10:39 < bridge> <rem1x> its only need realize another mini voice server
10:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> make a discord bot or plugin or something
10:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
10:40 < bridge> <rem1x> discord its another shit
10:40 < bridge> <rem1x> but voice native in game better
10:40 < bridge> <rem1x> its communication
10:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> idc, it's more cost, more mantanaince, more moderation, more reports, more human resources wastes
10:41 < bridge> <rem1x> im play this 15-16 years, and no any haven't tried to implement this
10:41 < bridge> <Ewan> technically it wouldn’t be super hard since opus is already an integral part of the game’s audio and the entire audio input pipeline is already supported by the libs already in use by ddnet. ppl just don’t see a need for it. use discord or smth
10:41 < bridge> <rem1x> its noneed mod at start, its no need at first try make perfect system
10:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you'll be surprised
10:42 < bridge> <rem1x> i mean, need to start small
10:42 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i dont wanna hear teenagers yelling and throwing slurs in voice chat on a blocker server
10:42 < bridge> <rem1x> guys think about it
10:43 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> ew block
10:43 < bridge> <rem1x> its really funny
10:43 < bridge> <rem1x> and cool new communication things
10:43 < bridge> <rem1x> it attracts more people
10:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i also don't want to hear about people reporting about yelling at each other for miniscule issuse
10:43 < bridge> <rem1x> and you can benefit from this
10:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> why
10:43 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> if we cant make fun of kog we cant make fun of block
10:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so we can spend more money on useless features in a free game?
10:43 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i can make fun of both
10:44 < bridge> <rem1x> no money need
10:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lmao
10:44 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> @ heinr
10:44 < bridge> <rem1x> enthusiasm is everything, that’s what the game was all about
10:44 < bridge> <rem1x> this whole game was made thanks to the community and ideas
10:44 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> do servers run on enthusiasm
10:44 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :thonk:
10:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what are you talking about
10:45 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> if u WANT voice chat, add it in yourself.
10:45 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> its open source btw
10:46 < bridge> <rem1x> i mean, to much proggers in tw, developed this game
10:46 < bridge> <rem1x> cool, but for it need some peoples 
10:46 < bridge> <rem1x> to divide the task
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> not really
10:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> no one is gonna work on it
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> a solo dev with the right idea could do it in a week
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> it would just be a shitshow
10:47 < bridge> <rem1x> this is pessimism from your side
10:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's your opinion
10:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and it is wrong
10:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> then do it yourself and get rejected and becomes a fork or something, see if i care
10:48 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> so salty
10:49 < bridge> <Ewan> he gives no fucks rn
10:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i just ate some really salty fish soup
10:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it checks out
10:49 < bridge> <Ewan> thug life
10:49 < bridge> <rem1x> you should never think that it will be a fork, because without trying, you won't know for sure
10:50 < bridge> <Ewan> you will need to fork it to work on it anyway
10:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's not just me if you haven't get the memo
10:50 < bridge> <Ewan> u expecting a mailing list or smth xd
10:50 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1160499487463194725/the_guy_from_up.jpg?ex=6534e25e&is=65226d5e&hm=95739caac6c5ba5bf29b84904f9df103de1a3879da3cd7257989574b12666d42&
10:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the linus workflow
10:51 < bridge> <Ewan> geezer
10:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
10:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> @_voxeldoesart zwelf has a poc in rust of ddnet
10:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Don't yell at me plz
10:53 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> :frozen:
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> Duzzint Matter
10:54 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i mean not gonna lie
10:54 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> if the entire server side code turns into rust itd be kinda cool
10:54 < bridge> <Ewan> We’re all star dust in the end
10:54 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> im not stardust im human
10:55 < bridge> <Ewan> Everything ever is star dust
10:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cool, also it's a nice way to prevent me from working on the source code ever
10:55 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> whats your point
10:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not that I work on anything really
10:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd, this is not us excluding u, its u exlucding urself voluntarely
10:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm very aware of that
10:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i just suck at learning new stuff
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats too bad
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz with rust u learn new things
10:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
10:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i wish i just can just quit my job and have fun
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i dont wanna sound weird, but rust has its "hype" for a reason
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> same speed as C with the borrow checker
10:57 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> learning new things for me starts with learning patterns
10:57 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> its how i learned ddnet code
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> its why it excites ppl who care about systems languages
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a new game
10:57 < bridge> <Ewan> Eventually we will all be compressed into oil and coal and the people of 3.002.023 AD will be wondering how they can rebuild their 5d sphere game in the newest telekinetic programming language
10:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i learned c++ via teeworlds
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> same
10:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i was like 17
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i didnt stop at that
10:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm 28 now bruh
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was 14 :poggers2:
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> im 23
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> i keep learning
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> I’m 57
10:58 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> wjat
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> age is no excuse lol
10:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
10:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but if you work 15hr jobs
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its true for now u dont rly need to learn anything
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> if it works for ur job
10:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> how would you learn
10:58 < bridge> <learath2> You need time to learn 😄
10:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lmao
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well cwait 20 years and i think u will have to put some effort
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> @
10:58 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i got ddnet hooked when i was 17 :justatest:
10:59 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> im 21
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanna be alive when C is obsolete and ppl think of it like fortran or cobol rn
10:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i wanna be alive right now
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> it will not happen in my lifetime
10:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cuz the econemy is killing us lmao
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is always the case  at  any point in time
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol
10:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also i just skipped my job today
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i never heard the news in tv "economy is doing well!"
11:00 < bridge> <learath2> If C has 3 fans, I'm one of them.
11:00 < bridge> <learath2> If C has 1 fan, it is me.
11:00 < bridge> <learath2> If C has no fans, I've died.
11:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think i'm crazy
11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> I would go to school if
11:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wait until you see chinese national media
11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
11:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's "doing very well" here expect for all other countries
11:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh shit the irclog

11:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> bruh, the model knows
11:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> other than the "popular" part i guess
11:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> still very vague tho
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> only about teeworlds cuz old
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> not ddnet
11:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> <a:sadSnail:785072987815804929>
11:05 < bridge> <learath2> I guess it is sort of popular among the list of games that are open source 😄
11:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1160503250366234674/image.png?ex=6534e5df&is=652270df&hm=2446930effea55080a8bda9b0e41bde8dff8e6bcab8a87e67e8c999085fc59df&
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> kinda sucks how that’s why people know it lol
11:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, language model moment
11:05 < bridge> <Ewan> ‘Oh it’s that linnicks game’
11:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> why does it suck
11:06 < bridge> <Ewan> better the game be known for how good it is rather than filling a niche need
11:07 < bridge> <Ewan> the game should be popular because it’s good period not cuz oss
11:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> fair, but I don't think it matters that much
11:07 < bridge> <Ewan> but ppl want graphics
11:07 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder if it has any data about it actually or is just hoping you asked because there is a relationship
11:07 < bridge> <learath2> Ask it if it knows of any relationship between ddracenetwork and cheese
11:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> do language models really know about any data?
11:07 < bridge> <Ewan> ask if it knows who i am
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet is among the open source game with highest concurrent players
11:08 < bridge> <Ewan> terraria?
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> it only competes with that game thats gpl
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgor the name
11:08 < bridge> <learath2> It's training set is in some vague sense of storage is stored in the weights
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> its all numbers
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> float numbers
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> 0.1 02
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> 0.2
11:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> INT numbers in this case tho
11:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's a quantized model
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> wat r u talking about
11:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> running on CPU as well
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> isnt it slow
11:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's ok,
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> or is it smol
11:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's 9GB
11:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so not that huge
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats what she said
11:09 < bridge> <learath2> It's afaik impossible to take the data back out though, so "storage" might not be the best word
11:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also RWKV has low complexity i guess
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> I’d expect response time to be about the same as the online interface
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> doesn’t have to juggle 10000 concurrent requests among its resource pool
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> even if cpu is way slower
11:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> It's probably a little bit slower than chatGPT
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> knowing fred’s hardware that is lol
11:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> no internet required tho
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
11:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and it is the largest model I can find for RWKV
11:11 < bridge> <learath2> Can it write code?
11:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably
11:11 < bridge> <learath2> Ask it for a C fizzbuzz
11:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats RWKV
11:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> This model is fine-tuned for chinese
11:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
11:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> Xi approved?
11:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think it's trying it's best for english
11:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> :pepeW:
11:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nah, just the model trainer is chinese, so he released a fune-tuned model
11:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont u have problems with AI and censorship there
11:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> what if it says something about taiwan numba 1
11:12 < bridge> <learath2> Oh, interesting
11:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also I think this model might not be legal cuz they do train it against openai
11:12 < bridge> <learath2> <a:AmberSweat:782407598015250472>
11:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it even tried to tell you that it's trained by openai only because the training set is so weird
11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> <a:frogsweat:880516410495864883>
11:12 < bridge> <Ewan> I’m telling big brother
11:12 < bridge> <Ewan> you’re gonna be grohnded
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> grounded
11:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and it breaks and is repeating stuff now
11:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1160505129125036082/image.png?ex=6534e79f&is=6522729f&hm=d3f9db82ebb96cac4c241d02bb4a4336ae82a39bd5ac184fc9ff1ade5c327667&
11:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> this model really likes to just repeat stuff if the context is lost
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> very relevant to cheese
11:13 < bridge> <learath2> Interesting behaviour
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> i remember chat gpt doing that
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> I can’t type for shit on my phone keyboard
11:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye i think chatGPT some time does that as well?
11:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> > Question: Do you know the chinese name for Teeworlds?
11:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> > Answer: The Chinese name for Teeworlds is 太空侵略者 (Tiānchóng Zìzhǔ zhě).
11:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's space invader
11:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's a video game alright
11:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also the pinyin is completely wrong
11:14 < bridge> <learath2> Is there a chinese name for teeworlds btw?
11:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> no
11:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we tried so hard to come up with one for years
11:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there is one for ddnet sort of
11:15 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> worlds of tee
11:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> just because it's more popular and people just started to call it whatever
11:15 < bridge> <Ewan> why have alternate names for stuff
11:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> tee isn't really a thing you can say in chinese and make it sound good tho
11:15 < bridge> <Ewan> we call chinese shit as it’s called there. at least we try to
11:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> people calls ddnet "the bean people" people in the sense of any character.
11:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i had dim sum for lunch
11:16 < bridge> <Ewan> it kinda sucked
11:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's the same spelling in pinyin phonetically to DDR
11:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> DouDouRen 豆豆人
11:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also fallguys was quite popular at the same time, which is 糖豆人, which is also the sweet bean people lmao
11:18 < bridge> <learath2> Chi is I guess the best you can do
11:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh no that sound so bad
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> chiworlds
11:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we have Ti
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> 1v1 me on oblock
11:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's sounds just like tee
11:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but it does not sound like a noun
11:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or a character
11:19 < bridge> <learath2> Oh, hm
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> okay i have to go to bed now
11:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> 踢 is kick. 提 is give. 体 is body or physical. 涕 is tear or snot. 替 is replacement. 题 is question. 屉 is drawer.
11:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> all of them sounds like tee
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> send me role details by mornin mg fred
11:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> none of them really works for anything
11:21 < bridge> <learath2> Dozens of options for wa and not one fits any of these to make a ti wa? 😄
11:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we are not japanese
11:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm pretty sure it'll be something world, where the something part is the hard part
11:23 < bridge> <learath2> You don't have dozens of options for wa?
11:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it has to be something sekai so you know what i'm talking about
11:25 < bridge> <learath2> Oh, I thought you'd want it to sound similar, since tee doesnt really have much of a meaning
11:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
11:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if it doesn't have any meaning then it could use the sound
11:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but none of the ti sound works. world has a translation tho so that part would be translated
11:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also i think wa has even less options
11:26 < bridge> <learath2> Well good luck, it's hard to name stuff, much much harder when translating stuff
11:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wa is just an onomatopoeia, tiles, digging and valorant and that's about it
11:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh and bady
11:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh and baby
11:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> frog
11:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> well i guess there are a few
11:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
11:27 < bridge> <learath2> Give frog?
11:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
11:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> very weird
11:28 < bridge> <learath2> Kick frog?
11:28 < bridge> <Ewan> just call it ball world
11:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh there's a translation for gores as well
11:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> just not for teeworlds i guess
11:28 < bridge> <Ewan> intestines
11:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> really hard for teeworlds
11:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> 勾累死 gouleisi it just sounds like gores and it mean "hook until you die of exhaustion"
11:29 < bridge> <learath2> I guess if you give up on having it sound close at all you can just call it ballworld and call it a day
11:29 < bridge> <Ewan> damn that’s a dense name
11:29 < bridge> <learath2> That actually fits perfectly wow
11:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ddr already took that name
11:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> which sucks more lol
11:30 < bridge> <Ewan> ball race network
11:30 < bridge> <Ewan> dummy drag race network but chinese
11:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> dummy is a hard word for chinese
11:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the meaning is really weird for chinese, cuz it's just not a common vocab
11:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> even in ddnet translation we swap dummies with clones/doppelganger even tho that is not technically what it is
11:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we have a translation for dummy but people only thinks of scarecrow or manikins
11:34 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, I'm unsure whether dummy is the correct word in english for what the dummy does even
11:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it was until dummy control was a thing i guess?
11:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there were server dummies before i think
13:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> @deen do u remember whats the oldest distro we support
13:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> debian?
13:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> 10?
13:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanna know the oldest rust version we need to support
13:48 < bridge> <deen> Rust stable is fine I think
13:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> stable debian is 1.61
13:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> @deen but i recall heinrich caring a lot
13:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk why
13:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> he wants pppl to compile with package manager rust
13:48 < bridge> <deen> Anyway, what do you want to do with rust?
13:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i want to update masterserver deps and try to fix https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6955
13:49 < bridge> <deen> Then do it without updating rust version?
13:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i also want to update it
13:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:49 < bridge> <deen> except if you run into a specific feature you require
13:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> but why not update the deps
13:50 < bridge> <deen> Because then we get complaints from people running old rust
13:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> then i tell them to update
13:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> :brownbear:
13:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> > On older distributions `rustc` version might be too old, to get an up-to-date Rust compiler you can use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) with stable channel instead or try the `rustc-mozilla` package.
13:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> we even mention thjis on readme
13:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok ima update
13:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill try with debian stable rust
14:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> seems like a update is the fix kek

19:52 < bridge> <hiigotmyaccoutonsteam> Hi everyone
