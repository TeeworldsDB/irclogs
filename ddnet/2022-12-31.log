00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could do a followup PR
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but yea, usually one waits for the comments to be resolved ^^
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and now im busy philosophing in #off-topic
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> now it's green üôÇ
03:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kurosio> I'm finally done with the binary tree in windows for own client, now they are easy to create, dynamic with the ability to create at runtime or once, interconnected with each other. It seems to be more optimized algorithms compared to the beginning windows. In this as they are simple, it is easy to create components such as Popup, MessageBox. But it needs more work.

03:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kurosio> Now i think how to connect the client-server, so that it is not something complicated. But it doesn't need to extend the protocol for each window.
03:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kurosio> Anyone involved in this area, any ideas on how to implement for ui server-client communication?
03:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kurosio> Or is there any old source code of anyone who has try made ui (server-client)?

05:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> That looks amazing! But, what symbols are you using for the minimize/maximize and close buttons?
05:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I would have never guessed the minimize button was that until I clicked it.
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kurosio> Thx^^, i use "\xe2\x81\x82" (‚ÅÇ) and "\xe2\x80\xbb" (‚Äª) for minimize/maximize, "\xe2\x9c\x95" (‚úï) for close. I tried to find something that made more sense, but I couldn't find any of the symbols.
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Are you using the font icon pack? It's the same symbols used for these icons here
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1058609445854249031/image.png
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I made a manual for how to use the pack too:
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> HOW TO ADD A NEW ICON TO DDNET:
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> So basically every icon is in a free pack, and you can find all the instances here: https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free&s=solid . Once you find the icon you like, you have to understand how DDNet reads these symbols. They rely on the UTF-8 encoding, meaning you have to covert it somehow. This website should be perfect for it: https://onlineunicodetools.com/convert-unicode-to-utf8 . You just select the symbol you want in font awesome, cl

06:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> And, to activate the font icon pack in the code, you have to set the font to `TEXT_FONT_ICON_FONT`. You can find plenty of examples of how this is implimented in the code. Remember to switch it back to `nullptr` after so it doesn't override anything!

10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That looks cool, what are you trying to do?
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think allowing servers to draw custom gui
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kurosio> Oh thank you so much! I'm going to try to pick some of these up now

11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kurosio> I want to implement a GUI system for the MRPG mode, being inspired by MMORPG. I am trying to recreate the UI of my favorite rpg game
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kurosio> So now i think how to bridge the client to the server
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kurosio> update icons

12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just transfer the entire tree of windows on each change? Seems like the easiest and as long as you don't have 100 should work fine
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kurosio> This is a layered ui which has two layers, the first of which is the active window, the second is the rest of the workspace
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kurosio> I think if there are a lot of windows, it will confused for user. And so far, it's also a tedious act of dragging each window at your convenience
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kurosio> The tricky part is that need a to bridge server with the tree
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> most favourite kind of prs, ily @Zwelf <3
