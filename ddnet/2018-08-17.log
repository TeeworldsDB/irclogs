00:43 <+laxa> great news, fixed it on DDRace :D
00:44 <+laxa> had to manually merge 3 commits + few dependencies
00:50 <+laxa> That might had been faster to switch all my DDRace servers to ddnet actually...
01:24 <+laxa> funny enough, my merge successfully protect password protected server whereas it does not work on ddnet apparently
01:28 <@heinrich5991> laxa: I think ddrace is ddnet now
01:28 <@heinrich5991> the mod, I mean
01:28 <+laxa> Yes, but I did not wanted to switch to ddnet for I dunno whatever reason
01:28 <+laxa> I have scripts and stuff running that might be breaked when switching
01:28 <+laxa> and since practically no one is using my servers, not a big problem to me
13:47 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #1259: Also use sha256 for the mapbugs stuff (master...pr_ddnet_mapbugs_sha256) https://git.io/fNjGb
