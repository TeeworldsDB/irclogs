19:59 <@EastByte> awesome gameplay today
19:59 <@EastByte> deen: looks like windows 10 will have a linux style package manager
20:00 <@EastByte> we should prepare a ddnet package at some point
20:00 <@deen> sure, go ahead
20:00 <@EastByte> I hope microsoft really allows free upgrade from 7 to 10
20:00  * fstd_ cringes
20:01 <@EastByte> sshhhh
20:01 <@deen> but yeah, obviously they're trying to get people to win10 for their windows shop
20:02 <@EastByte> well, still benefits for everyone
20:04 <@deen> I don't see the benefit when everyone uses Windows
20:04 <@deen> but that may just be me
20:04 < fstd_> is also me
20:05 <@EastByte> sure windows keeps being windows
20:06 <@EastByte> but it's nice to see users on one stable base
20:09 <@EastByte> and there will be less fucking around by stupid install assistants with toolbars and "system optimizer"
20:10 <@deen> i don't think microsoft will be able to get rid of that
20:10 <@deen> too much money moving in that direction
20:10 <@deen> same as all the google ads sending you to malware sites for downloads
20:11 < fstd_> huh, windows 10 is the one stable base everyone will eventually converge to using?
20:11 < fstd_> i think i read some news about what's cooking for windows 11 just yesterday
20:11 <@deen> fstd_: they may go into the direction of providing windows for free
20:11 <@deen> so everyone will always be expected to have the most recent version
20:12 < fstd_> i daresay that's wishful thinking at best :)
20:12 <@EastByte> deen: but now you can just tell them to not download things at all
20:12 <@EastByte> and use the package manager / windows store instead
20:12 <@deen> even the official installers are full with malware, are they not?
20:12 <@deen> java for example
20:12 <@EastByte> yea
20:13 <@EastByte> but you won't pack them in an open package manager
20:13 < fstd_> unless the windows store will be restricted-access like apple's app store is, the malware will just be added there
20:14 <@EastByte> atleast you have a chance to comment and vote it down if there is adware
20:15 <@deen> Yeah, ratings work really well: https://ninjadoge24.github.io/#002-how-i-cracked-nq-vaults-encryption ;)
20:16 <@EastByte> "Wow. Did I mention that NQ Vault has a premium version, which costs $7.99 a year? I bet it uses XOR2048enhancedmode for encryption."
20:16 <@EastByte> haha
20:17 < fstd_> wow
21:56 < Nimda> Aim 9.0 by Aoe & Hindu just released on Brutal at 2015-04-11 21:54
22:04 <@deen> the brazilian server is so weak. 30% CPU usage with 20 players
23:30 < eeeee> "encrypting" only the first 128 bytes kinda reminds me of http://hackedgadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/counterfeit-chinese-usb-hard-drive.jpg
