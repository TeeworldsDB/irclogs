00:01 <+bridge> <Ewan> I explained in pretty good detail near the message I replied to. I can give you a recap if needed but I don't really want to repeat myself
00:37 <+bridge> <Voxel> i wonder if people will actually use it here
02:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you can already mix and match dependencies today, I think
02:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I haven't found the motivation. do you mean this message? I can only see it enumerating different possibilities (which are already possible today, I think), but not why I'd want to choose them
02:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> Ok
02:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> If you aren't interested please say so
02:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> Sounds like generally you guys don't want it
02:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> without a use case I understand, no, I probably don't want it
02:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it sounds like it'll make things more complicated, so it should have a motivation beyond "it's possible"
02:17 <+bridge> <Ewan> well the way i see it, it's less complex than what you're doing now
02:17 <+bridge> <Ewan> it's just getting there that's the issue
02:17 <+bridge> <Ewan> if it works for you the way it is, that's fine
11:28 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Who is 0xfaulty?
11:44 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ^
13:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> a java dev apparently
13:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
13:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks a new friend
13:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Epic dev moment

18:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> totally not overkill server
18:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
19:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @deen u forgot to point codedoc.ddnet.org to the new ip too
19:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> well i forgot to tell you
19:21 <+bridge> <uwu> I wonder if someone coded in vr headset, you can easily see long methods, good for java devs
19:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34451051
19:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> quite big
19:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 1200 comments
19:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> big recession times?
19:26 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> hope it doesnt affect me xd
19:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh and wikipedia changed the look
19:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://wikimediafoundation.org/wikipedia-desktop/
19:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh
20:53 <+bridge> <SPYRES> tbh, wonder which departments go first. i always thought sales and marketing are first to go but could really be across all areas, some weighted more than others.
20:54 <+bridge> <SPYRES> doubt any executive getting a cut üòâ
20:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @SPYRES depends a lot
20:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> if they rly need money, engineers, but letting them go is a high loss of intelect
20:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> that can go to enemy business
20:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but well idk rly
20:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im not a businessman xd
20:57 <+bridge> <SPYRES> well google stadia should now be dead right, so in theory we can say the whole of the stadia team got the chop! üòÅ
20:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i wonder
20:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its not devs fault management sucks
20:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i wouldnt chop a good dev that might been in stadia
20:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> in fact stadia might have had some of the best engineers maybe
20:58 <+bridge> <SPYRES> they have clauses in contracts that prevent them from going to competitors within afew months of leaving but if they are being let go, wonder if that still applies.
20:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im talking out of my ass tho
20:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ye, but devs being paid google salary can take those months as vacations easily lmao
20:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and just wait for the rainfall of offers
20:59 <+bridge> <SPYRES> yeah i feel.
20:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> working at google is a lifetime set
20:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u are set for life
20:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> even uf u leave
20:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> if*
20:59 <+bridge> <SPYRES> luckily ddnet doesnt pay for developers so we will never have this issue of letting people go üòé
21:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and the most blegh ones use it as a "i worked at google and im saying this" youtube videos
21:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ugh i couldnt hate em more
21:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> there is also a netflix "engineer" streaming on twitch
21:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> he does nothing special lmao
21:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> smh
21:01 <+bridge> <SPYRES> also i bet high level manager, leadership, executives get pay increases when the rest below struggle. rather than letting people go, why doesnt the C-suite take a pay cut, might not make much of a difference in the grand scheme of things but still helps.
21:02 <+bridge> <SPYRES> see @Ryozuki this is why we need to be entrepreneurs!
21:02 <+bridge> <SPYRES> code us something tonight, will be on the market tomorrow üí∞
21:02 <+bridge> <SPYRES> no sleep for you
21:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @SPYRES i already got a decent job
21:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont overburn myself and get paid decently
21:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so life is decent
21:04 <+bridge> <SPYRES> ye me too, quite flexible job tbh. i get 35 days annual leave base.
21:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thats nice
21:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> here in spain its 24 iirc but i probs can get more
21:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> also i just can say im sick and they give me the day
21:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no questions asked, as long as u dont abuse
21:05 <+bridge> <SPYRES> and because i guess i work in public sector, which is OK, my employers contribute 24% to my pension.
21:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh ye public
21:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> idk about pension
21:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i have no hopes for that
21:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i prefer to save money myself
21:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
21:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the future looks grim in that regard
21:05 <+bridge> <SPYRES> yea, i hope to make it till 67
21:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think they want to make it 69 or 72 here
21:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> idk
21:06 <+bridge> <SPYRES> they want us to be working while we dead!
21:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> me 71y old "back in my old days of rust, when i was a youngun, i cried on a discord about a kirby game about using rust", finally i can retire
21:06 <+bridge> <SPYRES> its ok, you and me are going to be retired when we 35
21:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tbh in 50 years the world will be completely different
21:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am much more savage in that regard xD
21:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so yeah have no hopes, bcs nobody can see the future xD
21:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the politics of today are all fearing their own pensions and that come in 3-4 years, but absolutely not compareble to us üòÑ
21:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
22:13 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I am trying to modify the client to render a vector over each tile. Can you point me to where each tile is rendered?
22:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in tile.vert tile.frag
22:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with ogl 1.x there are rendertilemap functions in render.cpp
22:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with newer ogl u'd need to create more vertices(your vectors) in the buffer and let the GPU handle them
22:19 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ok ty (also should clarify that by vector I mean line)
22:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does it have any use case?
22:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like is it some physics vector
22:21 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I am trying to visualize direction per tile used for pathfinding the KoGAI will use
22:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can copy paste the rendertilemap function and simply write it only with vectors, and only call it after "normal" rendering. then it works with any backend
22:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the calls to this function happens in maplayers.cpp btw it iterates over all layers and calls the render function
22:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its pretty easy to understand tbh, just look into the code  a bit ^^
22:23 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ok I'll do my best
23:06 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> does RenderTilemap execute only on opengl 1.x?
23:12 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ^ I re-read this ok I think it was because I called it at the same place as RenderTilemap
23:26 <+bridge> <deen> You can just say I forgot to be told üòÑ
23:28 <+bridge> <deen> might be a problem for the people getting fired (with nice severance), but after google added 50k people in 2 years it's not a large cut
