00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's just not how it works
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Yep. Some cryptography is required
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hnryzz> yo someone can help me
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> > yo someone can help me
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> @hnryzz first you help us to make account server
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> *visible confusion
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hnryzz> oh shit
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hnryzz> how i can create a server
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hnryzz> im trying some days
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> whats your question?
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hnryzz> my friend can connect in my lan server
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hnryzz> i put sv_register 1 but apparently no working
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Did you forward you port?
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> > Alice joins fake server hosted by Eve, Alice starts authenticating, Eve asks the actual server for a serverToken passes it along to Alice, Alice authenticates to the authServer, Alice sends authResult to Eve's server, Eve just uses it to login on the actual server
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> @Learath2 Another idea. Alice authenticates to the authServer with serverToken + IP+Port of teeworlds server.
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Then alice sends authResult to Eve's sever.
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> But when Eve sends it to the real server it won't be accepted.
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Because the real server validates accessToken+IP+Port. (But Alice issued token for another fake IP+port)
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Feel free to ruin my great idea üòÑ
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AnyTrouble> hey guys, i started playin 0.7 ddnet
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AnyTrouble> is there any client with antiping?
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> no
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AnyTrouble> sadly
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 0.6>>
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AnyTrouble> Is anyone trying to make it or not?
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Not that we know
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @3da I'll think about it, I'm outside rn, but I feel there is a problem there with the reliability of ip and maybe with the manipulability of the authresult
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A random token isnt the best, maybe you could instead use an encrypted token, information in which we can trust
11:16 <@deen> @AnyTrouble it would probably be easiest to base on ZillyWoods
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> > A random token isnt the best, maybe you could instead use an encrypted token, information in which we can trust
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> @Learath2 to encrypt something sounds good. But currently I can't imagine how to use it in proper way. I don't have enough exp. in cryptography. So I am ready for your advices üôÇ
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The authentication server has a key
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It uses it to encrypt the data it sends to the client as a token
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No one but the authentication server that issued the token can decrypt it and read the data
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> This probably changes nothing in protocol. Because it doesn't matter what token is. If the auth server generates random token will it be better to encrypt it? Or the token shouldn't be random?
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> if the basic random is bad maybe better to use "cryptographic random"? üòÑ
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Probably you mean that token is encrypted structure containing username, timestamp, server ip and port?
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MoRdex> @3da hi can i take a little bit of your time about asking some questions about creating my server ?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MoRdex> who can answer my questions about creating server in ddnet ?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> > who can answer my questions about creating server in ddnet ?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> @MoRdex what's your problem?
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MoRdex> @3da hi sorry i have to take a little bit of your time for asking questions about create my server in ddnet

15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bumm> Wtf?
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @bumm thats my reaction
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @MoRdex you can ask here, but you might need to wait a while. Not everyone is familiar with how we set up servers
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MoRdex> thanks
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen#5910 is usually a good bet, but he is usually not around all the time
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MoRdex> ty
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MoRdex> @deen hi deen i need your help if you go online call me :d

17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> Hi, there is any way to disable weak hook ?
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> other than switching it with /spec?
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> @Soreu yes
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> like edit ddnet source or something like that
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> iirc there once was option to have strong hook for everyone
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and it cause way more problems than anyone could imagine
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> including not being able to even hammerfly
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> or it was just of speedfly? either way, it broke a lot of things
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> hammerfly isn't important in my mod so i don't need hammerfly i just need to everyone have the same power of hook in sametime
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/2b084645276baa37b7a31aafa3fab0e3a323201b
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> it was this one I think
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> (not like I understand the code, I just go thru commit names)
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ye, it was reversed day later, so I guess it was this one indeed
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Vexar ask @onby
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> for now i don't know what's wrong with my network i getting error 500 on github
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> @louis ok
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @MoRdex i don't do calls
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MoRdex> PRIVATE TALKING IN YOUR PV
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MoRdex> @deen sorry i need to take your time for create a server i seend you massage plz help me
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen he wants to host own server with database on some hoster for iranian players, but has no idea how to do it (and neither do I so can't help him)
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> @MoRdex tell me your problem maybe i able to help you
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MoRdex> @Vexar go in pv
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vexar> ok
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> good evening
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> why I can't configure ddnet with cmake?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/681916395599953937/unknown.png

18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> CMakeOutput.log contains only:
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> The system is: Windows - 10.0.18362 - AMD64
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> scroll a bit up in the bottom window
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does it say?
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> could not find any instance of Visual Studio.
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> but I have VS 2019 community
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> should I add some path to PATH env var ?
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you try opening ddnet directyl in MSVS?
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can enter a repository URL in there somewhere
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (in theory, it has native cmake support)
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> let me check if I have Visual C++ installed
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> xD
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wait, you said you have MSVS installed
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> I definitely installed C# but not C++
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> probably it can be the problem
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Ok I'll install C++ and try again
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @MoRdex Everything you need to host something like ddnet is public on the ddnet discord, we do not provide support with it, if someone here wants to help with it they will
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3da> Everything works. Very simple building process. Great üëç
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cool üôÇ
