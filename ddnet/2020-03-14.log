01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 the bug was really dumb ðŸ˜„
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what was it?
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at least I think I have it
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> besides even if it wasn't crashing i couldn't get it to deploy, was it crashing as soon as it starts?
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> init was in `OnConsoleInit` instead of `OnInit`
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> .s/deploy/load the .so
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wdym?
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well the binary was linked to the .so, but when i gave it a restart antibot loaded didn't show up in the logs
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that can't happenâ„¢
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> either it shouldn't start or the antibot must be there
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or you execute the wrong binary, I dunno
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk, it'd be very very very nice if you could check on that after patching the mapchange thing
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actuall if the mapchange bug was in there, the antibot should also have been loading, maybe you can grep the logs for antibot again
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the logs were constantly being overridden due to the restarts

11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 Is there no workaround for older cmakes?
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do we need one?
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I didn't try to find one that hard
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is 3.8 old enough to be decently common?
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> debian oldstable has 3.7
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, if even debian has caught up, I think it's fine
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we run debian stable, it's only needed in the antibot configuration and I tell the user what flag to pass in
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was kinda thinking debian had cmake 2.8 still
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> debian oldoldstable has 3.0
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh wait, you said oldstable has 3.7 that's not enough
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess only the antibot flag requiring 3.8 is a good compromise
