10:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> can anyone add anticheat on block servers ?
10:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> there are like tons of wb bots
10:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> like copy love box
10:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> that wont happen
10:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> ddnet admins say this everytime someone has similar complaint @bxlxr. that their block servers will not be moderated atall
10:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> srsly
10:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> lmao why xd
10:41 <@deen> we don't really care about block, just hosting it because we have capacity anyway and people asked for a server
10:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby>

10:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> lmao whaaa
10:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> last time this topic was brought up
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> this is what was said^
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> we hate botters lmao and admins say this
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> lmao
10:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> noone likes botters its just that keeping a server protected from cheaters requires work and its not something people would do if they dont care about the mod theyre workign on
10:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> if anyone wants to add some antibot features, we'd merge them though
10:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> oh really?
10:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> i think a simple version number kick would benefit those servers greatly
10:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> just make it possible to disable it, and don't expect too much since the new bot clients will have a configurable version number then
10:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> people have already made new bot clients with configurable version numbers
10:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> but that doesnt mean there arent still many players who still use the old ones
10:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> @deen if ddnet has this feature already couldnt the block servers just be updated to the latest repo?
10:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> can someone watch some players, and if they see a bot, the admin will kick him? (english 10000)
10:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> i dont think thats reliable because there are many bots that look humanlike and many humans that look botlike
10:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> yeah, like chillerdragon
10:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> ya exactly, chillerdragon used to set off my antibot system when it used to be shittier lol
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> lmao
11:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> chillerbot
11:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> hi lmao
11:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we are talking about my bot being undetected not my playstyle being botlike right? :troll:
11:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> lmao yeah
11:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> @ChillerDragon remember when u used to always false-positive my triggerbot system lol
11:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yy i was full rage
11:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> like i am right now .-.
11:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>

11:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why does it say md5_append is not defined ? -.- i included md5.h which defined md5_append

11:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> Ok danke
11:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> Wow i wanted to look at slawic girls omfg
12:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon u probs not linking the library
12:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whenever u see undefined reference to it usually means that
12:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon linking or not adding the cpp files to ur build
12:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea, its not th variable itself
12:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> probably not every file is added to cmakelists or something else is missing in there
12:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon this is after I have added the protocol extension, right? Because after that, bam worked but cmake only sometimes, thats why I think cmakelists is missing something
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Nah it was wrong function name. This error was missleading af
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> It should be fixed now @fokkonaut
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Oh, okay
13:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @onby block servers run the same ddnet server version as any official ddnet server
13:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> ooh so they should already have the version-kick thing enabled?
13:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know if DDNet has that feature ðŸ˜„
13:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> but if it does, then yes
13:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> it does, and it doesnt
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> i tested on ddnet ddrace with custom client that allows me to change custom version number
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/592315942273286145/Screen_Shot_2019-06-23_at_6.31.43_AM.png
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> and then i tested on ddnet block and didnt get kick
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> so :think_bot:
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> maybe we need some setting for that?
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> i think so yes
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ah, I see sv_banned_versions
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, let me set them for block
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> ty ðŸ˜„
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> should be set now
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> but I guess when they're connected already they don't get kicked
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> oo it works now cool
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> i tried again and got kick
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Seemed to work
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/592316939632771102/screenshot-20190623133552.png
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> HAHAHAH
13:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Gwendal> lmfao
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Great!
14:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Isnâ€™t team 0 after finish a config already?
14:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Hmm i didnt find one but Iâ€™m sure I saw players returning to t0 somewhere maybe on kog
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> if your team is unlocked, you are set to t0 after finishing
14:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Exactly
14:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> And this is important knowledge in some situations
15:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Like helping others when you are finished because they failed last part.
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why do we even still have teams? -.- can we please delete em
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ðŸ˜‚
17:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon a rank in team 0 doesn't have much meaning, you could have tees located at the right spots and finish a map much faster. Only by having team can you run the map properly without "cheating" by having tees all over
17:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmm fair point
17:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> imo a team rank is worth nothing because you didnt fight with blockers and trolls :p
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> Well imo teams are needed. Sometimes you Just dont have the time to hang around with lots of people for 3 hours. You Just wanna tryhard duo something real quick
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddnet hast 1829398123 servers you can always go to one of those
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that is currently empte
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> and how do u speedrun
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> need to hope no one joins and annoys you?
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> teams not being needed is the most non-sensical thing I've heard in the last decade in teeworlds
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet*
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hehe
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chiller likes to say lot of nonsensical stuff
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like porting to 0.7
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> -.-
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :think_bot:
18:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Gwendal> like "white them is good"
18:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Gwendal> like "white theme is good"
