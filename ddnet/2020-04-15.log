11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 i think you or @Ryozuki broke vanilla whisper. on master you cant use /w and /whisper anymore. it just sends the msg as a normal chat message leading to `No such command: w`
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well do you delete w as a command?
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> of course i dont
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it even shows up
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am guessing this is because of @Ryozuki's disable whisper thing
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> he never tests stuff
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tell me exactly how to reproduce it, including the versions
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> master, just try to /w
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> on what server
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no matter
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> try /w target
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or /w target msg
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it just gets sent as chat msg, on ddrace server leading to no such command, on ctf leading to just a chat msg
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "I am guessing this is because of @Ryozuki's disable whisper thing
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he never tests stuff" fuck you
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no u
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kid
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, did you test it?
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's my fault not his
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes i tested
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok, sorry then @Ryozuki
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk how to fix it tbh
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> whats the problem :D
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not without unfixing the other bug
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which commit caused it?
11:18 <@Learath2> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2532
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mh
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When you put w then press space, you are typing a command, but the selected command becomes -1
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but for custom commands like `/stats <name>` it works
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah, probably not
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm pretty sure that only works because it goes through the old interface
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> probably it just gets executed as a chat command
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> > idk how to fix it tbh
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Now I understand what you meant xd
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm I can change the other fix
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut that should take care of it, it'd be nice if you could give it a test
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Ryozuki you never test stuff, so that means maybe you would release my map:feelsamazingman:
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3916690
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> China to ban online gaming, chatting with foreigners outside Great Firewall
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not a big surprise considering that non-Chinese social networks etc are also banned
14:20 <+ChillerDragun> haha rip this minecrap server with all the press for china
14:20 <+ChillerDragun> i wondered how long this loophole will stay open
14:21 <+ChillerDragun> if one is bored and wants to write a method that converts decimal to base93 for me that would be awesome :D
14:21 <+ChillerDragun> i hate numbers
14:22 <+ChillerDragun> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/xA
14:22 <+ChillerDragun> this is what i have so far
14:24 <+ChillerDragun> ok that code was incomplete https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/P8
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> ubuntu > win
14:34 <+ChillerDragun> debian > ubuntu
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> discord > ChillerDragon
14:40 <+ChillerDragun> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/1Y
14:41 <+ChillerDragun> everything works until 92 and then at 93 it breaks im sure there is just a -1 or a +1 somewhere in the pack and/or unpacker
14:41 <+ChillerDragun> cmn brains i know u know it :D
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just like you would do with any base
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> first get rid of the sign
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then % 93 to extract the last digit
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then / 93 to get rid of the last digit
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> repeat
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> base93? who even uses base93 for anything?
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> some random blog post cited by wikipedia, apparently. also the only google result: https://kiwigis.blogspot.com/2013/09/base-93-integer-shortening-in-c.html
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon why do you implement base93?
16:05 <+ChillerDragun> yay i did it! it was some +1 and some index instead of 0
16:05 <+ChillerDragun> i hate numbers
16:05 <+ChillerDragun> @heinrich5991 i want to compress integers for my network protocol and i use only printable ascii range
16:05 <+ChillerDragun> my network packets are simple ascii strings
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you considered using base 10, base 16 or base 64?
16:06 <+ChillerDragun> yea
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> all of these are standard
16:06 <+ChillerDragun> yea but base93 > base64
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only on efficiency
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not really on human-readability, which you seem to be after with your ascii-only protocol?
16:07 <+ChillerDragun> my initial issue suggested me to implement 64 but then i did a test base64 encode and got a string that is longer than 1 character
16:07 <+ChillerDragun> so i decided to build my own and max out on 93 printable chars
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut /kill doesn't seem to be working on your server
16:07 <+ChillerDragun> yea i want it to be easier to debug also in wireshark
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why is it easy to debug with base93?
16:08 <+ChillerDragun> also my whole protocol uses strings so i would get utf-8 errors if i go out of printable range
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there are no standard tools to decode base 93 integers
16:08 <+ChillerDragun> well thats why i built mine
16:08 <+ChillerDragun> it was a mess but now it works
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't get it, at all
16:09 <+ChillerDragun> apparently it is % 94 and / 93
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not easy to debug in wireshark if you use base93
16:09 <+ChillerDragun> for base93
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, that's wrong
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> % 93, / 93
16:09 <+ChillerDragun> ok well then my implementation is wrong
16:09 <+ChillerDragun> or my base is actually 94
16:09 <+ChillerDragun> well my tests pass
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then your tests are wrong
16:09 <+ChillerDragun> u
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can proof to you that it's % 93, / 93 if you want…
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or you haven't created a test that's smart enough
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *prove
16:10 <+ChillerDragun> oh boi i trust you
16:11 <+ChillerDragun> here is my test but no need from my side to check it im happy just if ur interested https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/kS
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why 93 though? there are 95 printable characters in ascii
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because the blog author didn't want to have , and -
16:11 <+ChillerDragun> well i went from ! to ~
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for some reason
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to better compress his json
16:12 <+ChillerDragun> his code is so complicated 0.0
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I feel like one should remove base93 from that wikipedia article for only having a primary source
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How does base93 help readability though?
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not at all?
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's where I'm lost
16:12 <+ChillerDragun> u rude
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can copy-paste it?
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps
16:12 <+ChillerDragun> yes
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but you can also copy-paste the hexdump from wireshark
16:13 <+ChillerDragun> type the numbers on ascii keyboard
16:13 <+ChillerDragun> and avoid utf8 errors
16:13 <+ChillerDragun> i always send strings over the wire
16:13 <+ChillerDragun> i didnt bother building binary based packets
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you encode it in base93, you add 0x20 to get ascii characters, so you can copy and paste from wireshark?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 it is working, /kill only works after the kil protection time
16:14 <+ChillerDragun> yea my encoder adds the offset
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> base64 has the exact same property of being composed of only printable characters AND it's standard almost everywhere
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> unless you need the extra compression, I still don't get the idea, but rock on 😛
16:14 <+ChillerDragun> but is not single character
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but a single base93 character isn't something humans can decode either
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> unless you have the entire ascii table burned into your head
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not only that, because its not a power of 2, it doesn't align well to byte boundaries, 1 base93 character is worth a nice round 0.8173948513885039237824828178904213665386045911611077161653814220775461149566021520038150990198418033514123036424379615460758961865720213527676026544423095499000018826250024734330599159421946183809926966715883431691185407091977147891453605279538585366064366141087403437830009948244079937483166814937614532109342874
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or 6.53915881110803139025986254312337093230883672928886172932305137662036891965281721603052079215873442681129842913950... bits
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (so it doesn't even align with bit boundries)
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which is only 0.54~ bits better then base64 and that gets you a nice 9%~ increase in compression
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> standard base64 might not be the way to go, thinking about it
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> IIRC it can only encode whole bytes
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd definitely just go for good old base16
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon you said you still have a bug in base93. can you link the current code again?
16:50 <+ChillerDragun> @heinrich5991 thanks for asking but i solved it and im very happy all glitches are gone and tests are passing
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 👍
16:50 <+ChillerDragun> my packets are fixed size strings so i wanted to be one character long to represent NET_MAX_INT
16:51 <+ChillerDragun> yea but for sure its good to go with base64 or standards. Hex might be a good idea but i would have much lower max values
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza585> Is there a way for compiling this game for mac in windows?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, I don't think so
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we only support building from OS to the same OS and from linux to each other OS
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza585> So is it possible to compile it for mac from linux?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but it's a little bit annoying
17:19 <@deen> yes, using osxcross
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you know of a way to override the python interpreter? on macOS it keeps finding the system python which is py2
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in cmake?
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm actually I better make that script py2 compatible
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> FWIW, getting osxcross set up wasn't that difficuly
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> difficult*
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, ok
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I found it hard
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well for me it was just copying the sdk over and doing `build.sh` then `build_compiler_rt.sh`
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> whys there no ninja_lifetime tune
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because no one added it
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> imo ninja_lifetime, ninja_length, ninja_force would be very cool
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk how to code so rip
18:15 <+ChillerDragun> @HamidReza585 github actions can build teeworlds for you also for macOS
18:16 <+ChillerDragun> @louis just go and play around with the source im sure if u invest some time you can get to those goals
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza585> Any tutorial?
19:16 <+ChillerDragun> @HamidReza585 well github has probably some generic tutorials on github actions you can look into github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds in the .github directory how they did it
19:16 <+ChillerDragun> what source base are you trying to build? If its a recent fork of teeworlds and on github you might have a mac build already
19:16 <+ChillerDragun> Yo bois?
19:17 <+ChillerDragun> Does one know the abbreviation of public domain license?
19:17 <+ChillerDragun> Like MIT has MIT what has public domain? Is it UNLICENSED? 
19:23 <+ChillerDragun> omg i thought there is one pub domain which is same as unlicensed but this list says there are multiple :/ https://spdx.org/licenses/
19:24 <+ChillerDragun> oke looks like i found it => "Unlicense"
