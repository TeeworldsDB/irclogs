00:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea also thought that might be tricky. But rotating and moving should be fine.  The same way as tees with their guns are animated anything else could be animated
00:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Good job bot developer. Nice slider you have there
00:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Pog send code
00:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I need it
01:27 < bridge> <baby frog> anyone get the error "The breakpoint will not currently be hit. No symbols have been loaded for this document" in VS when putting a breakpoint on game-server? idk how to fix it ^^
01:42 < bridge> <baby frog> hm, i guess, after setting the breakpoint and launching, i had to go back to VS and set ddnet-server in "attach to process"
01:42 < bridge> <baby frog> hm, i guess, after setting the breakpoint and launching, i had to go back to VS and select ddnet-server in "attach to process"
01:42 < bridge> <baby frog> seems kind of weird that i have to do that :/
03:23 < bridge> <kekomonter> Try switch profile to debug and try again
03:24 < bridge> <kekomonter> Try to switch profile to debug and try again
03:25 < bridge> <baby frog> you mean here?
03:26 < bridge> <baby frog> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1201714921688289300/image.png?ex=65cad33c&is=65b85e3c&hm=4ec3844f3a01f621250dea0ca8daaef241b413e9f38b0e8d8d20369c293734d4&
04:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes debug includes symbols
04:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or RelWithDebInfo
04:20 < bridge> <baby frog> yeah i mean its always on debug when i debug
04:20 < bridge> <baby frog> usually it works fine, but i think the debugger is set for the client, so i need to switch it to the ddnet-server.exe
04:21 < bridge> <baby frog> not sure if thers any other workaround
04:21 < bridge> <baby frog> but it works fine
04:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the other workaround is using gdb c: it never bugged on me (except the many times it bugged or crashed axaxaxax)
04:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1201732873032585256/IMG_20240129_115124.jpg?ex=65cae3f4&is=65b86ef4&hm=364be5696289b7696a13eff7fabefff703817ec199ca8e55e257e32d2569fb09&
04:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watfak fred are u kidnapped?
04:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki u recommended ccache right? Have you used it? I ran this and changed branches forward and back and didnt notice and speed improvements
04:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache``
05:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay i configured a cache dir and i can see it writing files when i build. Yet I can not believe it is still this slow to rebuild a umodified version of the code that was fully cached before
08:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay cache is slowly building up that was so worth it
08:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> switching branches and so on without waiting 3 minutes for the first build is amazing
08:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I wonder if we can use ccache especially for clang tidy in the CI. And finally improve those fukin 30 minute CI runtimes.
08:20 < bridge> <scrumplex> We use ccache in GitHub Actions for Prism Launcher. It works great with GitHub's cache feature
08:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye thats what i thought
08:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when pr @scrumplex 
08:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> prism is also such a bloat of a project takes so long to compile
08:34 < bridge> <scrumplex> Qt 👀
08:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i wonder why you explicitly restore the cache here https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/blob/b0a473a5cecf8ad84c5669bf433f5d88e23f7202/.github/workflows/build.yml#L167-L174
08:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> while the official example does not use any restoring https://github.com/KeyviDev/keyvi/blob/master/.github/workflows/keyvi.yml
08:37 < bridge> <scrumplex> That's for Windows MinGW builds
08:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so?
08:37 < bridge> <scrumplex> They don't work with ccache-action
08:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but what do you retrieve then?
08:37 < bridge> <scrumplex> So if you build with MSVC you don't need that
08:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> -mingw-w64-ccache whats in here then
08:38 < bridge> <scrumplex> For MinGW we install ccache ourselves and retrieve the ccache store
08:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah so the github action package or however they are called does the retrevial for you
08:38 < bridge> <scrumplex> For every other platform we use this: https://github.com/hendrikmuhs/ccache-action
08:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but it doesnt do it for MinGW so you do it your self
08:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye
08:38 < bridge> <scrumplex> Yes basivally
08:39 < bridge> <scrumplex> Yes basically
08:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> didnt that guy also add windows support?
08:39 < bridge> <Ewan> https://tenor.com/view/dawg-skull-emoji-gif-24661581
08:39 < bridge> <scrumplex> Windows MSVC works. It's just MSYS2 (and probably other MinGW environments) that don't work with that
08:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1706600381.png
08:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see
08:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> F to the dude who tried to fix visual c++ in 161 commits and did not get it merged
08:40 < bridge> <scrumplex> There is also sccache from Mozilla. It can also do Rust caching iirc
08:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Maybe one they I can get a pipeline on ddnet++ again 
08:40 < bridge> <scrumplex> Maybe that could work too
08:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am 80% sure ddnet++ is too big to compile
08:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the build just always fails with "killed"
08:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rust caching we already seem to have something
08:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe its just crates idk
08:44 < bridge> <scrumplex> https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sccache-action
08:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay i got ccache ddnet prototype workin <:poggers2:1008007455936094328>

08:47 < bridge> <remakepower> Maybe we can add some things about this by NETSENDFLAG_EXTENDED
08:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> things about what
08:49 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> it's a reply to this `heinrich5991: plus we need backcompat for the vanilla/etc. servers we run`
08:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> backcompat for what
08:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and thanks
08:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok i find the msg my self xd
08:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah masterserver stuff
08:52 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> How to go about making a vote only votable by spectators? (just need a pointer from where to start :))
08:54 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> How to go about making a vote only votable by spectators? (just need a pointer from where to start :)) (is there already such functionality (specs being able to vote))
08:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> teeworlds 0.7 clients can not vote as spectators so don't bother adding votes for specs
08:56 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 😬 0.7 (could be a /vote command or smt)
08:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Mr.Gh0s7 no 0.7 discrimmination in this channel! Check rule #2

08:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes common 0.7 L
08:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> Chiller when are you officially overtaking Oy to Continue 0.7 development?
08:58 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :O f3
08:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @meloƞ its a work in progress
08:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Mr.Gh0s7 just use git invert cherry pick of this https://github.com/ZillyInsta/ddnet-insta/commit/01fe8613b92073e7894f7f3ef8680ab750a6d75a
08:59 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> btw this would be just for and fng server to solve 1o1 when there are many specs not for ddnet upstream.
08:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but jokes aside that pr is basically the pointers you were asking for
08:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> commit*
08:59 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :O
08:59 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ok ty
09:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> :poggers2:
09:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki dude ryo thanks for recommending ccache! I went from going for a shit during compile and returning to 90% to compiling faster with ``make -j1`` on my laptop than ``make -32`` on my i9-13900K (32) @ 5.500GHz desktop
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Flex
09:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``make -j32`` fakin emoji picker is overlapping my text. 
09:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes indeed very flex
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Wanna swap PCs?
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Would be a very funny trade wouldn't it
09:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> With unformatted ssd ofc

09:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Looks rich
09:10 < bridge> <meloƞ> Im hyped
09:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just run ``make -j32`` on a 4 core machine

10:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> Damn - i Pay Like 6 :pepeW:
10:59 < bridge> <remakepower> what? I used 0.7 to vote as spectators
11:00 < bridge> <remakepower> Sorry, It's dead spec mode
11:00 < bridge> <remakepower> My wrong
11:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Oh right the scuffed dead spec mode. Sure I remember playing 0.7 zCatch and it used the mode. I did forget about it. Should probably be mentioned in the issue I opened in teeworlds.
11:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> If the server can set you to dead spec mode the server has a option to allow some kind of spectator voting.
11:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also @remakepower who even are you? Do you use any other names than remakepower?
11:18 < bridge> <remakepower> I changed my name many times, and i never use my old name else dummy, so i'm Bamcane now, (before is RemakePower, ErrorDreemurr)
11:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah you one of those ok nvm then
11:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a name changer
11:18 < bridge> <remakepower> what's nvm?
11:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> never mind
11:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i cba to keep up with all the name changers o.O
11:19 < bridge> <cyberfighter> cba?
11:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd sori
11:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cant be assed
11:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i know that one from lerato
11:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> such a useful acronym
11:20 < bridge> <cyberfighter> you cba to type cba
11:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> indeed!
11:21 < bridge> <cyberfighter> also why do we need to support 0.7
11:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> to stay compatible with teeworlds
11:21 < bridge> <remakepower> My firefox crashed
11:22 < bridge> <remakepower> It's always crashed when i open 2 vscode + a lots of client for test
11:22 < bridge> <cyberfighter> i would slam dunk the shit out of the 0.7 support
11:22 < bridge> <remakepower> My KDE Plasma is also
11:23 < bridge> <cyberfighter> what client? teeworlds client?
11:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
11:23 < bridge> <remakepower> DDNet + 0.7 + Vanilla 0.6
11:23 < bridge> <cyberfighter> u use 4d like chiller? lol
11:23 < bridge> <cyberfighter> im going to be honest ive had my ddnet crash because i opened snipping tool
11:24 < bridge> <remakepower> DDNet is the most memory program of them
11:24 < bridge> <remakepower> SO WHY WE NEED TO WAIT FOR WE QUIT CLIENT????
11:24 < bridge> <cyberfighter> get a faster pc so it leaves fastee
11:24 < bridge> <cyberfighter> faster
11:25 < bridge> <remakepower> That even used more time than i quit other games like Terraria.
11:26 < bridge> <remakepower> I'm working my new mod, but i always get bugs
11:28 < bridge> <remakepower> Convert 0.7 protocol to 0.6 is toooooooooooooooo many bugs here for 0.7
11:29 < bridge> <remakepower> I didn't know why 0.7 client couldn't join the spec
11:31 < bridge> <remakepower> Oh Okay, i think i know it.
11:33 < bridge> <remakepower> I'm working to try copy ddnet register to 0.7
11:42 < bridge> <reitw> what about not doing that
11:42 < bridge> <reitw> tbh the bridge between versions is useless af, even since 0.7 is dead lmao
11:42 < bridge> <cyberfighter> yeah
11:43 < bridge> <remakepower> what is tbh?
11:43 < bridge> <cyberfighter> losing chillerdragon as a player because no 0.7 compat might be a positive :troll:
11:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> glue friendship, not hate, TeeGlue coming soon(TM)
11:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> to be humble = tbh
11:45 < bridge> <remakepower> Okay, thanks
11:47 < bridge> <reitw> To be honest
11:47 < bridge> <reitw> Ah ig both works
11:50 < bridge> <jxsl13> I was incorrect there, small brain fart
11:50 < bridge> <jxsl13> to be honest is more correct
11:53 < bridge> <gumbatw> its "to be honest"
11:54 < bridge> <remakepower> Thanks, though he replied me.

12:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> Fair enough :kek:
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if writing the file is half a second slower bcs of that it would still suck hard xD
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd say you should sue him if it changes in the next weeks
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but if u wait 3 years it's aged
12:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok thanks
12:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> See you in court lerato
12:19 < bridge> <robyt3> The effect is probably very small, zlib compression takes almost the entire time  finishing the datafile. And it's done in a background job
12:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @robyt3: do you have a jobs rework up ur sleeve?
12:20 < bridge> <robyt3> I sort of do, the PR is still open but I haven't gotten around to rebasing it yet
12:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yikes
12:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I’ll wait then
12:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> probably, i estimate the cost at around 38 milliseconds
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but probably a btree or smth would fit better than this xD
12:23 < bridge> <robyt3> For the majority of those 65k entries it does nothing because m_Num is zero for them
12:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> I smell a hash map incoming!
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's what i assumed 😄
12:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> who knows a ddnet map that uses shields?
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> before i forget it: i hate our map format.
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's so unintuitive, impressive.
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's just so weird how enveloppoints etc are stored
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> who can work with that 😂
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bro 99% of maps do use it or not? xD
12:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> baby aim 2.0

12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so you get a first class seat
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u bribe some?
13:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> i opened my mac my phone screen is a bit broken
13:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> i couldnt type lol
13:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no xd feels like that could go super akward and i also could image its a low success rate
13:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just saw some dude on yt do it and for him it worked
13:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye xd
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but he then failed to get a free pool 
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which is ez af idk how he managed to fk that up
13:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> free pool?
13:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> what dat
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> walk into hotel spa
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> without being a guest
13:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
13:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but imageine first class upgrade because you bribe with 10$ gift card xxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
13:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think he went with like way more than 10 but whatever
13:08 < bridge> <learath2> Lounge attendants will only let you bribe them if you look extremely handsome
13:08 < bridge> <learath2> You should always be nice to the checkin person and ask them whether a business class upgrade is available. At checkin it will always be cheaper and usually worth it especially for long flights
13:09 < bridge> <learath2> And if you are especially lucky and/or have decent loyalty with the airline sometimes the checkin people will even bump you up free
13:10 < bridge> <remakepower> I'm successful move it (the ddnet master)
13:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> woah did u pay for that shit already @learath2 ?
13:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> who is rich now xd
13:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i just flew 17 hours in the luggage container just fine. Upgrades only for ppl who need to burn money or company is paying.
13:12 < bridge> <learath2> 17 hours in economy sounds like <a:painpeko:974639276753055744>
13:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> But yea being nice and handsome and asking is a better strat than bribe
13:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 it was pure luxury
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watchin movies
13:13 < bridge> <learath2> I paid twice. Got bumped up free 4 times. Got bumped up at the gate 2 times. And once the checkin agent put me on an empty row in economy, so I could just sleep across 3 seats 😄
13:14 < bridge> <remakepower> Maybe i did a crazy mod(based on 0.7 but can use ddnet master)
13:14 < bridge> <learath2> @remakepower I don't think I understand what you mean
13:15 < bridge> <remakepower> I make a 0.7 server mod, but it registered to ddnet master
13:15 < bridge> <learath2> That is not possible yet, since the ddnet client can't connect to 0.7 servers
13:16 < bridge> <remakepower> 0.7 *mod*
13:16 < bridge> <learath2> Oh or do you mean you made it work? As in a 0.7 based mod that can handle 0.6 clients?
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 by asking?
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats pog i should try. But i might be too shy
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also i lack the handsome part xd
13:16 < bridge> <remakepower> I did a compatibility layer
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 ye the empty row is classic. I usually just go there without asking lol
13:17 < bridge> <learath2> Always ask if an upgrade is available. There is no harm in asking, if they give you a price either it's mostly full or they just didn't like you
13:17 < bridge> <remakepower> It could be able to let 0.6 join one week ago
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok will try thanks lerato
13:18 < bridge> <learath2> Oh, that's cool. We have a compatibility layer in the other direction
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u make up some bullshit excuse why u need it? @learath2 like "ou my back" "i need the sleep" whatever?
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or do u says like "do you have free stuff for me which others pay for?"
13:18 < bridge> <remakepower> I remember that fokkonaut did this in his F-DDrace
13:19 < bridge> <learath2> Nope. I usually say "By the way, would it be possible for me to upgrade?"
13:19 < bridge> <remakepower> (I means (by his way) Sevendwon)
13:19 < bridge> <remakepower> (I means (by his way) Sevendown)
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> are you using F-DDraces old code @remakepower o.O
13:20 < bridge> <remakepower> No
13:20 < bridge> <learath2> Free upgrades are not that common. I just struck out for a while. Then I got cursed and my last couple flights all delayed or cancelled. So my luck averaged out 😄
13:20 < bridge> <remakepower> I used ddnet code
13:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > That is not possible yet, since the ddnet client can't connect to 0.7 servers
13:21 < bridge> <remakepower> It's just a -Sixup
13:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://chillerdragon.github.io/ddnet7-client/
13:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> buy ddnet7 client by chiler today
13:21 < bridge> <remakepower> I means i use ddnet sixup
13:22 < bridge> <learath2> Now I'm confused. Sixup is in the other direction. 0.6 mod/server. 0.7 client
13:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye same my luggage got lost in my last 2 flights lmao @learath2 
13:22 < bridge> <remakepower> Oh, you successful do it based on ddnet
13:23 < bridge> <remakepower> I did a client mod named LunarTee to do it based on 0.7, but it still WIP now.
13:23 < bridge> <remakepower> Maybe i already give up it
13:24 < bridge> <remakepower> And my server mod is here: github.com/Bamcane/TeeGlue
13:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 24 commits
13:26 < bridge> <remakepower> 68bafe0cbaa5b99298dfd22b7eb2a1cdd4c7c455 and 88b25547a02ebc5bfa5122a4b8d898364967c33e is biggest commit of them. I think maybe
13:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye
13:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Would be nice if it was a proper fork of teeworlds with your work on top
13:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not a repo from scratch
13:28 < bridge> <remakepower> like github.com/teeworldsmods/teeworlds ?
13:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
13:37 < bridge> <remakepower> Why not we let client translate ddnet chat/broadcast message like 0.7?
13:37 < bridge> <remakepower> I think it's much better for Non-English noob player
13:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> How should it translate all possible text in advance ^^
13:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Generally the idea is ofc good but it would need quite some effort, or server side translations
13:41 < bridge> <Ewan> ah
13:42 < bridge> <remakepower> First we check client version, if could then send CNetMsg_SvDDNetMsg
13:42 < bridge> <Ewan> anyonw want to play ddrace
13:42 < bridge> <remakepower> And client can translate it
13:43 < bridge> <remakepower> Just like 0.7
13:43 < bridge> <remakepower> but we should add a uuid msg for it
13:43 < bridge> <remakepower> Oh
13:43 < bridge> <remakepower> Oh, But ddnet had too much messages
13:44 < bridge> <remakepower> Hm
13:58 < bridge> <remakepower> I'll start working on this
13:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> For predefined messages yes. But broadcasts are hard
13:59 < bridge> <remakepower> Not all broadcast.
14:00 < bridge> <remakepower> The broadcast like "xxx map released" is read from a file (In my memory)
14:00 < bridge> <remakepower> So we needn't translate them
14:00 < bridge> <remakepower> It's the server hoster's task
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah
14:06 < bridge> <remakepower> What's the next version?
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 18.1 probably
14:27 < bridge> <remakepower> I had a bad habit that i hardly ever to see the pull request and issues (Even by me)
14:28 < bridge> <remakepower> My computer is old, that made me build ddnet need almost half an hour..
14:28 < bridge> <remakepower> My computer is old, that made me build ddnet need about half an hour..
14:28 < bridge> <remakepower> I hate it, 😦
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Buy new
14:34 < bridge> <remakepower> No, i'm only a student.
14:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That's an argument for not against it
14:35 < bridge> <remakepower> Huh?
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> To study well, you need a good pc
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Has your university no computers?
14:39 < bridge> <remakepower> No, i'm not university student
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then your school
14:42 < bridge> <remakepower> Oh wait
14:43 < bridge> <remakepower> i found a problem about translate these msg
14:43 < bridge> <remakepower> how can we
14:43 < bridge> <remakepower> oh
14:43 < bridge> <remakepower> now problem
14:43 < bridge> <remakepower> how can we record demo by server
14:43 < bridge> <remakepower> no problem
14:59 < bridge> <Ewan> What kind of student are u
15:00 < bridge> <zhn> student of the gods
15:00 < bridge> <zhn> valhalla awaits me
15:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> @remakepower, your tsg server is sending `"afk":"false"` to the master server instead of `"afk":false`
16:09 < bridge> <baby frog> question, sometimes when looking at demo, i will see the tee move his feet when jumping, but only the next tick do i see the key press (the up arrow) in the demo, which is when he will jump. so, does it take 1 tick for the jump to actually happen when it is processed? or is there simply a delay with the key press arrows, or what?
16:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> chiller im not queueing
