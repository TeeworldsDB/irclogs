02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @heinrich5991 I'm not and didn't even see that game once, but still found it damn interesting 👍
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 🙂
06:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen nice, that was fast ^^
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen if you can make a release with that change before tourn would be awesome 🙂
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @heinrich5991 ah do you also watch speedruns of games you never even played?
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @Soreu you should look at this channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtUbO6rBht0daVIOGML3c8w

09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> CURL_LIBRARY_CRYPTO
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>     linked by target "DDNet" in directory /ddnet-master
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> CURL_LIBRARY_SSL
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>     linked by target "DDNet" in directory /ddnet-master
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess I have to install a more recent openssl version in my chroots. But the question is which one? 1.0.2 or 1.1.1? Also, if someone's system only has one, but not the other, DDNet client won't work for them, right?
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 yeah, so after upgrading to 12.9 I can't run it on Linux now:
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ./DDNet: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i guess many will run into this, but I don't see any way to fix this without bundling the lib
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> blergh
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how was this not found by me while testing :<
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the solution is not to look for openssl when bundling curl
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> interesting, won't we get linking errors then?
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *not look for openssl when bundling
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we have our own implementation of sha256 and md5
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and we don't have to link to libssl for libcurl on the target system, it knows what version of libssl to link to
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, can you provide a fix or is it not that simple?
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can provide fix, sec
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen ^
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> works!
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice 🙂
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I was a little worried
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my compilation process on the slow machine just finished 😄
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I didn't have to build from scratch
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, hadn't compiled in a while apparently
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but great, and thanks for asking 🙂
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 cool video
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @heinrich5991 all abusing a bug:kek:
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> There's no client so far for DDNet 0.7, right?
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> There's ZillyWoods
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> except for ChillerDragon's ZillyWoods
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and you can use vanilla
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I know o vanilla, but i'm planning on updating entities as some ppl know already, and I also have in plans creating new mapres/tileset, but the thing is that DDNet has 2 "engines" for displaying graphics (if I even count it correctly) and both of those display mapres ingame slightly different imo
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> so... will DDNet 0.7 also have like 2, so it will be 4 in total, or 0.7 will have one and only engine? xD
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what 2 engines does ddnet have?
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> something that is default and OpenGL 3.3
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i thought opengl 3.3 looks like default with a higher resolution
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and there's that preinit VBO that I was too lazy to search in google xd
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so you get a different rendering based on resolution anyway
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I still have in mind what was like 4 years ago where mapres looked totally different based on zoom & screen resolution so it was true hell to make triangle entities that looked correct like here:

23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> that's why I'm asking
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i'm not planning anything for ddnet7 currently considering the player numbers
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and since OpenGL 3.3 is marked as experimential, I guess it'd be "smarter" to work on default engine of current latest client?
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ok, thanks
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Does someone know why pgrep does not work with screens?
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/DS
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i do not want to fallback to ps aux | grep
