01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you think there is any issue with using a server flag for now just so it works? it's not worse then checking the gametype and we can phase it out for proper flags
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @nuborn do you have a moment?
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> yes
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> when you added extrainfo, you made a bit of velY signify that extrainfo is being used right?
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> yes, at that time I mostly thought about a way to separate extrainfo projectiles from regular projectiles. and on vanilla projectiles that sign would never be set since their velocity is normalized (to somthing like < 100 after writing to the object)
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> regular=vanilla
02:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 2 questions, 1) why did you need an IsDDNet check on the client side if you already had a bit signifying extrainfo
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> that was because I wasn't sure if it would brake any mods at the time, so I initially  added it that way just in case. hypothetically, a mod could use projectiles with a high modified speed, so that they would accidentally count as extrainfo
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In that case 2) why does it break a mod like bw to remove the check? are they sending projectiles that are too fast?
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> but thinking about it I should have used a higher bit. with the 9th bit that is around 500, or 5 times vanilla projectile speed (not taking into account tunings). with a higher bit it could potentially had been compatible with nearly all (future) mods
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> yes
02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> I didnt notice it while playing there, but it seems likely
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well the projectiles in question aren't even moving
02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> oh, that's odd
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> then abs(pProj->m_VelY) should be 0, so the check should return false, I think
02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @nuborn yeah they are accidentally sending m_Pos.x*100.0f instead
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> oh 😄 so that was the problem?
02:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep, makes some projectiles disappear
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> 80% of the #records are from Ravillion, you could not display ranks from that map
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that would be unfair
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @sorgaxD is the map just popular and unfaily or is it too easy for insane?
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Binary has more finishes and is also Insane btw
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> I don't know because i don't play Binary or Ravillion, but at least for me, its annoying to see ravillion ravillion ravillion ravillion ravillion. At this point no one cares about who finish that map unless it's a rank 1
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can only speak for yourself
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> i know 😦
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @sorgaxD My solution for stuff like this is to use feed: https://ddnet.tw/status/records/feed/ and have a newsboat rule:
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ignore-article "https://ddnet.tw/status/records/feed/" "title =~ \"Finish on [Insane] Ravillion\" or title =~ \"Team finish on [Insane] Ravillion\""
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and mute the #records channel in discord instead
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> well, thanks
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @sorgaxD My solution for stuff like this is to use feed: https://ddnet.tw/status/records/feed/ and have a newsboat rule:
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ignore-article "https://ddnet.tw/status/records/feed/" "title =~ \\"Finish on [Insane] Ravillion\\" or title =~ \\"Team finish on [Insane] Ravillion\\""
10:58 <@deen> Great, so if I use \ then either Discord displays the text wrong or IRC does...
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> wym?
11:00 <@deen> If I write a single \ on Discord it instead escapes the next character. So I need \\, but then it shows two backslashes on IRC
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ah yeah xd
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> irc displays raw messages from discord
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 @nuborn i dont know if its related, but sending vanilla shotgun projectiles as extrainfo makes them look weird, so for my mod i had to add a check whether its vanilla shotgun or not, and based on that only fill the info or the extra info
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 if you implement the timescore not as a playerflag you can remove it completely, thought we discussed that :(
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I want it only sent to specific players
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or is that still possible?
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> now that i look at it, should still work?
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut `CGameController::Snap` takes a SnappingPlayer argument
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can snap differently for different clients
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah nice
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But now dummy is broken :(
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> With the way it was you could display differently for dummy
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can snap differently for the dummy aswell
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How?
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The dummy and the main character have different clientids
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I tried this once the way that the old authinfo was implemented, but for score
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it didnt work
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But i will give it a try
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just after my breakfast
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how do i disallow it? not sending the flag?
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It works
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you send the new netobj thats the only thing thats considered
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you set the flag its time, if you dont its score
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tested with dummy aswell, it works fine

13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is this error msg lol
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its clear
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon attempting to read from memory you're not supposed to read from, for example accessing an array out of bounds
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Ryozuki chiller doesn’t know errors his code always works perfectly
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> actually "this" probably means the object was deleted while trying to run a member of it
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no i mean where is the error message from
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what code base and what compiler
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i am used to fixedwith error messages this looks weird. Thats why i ask. But thanks guys for explaining read access violation :troll:

15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ye i'm on windows
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is ur assembly as good as nur math?

18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen its bloated. I have to admit thats the only IDE i have some expierence with and others might be similar shit. But i rage every time i have to use it to debug something on windows. Opening a simple source file takes ages. It seems super buggy. Stuff works sometimes and sometimes it doesnt. Sometimes it fixes it self or you have to restart it. IT CRASHES WAAAYYY TOO OFTEN. Up <message clipped>
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> loool wtf
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> my client stopped rendering generic tiles
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> even after restart
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nvm i think i deleted the texture -.-
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> 900 iq
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikr
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh no i added a new texture to appdata called generic_unhoobale.png
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah thats dangerous
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> And @ChillerDragon i'm using vs community 2017 and it didn't crash at all since i'm using it, i dont feel any slowness in it also
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ur weird anyways
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Unhoobale?
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> UNHOOKABLE

19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @jao 🙁
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Is it because I put an s at recorder ? xd
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> so tell me I need to know
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well for starters you don't add spaces between words and punctuation
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in english at least
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> I did that?
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> on multiple occasions

19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> there are more
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Ye everything that ends with a "!" I suppose
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does it work with selfmapped maps @archimede67 ?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @archimede67 why is your style so inconsistent
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bro he uses js
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what do u expect
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i suggest fixing demo buggs before addign features
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @jao because sometimes I really try to not make any mistake and sometimes I just write like it was French
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @ChillerDragon what you mean with self mapped maps?
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if the map is in ur maps folder bu tnot in downloaded maps
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @archimede67 talking coding style
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @jao you mean sometimes I do
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ```cpp
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> if(something)
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> {
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67>     // code
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> }
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ```
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> and sometimes
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ```cpp
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> if (something) {
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67>     // code
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> }
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ```
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ?
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> always if(
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ik
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> its visual studio
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> disable auto formatter
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> isn't there a way to have my own sort of rules?
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @archimede67 demos have some bugs the most cruicial one being that if you have the map in your maps/ folder and ct it the demo is broken https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1702
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> wat
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> wait
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> so you're telling me if i grab a map from downloadedmaps and put it into maps/ folder its sort of broken?
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i assume
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> lemme try
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i just realized that all my demos that i cutted on my maps are unusable
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and i deleted my maps/ folder then it worked agian
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> wait
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> so i need a local server
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i only tested on remote ones
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> How
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> i just copy a map like bit2 in my maps/ folder?
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> map a map upload it on srv join
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> done
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and remove crc
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> and i need to cut the demo ?
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it fails on cut
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> do you have a video
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> for me it works
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bro
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> bru
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what did u do?
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> i have multiple "remote" maps in my maps/ folder
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> call?
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> like my map Skyventure is in maps/ folder but also in downloadedmaps/
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> but the name is different
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i assuem name and crc have to be same
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> like
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> in downloadedmaps the name is Skyventure_446c9c47
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but the error is wrong crc so maybe different crc
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i didnt investigate yet
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> where in maps the name is only Skyventure so technically i don't see how it fail
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://ufile.io/vvabt0x0
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> use this downloaded maps folder
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and join BlmapChill or ChillBlock5 server
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ok gimme a sec
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @ChillerDragon now i rec a demo?
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes and cut it
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> it works xd
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> you told me i should also have the map in maps/ but how should it be called
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://hookrace.net/blog/chinese-traffic-time.gif/
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> question is
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> https://hookrace.net/time.gif
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> its not a real gif is it?
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It's real
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> each frame is dynamically generated, it is of infinite size
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> yeah
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> so you can't technically download it xd
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you can
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its a gif
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> try then xd
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how do you download infinite size foko
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> i need to know that xd
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cyberFighter> nah just get a zip bomb
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> foko will have the answer
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can /dev/random
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you will be downloading for a long time
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the top left Corner of a map, is it 0, 0 or 1, 1
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 0, 0, probably
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but then the return value of some functions in collision.cpp dont make sense, they return 0,0 if failed
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe its 1, 1 xd
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nah, negative positions also exist
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But isnt it stupid to return 0,0 if its still inside of the map?
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> show the code snippet
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just look for 0,0 in collision.cpp
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't have the source open
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you evidently do
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No, i Look on github
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if not i would have sent the code
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just copy the name of the bloody function?
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not rocket science
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> github also supports links
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to specific lines
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> "rocket science" xd
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> vec2 CCollision::GetPos(int Index)

23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i have no clue how this is used, so im just wondering if it makes sense to return 0, 0 or if -1, -1 would be better
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because the tile 0, 0 could be mapped, if its the top left tile
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> -1, -1 is not mappable
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (using the editor)
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But if the top left tile is 1, 1 this is totally ok, thats why i asked xd
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> top left tile is 0,0
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this looks like a failsafe anyway
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and shouldn't be triggered by normal code
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so its ok to return 0,0?
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And if it does get triggered 0,0 doesnt break everything
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea, thats what i thought
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no xd
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Explain the logic please :)
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't like this school of code, I'd rather fail loudly
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the idea is that (0,0) is a safe position to return
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so if you pass garbage in, you get something sensible out
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with the idea that it make the server not crash if there's a bug
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh, okay
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I don't like that)
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why? xd
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Yea always when I fuck stuff up I end at 0,0 xd
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> But this is a place every map has
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because I think that it masks bugs and leads to worse behavior
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Minimum size is 1 I guess
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> minimum is 2 by 2
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> minimum size is 2x2
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ah
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wieso is kog code eigentlich closef src
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is voll dumm
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Lol
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Sounds logical
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> @fokkonaut extrainfo currently doesn support having a different speed per bullet (which vanilla shotgun uses), so you will have to use the ordinary fillinfo for those, like you did.
