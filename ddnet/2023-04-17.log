00:01 < bridge> <deen> @Robyt3 has this been fixed? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4537

11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Was this an issue at all? I read this like 5 times a day xd. We should defs check out if the latest 2.x version works
11:51 < bridge> <Learath2> I remember this being an actual issue we verified with a profiler
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> To me it doesn't even sound input related
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> More like some weird vsync stuff again xd
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Anyway. Maybe windows fixed it. Or SDL in the meantime
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We should at least try it out
12:21 < bridge> <deen> @Jupeyy_Keks https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/4683 doesn't apply anymore, do we still need it?
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yep with new SDL we have to remove it
12:24 < bridge> <deen> ok
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We also should do a minor patch in our input handling. Somewhere in input.cpp i made some comments about it
12:40 < ChillerDragon> !help

12:41 < ChillerDragon> sorry too lazy to lookup nmap command (will find a fix for the future)

12:41 < chillerbot> pong
13:27 < bridge> <Patiga> @Jupeyy_Keks apparently webgpu in chrome doesn't have support for linux yet
13:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> really
13:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> web browsers still do stuff like that?
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sad.
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sadly even for css stuff. Linux Firefox still hasn't backdrop filter default on. On windows since a few months it is iirc
13:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> backdrop filter?
13:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://caniuse.com/?search=webgpu says that it can be enabled in older chrome versions for linux, windows, macos
13:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so perhaps you can enable it on linux on the newest version as well?
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Css attribute
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Manually maybe
13:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ye, manually
13:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In Firefox Dev i couldn't run the wgpu thing. Worth a try in nightly chromium
13:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or it's indeed a wgpu stable issue
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe current gh repo works better ^^
14:00 < bridge> <Patiga> @Jupeyy_Keks @heinrich5991 I somehow forgot to link it https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API#browser_compatibility
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sad to know that MacOS will take another 100 years before implementing it
14:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or more iOS
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Which doesn't allow a custom browser to run
14:03 < bridge> <Patiga> yea :/
14:37 < bridge> <Robyt3> We can only use SDL 2.0.18 or 2.0.20 for IME though, because later version introduce another bug
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Lmao
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The only thing that is more broken than ddnet editor is sdl
14:43 < bridge> <deen> eh, maybe ping me when that new issue is fixed? üòÑ
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Do they fix it before 3.0 release?
15:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_gamma_coding
15:57 < ChillerDragon> ryo lets refactor tw pack int with elias coding just to break protocol for kicks
16:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that coding seems super inefficient
16:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its made to be space efficient
16:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for low values
16:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/12nw1pc/announcing_bitcode_format_for_serde/
16:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> found it hereww
16:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think I prefer something like twint, seems more space-efficient to me
16:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> only the numbers 1-15 are more space efficient in elias than in twint, and everything else is much worse
16:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (do note that i never said i wanted this for tw xD i just found it interesting)
16:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I see
16:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it seems to be invented for clarity, not for practical use
16:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> there is also the alternative of huffman
16:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> that had some license limit or smth
16:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> arithmetic coding?
16:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
16:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the patent expired by now I think
16:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nice
16:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> zstd uses something in between arithmetic coding and huffman IIRC
19:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Patiga not working either, either the twgpu implementation isn't correct for webgpu, or i am stupid (changed the ::GL to ::WebGPU), or its wgpu
19:18 < bridge> <Chairn> tips of the day: when you look for files deleted more than 3 months ago, you can still grep for string on /dev/sda
19:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and then?
19:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> text files u mean?
19:21 < bridge> <Chairn> yeah, only works for text file
19:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and only if u didnt overwrite the bytes xD
19:21 < bridge> <Chairn> you grep with `grep -b` for byte offset and then extract the file you want with dd üòÑ
19:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah
19:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> still useful
19:28 < bridge> <Chairn> i don't get it, it's way less efficient?
19:28 < bridge> <Chairn> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_code_(data_compression)
20:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neobuthus_factorio
20:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 @heinrich5991 lol
20:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > The species was named after Factorio, a video game created by the son of one of the researchers who described the species.[1][2]
20:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the world is so small xd

21:05 < bridge> <Chairn> Do spanish and italian people really use qwerty keyboard?
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> kataloneons like ryozuki do
21:07 < bridge> <Learath2> Uh, italian is qwerty with some extras
21:07 < bridge> <Chairn> kinda weird for latin language
21:07 < bridge> <Chairn> letter placement is probably suboptimal
21:11 < bridge> <Learath2> Qwerty is suboptimal even for english iirc. I think colemak is supposed to be the efficient one for english
21:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
21:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> qwerty with √± and √ß
21:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ¬∑
21:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> l¬∑l
21:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> azerty are the weirdos
21:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im to used to qwerty
21:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cant switch
22:03 < bridge> <Patiga> have you used the compiler options that the wiki tells you to use?
22:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> have u a webgpu version hosted?
22:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean u probs already tried, didnt ya
22:04 < bridge> <Patiga> no
22:04 < bridge> <Patiga> yes, only once and it didnt work
22:05 < bridge> <Patiga> otherwise maybe another version of wgpu might work, in particular there is a gecko branch which was supposed to work with the unstable firefox implementation (can be enabled as a unstable feature in firefox), didnt work the last time I tried
22:05 < bridge> <Patiga> did you do this?
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nah
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it compiles it must work xdd
22:07 < bridge> <Patiga> I don't see hoe twgpu could have anything to do with it. wgpu might be not compatible currently somehow, maybe the js calls changed or smth
22:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hoe?
22:09 < bridge> <Patiga> darn phone keyboard :p
22:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did now, didnt work
22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wgpu 0.15.1 sadly doesnt compile
22:18 < bridge> <Patiga> ah I think you can find recent (maybe 5 days ago) reddit post on game_dev talking about exactly that (I'm on phone and can't search). they said that  wgpu 0.14.0 should work iirc. there was a bit of version breakage, but I think you can just go back a few commits for a working 0.14
22:18 < bridge> <Patiga> huh? you mean with the options?
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just tried newest version in cargo.toml
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but probs the deps are out of sync then
22:20 < bridge> <Patiga> wdym? with the version going a few commits back should still be guaranteed to compile (at least for native)
22:21 < bridge> <Patiga> ah, the most recent version o.o
22:21 < bridge> <Patiga> is it a compile error in the crate thiserror talkong abt smth unstable?
22:21 < bridge> <Patiga> or some version mismatch?
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```

22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I am not sure tbh
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> actually i thought they can have their own web_sys deps
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and it should‚Ñ¢Ô∏è just compile
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah lol it also uses 0.13.1 now
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i c
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have to change in all cargo.toml
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> since they all have wgpu dep
22:23 < bridge> <Patiga> yea I updated to 0.14 and the right after 0.15 came out, so I went there

22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they still added some stuff, but not too much
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hop√ºefully
22:24 < bridge> <Patiga> I really dislike assisting debuggin from mobile, with limited internet
22:25 < bridge> <Patiga> wait you do 0.13->0.14? I thought that switch should also be in the git history
22:26 < bridge> <Patiga> or what version did you just change to break it
22:28 < bridge> <Patiga> there should be a commit 0.13->0.14 and 0.14->0.15 right after
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> from u?
22:29 < bridge> <Patiga> yes, for twgpu
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah i am in matrix-optimization branch lel
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how did i end up there
22:29 < bridge> <Patiga> yea that one is long forgotten ^^
22:30 < bridge> <Patiga> if those changes arent on the main branch, then they gotta be in `dev`
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly i still get no suitable adapter found
22:36 < bridge> <Patiga> also on 0.14.x? then unlucky. people on that reddit post had success iirc, so if you want to continue your tour that might be a suitable next stop
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh seems like neither master nor dev are up to date with wgpu
22:39 < bridge> <Patiga> neither is at 0.15.x?
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> both on 0.13.1
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tee-rendering is
22:39 < bridge> <Patiga> ow, the go on the tee-rendering branch
22:39 < bridge> <Patiga> ye
22:40 < bridge> <Patiga> and go back to those version bum commits I'd suggest ^^
22:40 < bridge> <Patiga> *bump
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Caused by:
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>   failed to read `/home/jupeyy/Dokumente/dev/libtw2/gamenet/ddnet/Cargo.toml`
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lol it reads from other dir rn
22:44 < bridge> <Patiga> yeye go back to those commits
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> which commits?
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bump?
22:44 < bridge> <Patiga> bump wgpu to ...
22:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dokumente
22:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah bro i installed KDE in german
22:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs i am gansta
22:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> af
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Patiga  how can i see which backend is used? or should i simply force WEBGPU again
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah terhe is a version string in console
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> still didnt work xD
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this lib is harder to use than c++
23:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://wgpu.rs/examples-gpu/?example=boids
23:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
23:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> those examples also dont work for me
23:37 < bridge> <Voxel> i THINK i did the final update for #6437. Can anyone review to see if it's any good or not?
23:37 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6437
