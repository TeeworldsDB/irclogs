04:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I will ping you every morning!
04:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> are you like just there now?
04:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea
04:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ~~did germany kick you out~~
04:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes I was too edgy
04:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
04:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> imma take a nap actually
04:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> woke up at 3am, it wasn't great
04:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Bruv
04:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I was still awake at that time
04:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Jet lag moment I guess
04:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :HammyShock:
04:11 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Agreed, we germans abandoned irc enjoyers (except scrumplex because He cool)
04:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Don’t you have to go to work or something?

04:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> no
04:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wowo
04:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> why would i go to work on sunday
04:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh
04:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I totally knew it was Sunday
04:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
04:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But then you are in china

04:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :HammyShock:
04:51 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> yeh, i facing my weaknesses like batman
04:51 < bridge> <Ewan> true
04:56 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's 7:30 in the morning here
05:08 < bridge> <Ewan> 9 pm
05:17 < bridge> <louis> left or right

05:24 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> bro, reading and writing to a file is so faking fast, i never tougth i could read, delete, and write again to a file every single tick
05:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> without a single mistake
05:34 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i wonder how fast it's gonna be if i use hard drive instead of ssd
05:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye writin smol files is fast af
05:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> faster than priting to the terminal iirc
05:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think i boosted fps in a terminal based game once by instead of printing writing to a file and then using ``cat`` to print the entire file :D 
05:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> buy chillerdragons bash game engine today
05:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1705207908.png
05:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this looks wrong. Jopsti should one highlite him self?
05:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i wonder if i could have replaced "him" with something genderless in that sentence
05:53 < bridge> <Ewan> -21 out tonight
05:53 < bridge> <Ewan> :feelsbadman:
05:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i envy u
05:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cold is pog
05:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for me it doesnt get much colder than 28 durin da nite i think
05:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan fahrenheit?
05:55 < bridge> <Ewan> c
05:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> o.O
05:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i got yelled at for using freedom units last time
05:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
05:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> freedom units
05:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watfak
05:55 < bridge> <Ewan> murica
05:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think i never got to xp -21
05:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sounds fun 
05:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i didnt know its that cold in murica
05:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> time to move
05:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ewan u eng pro
05:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> send woke generless sentence
05:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > Jopsi should one highlite him self?
05:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how can i replace "him" with something genderless like "one" @Ewan ?
05:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or how to make the sentence cool in general
05:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> apparently "oneself" is a thing xd
05:59 < bridge> <Ewan> what context
05:59 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
05:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the context i used it in
05:59 < bridge> <Ewan> themselves
06:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oke thank
06:00 < bridge> <Ewan> should one highlight themselves
06:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i put tripple A english on my CV now
06:00 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
07:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Okay thats kinda cool you can close issues in other repos with commit messages
07:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1705212891.png
07:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can codeberg do that too? -.-
07:47 < bridge> <Ewan> it's huge country
07:47 < bridge> <Ewan> it just depends on where you are
07:49 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ah man
07:51 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i run a server on linux, people can register and make an account, the physical file of that account is made but it can not be readed from the server once the player tries to "/login username password"
07:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and it's working on windows with the same code
07:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i run the server as root, but still having the same problem
07:53 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and once i restart the server, you can /login
07:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i gave the DDnet-Server  chmod +rwx but still the same
07:55 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> also i can give you my last commit link if you want
08:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and once i restart the server, you can /login with previously register accounts
08:01 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and once i restarting the server, you can /login with previously register accounts
08:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> never mind, the code is having problem, in windows too
08:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 😂
08:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> the problem was stupid as, not closing the file: io_close() :troll:
08:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Classic
08:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No
09:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ye dats wat i thought ima open an issue and will probably not fix before end of 2028
09:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did you know the word procrastination includes pro?
09:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> with improved knowledge from work im retaking edlang
09:40 < ChillerDragon> i cant tell if ddnet singapore servers lagg or my wifi idk how to test
09:50 < bridge> <meeu> when
09:50 < bridge> <meeu> what's your ping to Singapore?
09:50 < ChillerDragon> 37
09:51 < ChillerDragon> it feels smoother than at home haha
09:51 < ChillerDragon> but i have lag spikes that make it super faily to play
09:51 < bridge> <meeu> XD good
09:51 < ChillerDragon> idk if its my connection or the server
09:51 < bridge> <meeu> CHN8 has good ping too from here
09:52 < ChillerDragon> i have 78 in chn8
09:52 < bridge> <meeu> oh I have 60ish
09:52 < ChillerDragon> jumps to 90 ye its rly bad xd
09:53 < bridge> <meeu> probably your wifi then
09:53 < ChillerDragon> meh
09:54 < ChillerDragon> sucks to be me
09:55 < ChillerDragon> shiet mobile data is even way worse
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> hi meeu
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> 😃
10:48 < bridge> <Ewan> how is singapore fellas
11:00 < bridge> <meeu> hi Ewan o/
11:00 < bridge> <meeu> the singapore server is empty most of the time XD
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
11:00 < bridge> <meeu> i saw chiller but he was afk earlier
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> ah
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> i wonder why he is there
11:02 < bridge> <Ewan> how are u
11:02 < bridge> <meeu> sad cuz bad ping to USA :c
11:02 < bridge> <meeu> it's not so bad to USA2 ig, 200 ping
11:03 < bridge> <Ewan> ah messed up
11:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What’s your in game name?
11:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Best ping ddnet server
11:40 < bridge> <Ewan> Meeu
11:40 < bridge> <Ewan> Lol
12:48 < bridge> <learath2> I seriously do not understand MSVC
12:49 < bridge> <learath2> Accessing an unscoped enumeration that's a member of a class through a fully qualified name is legal since C++11
12:51 < bridge> <learath2> It should even be part of the outside scope, so should let me refer to it using just the class too...
13:00 < bridge> <learath2> oh it's not the scoping that's the issue, it's that stray constant...
13:01 < bridge> <Ewan> Damn
13:05 < bridge> <learath2> Let's just drop support for MSVC, no self respecting developer uses it anyway
13:10 < bridge> <learath2> Ok, I can't do this without a windows machine, can one of you find out where this constant is coming from?
13:10 < bridge> <Ewan> Ach
13:11 < bridge> <learath2> https://godbolt.org/z/K1nbbno9K this is what's happening, so you are looking for a `#define ERROR` that only happens on windows 😄
13:11 < bridge> <Ewan> what’s the constant
13:11 < bridge> <learath2> Or maybe I should just rename my error state to something like FAILED
13:12 < bridge> <learath2> It might be easier
13:13 < bridge> <learath2> I have no idea where it's coming from https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7683 but somehow after all the includes in `http.cpp` there is `ERROR` `#define`d
13:13 < bridge> <learath2> Or maybe I can just do #ifdef ERROR #undef ERROR after the include 🤔
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> before that let's drop support for macos xd
13:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No macos > msvc
13:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> At least it’s unix
13:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> xcode is the poggest of them all
15:11 < bridge> <gerdoe> @heinrich5991 what's the main reason of using `warn` instead of using `Result<_, _>`?
15:12 < bridge> <patiga> @gerdoe warn is for inconsistencies / oddities which should not cause the operation to fail, but can be logged
15:13 < bridge> <gerdoe> yeaah but warn goes trhu aall the codebase of libtw2
15:14 < bridge> <gerdoe> looks monstrous just for logging
15:16 < bridge> <gerdoe> btw, inconsistencies and oddities are the ones that should not occur?
15:18 < bridge> <patiga> yes
15:19 < bridge> <patiga> for example, in gamenet, snap object decoding warns whenever there is excess data
15:20 < bridge> <patiga> excess data is not an huge issue, since we expect backwards compatibility by future extensions
15:20 < bridge> <patiga> but this does indicate that something should be updated
15:20 < bridge> <patiga> or fixed elsewhere
15:21 < bridge> <gerdoe> but what about using result + error handling?
15:21 < bridge> <gerdoe> i just don't get the point
15:22 < bridge> <patiga> because then the entire operation would unnecessarily fail
15:22 < bridge> <gerdoe> no why
15:22 < bridge> <gerdoe> ah
15:22 < bridge> <gerdoe> okey i get it xd
15:22 < bridge> <patiga> nice :)
15:23 < bridge> <patiga> its kinda weird to work with at first
15:23 < bridge> <patiga> and its an additional parameter everywhere, which can be a bit annoying at times ^^
15:24 < bridge> <gerdoe> yeah like every function signature every function call has this warn field
15:24 < bridge> <gerdoe> also callbacks
15:24 < bridge> <patiga> yea
15:24 < bridge> <patiga> its kinda like logging, but with a very different interface
15:25 < bridge> <gerdoe> c-way in rust
15:26 < bridge> <patiga> hm, logging is also quite common in rust
15:26 < bridge> <gerdoe> have never seen such approach tho
15:27 < bridge> <gerdoe> having `log!` is cleaner imho
15:28 < bridge> <gerdoe> repo is quite old maybe that's the reason
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do the it must exist extremist path
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> every unwrap is a potential logic bug
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do the "it must exist" extremist path
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> every unwrap is a potential logic bug
16:10 < bridge> <gerdoe> no unwraps only match 8)
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> every error u must handle will introduce more potential to do it wrong
16:18 < bridge> <chairn> the code also fails to compile with clang and gcc
16:18 < bridge> <chairn> the macro is replaced in both case
16:19 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, I hadn’t noticed the define was the issue
16:19 < bridge> <learath2> The define only happens in windows, thus I thought it was a msvc issue
16:19 < bridge> <chairn> who the hell defines an ERROR macro ?
16:19 < bridge> <chairn> maybe you can try the MSVC equivalent -E flag to see where it comes from
16:44 < bridge> <aegisub> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1196117616444588112/message.txt?ex=65b67656&is=65a40156&hm=f2a64f8081177816d096ac4c3e5cf627bf486a10a25c847442ca0ce2ac95b2a7&
16:44 < bridge> <aegisub> so yeah it's curl.h that includes windows.h
16:45 < bridge> <aegisub> you don't wanna know how many hours of my life were wasted debugging some cursed windows-only issue that turned out to just be due to windows.h defining some weird macro
16:51 < bridge> <gerdoe> so better to panic you mean lol
16:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hard to say, but sometimes i like it more than creating long unhandled err chains, or handle errors everywhere
16:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in code where you dont expect errors, your error handling will probably suck
16:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
16:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> tell me a feature u would like in edlang
16:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hiarc
16:55 < bridge> <gerdoe> terminating pc
16:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need a nice logo
16:55 < bridge> <gerdoe> avx2 support
16:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can do that on any systems lang
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> arch intrinsics
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> does this feature fit on a language feature?
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> not a library i mean
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> imo yes, i abuse it across half of my code base already
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need to find some new papers on borrow checkers
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's basically the alternative to borrow checking
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and u need RAII
16:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> hmm
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs i am also huge RAII abuser
16:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> how would u call edlang's cargo?
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> walkstop
16:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> car go
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> walk stop xd
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epic
16:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
16:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> ed is like a ancient editor right
17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> really?
17:32 < bridge> <gerdoe> gats
18:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea edge case error paths are often bugged them selfs. Because they were never tested.
19:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is this two conditions are equal ?
19:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
19:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if(pPlayer->GetCharacter() == 0)
19:49 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> 
19:49 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if(pPlayer->GetCharacter())
19:49 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
19:49 < bridge> <devinci24> if my cpp knowledge doesn't fail me they are the opposite ^^
19:51 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i think they are the same if you use it in an if,
19:51 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it, in an if 😂
19:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> bro
19:52 < bridge> <devinci24> if(pPlayer->GetCharacter() == 1) should be the same as if(pPlayer->GetCharacter()).
19:52 < bridge> <devinci24> Can't you just test it anyways?
19:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i testing the people here :lol:
19:52 < bridge> <devinci24> 0 gets evaluated to false while any other int is true
19:55 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is there a function to get the ClientID by the players name ?
20:05 < bridge> <furo321> There isn't a function for it, you will have to loop over all players and check if the name matches. But I guess it would be pretty easy to extract something like this to a function.
20:05 < bridge> <furo321> 
20:05 < bridge> <furo321> ```cpp
20:05 < bridge> <furo321> char aPlayerName[MAX_NAME_LENGTH] = "nameless tee";
20:05 < bridge> <furo321> int ClientID = -1;
20:05 < bridge> <furo321> for(int i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++)
20:05 < bridge> <furo321> {
20:05 < bridge> <furo321>     if(str_comp(aPlayerName, Server()->ClientName(i)) == 0)
20:05 < bridge> <furo321>     {
20:05 < bridge> <furo321>         ClientID = i;
20:05 < bridge> <furo321>         break;
20:05 < bridge> <furo321>     }
20:05 < bridge> <furo321> }
20:05 < bridge> <furo321> ```
20:05 < bridge> <furo321> 
20:05 < bridge> <furo321> ClientID will be -1 if a player named `nameless tee` wasn't found.
22:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Lol, that's hella wrong.
22:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> `if (pPlayer->GetCharacter() != 0)`
22:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> is the same as
22:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> `if (pPlayer->GetCharacter()`
22:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> but definitely not the opposite using `1` is true xD
22:18 < bridge> <devinci24> yeah... that's what I said? 😄
22:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ok, I won't argue with you. You're a troll
22:18 < bridge> <devinci24> Are you sure you are not hating on me
22:18 < bridge> <devinci24> no but fr
22:18 < bridge> <devinci24> that's exactly what I said
22:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ok
22:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> You sure you aren't victimizing yourself?
22:18 < bridge> <devinci24> Can someone not biased tell me if I'm actually dumbing hard or just fokko trolling me?
22:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Like last time
22:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Maybe just learn to read
22:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And not victimizing yourself
22:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> that's very toxic
22:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I told you last time even directly that I was not hating. But you're dumbing hard *again*
22:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And u victimized urself last time too by not accepting my statement :)
22:21 < bridge> <nouaa> that's right though
22:21 < bridge> <devinci24> thanks
22:21 < bridge> <nouaa> fokkonaut being fokkonaut
22:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @nouaa no wonder you want to steal code. Too dumb to code on your own
22:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I'll explain.
22:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> GetCharacter() does not return `1` if it exists. It's a pointer, and it points to a memory location. So when you take it as an integer, it'll not be 1. That would imply all characters point to the same memory
22:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> that's why you check `!= 0`
22:24 < bridge> <nouaa> atleast it should return a truthy value if it does exist
22:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> aka `!= 0`
22:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And not `== 1`
22:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> As both of you seemed to agree on
22:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Oh boi...
22:25 < bridge> <nouaa> I assumed it wasn't necessarily a pointer, but yeah u're right
22:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @devinci24 So I think you're the one that is biased. Work on yourself
22:26 < bridge> <fokkonaut> DDNet hiring anyone these days
22:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> it wont work because the pointer is probs implicitly casted to a int, and a pointer is like a numeric address
22:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> and a lower address like 0x1 is probs not what u will get
22:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> if(pPlayer->GetCharacter())
22:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> this works because
22:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> the address is not 0
22:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> so its a truthy value
22:27 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 🤝😂
22:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> all values > 0 are truthy
22:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> if(pPlayer->GetCharacter() > 0)
22:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And < 0, but that doesn't matter in this context
22:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> true i forgot about negatives xd
22:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
22:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway its wrong to compare a pointer to a number
22:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> for lot of complex reasons
22:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> do if(pPlayer->GetCharacter()) or if(pPlayer->GetCharacter() != nullptr)
22:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> That aswell
22:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Does nullptr actually work when the DDNet code sets it to 0 or NULL?
22:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
22:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Nice
22:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw
22:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> 0 is the nullptr address on the default address space
22:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> hello world :poggers2:

22:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> there can be address spaces where a adress at 0 is valid
22:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ahhh
22:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> but thats another talk
22:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I see
22:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ty
22:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> > An address space is a fundamental part of the type of a pointer value and the type of operations that manipulate memory. LLVM affords a default address space (numbered zero) and places a number of assumptions on pointer values within that address space: The pointer must have a fixed integral value.

22:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> > A pointer is an address that provides a translation within some virtual address space to a piece of physical memory.
22:31 < bridge> <devinci24> that's the reason I proposed == 1. I could have also said == 123123. Doesn't 1 get evaluated to true aswell?
22:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur missing the point
22:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u compare a pointer type to a int
22:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> it wont be casted to a bool
22:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Oh man.
22:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> there will never be a true or false
22:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> it will be
22:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> does pointer has address 0x1 through this cast to int
22:32 < bridge> <devinci24> oh really? That's what I was missing then. thanks for your answer ryo
22:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @devinci24 #staytoxic
22:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> That from a moderator

22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> the compiler will also tell u ur doing bad stuff
22:34 < bridge> <devinci24> yeah I didn't know that method? was returning a pointer.
22:34 < bridge> <devinci24> I just assumed, mb there 😛
22:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xxxxD
22:35 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 0 self awareness
22:35 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> fokkonsomething
22:36 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ?
22:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yeah, I'm on my daily dose of talking to idiots
22:36 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ah that makes sense
22:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> u didnt talk to me yet 😏
22:37 < bridge> <nouaa> shit, I'm included

23:08 < bridge> <gerdoe> another self-made teedrama™?
23:26 < bridge> <gerdoe> @ChilleDragon where can i check your votes.cfg for zilly-insta?
23:58 < bridge> <super3559> is it still on?
23:58 < bridge> <teero777> nop
23:58 < bridge> <super3559> rip
23:58 < bridge> <super3559> got any way for me to doo it myself
23:58 < bridge> <teero777> didnt finish it
23:59 < bridge> <super3559> since ive been trying to get it to work
23:59 < bridge> <super3559> but i have no idea what to change
