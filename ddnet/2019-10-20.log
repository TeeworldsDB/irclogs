12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 good idea mutes is a mess
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TcTc comes from https://info.ddnet.tw/info so you'll have to replace info.ddnet.tw in the source code with your own server
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> isnt that what i just said? xd
15:39 <+Ryozuki> Learath2 @Learath2
15:39 <+Ryozuki> yes
15:43 <+Ryozuki> Learath2 i agree some team code stuff looks rly weird, i don't get why https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/teamscore.h exists
15:44 <+Ryozuki> solo and stuff is handled in many places its rly bad
15:44 <+Ryozuki> if you want to check someone is in solo check it directly, not through this stupid class
15:45 <+Ryozuki> also cankeephook and cancollide should be in the player or character
15:45 <+Ryozuki> and it should also store the team info
15:45 <+Ryozuki> no need for this
16:13 <+Ryozuki> i think we also shouldnt care about ddrace16 at this point
16:13 <+Ryozuki> ill try smth
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ryozuki: The idea with teamscore is that it's shared with the client iirc
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> to make sure the client also uses the same rules i guess
16:26 <+Ryozuki> im changing it
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ryozuki: Get rid of TEAM_SUPER aswell while at it
17:11 <+Ryozuki> im doing so
17:11 <+Ryozuki> and also team flock
17:11 <+Ryozuki> i deleted the whole file
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but team_flock is actually used, isn't it? "team 0"
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> We could see 0.7 as an opportunity to rewrite the server in bash ðŸ™‚
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill need some more time for that rewrite
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and weekend is over xd
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki can you atleast tell me along what line are you going to clean it up, so I can also get it in the 0.7 branch?
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I could work on mutes while you finish that one up
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wanted to remove teamscore and save the team in cplayer and charactercore
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cplayer cuz u can be in a team while ded
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u dont have a character while ded
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> charactercore so we can mirror it to the client?
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not interested in 0.7 :p
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even in 0.6 you'll need to find a way to replace the now missing teamscore
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's used for prediction
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ik
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i need more time
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but we dont need team super anymore
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> super is a character status
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, i wonder who thought it was a good idea to have it as a team
