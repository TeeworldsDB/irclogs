01:20 < laxa> Anyone ever tried to make a solution file for visual studio for teeworlds ?
01:21 <@deen> can't bam use VS?
01:21 <@deen> generally it's best to only have a single building system
01:28 < o_be_two> deen, you cant guess that ..
01:29 < o_be_two> i work for OVH as linux admin & devops for RunAbove (OpenStack) since today x) ...
01:32 <@deen> o_be_two: nice!
01:32 <@deen> contratulations
01:32 < o_be_two> ty :)
01:33 < laxa> So... What about the backdoor you promised me at OVH o_be_two ?
01:34 < laxa> fsociety will raise surely soon enough !
01:34 < o_be_two> ahah :D
03:06 <@deen> EastByte: heh, just saw this about the Let's Encrypt thingy, looks like they're pushing the date back and back: http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yMjeopClJAI/VchYt0v46JI/AAAAAAAAIPQ/FtFb6rAP-8Y/Untitled-22.png?imgmax=800
03:21 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] H-M-H opened pull request #278: added Notifications for osx (master...Mac) http://git.io/v3nna
03:41 <@deen> whenever i get a new server, it gets ddosed immediately..
04:06 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #278: added Notifications for osx (master...Mac) http://git.io/v3nna
08:18 <@heinrich5991> deen: interesting (the let's-encrypt thing)
12:08 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: looks like Oy is against spoofing protection for 0.6.4
12:09 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: it looks like there is *some* spoofing protection
12:09 <@heinrich5991> but it could be better
12:09 <@EastByte> did I miss something?
12:09 <@heinrich5991> it checks for correct ack numbers and randomizes the client port
12:11 <@EastByte> I can't find the commit
12:12 <@EastByte> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/f457b58d68e72df83128a7bc779d71a5208dfe47
12:13 <@EastByte> ah
12:17 <@EastByte> indeed it's *some* spoofing protection
12:17 <@EastByte> not pretty solid ofcourse
12:18 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/f457b58d68e72df83128a7bc779d71a5208dfe47#diff-8be0b73182ebc28e83f65ab6d3335e90R200
12:18 <@heinrich5991> the relevant part
12:19 <@EastByte> iirc the seq number only is 2^10
12:20 <@EastByte> that's like half a second of bruteforcing
12:20 <@deen> Hm, noobs always play on the wrong servers
12:20 <@deen> just joined Kobra 4 on USA and everyone playing there was from europe...
12:22 <@EastByte> !twp deen
12:22 < Nimda> deen is currently playing Kobra 4 on server : DDNet GER - Novice [DDraceNetwork].
12:25 <@deen> tried to convince them that ping 40 is better than 140
12:25 <@EastByte> "nope" :)
12:29 <@EastByte> https://github.com/east/teeworlds/tree/pwantispoof
12:29 <@EastByte> already getting complains because of my lameass spoofing protection
12:29 <@EastByte> no one bypassed it yet, though
12:32 <@deen> hm, no multi-processor network rx queues on 2.6.32 kernel
12:32 <@deen> and of course they switched me over to that old kernel on chile
12:32 <@deen> that will hurt with big ddos attacks =/
12:33 <@EastByte> :D
12:52 <@deen> EastByte: what kind of complaints?
12:54 <@EastByte> Meskalin and also some other guy were complaining about that this is a stupid protection and easy to bypass
12:55 <@EastByte> probably not knowing how it works, I got no proof of a bypass
12:55 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: well, what's your system?
12:56 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: I have a server online, you can follow me
12:56 <@EastByte> there is a generated password which the user has to enter
12:57 <@EastByte> so the token handshake is simply done by the user
12:57 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: does that protect from inserting messages?
12:57 <@heinrich5991> it doesn't sound secure
12:57 <@EastByte> nope, only from flooding slots with spoofed ips
12:58 <@EastByte> different problem
12:58 <@heinrich5991> ok. but that's not the real problem right now :/
12:58 < Learath2> make the user enter a captcha
12:58 <@EastByte> ^ that's basically how it works
12:58 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: this problem still exists, though
12:58 <@EastByte> you can dos any server
12:59 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: yes. it should be fixed, you're right
12:59 <@heinrich5991> but what causes the most frustration right now is that other problem :/
13:00 <@EastByte> maybe
13:25 <@deen> EastByte: what happened to the "download a small map as spoof protection"?
13:38 <@EastByte> deen: I noticed two additional problems
13:38 <@deen> Savander: why did you leave?
13:38 <@deen> Savander: i found a way to help...
13:38 <@EastByte> the vital one is that this kind protection probably won't work at all with dummys...
13:39 <@EastByte> since we have such a primitive dummy connecting scheme
13:39 <@deen> EastByte: well, let's remove dummies and move them to server side features
13:39 <@deen> :P
13:40 <@EastByte> I guess that currently is not a valid option^^
13:40 <@deen> i think it is, dummy makes the client code terrible and introduces bugs everywhere
13:40 < Savander> deen,  really?
13:40 <@deen> Savander: yeah, but i failed to do it^
13:40 < Savander> ah, didn't know :D
13:40 < Savander> ^^>
13:40 <@deen> Savander: i could enter the map at a later part, then fall back toyour part
13:40 <@deen> with ninja
13:41 < Savander> oh, i got it
13:41 < Savander> it'd be epic :D
13:41 <@EastByte> deen: removing client side dummys will cause too much hate
13:41 <@EastByte> also there is no way we can support older versions of dummy clients
13:42 <@deen> EastByte: well, bam, people need to update
13:42 <@EastByte> it was your fault adding them in the first place :P
13:42 <@deen> no, i was always against them =/
13:42 <@deen> i think teamplay is the most important part of ddrace
13:42 <@EastByte> right, me too
13:42 <@deen> i finally added a version of them where i removed half the features
13:42 <@deen> and i mainly added it for map testing
13:43 <@heinrich5991> apart from things about not adding dummies at all, I guess client-side dummies are the better option
13:43 <@deen> because testers complained that they never can find a partner for tsting maps
13:43 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: explain
13:43 < Savander> Then people just started making Dummy drag
13:43 < Savander> maps!
13:43 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: otherwise there will be lags when switching, etc.
13:43 <@deen> heinrich5991: and now with dummy there's twice the traffic and slightly different delays with main and dummy
13:44 <@heinrich5991> ah, the traffic
13:44 <@heinrich5991> I didn't think of this
13:44 <@deen> traffic is actually a limiting factor for some people on ddnet
13:44 <@deen> that's also why /showall is off by default
13:44 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: also the current switching between dummys also isn't implemented really efficient
13:45 <@heinrich5991> but I guess making it serverside will jnust introduce more bugs
13:45 <@EastByte> it will
13:45 <@heinrich5991> the good thing about client dummies is that it's not a new situation for the server :)
15:52 <@deen> meh, meskalin is spamming servers with his spoofed clients
15:53 <@deen> wait no
15:53 <@deen> he's actually making the people who use his client say that...
15:58 <@deen> it's of course bad that 15% of players use his client =/
15:58 < Sadale> wow wtf?
15:58 <@deen> it has lots of bots, peopple love bots
15:58 <@deen> but they don't realize it's malware
15:58 < Sadale> oh :(
15:59 < Sadale> I remember that nx|City has a computer shutdown command and a command for creative useless files on your HDD, etc.
15:59 < Sadale> I seen it in tw forum
16:08 < Savander> http://pastebin.com/0yUytWrY
16:08 < Savander> ehm?
16:08 < Savander> "bam release"
16:08 < Savander> WOW
16:09 <@heinrich5991> Savander: what's that?
16:09 < Savander> compiling
16:09 < Savander> after bam release
16:09 < Savander> on ltest 0.6 soruces
16:09 < Savander> sources from github.com/teeworlds
16:09 <@deen> Savander: that's windows
16:09 < Savander> :/
16:09 <@deen> when 2 processes write, the characters get mixed
16:09 <@deen> you can use -j 1
16:10 <@heinrich5991> could still be fixed somehow I guess
16:10 <@deen> yes, should be fixed in bam
16:10 < Savander> ehm
16:10 <@deen> I've seen this every time i compile on windows
16:10 < Savander> -j 1?
16:10 < Savander> where
16:10 <@deen> bam -j 1 release
16:10 <@deen> i think
16:10 < Savander> cuz, still a lot o ferrors
16:10 <@deen> yeah, but readable errors
16:11 <@heinrich5991> now even your IRC client does it :P
16:11 <@deen> it only happens when there are errors in multiple files
16:11 < Savander> hmm
16:11 < Savander> i don't understand, why 
16:11 < Savander> xd
16:11 < Savander> i have errors in every single file
16:11 < Savander> lol
16:11 < Savander> CNetObj_*
16:13 < Savander> ok
16:13 < Savander> maybe problem is with python
16:13 < Savander> yop.
16:20 <@deen> now spoofed clients too
16:20 <@deen> all with port 1337
16:22 <@deen> oh, advanced dummies
16:22 <@deen> they actually move
16:22 <@deen> all in sync
16:22 <@deen> but their ips are obviously spoofed, interesting
16:23 < Sadale> deen, botnet?
16:23 <@deen> Sadale: no, just 1 computer, but it can fake any ip
16:24 <@heinrich5991> may I say: "I thought you had spoofing protection"?
16:24 <@deen> what's that in reference to?
16:24 < Sadale> deen, interesting. How do it receive package to control the dummy then?
16:24 <@deen> Sadale: it doesn't
16:24 <@heinrich5991> I genuinely thought (and I'm still thinking) that you implemented spoofing control?
16:24 < Sadale> deen, nvm
16:25 <@deen> you can come on the Kobra 4 server if you want to watch them
16:25 <@heinrich5991> but it's not in place anymore?
16:25 <@deen> heinrich5991: i tink we had something like that, but it caused problems for many players and was never a good protection anyway
16:25 <@heinrich5991> ah
16:25 <@heinrich5991> I think fstd had something like that in ddwar
16:26 <@deen> and we do have protection against spoofing the ips of actual players, random ports etc
16:26 <@deen> but here just random ips are spoofed
16:26 <@heinrich5991> don't remember how that worked exactly though
16:26 <@heinrich5991> yea, but IPs that can't be used for receiving)
16:26 <@deen> and the tees look like they're dancing^^
16:26 <@heinrich5991> ^^
16:28 <@deen> so far they couldn't control the movement of spoofed clients i think
16:28 < Sadale> how do they dance if the ip is spoofed?
16:28  * Sadale is confused :S
16:28  * Sadale is noob
16:29 <@deen> Sadale: they manage to send control packets somewhow
16:29 <@deen> i thought it had some ack in it
16:30 < Sadale> interesting. :/
16:59 < Savander> Wow, server gets 3 request per second about gameinfo from server list
17:03 <@deen> what server list?
17:05 < Savander> inside game
17:05 < Savander> this from masterserver
17:06 < Savander> and one man refreshing this list every second
17:06 < Savander> since 10 minutes
17:07 <@heinrich5991> Savander: that's likely an automated tool
17:07 <@heinrich5991> Savander: do you run a populated server?
17:08 < Savander> nope
17:08 < Savander> im testing code
17:08 < Savander> i ran local server
17:08 < Savander> with a bit modified code
17:08 < Savander> to see ips (for test, how it works)
17:08 <@heinrich5991> haha sure :D
17:08 < Savander> and one ip refershing list 
17:08 < Savander> every second
17:08 < Savander> :PP
17:08 <@heinrich5991> likely an automated script
17:09 < Savander> yup
17:09 < Savander> maybe it's
17:09 < Savander> http://www.teeworlds-stats.info/
17:09 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: the previous version of antispoof simulated a mapchange and checked whether the client requests the correct chunks of the fake map (pretty much like that)
17:09 <@heinrich5991> I know at least one guy who runs one, but it's not as aggressive as "every second"
17:09 <@EastByte> the main problem was it wasn't allocation-less
17:10 < Savander> teeworlds-stats probably does it
17:10 < Savander> for collecting data ^^.
17:18 <@EastByte> Savander: 84.200.208.199 should request every 30 seconds
17:18 <@heinrich5991> is that you? :)
17:18 <@EastByte> yep
17:18 <@heinrich5991> what are you doing?
17:18 <@EastByte> it's the backend Nimda uses
17:18 <@heinrich5991> ah
17:18 < Savander> i see
17:18 <@EastByte> a json api for server requests
17:19 < Savander> ^^
17:20 <@EastByte> traffic after full refresh:  kbytes send/recv 18.8642578125 / 163.9267578125
17:20 <@EastByte> I guess requesting once per second isn't that expensive
17:21 <@deen> you can watch ddnet traffic on empty servers: http://ddnet.tw/status
17:21 <@deen> not much being setn
17:30 < Savander> ;)
17:31 < Savander> 100% cpu on DDNet.tw
17:31 < Savander> backup?^^
17:31 <@deen> that's normal
17:31 <@deen> it's a single core machine and it runs cpu intensive stuff 24/7
17:32 < Savander> http://www.teeworlds-stats.info/tee?n=iG_Savander
17:32 < Savander> "Do you like iG_Savander ?    [facebook] [twitter]"
17:32 < Savander> do you like me:C
17:32 < Savander> xD
17:33 <@deen> teeworlds-stats has some really old statistics
17:33 <@deen> i can see my ictf and adrenaline 3 phases: http://www.teeworlds-stats.info/tee?n=deen
17:33 < Savander> its not updated 
17:33 < Savander> meh
17:34 <@deen> or ddmax is still shown as one of the most played mods^^: http://www.teeworlds-stats.info/general
17:34 <@deen> would be nice to have some filter, like "since 2015"
17:34 < Savander> it's funny how it works :D
17:35 < Savander> ehm it's updated i think
17:35 <@deen> sure it's updated
17:35 <@deen> but it still keeps the old data from years ago as well
17:36 < Savander> like my site
17:36 < Savander> youtube channel statistics
17:36 < Savander> it's good, he should make api maybe
17:37 < Savander> to give some data to others
17:37 <@deen> yeah, I'd also like all the raw data
17:37 < Savander> like youtube does
17:37 <@deen> ddnet is offering all the data we have publicly now, i think
17:37 <@deen> only saves are not public^^
17:37 <@deen> i think all the other information is
17:38 <@heinrich5991> you hopefully don't display IP addresses? :)
17:38 <@deen> heinrich5991: i don't record any ip addresses
17:38 <@deen> heinrich5991: they are stored in logs for 2 days, then removed
17:38 <@heinrich5991> nice
17:38 <@deen> don't have any logs from more than 2 days ago
17:38 < Savander> you offerin data as zip
17:38 <@deen> Savander: yeah
17:38 < Savander> in archive/
17:38 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/stats/
17:38 <@deen> should all be linked here
17:39 < Savander> im thinking about, something like json providing automated generated via website ^^.
17:39 <@deen> and the maps and configs of course
17:39 <@deen> Savander: sure, if you think people will use it and want to implement it :P
17:40 < Savander> im talking about teeworlds-stats
17:40 <@deen> ok, yeah
17:40 < Savander> because it'll be usable :PP
17:41 < Savander> its more than 2 years collecting of data of all tees 
17:41 < Savander> it's good point to make some graphs
17:41 < Savander> :P 
17:41 <@deen> much more than 2 years i think
17:41 < Savander> and infographics
17:41 <@deen> because it shows so much ctf4_old for me, i didn't play that much in 2-3 years

17:41 < Savander> but maybe it was updated
17:44 < Savander> http://www.veracode.com/security/spoofing-attack
17:46 < Savander> server sends you more information after selection it on server list or sends everything after refresh?
17:49 <@deen> don't understand
17:49 <@heinrich5991> Savander: it sends everything each time your client requests, e.g. on refresh
17:50 < Savander> ok
17:50 < Savander> thanks &&:

18:31 < devnull> is there a clientlog?
18:32 < devnull> i dont have one oo
18:33 < devnull> either deen has a clientlog (with at least the normal serverchat), he has a pretty good memory or he has logs with the normal serverchat more than 1 month old
18:35 < devnull> deen hat eine funktion um den chat seines clients zu loggen (nur von ihm), ein sehr gutes ged√§chnis oder er speichert mindestens die normalen serververl√§ufe f√ºr √ºber 1 monat
18:35 < devnull> bin ich aber jetzt auch mal gespannt
18:46 <@deen> devnull: haha, I run my client like this: ./DDNet -f mine.cfg >> client.log
18:46 <@deen> so yes, while I don't have server logs, I have client log a few months back
18:46 <@deen> good to check when someone talks to me about something and I forgot what it was about
19:36 < danstee> Hello everyone :)
19:37 < Savander> hi
19:37 < danstee> I am just now getting into setting up a DDNet Server on my Debian root server. Is there any really good starting point for me to read about how I should go about it?
19:38 < danstee> Unfortunately there is no Readme or anything in the github, and also not on the ddnet site itself
19:38 < Savander> http://ddnet.tw/settingscommands/
19:41 < danstee> I do not look for *all the commands*, but for the values the commands need in order for my server to work as a ddrace server
19:42 < Chairn> it works as ddrace server without any settings
19:44 < Savander> jup
19:44 < Savander> don't know what you want to set up
19:45 < danstee> Well, then I must have anything wrong with settings for my map. I just took the run_guy_25.map file into my maps folder, changed the autoexec.cfg to source that map, but it won't use those tiles moving me somewhere else
19:45 < Savander> hmm?
19:45 < Savander> which version
19:45 < danstee> Sorry for dumb questions, I just don't feel like I understood the gist of it
19:45 < Savander> you know, ddnet uses 
19:45 < Savander> another tilesets
19:45 < Savander> than race
19:46 < danstee> Oh, well... that means I might have to use another server executable?
19:47 < Savander> deen,  where is run_guy on your github?
19:47 < Savander> i found only HDP
19:50 < Savander> savander.pl/upload/maps/run_guy_25.map
19:50 < Savander> danstee, 
19:50 < Savander> get this one
19:52 < danstee> Yeees
19:52 < danstee> That one worked
19:53 < Savander> ;)
19:53 < danstee> So, just so I get it right: There are different kinds of tilesets, and they are only compatible with a certain server executable?
19:54 < Savander> yes
19:54 < danstee> And can I just take any map my client downloaded from another server, and run it on my server? (I guess no then)
19:54 < Savander> you can but, server need to interpret it
19:54 < Savander> ddnet interpret it a bit different than old race 
19:55 < danstee> Ahh okay. So DDNet is like the "newer version" of DDRace?
19:56 < danstee> Sweet, thank you guys! You just made my day! :)
19:57 < danstee> Will the server executable look in subfolders of my maps folder? alas, can I organize them in a folder structure, or do I need to tell the server the folder name as well?
20:00 < Savander> maps are execute from maps folder or data/maps folder
20:02 < Savander> yes
20:02 < Savander> you can
20:02 < Savander> inside data/maps or maps
20:02 < Savander> make a folder
20:02 < Savander> then in config
20:02 < Savander> sv_map "folder/map_name"
20:02 < Savander> or change_map "folder/map_name"
20:03 < Savander> oh and i forgot
20:03 < Savander> ddnet supports ./maps folder
20:03 < Savander> but standard server not
20:08 <@deen> Not sure if I wrote about this here, but about blocking IPs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:82.148.97.69
20:11 < Savander> what
20:11 < Savander> the/
20:17 < danstee> One more question: Playing AiP-Gores here, got it from the def- github
20:17 < danstee> problem is: hook is disabled. How can I enable it? 
20:18 <@deen> danstee: hm, what's your config?
20:18 <@deen> you must have set something, because by default hook is definitely enabled
20:18 < Savander> deen,  map doesn't have some settings?
20:18 < Savander> in .cfg
20:18 < Savander> maybe inside you disable hook
20:18 <@deen> not that one, no
20:19 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet-maps/tree/master/oldschool
20:19 <@deen> AiP-Gores has no cfg file
20:19 < Savander> oh ye
20:19 <@deen> oh, but maybe danstee had a solo map running before and something didn't get reset?
20:19 < Savander> it'll be weird
20:19 < Savander> because server reset it automatically
20:20 < danstee> ahhh yes I had a solo map running
20:20 < danstee> and then just used console with change_map
20:20 < danstee> one sec, I'll try a restart
20:20 < Savander> still it's weird
20:20 < Savander> it should reset all settings to default ? Am i wrong?
20:21 <@deen> Savander: sv_tune_reset is 0 by default
20:21 <@deen> maybe we should make it 1?
20:21 < Savander> i guess
20:21 <@deen> i imagine some people might be experimenting with tunes
20:21 <@deen> and they don't want to reenter the tunes every time they reload the map
20:21 <@deen> most people use the server to test their own maps and new ideas etc
20:21 <@deen> not to actually host a server
20:21 < Savander> just put
20:22 < Savander> this command
20:22 < Savander> into autoexeec
20:22 < danstee> which one?
20:22 < danstee> sv_tune_reset 1
20:22 <@deen> sv_tune_reset 1
20:22 < danstee> okay
20:22 <@deen> oh, I notice that we're not resetting another setting
20:23 <@deen> sv_solo_server :P
20:23 <@deen> not sure if that should be reset by default either
20:23 < Savander> deen,  in next update you should add sV_tune_reset 0 # Reset tunes/ddrace settings after switch map
20:23 < Savander> deen,  it depends on settings inside file?
20:23 <@deen> Savander: if i change the autoexec, it overwirtes everyone's settings, that's terrible
20:23 < Savander> deen,  then add it to new downloades
20:23 <@deen> yeah
20:24 < Savander> so it's not bad i guess?
20:24 < Savander> if you want solo server
20:24 < Savander> you probably put it into settings.cfg
20:24 <@heinrich5991> about that IP: lol
20:24 <@deen> and then it would get reset every time
20:24 <@deen> hmmmm
20:24 <@deen> not sure what's best
20:24 < Savander> best is reset all ddrace settings
20:24 < Savander> :PP
20:25 <@deen> well, and then how is someone supposed to run a solo server?
20:25 < Savander> sv_solo_server
20:25 <@deen> set sv_solo_server 1 in each map config?
20:25 < Savander> sv_solo_server 1 in config
20:25 <@deen> Savander: it still gets reset to 0
20:25 < Savander> so it not depends on if it is in config
20:25 <@deen> not to the original value
20:25 <@deen> right
20:26 < Savander> so then i don't know :D
20:26 < Savander> hmm
20:26 < danstee> thx guys, now it seems to be working though...
20:26 < Savander> danstee,  ;)
20:27 < danstee> Have I started ideas for the next release? #beingproud :D
20:27 < Savander> don't know, maybe we should stay it as it is now.
20:27 < Savander> without reseting sv_solo_server
20:28 < danstee> Do you guys have a sample autoexec.cfg that has comments to the options? I mean, oldschool unix style? ;) I'm sure that would help new people hosting
20:29 < Savander> autoexec.cfg
20:29 < Savander> has simple config
20:29 < Savander> if you want more, just read settings page on ddnet.tw
20:29 < Savander> :P
20:29 < Chairn> [20:21] <@deen> Savander: sv_tune_reset is 0 by default [20:21] <@deen> maybe we should make it 1?
20:29 < danstee> See, I still don't even get the different options where to put settings
20:29 < Chairn> deen: is that the reason why i had to load quintessenz map twice when i tested my final part?
20:30 < danstee> A simple guide how and where settings are sourced from would be great
20:30 <@deen> Chairn: doesn't sound so, not sure why you had to do that?
20:30 < Chairn> first time i load, tune zone didnt work
20:30 < Chairn> so i reloaded, and it worked
20:30 < Savander> it's weird
20:30 <@deen> Chairn: maybe you set the tune zones too late
20:30 < Chairn> ?
20:31 < Savander> tunes are not resets by default
20:31 < Chairn> what you mean by "too late"?
20:31 < Savander> So map doing it at start (if maps has tunes)
20:32 <@deen> Chairn: no idea, never seen something like that happen^^
20:33 < Chairn> lemme try again
20:33 < Savander> deen, in new release (in archive) we should put sv_reset_tunes 0 #Description
20:33 < Savander> but not update it in autoupate
20:33 < Savander> the best solution i guess ^^>
20:34 < Chairn> well, this time worked first time
20:39 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/v34Lb

21:22 < Donate4DDNet> hey :)
21:27 < Savander> yo
21:46 < Chairn> ehm, i can compile in normal, but not in debug mode

22:35 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/THKQsfc67335
22:40 < WolfAlex> Savander: thats the IP that refreshes all 2 sec?
22:41 < Savander> no no
22:41 < Savander> refreshes means how many refreshes in total
22:41 < Savander> from all ips
22:41 < Savander> below time of server ran
22:41 < Savander> and second is current time
22:42 < Savander> 1.5x per second
22:42 < Savander> list is refreshed
22:42 < Savander> ^^.
22:43 < WolfAlex> ahh
22:43 < WolfAlex> you can blacklist two IPs
22:43 < WolfAlex> these IPs are doing like 80% of all requests
22:44 < WolfAlex>         [87, 117, 225, 46],
22:44 < WolfAlex>         [79, 133, 48, 200],
22:44 < Savander> 79,133,48,200
22:44 < Savander> it doing it all the time
22:44 < Savander> :P
22:44 < WolfAlex> yea
22:44 < Savander> oh
22:44 < Savander> ;D
22:44 < Savander> what is it?
22:45 < WolfAlex> hm?
22:45 < Savander> [79, 133, 48, 200
22:45 < Savander> you know who is it?
22:45 < WolfAlex> no idea
22:46 < Savander> ^^
22:47 < Savander>  79.133.48.200
22:47 < Savander> someone from germany
22:47 < WolfAlex> you can also block these IPs
22:47 < WolfAlex>  84,200,208,199
22:47 < WolfAlex>  188,165,209,72 
22:47 < WolfAlex>  37,59,122,145 
22:47 < WolfAlex>  37,17,224,28
22:47 < Savander> i don't want to block anything ^^>
22:47 < WolfAlex> these IPs are automated scripts ._.
22:48 < Savander> http://whois.domaintools.com/87.117.225.46
22:48 < Savander> maybe they collecting data
22:48 < Savander> for statistics :v
22:48 < WolfAlex> hm
22:49 < Savander> it's not much traffic
22:49 < Savander> sooo
22:49 < Savander> ;P
22:50 < WolfAlex> the token distribution is strange ....
22:52 < WolfAlex> https://pastebin.com/ym3C2wyH
22:53 < WolfAlex> (with the two IPs i mentioned blocked)
23:26 <@deen> Chairn: compilation works for me, tried removing objs?
23:27 < Chairn> didnt work
23:29 < Chairn> objs/engine/external/json-parser/json_d.o: In function `json_object_get': E:\Teeworlds_DDNet/src/engine/external/json-parser/json.h:192: multiple definiti on of `json_object_get' objs/engine/client/serverbrowser_d.o:E:\Teeworlds_DDNet/src/engine/external/json -parser/json.h:192: first defined here
23:29 < Chairn> still the same
23:29 <@deen> weird
23:30 < Chairn> only ddnet.exe is not compiling, i have all others executables
23:30 < Savander> you changed something? o.O
23:30 <@deen> sounds like a VS/windows problem
23:30 < Chairn> i use mingw
23:30 <@deen> maybe you can find out how to fix it
23:31 < Chairn> doesnt work for master branch either
23:31 < Chairn> same error
23:31 < Chairn> and master is sync with yours deen
23:31 < Savander> wait
23:31 < Savander> you have latest ddnet
23:31 < Savander> version?
23:32 < Chairn> ?
23:32 < Chairn> what you mean? the code on master is sync with deen's
23:32 < Savander> What you compiled
23:32 < Savander> ok so
23:32 < Savander> i'll try compile it too maybe?
23:32 < Savander> im on windows
23:32 < Savander> using mingw too
23:32 < Chairn> ok, nice
23:33 < Chairn> give it a try ;)
23:37 < Savander> yaay
23:37 < Savander> teetow send me a newest music
23:37 < Savander> to trailer
23:37 < Savander> it's sounds... awesome!
23:37 < Savander> sent me*
23:38 <@deen> it's possible that the people who send requests to servers all the time, are using it for attacks
23:39 <@deen> the kind of attack where they know everyone's IPs and ports and correlate IPs with joining servers
23:39 <@deen> they should also have a server running for that
23:40 < Chairn> Savander: did it compile?
23:40 < Savander> wait
23:40 < Savander> i need to finish download
23:40 < Savander> :D
23:41 <@deen> the hoster of 79.133.48.200 looks interesting^^
23:41 < Savander> :D
23:41 < Savander> yup!
23:41 <@deen> located in frankfurt, great connection to Deutsche Telekom network, ddos protected, cheap
23:42 < Savander> he request me all the time.
23:42 <@deen> might try them out
23:42 <@deen> if you're annoyed at the requests or we find out some more about them, we can send an abuse mail
23:42 <@deen> german hoster should at least consider it
23:43 <@deen> eh, qloc.de only has Windows for KVM...
23:43 <@deen> guess you can just buy it with windows and set up debian...
23:43 < Savander> really?
23:43 < Chairn> ddos?
23:43 <@deen> https://www.qloc.de/modules.php?name=sections&op=view&ids=5
23:43 <@deen> and traffic is pretty low with just 2 TB
23:44 < Savander> maybe you can ask them
23:44 < Savander> for VPS without windows 
23:44 < Savander> but with debian
23:45 <@deen> I'm wondering why i never heard of that hoster before
23:46 < Savander> deen, 
23:46 < Savander> same problem here
23:46 < Savander> ;)
23:46 <@deen> ok, then try to find out why?^^
23:46 < Savander> with those "json"
23:46 < Savander> i'll :P
23:47 <@deen> hm, i remember the description texts of qloc.de word for word
23:47 <@deen> must be a new subcompany of some i tried already
23:47 <@deen> or they stole the text
23:53 <@deen> i think i have the name of the guy who runs 79.133.48.200
23:53 < Savander> huh
23:54 <@deen> in case anyone wants to ask him what he's doing with all these server pings
23:56 < Chairn> dont get those json
23:56 <@deen> ah, my bad, it's a webhosting server of qloc.de
23:56 <@deen> they run many websites on it: http://sameid.net/ip/79.133.48.200/
23:56 <@deen> I'd assume one of these guys has some php script running to ping all servers
