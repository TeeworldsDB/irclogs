00:00 <@deen> yeah
00:01 < goo_> is the built in round() same calculation? maybe there were small changes with laser
00:02 <@deen> Should be same
00:06 < goo_> also, was it intended to have lower case r in DDRace? it is DDrace everywhere
00:06 <@deen> Yes, intentional
00:06 <@deen> I prefer the way it looks
00:06 < goo_> ok
00:06 <@deen> not so crowded with all these upper case letters
00:06 < goo_> i prefer with caps, as it symbolises each word, Dummy Drag Race
00:07 < goo_> but its just symantecs, small stuff i shouldnt be worrying about, im off to work on uni project, cheers
00:08 <@deen> Yeah, but at ddnet we don't even like the dummy drag aspect of it, haha
00:10 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/rules/
00:10 <@deen> 3. Do something else than simple (stupid) dummy drag parts
00:13 < goo_> im off to work on app, bye
