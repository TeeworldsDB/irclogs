00:13 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] H-M-H opened pull request #740: exclude external libs from github statistics (master...pr_linguist) https://git.io/vS7sI
12:05 < Ryozuki> what is this?
12:05 < Ryozuki> if(Unpacker.Error() == 0 && !str_comp(pCmd, "crashmeplx"))
12:05 < Ryozuki> crashmeplx
12:05 < Ryozuki> ?
12:06 < Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L1160
12:07 <@EastByte> that's a ddrace client indicator I think
12:08 <@EastByte> look into server.cpp where it's interpreted
12:08 <@EastByte> oh you got the line from server.cpp, nvm
12:21 <@deen>  it's old compatibility stuff
12:21 <@deen> we need a faq for this kind of question
12:22 <@deen> 12:39 <@deen> it's not an indiciation for ddrace/ddnet client, it's an indication that this client can receive more than 16 player objects
12:22 <@deen> 12:39 <@deen> because if a client can't, you end up crashing the client
12:23 <@deen> https://ddnet.tw/irclogs/2015-07-30.log
12:27 < Ryozuki> Why don't put a faq here
12:28 < Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/wiki
12:28 <@deen> what about your wiki btw?
12:28 <@deen> i tried editting it and got errors
12:29 <@deen> and i don't think we need another wiki
12:29 < Ryozuki> i'll look that error
12:30 < Ryozuki> well yea, we can put the faq on the current wiki
12:32 < Ryozuki> can you tell me how to reproduce the error?
12:33 < Ryozuki> what you did exactly?
12:33 <@deen> have no account, just wanted to make a new page
12:33 < Ryozuki> ok
12:34 <@deen> hm, just tried again and it works
12:34 <@deen> no idea
12:34 < Ryozuki> when you made the account?
12:34 < Ryozuki> maybe i fixed it time ago
12:34 < Ryozuki> i mean the page*
12:37 < Ryozuki> so, should i call it "Development FAQ" or just FAQ
12:38 <@deen> not sure^^, or just write it on github readme.md
12:40 < Ryozuki> we would spam the repo with commits then, i think
12:40 < Ryozuki> wiki can be edited without account, so ill just make 2 faqs, dev, and game faq
12:41 < Ryozuki> also ill port some tutorials from forum
12:56 < Ryozuki> heinrich5991, about https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/739#issuecomment-294278772 i added cases where the output is only shown to the server console and admin rcon, so i'll remove them, these cases are when the player joins/enters and when it drops
12:56 < Ryozuki> i think it was correct before the last commit
12:57 <@heinrich5991> was it? I thought the join/leave messages are shown to everyone who is currently logged in
12:57 < Ryozuki> i tested it and no
12:57 < Ryozuki> just to admins
13:00 < Ryozuki> i think it's ready to merge now
13:01 < Ryozuki> oh wait
13:04 <@heinrich5991> it seems you're right. https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/1ae474689d564e1feba9924842f05e06600d83a1 added that, I wonder whether that was intended
13:04 <@heinrich5991> and you have tried it out that it indeed doesn't show?
13:04 < Ryozuki> i logged as admin
13:04 < Ryozuki> connected another client, showed up "player entered..."
13:04 < Ryozuki> then i logged as mod
13:04 < Ryozuki> joined another client
13:04 < Ryozuki> didn't show up
13:22 < Ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.tw/Development_FAQ
13:22 < Ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.tw/User_FAQ
13:22 < Ryozuki> feel free to add things
