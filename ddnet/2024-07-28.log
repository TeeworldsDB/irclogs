03:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ryo "linkit" is a cool name!
04:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> How do I correctly fill a integer from a 4 byte memory region into a 64 bit register?
04:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> In my .bss section i have `udp_payload_index resb 4` and now i want to move its value into `rax` but `rax` is 8 byte.
04:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> So this is reading out of bounds if i understood it correctly `mov rax, [udp_payload_index]`
04:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the register name determins the size so its reading 8 bytes starting at my udp_payload_index label which is only a 4 byte region
04:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `mov edx, [udp_payload_index]` should do a 4 byte move but then only half of `rax` is set and there might be other garbage in the other half
04:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> So i did a `xor rax, rax` first hoping it would all just work. Does that make sense? Or did i miss something?
04:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I just had an interesting denial of service idea for the 0.7 protocol to basically ban one player quite efficiently. Can I post it here? xd
04:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Ah nvm it doesnt work so i can share the idea
04:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> So the security tokens are used to make sure I can not impersonate another ip and act on their behalf because i never get back the reponse with the token from the server.
04:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> My idea was to spoof the connect message to generate a token which i do not get but thats fine. If now the real owner of the ip tries to connect they will be rejected because the token is wrong.
04:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> But it does not work. You need to send ctrl_msg_connect for the server to drop invalid tokens which depends on the server token.
08:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yikes, there's no `movzx` instruction with 32 bit source üò¨
08:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wat even movzx do?
08:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> mov zero extend, it takes value and moves it into bigger place
08:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> `mov rax, byte [label]` moves 1 byte from label into rax
08:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> probably*
08:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Filling the rest of rax with zeros?
08:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yep
08:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Epic that‚Äôs what I need
08:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but it doesnt exist for 32 bit xd
08:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Do you think my xor hack works as well?
08:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im scared about endianess  and stuff
08:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> never heard of her
08:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> endianness!
08:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i mean i heard of it but never had problems with it xd
08:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> nessendian!
08:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Okay I will use that from now on everywhere
08:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> `mozx`?
08:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> `movzx`?
08:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> no xor rax and mov eax
08:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ah xd
08:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ye, i think it's the only way to make it work for 32 bit value :thonk:
08:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Since you said it can‚Äôt fail it‚Äôs not gonna add bugs
08:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Compiler dev approved
08:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> better not trust my words :justatest:
08:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Too late
10:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have the feeling 64 bit is like ipv6
10:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nobody actually uses it
10:25 < bridge> <jxsl13> maybe more like ipv6 devided by 2 ._.
10:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> feels like every `push` and `pop` is bloating around 64 bits while `cmp` only checks 32 or all my C bros use `int32` in their apis
10:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 you would love what im working on right now
10:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> selfrolling my testing framework in assembly
10:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> urgh
10:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> too low level for mein geschmack.
10:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> average go enjoyer
10:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> classic
10:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> static linking enjoyer
10:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont link shit
10:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> libc is bloat
10:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> libc is bloat
10:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cleaner than go lang test code
10:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> change my mind
10:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1722156277.png
10:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> assembly with macros is a underrated simple language
10:58 < bridge> <learath2> There is no movzx for 32 bit source because it would make no sense to have one
10:59 < bridge> <learath2> In x86-64, 32bit operands by definition create a 32 bit result zero extended to 64 bits
11:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> cannot deny
11:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it would make sense to me, so i  can write `movzx rax, dword ptr [foo]` :kek:
11:22 < bridge> <learath2> Just use mov instead
11:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but what if there's some data in upper 32 bits of a register
11:23 < bridge> <learath2> It's discarded, as I said, 32 bit operands create 32 bit results zero extended to 64 bits
11:25 < bridge> <learath2> https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-1-manual.pdf 3.4.1.1
11:28 < bridge> <learath2> `mov eax, dword ptr [foo]`
11:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and in rax there won't be garbage value, right?
11:28 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, the upper half will get zero'd
11:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chilllerdragon: you can remove that xor xd
11:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> woah no xor?
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just ``mov eax, 0xBABE`` and im good? the entire `rax` register only contains babe? thats op
11:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> register wont contain garbage if you move into eax 32 bit operand
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so you basically can't shoot your self i the foot with assembly
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> easier than pyson
11:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if you want just a number you can just write `mov rax, 0xBABE`, can't you? :thonk:
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i read from some label
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats a 4 byte region
11:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ye, so it will work
11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i might ditch bash as my fav language
11:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> also you don't need xors before `movzx` as here https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds-asmr/blob/b52f44e3a94e7af03341b18fa85ccde329ed02cd/src/udp.asm#L78-L79
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> basically grep xor &>/dev/null
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its cring anyways why not mov 0
11:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i fixed quitting btw xd
11:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no more `pkill`
11:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> better quit support than vim
11:46 < bridge> <learath2> No, only 32 bit operands have this behaviour, it's for legacy reasons
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i removed it all xd
11:46 < bridge> <learath2> Oh actually wait, I didn't look at it
11:46 < bridge> <learath2> It's fine, you don't need the xor
11:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it still works 
11:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but that doesnt mean much does it
11:47 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah yeah, it's fine. I misunderstood what catperson said. I thought he meant those can also be mov
11:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im not a furry :justatest:
11:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so either mov on `edi` or `movzx byte` on `rdi`?
11:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> eh well different sizes trol
11:49 < bridge> <learath2> Chiller when code directly in bytecode?
11:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> once i spawned a tee with assembly
11:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but then i also gotta learn elf format and shits
11:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its gonna be much harder
11:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: when vulkan support?
11:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and offsets
11:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i leave vulkan to jopsti and lerato
11:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they already pro in it
11:50 < bridge> <learath2> There was this weird dude in an irc channel that I used to be in that made a really interesting machine code writing tool. Then he turned out to be a massive racist transphobe so he got exiled. Now I can't find the tool and my irclogs aren't complete from those days

18:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yup, now it loads blazingly fast
18:14 < bridge> <learath2> I spent 1 hour today not implementing a 64-ary trie. Just mentally got stuck randomly
18:15 < bridge> <learath2> I still can't decide how to make it, random total mental block
18:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and it fixed docker as well üòè
18:18 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe I'll make a 256-ary trie instead, hm
18:18 < bridge> <learath2> but it's probably worse on cache
18:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> what you do
18:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> share the knowledge
18:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> changed dns ip in `/etc/resolv.conf` xd

19:04 < bridge> <trexic> Hello guys, I have a question.
19:04 < bridge> <trexic> Im new to the ddrace project and I want to add my own component.
19:04 < bridge> <trexic> So I created my own folder called features (game/client/features)
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> I created a class, which extends the CComponent class.
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> Now I want to override the OnRender class.
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> I've also overridden the Sizeof method with a return of sizeof(*this).
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> 
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> So now I have to register the component.
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> I did this in the gameclient.h by adding this:
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> // all components
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> CTestComponent m_TestComponent;
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> 
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> Then I added it to the insert call in the gameclient.cpp:
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> m_vpAll.insert(m_vpAll.end(), {&m_Skins,
19:05 < bridge> <trexic>                           &m_CountryFlags,
19:05 < bridge> <trexic>                           &m_MapImages,
19:05 < bridge> <trexic>                           &m_Effects, // doesn't render anything, just updates effects
19:05 < bridge> <trexic>                           &m_Binds,
19:05 < bridge> <trexic>                           &m_Binds.m_SpecialBinds,
19:05 < bridge> <trexic>                           &m_TestComponent, <-------
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> 
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> 
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> Unfortunately I get the error, that m_TestComponent is an unknown overwrite specifier.
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> The error leads to the gameclient.h, where I put CTestComponent m_TestComponent;
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> 
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> 
19:05 < bridge> <trexic> Can anybody help me with this?
19:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> is CTestcomponent correctly declared to extend CComponent?
19:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> eg `class CTestComponent : public CComponent`
19:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> only ask in 1 channel
19:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> delete one msg
19:11 < bridge> <trexic> As I said, idk where that belongs to... sry
19:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> np, here in dev it fits quite well i'd say
19:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> questions is more for beginners
19:12 < bridge> <trexic> Yes its is:
19:12 < bridge> <trexic> class CTestComponent : public CComponent
19:12 < bridge> <trexic> {
19:12 < bridge> <trexic> public:
19:12 < bridge> <trexic>     virtual int Sizeof() const override { return sizeof(*this); }
19:12 < bridge> <trexic>     virtual void OnRender() override;
19:12 < bridge> <trexic> };
20:09 < bridge> <teero777> did you define OnRender somewhere?
20:09 < bridge> <teero777> can you provide the exact error?
20:10 < bridge> <teero777> can you provide the exact error? (just copy logs)
20:10 < bridge> <trexic> Im sorry, I was just about to tell you that I have found the issue üòÑ 
20:10 < bridge> <trexic> I was including the gameclient.h in the testcomponent.h and that caused the issue
21:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> roby the machine
21:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i actually had to change settings in router because `/etc/resolv.conf` was overwritten by dhcpcd service :\
21:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can also stop the dhcpcd from doing that
21:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i didn't find how to do that so i changed in router üòÑ
22:59 < bridge> <teero777> how are jump and other particles packed into demos?
23:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> as snapshot items
23:00 < bridge> <teero777> an explosion is `CNetEvent_Explosion` for example but what would a jump be?
23:00 < bridge> <teero777> i cant find the correct struct
23:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe as an event on the character
23:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> don't quite remember
23:01 < bridge> <teero777> there is `CNetEvent_Common` but it defined as
23:01 < bridge> <teero777> ```cpp
23:01 < bridge> <teero777> struct CNetEvent_Common
23:01 < bridge> <teero777> {
23:01 < bridge> <teero777>     static constexpr int ms_MsgId = NETEVENTTYPE_COMMON;
23:01 < bridge> <teero777>     int m_X;
23:01 < bridge> <teero777>     int m_Y;
23:01 < bridge> <teero777> };
23:01 < bridge> <teero777> ```
23:01 < bridge> <teero777> no idea how i would use that
23:01 < bridge> <teero777> ah nvm
23:02 < bridge> <teero777> thats just the parent of all the other ones
23:02 < bridge> <teero777> ~~there is `CNetEvent_Common` but it defined as~~
23:02 < bridge> <teero777> ```cpp
23:02 < bridge> <teero777> struct CNetEvent_Common
23:02 < bridge> <teero777> {
23:02 < bridge> <teero777>     static constexpr int ms_MsgId = NETEVENTTYPE_COMMON;

23:02 < bridge> <teero777> ~~no idea how i would use that~~
23:07 < bridge> <teero777> if you don't have infinite jumps everything works fine but as soon as you get infinite jumps the sounds and jump particles disappears
23:07 < bridge> <teero777> if you don't have infinite jumps everything works fine but as soon as you get infinite jumps the sounds and jump particles disappear
23:07 < bridge> <teero777> maybe the physics code is just playing with me and its not correctly implemented
23:20 < bridge> <teero777> ok
23:20 < bridge> <teero777> that is literally the default demo behaviour
23:20 < bridge> <teero777> if you have endless jumps it doesn't give sounds nor particles
23:20 < bridge> <teero777> thats so stupid
23:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what are you trying to do?
23:23 < bridge> <teero777> im making a new TAS video and im rendering the run directly to a demo. Since the tas includes infinite jump you can't really witness the absurd amount of jumps the tas makes since it endless jumps apparently isn't visualized in the demo player.
23:23 < bridge> <teero777> no problem tho i can fix it

23:33 < bridge> <teero777> okay seems like all endless jumps are handled as ground jumps thats why they don't have particles or sounds in demos
23:33 < bridge> <teero777> the sounds for ground jumping are sent manually from the server
23:34 < bridge> <teero777> the sounds for ground jumping are sent manually from the server only if you don't have endless jumps
23:43 < bridge> <teero777> just increasing m_Jumpled on the player core by one before putting it into the demo works fine.
