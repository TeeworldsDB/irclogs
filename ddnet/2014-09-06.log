01:01 < Savander> good night
01:01 < Savander> :)
01:01 <@deen> bye Savander 
01:08 < laxa> deen: are you there ?
01:08 <@deen> yes
01:08 < laxa> I have an idea
01:08 <@deen> I know
01:08 < laxa> to avoid cheat on /save
01:08 < laxa> xD
01:08 < laxa> save the /timeout code in the save
01:09 < laxa> and only load if players nickname AND timeout code corresponds
01:09 <@deen> then people will just start exchanging timeout codes
01:09 <@deen> you can do /timeout x
01:09 < laxa> it's painfull to do
01:09 <@deen> and the other does that afterwards
01:09 <@deen> it's pretty easy
01:09 < laxa> hum yeah
01:09 < laxa> ok
01:09 <@deen> and with timeout codes you can do the same kind of cheat already anyway
01:09 <@deen> without saving
01:09 <@deen> just set /timeout x, simulate a timeout, and swap
01:10 <@deen> Or you can ask EastByte for access to his TW bouncer and do the same without any server support
01:10 < laxa> what is TW bouncer ?
01:10 <@deen> like an irc bouncer, but for teeworlds
01:10 < laxa> I don't know what a bouncer is.
01:11 <@deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_(software)
01:12 < laxa> Well, I don't understand how usefull that could be on teeworlds.
01:12 <@deen> you could use it as timeout protection on any server, not just ddnet
01:12 < laxa> bouncer / proxy and VPN are quite the same right ?
01:12 < laxa> Wtf, how ?
01:13 <@deen> the bouncer is actually connected as a client to the tw server
01:13 <@deen> and you connect to the bouncer
01:13 <@deen> then your inputs are relayed to the server
01:13 <@deen> but if you timeout, the bouncer stays connected
01:13 <@deen> and waits for you to reconnect
01:14 < laxa> hm ok lol
01:16 < laxa> bouncer is like "screen" command ? :)
01:17 <@deen> like the detach feature of screen
01:25 < laxa> you want another feature deen ?
01:26 <@deen> of course not
01:26 < laxa> xD.
01:26 <@deen> you could implement it yourself
01:26 < laxa> Option to allow teeworlds to run full CPU without being in window focus
01:26 < laxa> only usefull for 2 screens user
01:26 < laxa> or windowed player
01:27 <@deen> why is that useful?
01:27 < laxa> if your computer is b ad
01:27 < laxa> it's usefull
01:27 <@deen> why?
01:27 < laxa> Dota 2 has this feature
01:27 < laxa> well
01:27 < laxa> if the game has low fps when not in focus
01:27 < laxa> you can't really spectate someone
01:31 < laxa> engine_no_focus_sleep "0"
01:31 < laxa> this command on dota 2
01:32 <@deen> WTF
01:32 <@deen> I just implemented it
01:32 < laxa> xD
01:33 <@deen> but my computer crashed
01:33 < laxa> Oh...
01:33 <@deen> I think my mainboard is fried
01:33 <@deen> meh, writing it again on laptop
01:33 <@deen> 1 moment
01:34 <@deen> oh, i have no graphics on my laptop
01:38 < laxa> Give me srcs, I'll test.
01:42 <@deen> there you go laxa

01:42 <@deen> ..
01:42 <@deen> then why do you suggest it?...
01:43 <@deen> Has anyone complained about that?
01:43 < laxa> No, but it's nice feature for double screens users.
01:43 < laxa> I'll use it
01:43 < laxa> For better fps when spectating
01:43 <@deen> you really shouldn't
01:43 <@deen> you already get fine fps when spectating
01:55 < laxa> any news regarding steam deen ?
01:55 <@deen> not interested
01:55 < laxa> hum ok :(

14:03 <@deen> bor: are you still there?
14:03 < bor> yes
14:04 < bor> king asked me to ask you to change the rcon pass , apparently it is too easy and some ppl has guessed it or otherwise have it
14:05 <@deen> why do you think so?
14:05 <@deen> All DDNet mods have it, I haven't seen anyone else use it
14:07 < bor> i don't , king does
14:08 <@deen> well, then i would like to know why
14:10 < bor> ask him , he says he can't join the irc (the proxy problem again , he is not using proxy but his net is detected as proxy) but he is on skype
14:32 < Savander> !pl-eng Deen, co tam u Ciebie?
14:32 < Savander> meh

16:08 <@deen> hi kamillentee 
16:08 < kamillentee> hey
16:10 < laxa> deen: I have experienced a strange 3 times today.
16:10 < laxa> strnage bug
16:10 < laxa> really weird one
16:10 < laxa> grenade going through wall
16:10 < laxa> on solo map
16:10 < laxa> when a tee stands between wall and grenade
16:10 < laxa> happened 3 times
16:11 < laxa> I might have demo of it
16:21 <@deen> i know, same in vanilla
16:21 < laxa> wtf
16:21 <@deen> can't change that i guess
16:21 < laxa> WTF
16:21 <@deen> if you stand in a specific way you can shoot through some 1 tile walls
16:21 < laxa> Lulz...
16:22 < laxa> And how it isn't fixable oO ?
16:22 <@deen> Try to fix it please and you will see
16:23 <@deen> changing physics is always a bad idea
16:23 <@deen> will totally change how grenade parts work
16:23 <@deen> and many maps would break
16:24 < laxa> Thought that would be an entitie problem or something.
16:29 < laxa> Is there any issue about it on the repo teeworlds/teeworlds deen ?
16:29 < laxa> Can't find one
16:30 <@deen> i don't think so
16:30 <@deen> but haven't checked their issues for some months
16:30 <@deen> i can show you where you can easily reproduce it
16:30 < laxa> Hum...
16:31 < laxa> nice
16:31 < laxa> show me ! :)
16:31 <@deen> follow me

16:48 <@deen> wtf laxa
16:48 < laxa> deen: ?
16:48 <@deen> i do some speculation and you post it to the teeworlds devs?
16:48 < laxa> why not ?!
16:48 <@deen> i haven't read the source, nor tested it with vanilla and you probably haven't either
16:50 < Savander> xD
16:50 <@deen> posting a bug report based on a mod and speculation is bad
16:50 < laxa> ok
16:50 < laxa> We'll try on a vanilla then
16:51 < laxa> we need a map
16:51 < laxa> I'll provide server
16:52 <@deen> I'm not going to help you with this or any other thing. Stop spamming me please.
