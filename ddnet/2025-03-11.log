03:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ddnet feels buggier and bloatier than ever - but that's possibly just new age, anyways, setting an automap seed in editor crashes the client
03:29 < bridge> <learath2> Are you talking about after training or during training? If training is happening there is nothing  to do really, ddr5 is so high frequency that even lines built to spec within tolerance need to be trained on to not have issues.

03:29 < bridge> <learath2> After training I'm not quite sure what would be slowing it down, so I can't really comment
03:31 < bridge> <learath2> A couple of the recent features made it in lightning quick creating a flurry of issues :/
03:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I know
03:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Should've let me take a look at all those network changes
03:31 < bridge> <learath2> If you found a reproducible crash that isn't reported yet please create an issue
03:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I think heinrich gave me a good eye for extending stuff in a good way with thinking about it before
03:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> And not whatever happened recently
03:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I'll check
03:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Anyways gl
03:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Not watching who is merging stuff - but we shouldn't just merge stuff for contributions
03:39 < bridge> <hectavoxel> im pretty sure thats fixed in nightly
03:40 < bridge> <hectavoxel> yea it is

04:45 < bridge> <Solly>     }
04:45 < bridge> <Solly> ```
04:45 < bridge> <Solly> is it meant to be && teamlocked
04:45 < bridge> <Solly> cant you just not lock but unpractice a too large team
04:50 < bridge> <Solly> idk how u get more than 2 players in a team anyway
04:50 < bridge> <Solly> idk how u get more than allowed players in a team anyway
05:03 < bridge> <pioooooo> In practice mode it doesn't check max team size
05:38 < bridge> <Solly> when joining another team?
05:39 < bridge> <Solly> when joining a team from a practice team?
05:39 < bridge> <Solly> it does when trying to join a practice team from t0
05:46 < bridge> <mangomanjo_82539> can i get a mod to ban a blocker in a map
05:56 < bridge> <pioooooo> i dont think so

07:58 < bridge> <hectavoxel> im so glad i learned how to use ffmpeg
07:58 < bridge> <hectavoxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348912840748171264/image.png?ex=67d1307a&is=67cfdefa&hm=cf08c73658d3721702c3bce2460b8bfbc095f4253fb1bc478825e6158539f9d3&
07:58 < bridge> <hectavoxel> this is just bullshit dude
08:04 < bridge> <Ewan> lmao
08:04 < bridge> <Ewan> freaky tiktok tutorials
08:16 < bridge> <Assa> I whish discord would do this -.-
08:16 < bridge> <hectavoxel> LOL
08:17 < bridge> <hectavoxel> 15MB uploads only on mondays, wednesdays and fridays guys!! every other day is 8MB!
08:17 < bridge> <hectavoxel> dude i found the worst fucking video ever and i had to rag on it
08:18 < bridge> <hectavoxel> cant send it here
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
08:24 < bridge> <Assa> currently I need to downscale all demos I want to upload, my native 2K resolution is too much for dc
08:25 < bridge> <hectavoxel> are you also using ffmpeg?
08:25 < bridge> <Assa> i am using ffmpeg a lot (indirectly)
08:25 < bridge> <Ewan> do u know how to do 2 pass encoding with ffmpeg command line
08:25 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s vital
08:25 < bridge> <hectavoxel> its literally my go-to now when trying to send videos on discord
08:25 < bridge> <Ewan> a little math and u can roughly aim for a filesize
08:25 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
08:26 < bridge> <hectavoxel> not really but i kinda know how to make it under 10mb
08:26 < bridge> <Assa> If I were on ubuntu all time, I would totally agree 😬
08:27 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ```
08:27 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ffmpeg -i "[filename].mp4 -s 960x540 -fs 8MB "[filename]_smaller.mp4"```
08:27 < bridge> <hectavoxel> literally found out about resizing images too so it has much better results
08:27 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ```
08:27 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ffmpeg -i "[filename].mp4" -s 960x540 -fs 8MB "[filename]_smaller.mp4"```
08:27 < bridge> <hectavoxel> literally found out about resizing images too so it has much better results
08:27 < bridge> <Ewan> wait u can just do that now
08:28 < bridge> <Ewan> :brownbear:
08:28 < bridge> <Ewan> makes sense
08:28 < bridge> <Assa> time for an alias
08:28 < bridge> <hectavoxel> literally turnes an 80MB file into like, a 3.5MB file with this exact line
08:28 < bridge> <Ewan> i used my script within msys2 all the time
08:29 < bridge> <Ewan> works fine
08:29 < bridge> <hectavoxel> wdym alias
08:29 < bridge> <Ewan> cmd line alias
08:29 < bridge> <Assa> while true, my setup is in general a bit scuffed xD
08:29 < bridge> <Ewan> command which expands to that
08:29 < bridge> <Assa> https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/alias/
08:29 < bridge> <hectavoxel> oh thatd be so helpful
08:29 < bridge> <Solly> i used to hate ffmpeg, then i learnt how to use chatgpt
08:30 < bridge> <Assa> oops, searching for the less german link ...
08:30 < bridge> <Ewan> are u an ubuntu lover
08:30 < bridge> <Assa> no, i am a windows hater
08:30 < bridge> <Assa> no, i am a windows and mac hater
08:30 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i think ddnet srv convinced me to use ffmpeg for downsizing
08:31 < bridge> <Ewan> i hate chat gpt
08:31 < bridge> <hectavoxel> and literally its a gamebreaker because i can give discord a middle finger by not buying their nitro
08:31 < bridge> <Ewan> i just upload my videos to a friend’s website
08:31 < bridge> <hectavoxel> same
08:31 < bridge> <hectavoxel> its not useful to me at all and every question i ask it doesnt give me a good answer
08:31 < bridge> <Solly> chatgpt has made me a more competant everything, i agree the onset of ai has made the internet worse
08:32 < bridge> <Solly> chatgpt wasnt the start of that
08:32 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s made you more competent?
08:32 < bridge> <hectavoxel> definitely not, but its still a huge catalyst
08:32 < bridge> <Solly> competency being a measure how many things i can do in a certain timeframe yes
08:33 < bridge> <Ewan> competent or dependent
08:33 < bridge> <Solly> i used to google how to do things in bash 1 thing at a time, now i can just ask chatgpt and edit it when it inevitably misinterprets my prompt
08:33 < bridge> <Assa> https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/alias.1p.html
08:33 < bridge> <Assa> 
08:33 < bridge> <Assa> hmm, I can also send you a medium tutorial... why do you not have a nice english site with explanations and examples oO
08:33 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i do not understand how ppl can treat chatbots like a web browser
08:33 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i only go to it for like, super niche questiond
08:34 < bridge> <Solly> im pretty dependent on it right now, but i used to be dependent on stackoverflow and such before learning how to use man pages and documentation
08:34 < bridge> <Solly> chatgpt is much much faster
08:34 < bridge> <Solly> and has much less slop
08:34 < bridge> <Solly> if you dont know what youre looking for
08:35 < bridge> <Solly> and even if you know what youre looking for, wading through the cpp docs to get an answer to something for example is much slower than just asking chatgpt
08:35 < bridge> <Solly> and has much less slop (written by chatgpt)
08:35 < bridge> <Solly> and has much less slop (written by chatgpt, and cookie banners, and newsletters and huge headers, and waffle at the start, and ads if you havent got an adblocker)
08:36 < bridge> <Assa> according to chatgpt: `alias ffsmall='ffmpeg -i "$1" -s 960x540 -fs 8MB "${1%.*}_smaller.mp4"'`
08:36 < bridge> <Assa> 
08:36 < bridge> <Assa> ffsmall input.mp4
08:36 < bridge> <hectavoxel> hell yea
08:36 < bridge> <Solly> is -fs 8MB an option?
08:36 < bridge> <Ewan> seems so
08:37 < bridge> <Solly> thats nifty
08:37 < bridge> <hectavoxel> yea
08:37 < bridge> <Ewan> thats what i said
08:37 < bridge> <Ewan> for real
08:37 < bridge> <Solly> im gonna use this xd
08:37 < bridge> <Ewan> used to have to do 2 commands to get that result
08:37 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i set it to 8MB because theres sometimes an overflow
08:37 < bridge> <Solly> although swap the -s for a thing to conserve aspect ratio
08:37 < bridge> <Assa> now hecta, put that alias into `~/.bashrc` (probably) and you're gucci
08:37 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i should do that
08:37 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i only found -s through stack overflow :troll:
08:38 < bridge> <Solly> you should be able to specify max number of pixels or something
08:38 < bridge> <Solly> or max dimension
08:38 < bridge> <Solly> also keep it to an even number because some hardware encoding schemes require that
08:38 < bridge> <hectavoxel> yeah definitely
08:38 < bridge> <Assa> the size of a video depends on the compression for the frames and increments, it's a really hard problem knowing how big your vid is going to be in the end
08:38 < bridge> <Solly> i had previously chatgpted that i know its possible
08:40 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i feel like resizing is optional, because it often works without it, but in the rare case it doesnt, halving the dimensions of the video does the trick
08:40 < bridge> <Solly> it probably knows given the scheme how well ish a certain compression algo does given a quality factor
08:40 < bridge> <hectavoxel> all that matters is that its under 10MB, so if it somehow knows itll work without resizing then we wouldnt need it
08:40 < bridge> <Solly> and then calculates said quality factor
08:41 < bridge> <hectavoxel> but it if does know itll go over, then it'll resize
08:41 < bridge> <Solly> reducing resolution and fps is probably wanted as no one cares about that, but do care about bad compression artifacts
08:41 < bridge> <Solly> cant it just set the quality really low
08:41 < bridge> <Solly> or does the compression algo not support that, or give up at a ceratin point or does ffmpeg set an arbritrary limit
08:42 < bridge> <Solly> ^ doesnt mtter am curiopus tho
08:42 < bridge> <Solly> ^ doesnt mtter am curious tho
08:42 < bridge> <hectavoxel> im pretty sure it compresses it in a way where it doesnt have any visible compression artifacts, so it removes high freq detail n cral
08:42 < bridge> <hectavoxel> im pretty sure it compresses it in a way where it doesnt have any visible compression artifacts, so it removes high freq detail n crap
08:43 < bridge> <Solly> see the tom scot video which probably uses x265
08:43 < bridge> <Solly> it can go really low quality

09:13 < bridge> <Solly> i found them
09:13 < bridge> <Solly> dw
09:46 < bridge> <Assa> because it's currently topic at my work, what if I hit ddnet with a dsgvo/gdpr "give me all data you have about me" thingy? I don't think we have something in place for this
09:48 < bridge> <Assa> and don't think that ddnet has no personal data at all, like IP addresses in the logs, comments at the forum, the wiki, ...
09:57 < bridge> <Solly> the forumn and wiki probably have ways to query the database
09:57 < bridge> <Solly> which are known cuz they use
09:57 < bridge> <Solly> things everyone else uses
09:58 < bridge> <Assa> and server logs?
10:04 < bridge> <Solly> thatas not a thing everyone uses
10:04 < bridge> <Solly> but is queryable
10:12 < bridge> <Assa> as long as it doesn't involve "private" data of other users
10:12 < bridge> <Assa> then you need to start with redactions 💀
10:12 < bridge> <Solly> ono
10:13 < bridge> <Assa> It's not, that I want to do that, just warn you of a potential future problem
10:13 < bridge> <Solly> i see
10:13 < bridge> <Solly> i steer away from anything sql
10:13 < bridge> <Solly> or server side
10:14 < bridge> <Assa> might make sense, to have a small script in place somewhere to do that on demand
10:14 < bridge> <Solly> sed s/i forgot how to do regexes i might juse use js/REDACTED/
10:14 < bridge> <Solly> sed s/i forgot how to do regexes i might just use js/REDACTED/
10:15 < bridge> <Assa> I don't know, if we have logs that correlate to other users, except chats
10:15 < bridge> <Solly> do  ddnet srvs keep whispors?
10:15 < bridge> <Assa> I mean probably
10:15 < bridge> <Solly> ghasp
10:15 < bridge> <Assa> probably
10:15 < bridge> <Solly> i put my discord name in them
10:15 < bridge> <Solly> !!!
10:16 < bridge> <Assa> they are deep in the logs, and if you didn't do that recently, this is probably already deleted
10:21 < bridge> <totar> I don't think they do unless it's in the antibot module
10:22 < bridge> <totar> I don't think they do unless it's in the secret antibot module
10:22 < bridge> <Assa> they are at least processed, don't we have a bad-word module retracting insults already in place?
10:40 < bridge> <Assa> at least from checking the code I conclude, that everything gets logged. From chats, to servermessages, to broadcasts, chat commands, console commands, ...

10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @tsfreddie I probably asked you this before, but do we _ever_ need to support not enabling HiDPI support?
10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like when does it make sense to disable it
10:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. in winit you cannot disable it afaik
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @patiga here you see the problem I mentioned about SDL being stupid for giving resolutions in logical pixels, especially not as float.
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the aspect ratios are just weird with a scaling of like 1.75%
10:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>

10:50 < bridge> <patiga> ouch :/
10:50 < bridge> <oxyzo.> god
11:22 < bridge> <patiga> I thought with the new change we now use the canvas size / winit physical size to do the calculation. Did I switch them up there too? (grrr sdl2)
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> SDL only reports the logical size in the video modes (which itself already is questionable if this list is _mostly_ intersting for fullscreen)
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> additionally in fullscreen under wayland there is no real way to get the correct canvas size, since the DPI value is not known and the docs of https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/SDL_GetDisplayDPI say :
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> > WARNING: This reports the DPI that the hardware reports, and it is not always reliable! It is almost always better to use SDL_GetWindowSize() to find the window size, which might be in logical points instead of pixels, and then SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize(), SDL_Vulkan_GetDrawableSize(), SDL_Metal_GetDrawableSize(), or SDL_GetRendererOutputSize(), and compare the two values to get an actual scaling value between the two. We will be rethinking how 
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Which does not make me confident to use it.. The GetDrawableSize is defs wrong on wayland in fullscreen xD
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno which is better to use
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think SDL is simply bad here
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> On winit i'd use the canvas size
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> (simply bcs it's u32 and not a float)
11:28 < bridge> <patiga> ah, getwindowsize is only available for the actual current window, that is when you 'selected' a video mode
11:28 < bridge> <patiga> no
11:29 < bridge> <patiga> I mean getdrawablesize
11:29 < bridge> <patiga> that is definitely awkward
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, but apparently winit can fetch it ahead
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and SDL3 also includes the DPI value in the video mode
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so I assume SDL2 is simply limited in this regard
11:31 < bridge> <patiga> with the window size / logical size as float?
11:31 < bridge> <learath2> Server logs would be rather hard to share since most lines do not contain any ip info.
11:31 < bridge> <learath2> 
11:31 < bridge> <learath2> To be honest, I am not even sure how best to not give out someone elses PII (if server logs can be considered PII), since the only thing they can give us is a name, which could be faked (either by the requester or by someone else ingame).
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think not. that confused me too xDD
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe they are not confident using a 32-bit float
11:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> winit also uses 64-bit
11:33 < bridge> <patiga> yea, they should worry when I turn up with my 4000K monitor
11:33 < bridge> <learath2> Nonono, we don't log them ever. The only way anyone ever sees your whispers is if we are running an active packet capture
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_DisplayMode
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> >  int w;                          /**< width */
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> >     int h;                          /**< height */
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> >     float pixel_density;            /**< scale converting size to pixels (e.g. a 1920x1080 mode with 2.0 scale would have 3840x2160 pixels) */
11:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the fact they just call it width and height in the comment already sucks xD
11:34 < bridge> <patiga> they always only give the easiest example for scaling, crazy
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's just insane that they struggle so much with it. Besides `PhysicalSize` is maybe sometimes ambigious, generally winit does a much better job naming stuff so that it's easy to understand just from the names already
11:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's just insane that they struggle so much with it. Besides `PhysicalSize` is maybe sometimes ambiguous, generally winit does a much better job naming stuff so that it's easy to understand just from the names already
11:36 < bridge> <patiga> I suppose they have the advantage of being the newer system ^^
11:36 < bridge> <patiga> though I probably messed some of that stuff up in map-inspect-web in twgpu
11:37 < bridge> <patiga> But that project was also a struggle coz winit wasn't able to send resize events in the web yet, I think it does now
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but I thought SDL3 would break everything anyway, could at least fix such stuff xD
11:37 < bridge> <patiga> The other struggle was that I got no clue about html/css, and couldn't replicate the perfect fullscreen mode that ddnet's preview manages
11:38 < bridge> <patiga> I kinda hope we understand something wrong when it comes to that in sdl3, else it would honestly be kinda sad
11:38 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Did I add hidpi toggle? I don't remember. I only remember the res thing.
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah you didn't indeed, but since u tested highdpi most, maybe u remember smth xd
11:40 < bridge> <learath2> Seems it was me who added it. I think it was fixing "fixing" something. Probably that one weird bug with the clip rects being wrong for whatever reason
11:40 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Right
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah true, before tsfreddie fixed that we defs got that wrong
11:40 < bridge> <learath2> Perhaps we no longer need it because we are doing something else "more correctly" now
11:40 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Macos was weird at the time
11:41 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Also I don't even have a Mac anymore. So I probably don't really have any input about hidpi now
11:42 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Windows does it silently, app won't know (at least resolution wise) so it doesn't really matter for windows. I don't know enough Linux.
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on windows we enabled highdpi awareness anyway. i think this kinda makes window size = canvas size or smth.. can't remember correctly
11:44 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Exactly, even if user force disable hidpi, window size still is just canvas size. Windows will just tell the game that it has a smaller screen
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> > I don't know enough Linux.
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> x11 defs has no support for this stuff, at least not on a standard level.
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wayland generally works, fullscreen now looks blurry bcs the videomodes have no DPI value
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I am defs interested what apple silicon reports for pWidth and pCurrentWidth after these calls:
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9853/files#diff-442d7485882d4f383630c81a7061d34995210d7f694acf5eae9366d85a9f66e9R1251-R1258
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In fullscreen & windowed.
11:46 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I don't really want to know either cuz I'm not fixing it:kek: :kek: :kek:
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 🫠
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I hope @ryozuki fixes it 😏
11:48 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I'll be rooting for you guys <a:vibe:1191801470945869927>
11:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> you know what i want to fix?
11:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> ddnet-rs on nix -.-
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> At least clap for us
11:48 < bridge> <TsPiggy> 👏 :gdclap: <a:blobclap:1073117766304940042> <a:animated_clapping:858209363373981707> <a👏1276155135617273857>
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you explain the problem as if i am 5, i might be able to help
11:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> crate patches makes nix go un poco loco
11:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> so i might patch the patch to not use the patch
11:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> :Pepega:
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So it's really just about the ffmpeg stuff?
11:49 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Why would ddnet-rs care about nix tho.
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what happens if you simply leave the ffmpeg feature off?
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nix users care about ddnet-rs
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :deen_star:
11:50 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Ye but I thought it would need to be done on the nix side. It's a weird scheme to do.
11:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> look at it that ways
11:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> nix refuses to function properly because of a patch
11:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> so i use nix to patch ddnet-rs so nix fixes itself
11:50 < bridge> <TsPiggy> That sounds about right
11:51 < bridge> <meloƞ> lemme check without ffmpeg
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wow bincode 2 officially released now
11:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> still waiting for an answer :c
11:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348971937149358080/image.png?ex=67d16784&is=67d01604&hm=efa2fcd1f73cac0ea66b2b52bb890005d0b37e255a506cd65fc1e1913498af9a&
11:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> nix forum useless gg
11:53 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Although tbf if ddnet-rs is also just nix ppl it might be not that different doing on either side. Cuz you aren't wasting ddnet-rs's limited human resources
11:53 < bridge> <TsPiggy> So basically melon could just do whatever he feels like :kek:
11:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> :p true
11:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> in a perfect world i would like nix-run to function properly
11:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> :(
11:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> in perfect world you die from working 20hrs a day.
11:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> imagine how cool it would be
11:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
11:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> "hey freddie wanna join us in mapping ??"
11:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
11:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> oh sure!
11:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
11:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> nix run nixpkgs#ddnet-rs
11:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> (there's a Chinese company called perfect world)
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh yeah what an utopia
11:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> My friend keep sharing his clock out screen at 1am
11:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> TELL ME WHICH ONE YOU DUFUS
11:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348972867550711818/image.png?ex=67d16862&is=67d016e2&hm=bf8f069bedc51f6976cb97d32ca60226f07e97059da355595359f2186fa008f1&
11:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😮 what does that mean?
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you need to link all x11 stuff manually?
11:57 < bridge> <oxyzo.> its one of them
11:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Nix put it's library in weird places and hacks linker to find them
11:57 < bridge> <meloƞ> 95% is handled by pkg-config tbh
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah gg
11:58 < bridge> <TsPiggy> lots of things don't use pkg-config tho
11:58 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I still haven't be able to build Godot and run it
11:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> lets see if i just put in 3GB of X11 shit
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like the arch maintainer that ignored my request to fix their pkg-config for vulkan library
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> still salty every time i think about it
11:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> maybe it fixes itself through that and everyone trying to run ddnet-rs on nix will send me death threats
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he is the single reason i prefer debian over arch
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
11:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> "why on earth is ddnet-rs 6gb ????"
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> only 6gb?
11:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> just the dependencies ofc
11:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> 🤷
11:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> should i try to help
11:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i mean i am on nix pill rn
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dunno why but the release binary on gh actions is already 200MB XD
12:00 < bridge> <oxyzo.> 64k ultra hd twinbop skin
12:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> you're on the pill?
12:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> oh baBY
12:00 < bridge> <TsPiggy> but i haven't done anything nixpkgs related tho
12:00 < bridge> <TsPiggy> <a:InsaneCat:1135575687172980866>
12:00 < bridge> <pro_gaming1921> smash
12:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> i mean wayland still seems borked for ddnet-rs - but it runs fine if i dont try to switch monitors...
12:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> not sure how you could help, you could help me pin the X11 libs missing to run with wayland fully disabled
12:01 < bridge> <TsPiggy> on second thought
12:01 < bridge> <TsPiggy> probably i can't
12:01 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i'm late on chn april fools stuff
12:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> my flake is here if you wanna have a look:
12:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
12:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs-misc/pull/2
12:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> 😢
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oh no a new egui version dropped
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> smth will randomly break again in the UI 😂
12:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> letsgooo!!!
12:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> reminder that i pinned everything to master in my flake, so it expects everything to be up to date ay? <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Does nix even ignore cargo.lock or what xD
12:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> normally that file determines which version is used
12:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> cargo2nix generates their "own" cargo.nix file :Pepega:
12:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> > are you fine with me putting this as draft?
12:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> 
12:05 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i've never seen people ask that
12:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> some people are fine with drafts, some people want it closed
12:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> better safe than sorry, scared of jupsti kicking me out !
12:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:  what does closed do anything
12:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> it would tell everyone that i failed
12:06 < bridge> <meloƞ> 😢
12:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i still didn't figure out how to rerequest on godot
12:07 < bridge> <meloƞ> not sure if git allows you to rerequest a review tbh
12:07 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i wonder how any PR with back and forth worked in godot
12:07 < bridge> <meloƞ> some cli magic maybe
12:10 < bridge> <learath2> When use an actually good distro like Gentoo?
12:11 < bridge> <learath2> There must be a way because I saw metamuffin rerequest a review on the godot repo live
12:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> i tried Gentoo, didnt like its spirit, went back to nix where everything is pure drama
12:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> maybe i just wait for milkeey to finally make his own distro -.-
12:12 < bridge> <TsPiggy> who's that
12:12 < bridge> <learath2> A person
12:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> metamuffin is a legend
12:12 < bridge> <TsPiggy> maybe they have write/triage access already
12:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> @jupeyy_keks FyI - this is the exact error i get when trying to build using nix
12:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348976995509338142/image.png?ex=67d16c3a&is=67d01aba&hm=aef302474973dece6dc8ed33309b9a0e54cb9dd5f6f0172cbedca72423ed07af&
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even without ffmpeg?
12:13 < bridge> <meloƞ> yed
12:13 < bridge> <meloƞ> yessir
12:13 < bridge> <meloƞ> i guess it evaluates everything and ignores if its used or not
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok it is not able to load my github repo
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can try to replace `branch = ` with `rev = `
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe that helps
12:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> :o - that would be interesting to know
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but the other caused by i don't understand
12:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'll try to update all deps, maybe that magically helps
12:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> <3
12:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> (or breaks everything)
12:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
12:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it will build but crash everywhere
12:16 < bridge> <meloƞ> maybe i shouldnt use naersk... i'll see if that is a cause
12:17 < bridge> <learath2> The spirit of freedom and liberty? The unbounded flexibility?
12:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> can i `archinstall` click through 10 windows and have a running OS ?
12:17 < bridge> <meloƞ> can i `nixos-rebuild switch /etc/nixos` and have my system at the state i left it 3 years ago???
12:18 < bridge> <learath2> Don't be doing that. It lowers your linux skills
12:18 < bridge> <learath2> Embrace the future. You don't need 3 year old system state
12:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> i mean i could setup arch using the CLI without a script within like.. 15-30 minutes
12:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> i actually once tried using Gentoo but the readme made my head hurt so i stopped xD
12:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> i actually once tried using Gentoo but the wiki made my head hurt so i stopped xD
12:19 < bridge> <learath2> Soon you won't be able to. You'll be asking where are my gui buttons weeeee
12:20 < bridge> <learath2> Oh cmon the handbook is excellent. Perhaps the only source of linux info online except the archwiki
12:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> exactly, so much information in such a short amount of time
12:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> my head cant handle
12:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> :angy:
12:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> god 5!!!! deps arent available in nix yet so they need their own hashes :reeeee:

12:31 < bridge> <TsPiggy> wtf
12:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> alteast its a good training in vim keybinds <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
12:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> > nix has the biggest number of packages
12:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> 
12:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> > half of them are pip cargo and vscode-extensions
12:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> 🤷
12:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> i understand ffmpeg-sys-next, its jupstis repo
12:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
12:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> but egui-notify?? really?
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they are not available bcs they are loaded from github instead of crates.io
12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why the fck can nix not deal with that
12:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> HA FLIP YOU i forced nix to be more explicit
12:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> "spurious network error failed to resolve address for github.com: Temporary failure in name resolution;
12:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
12:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> in ffmpeg-sys
12:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> so i guess it really is because its branch= and not rev=
12:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> kinda sounds like a dns problem xD

12:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> hm maybe i can run it outside the sandbox
12:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> nix moment
12:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> mwuhahah that works
12:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> `nix run --option sandbox false` runs it <a:catkiss:1199448915410423988>
12:44 < bridge> <TsPiggy> didn't know nix run does sandbox
12:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> nix sandboxes.. everything
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> it doesnt sandbox the kernel
12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> 🤓
12:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> 🤓
12:46 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:
12:46 < bridge> <TsPiggy> wdym
12:46 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i don't see nix blocking filesystem access like flatpak does
12:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> every nix run, nix build, nix develop is sandboxed to ensure reproducibility
12:47 < bridge> <TsPiggy> is sandbox in nix just means every envs and stores
12:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> > It is achieved by isolating build jobs from input sources whose contents are prone to change dynamically and without notice. For example, the main2 file system hierarchy is completely bypassed to prevent depending on files in global directories, such as /usr/bin, where a reference to an executable may point to different version as time goes by.
12:48 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ye so it's just a versioning thing
12:48 < bridge> <TsPiggy> cuz nix run nixpkgs#ddnet still puts config in my .config that's not how i describe sandbox usually
12:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> its about the build process itself, not the final product ig
12:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
12:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> you can nix run a program that runs rm -rf on your home directory ig

12:51 < bridge> <TsPiggy> user might be confused tbh. building under a defined env is more like container than sandbox but i guess the word container is ruined by docker now
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u ever need to use python
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i recommend uv
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> best tool
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/astral-sh/uv
12:52 < bridge> <Solly> I thought this was a pip wrapper
12:52 < bridge> <Solly> Pip is so slow
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> it is all
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> a package manager
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> a env manager
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> a tool manager
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> uv ruff
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> ruff is also the best
12:53 < bridge> <Solly> Is it dropin for pip and venv
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff
12:53 < bridge> <Solly> That's all I care about
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> it has support for venv and pip
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Vulkan 1.4 epyc
12:53 < bridge> <Solly> I want to get rid of pip
12:53 < bridge> <Solly> It's slow
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> uv venv
12:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> 🚀
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> well im not gonna repeat myself again
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> it has its own better system than pip
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> uv add yourmom
12:54 < bridge> <Solly> You said supports pip
12:54 < bridge> <Solly> Does it wrap or implement it
12:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> ⚡️ 10-100x faster than pip.
12:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> it implements a pip interface under uv pip
12:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it also has its own deps system

12:59 < bridge> <Solly> Listing packages takes like 10s
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice, just wondering, does the subdir matter?
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like does nix just find it or how does it work
13:10 < bridge> <zhn> wiki and forum have gdpr related things afaik, don't know if we keep chat logs as is
13:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> there are multiple ways to specify that
13:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> most people use a .envrc where you just say `use misc/flake`
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok i was just wondering if you want to put it into a subdir called nixos or smth, so in future you can more easily add nix-related stuff
13:23 < bridge> <dukooooooo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348994835541135460/image.png?ex=67d17cd7&is=67d02b57&hm=844db993e02fd4c28a4d6c78da7af9f17d457ddd779c2a8bce09ac96e7e5d2ef&
13:23 < bridge> <dukooooooo> its empty why?
13:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> there wont be any more nix related stuff really
13:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> a single flake.nix can be extended to hold everything nix related
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
13:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> flake.lock and other directories should be gitignored
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no pictures or smth 😬

14:37 < bridge> <0xdeen> @thekid36 Thanks! ^
14:43 < bridge> <kebscs> #9812 is ready for review/merge 🙂
14:43 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9812
14:54 < furo> @murpi The "Soup" servers you banned last time seem to be back on a new IP and they're still filled with "(connecting)" players. While at it, could you also take a look at "Multeasymap Turkey" and "EatNet Multimap Turkey"? They're filled with AFK/Fake players and have been for months.
15:04 < bridge> <Solly> Yeah they're always full but no one ever moves D:
15:29 < bridge> <Solly> @kebscs does this clear keys pressed then held using chat?
15:29 < bridge> <Solly> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9844
15:31 < bridge> <kebscs> wdym?
15:31 < bridge> <kebscs> if you hold key, alt tab, release and come back to game
15:31 < bridge> <kebscs> then key wont be held
15:31 < bridge> <Solly> That's undesired behaviour for me
15:31 < bridge> <kebscs> at least in menus
15:32 < bridge> <kebscs> why?
15:32 < bridge> <Solly> Because I often hold things down using the chat bug
15:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Chat bug?
15:32 < bridge> <Solly> And alt tabbing (changing desktop) often
15:32 < bridge> <Solly> Hold key, open chat, let go of key , close chat key is still held
15:33 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I think it's basically intended behavior, and I personally prefer using my `say /pause` bind instead of my chat bind to hold inputs
15:33 < bridge> <kebscs> this still works
15:33 < bridge> <kebscs> it only fixes alt tab
15:33 < bridge> <Solly> But do the keys then get unheld on unfocus
15:33 < bridge> <kebscs> no
15:33 < bridge> <Solly> That's fine then
15:34 < bridge> <Solly> ❤️
15:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you can do the same by spectating
15:35 < bridge> <Solly> Many things do it
15:35 < bridge> <Solly> I just wanted to know if keys held down like that are then let go
18:05 < bridge> <louis> i feel like this is true, but at the same time some of the features are pretty nice
18:06 < bridge> <louis> just needs better testing i guess
18:06 < bridge> <louis> seems like most RC periods don't really find the bugs that really matter
18:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki do you like the new match ergonomics?
18:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/edition-guide/rust-2024/match-ergonomics.html
18:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it kinda feels more annoying to use imo
18:16 < bridge> <zhn> microsoft rewrote typescript in go kekw
18:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Are there typescript implementations in typescript? I bet there are
18:21 < bridge> <TsPiggy> tsc is indeed written in typescript
18:22 < bridge> <TsPiggy> There isn't any fully compatible native typechecker:justatest:
18:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> its ok, i think they have plans for future
18:42 < bridge> <kebscs> I feel like 19.0.1 could have been a thing
18:42 < bridge> <kebscs> Like 5 different crashes fixed just few days after 19.0 release
19:30 < bridge> <teero777> building ladybird. lets hope its good
19:38 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> haha @teero777 
19:38 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> not sure what your definition of good is but i doubt it can really compete with firefox yet they didnt even release yet did they?
19:39 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i watch the devlog on yt sometimes it looks cool and all but very much WIP
19:39 < bridge> <teero777> they want to release an alpha 2026
19:40 < bridge> <teero777> As long as it is somehow usable I can just submit prs for things I need xdd
19:40 < bridge> <teero777> Or just make a fork
19:59 < bridge> <teero777> its not done building yet :(
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> i know someone who gets paid to work on it full time, i could redirect questions if u need
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> if you plan on messing with it. it’s very c++. and uses no STL
20:00 < bridge> <Ewan> so it’s kind of a weird codebase
20:17 < bridge> <teero777> it is still compiling....
20:18 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah

20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> windows is a very difficult target if you’re not using the STL
20:20 < bridge> <teero777> > Andreas was most comfortable with C++ when creating SerenityOS, and now we have almost half a million lines of modern C++ to maintain.
20:20 < bridge> <Ewan> to maintain in parallel at least
20:20 < bridge> <teero777> half a million wtf
20:20 < bridge> <teero777> ah wait its not that much

20:40 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> but half a million is :D 
20:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> million sounds so extreme
20:40 < bridge> <teero777> 1000 thousand isnt that much xd
20:41 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> u also buy stuff in the supermarket for 9.99 just because its less than 10 bucks huh?

20:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> you never talked to chiller teero?
20:54 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki ok sounds funni but i dont get the context of the gif xd
20:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what's what xd?
20:56 < bridge> <teero777> where
20:56 < bridge> <teero777> no
20:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> skill issue, i once talked with chiller and jupsti back when almost noone knew about ddnet-rs :Pepega:
20:56 < bridge> <teero777> how
20:57 < bridge> <teero777> i wanna meet the biggest youtube ever
20:57 < bridge> <meloƞ> some weird online vc with screen share
20:57 < bridge> <meloƞ> it worked tho
20:58 < bridge> <teero777> show
20:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> i forgot name
20:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> ChillerDragon: show him
20:58 < bridge> <teero777> im downloading game, compiling ladybird and doing tas computation idk if my pc can handle anything
20:58 < bridge> <teero777> typing barely works
20:59 < bridge> <oxyzo.> download more pcs
20:59 < bridge> <teero777> wait
20:59 < bridge> <teero777> it just finished
20:59 < bridge> <teero777> YES
20:59 < bridge> <teero777> lets try ladybird
20:59 < bridge> <oxyzo.> finished what
20:59 < bridge> <teero777> @blaiszephyr come vc
20:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki how to get variant's value in your lang?
20:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> eating rn
21:05 < bridge> <negarxx> how can i report a player using a bot ?
21:05 < bridge> <oxyzo.> #✉-create-a-ticket
21:06 < bridge> <oxyzo.> goodluck waiting for a mod to respond:deen_star:
21:06 < bridge> <hectavoxel> ai mods
21:07 < bridge> <oxyzo.> upgrade to premium to get reponse 5x faster
21:07 < bridge> <oxyzo.> upgrade to premium to get response 5x faster
21:08 < bridge> <hectavoxel> Sorry, but as an AI model, I am unable to join a DDNet server! I will notify any online moderator for you and they will be able to join chat shortly to help you!
21:08 < bridge> <teero777> *promptly calls all mods on their landline*
21:10 < bridge> <hectavoxel> omg dude imagine getting a call at like 4 AM describing how someone was "anti-blocking" in multeasy
21:12 < bridge> <oxyzo.> and the ai will talk in gibberlink mode or whatever it is
21:13 < bridge> <hectavoxel> LOL IT USES THE SIRI TTS
21:13 < bridge> <hectavoxel> SO EVERY SPECIAL CHARACTERS GONNA BE LIKE
21:13 < bridge> <hectavoxel> "I am calling you because Gump... phhhhhu. uuuhuuuhuguu-"
21:15 < bridge> <Ewan> who the hell has a landline
21:17 < bridge> <teero777> in europe its common no`
21:17 < bridge> <teero777> in europe its common no?
21:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki btw, I don't remember if I already wrote it but this code panics
21:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```rust
21:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> mod foo {
21:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     pub fn main() -> i64 {
21:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         for (let mut i: i32 = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) {
21:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat>             let mut b: i8 = 0;
21:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat>             b = b + 1;
21:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         }
21:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 
21:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat>         return 0;
21:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat>     }
21:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> }
21:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```
21:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> cant yet if u mean the tag
21:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> it does? xd
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i couldn’t say, but funny if so
21:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki rust 2024 lints are still bit buggy 😬
21:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1349114566147051592/Bildschirmaufnahme_20250311_211857.webm?ex=67d1ec59&is=67d09ad9&hm=16aeb461d0a26a78c71e31726935e3324468d46c56a1d7b34723fbaaf60d4eee&
21:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:20 < bridge> <teero777> also looks a lot laggy xd
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think that is just the record
21:20 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Whah? I'm no Rust guy but this looks like it should trivially optimize to nothing? Is this like -O0 only?
21:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> he not talking about rust
21:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> its the lang im making xd
21:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh it just smells rusty to someone uncultured like me
21:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> u cant do a for loop like that in rust
21:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> rust ordered from temu
21:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> can't write normal for loops 💀
21:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> what even is Rust
21:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> is this like one of those "you need to have an iterator because that's cooler" things
21:23 < bridge> <teero777> `for i in 0..10`
21:23 < bridge> <teero777> would be a rust loop
21:23 < bridge> <teero777> looks nice tbh
21:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok tbf I do really like that
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> that operator is used for more than loops as well
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> [..] will give u a complete slice into compatible containets
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> [..] will give u a complete slice into compatible containers
21:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah I imagine it just produces like some weird range object that I would have to read about to understand
21:25 < bridge> <Ewan> slices. and they’re cool
21:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> do you mean that indexing with a range gives you a slice, or is this just slice syntax and there's no actual range *thing* here
21:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> do you mean that indexing with a range gives you a slice, or is this just slice syntax and there's no actual range *thing* here?
21:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> cus it is
21:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> iterators are based in rust
21:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> if u need c like for loop use while loop
21:26 < bridge> <Ewan> u can have numbers on either end to specify range. lack of limits means the whole thing
21:26 < bridge> <Ewan> it gives u a slice
21:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> slices are just references with some metadata right?
21:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> .. is a Range
21:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> unbound range
21:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> for example pointer and length of the slice
21:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can use a range in a index
21:27 < bridge> <Ewan> references with rules ig, ryo can take over now
21:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> x[0..2]
21:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> x[0..]
21:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> 0..=2
21:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> usually to get a slice
21:28 < bridge> <Ewan> as slice
21:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok thamks for confirming my suspicion
21:28 < bridge> <Ewan> or smth
21:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> it may not be a slice
21:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> since u can implement the index trait
21:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> on ur struct
21:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
21:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Index.html
21:28 < bridge> <Ewan> ahh big brain
21:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
21:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> use std::ops::Index;
21:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
21:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> enum Nucleotide {

21:29 < bridge> <Ewan> traits > sketchy operator overloading
21:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> code bomb
21:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> robyt has been writing a bible
21:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> c++ bible?
21:29 < bridge> <Ewan> he’s ready for the full rust rewrite
21:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> chiller is this ur alt?

21:32 < bridge> <nameless_me> anyone know fokkonaut's github for F-DDrace? I see like 3 or 4 of them, which one is the most up to date? Thanks
21:33 < bridge> <robyt3> I'm not sure if a label is really useful for this. It's supposed to say that it's a lower priority issue that no maintainer/core dev is going to work on. But isn't that also already specified by nobody being assigned to the issue?
21:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace this?
21:34 < bridge> <nameless_me> thanks!
21:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> np
21:40 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki stop dox me
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What was the patch-accepted then for xd
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But honestly dunno what could be better
21:41 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @meloƞ josspit had the magic vc link. I think it was matrix related? But no accounts? it was really cool somehow
21:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> ikr
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://call.element.io/
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it is quite cool indeed
23:11 < bridge> <teero777> sadly i can't upload any videos anymore

23:11 < bridge> <teero777> this is the end guys
23:11 < bridge> <teero777> sorry
23:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Tf is that browser? Firefox 3.6?
23:12 < bridge> <teero777> ladybird xdd
23:12 < bridge> <teero777> lets just say it is very WIP
23:12 < bridge> <teero777> its super slow for me xd
23:12 < bridge> <teero777> maybe it didn't compile with optimization or smth idk
23:13 < bridge> <teero777> i get frequent crashes too
23:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I should try servo again. See if it's finally usable
23:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sounds like secure for a browser
23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 11/10 would recommend
23:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sounds really secure for a browser
23:14 < bridge> <totar> I mis spelled servo browser and accidently found this website http://www.serverbrowser.com/
23:14 < bridge> <totar> I miss spelled servo browser and accidently found this website http://www.serverbrowser.com/
23:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Does it have teeworlds? Xddd
23:15 < bridge> <totar> I wish
23:15 < bridge> <totar> I thought it might tbh
23:15 < bridge> <totar> I think it only supposed source game protocol
23:16 < bridge> <totar> I'm surprised such a nice domain is being used so generously
23:18 < bridge> <teero777> Is it an opensrc project?
23:18 < bridge> <totar> idk
23:18 < bridge> <teero777> Maybe your can pr the DDNet mastersrv code
23:19 < bridge> <totar> it has no info anywhere
23:19 < bridge> <teero777> No about section?
23:19 < bridge> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1349144710173823068/image.png?ex=67d2086c&is=67d0b6ec&hm=492ac55bbdaec480d9cc96305221475230bcc9db6c159c13b56fc7fb80df7274&
23:19 < bridge> <totar> send them a feedback xd
23:19 < bridge> <totar> the styling is so good
23:19 < bridge> <teero777> Yea I just found that
23:19 < bridge> <teero777> You could
23:21 < bridge> <louis> that's a really funny ui, don't see stuff like that much nowadays
23:21 < bridge> <totar> it's not easy to make a website look like this lol
23:25 < bridge> <louis> i mean not easy in the sense that no tutorials will show you how to style like this
23:25 < bridge> <teero777> It's way harder than a modern simplistic look xd
23:28 < bridge> <louis> i mean it does seem to sacrifice being reactive and such
23:29 < bridge> <louis> it does seem to sacrifice being reactive and such
23:29 < bridge> <totar> I think it's reactive enough
23:31 < bridge> <totar> ah I figured it out
23:31 < bridge> <totar> it's using Ext3 JS
23:31 < bridge> <totar> https://extjs.cachefly.net/ext-3.4.0/examples/
23:32 < bridge> <louis> so just an old framework xd
23:32 < bridge> <teero777> So it's easy again?
23:32 < bridge> <teero777> xdd
23:33 < bridge> <teero777> @totar do you think you could write a c compiler in c right now?
23:33 < bridge> <totar> no
23:33 < bridge> <teero777> ok
23:33 < bridge> <totar> I only know like 4 x86 instructions
23:33 < bridge> <teero777> Is that a bad interview task
23:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Compiler compiles to assembly right?
23:34 < bridge> <teero777> I only know the one and only important one
23:34 < bridge> <teero777> mov
23:34 < bridge> <totar> true
23:34 < bridge> <teero777> ye
23:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Insert Christoper dolman talk
23:34 < bridge> <totar> ^
23:35 < bridge> <teero777> idk how the compilers are so fast tbh
23:35 < bridge> <teero777> Parsing files sounds slow
23:35 < bridge> <totar> 40 years of optimization?
23:36 < bridge> <totar> also computers are fast
23:36 < bridge> <totar> but not all compilers are fast
23:36 < bridge> <nameless_me> hey chillerdragon, you've worked on F-DDrace before right? I have a question to ask, but I can't message you because you have turned yourself into an app
23:38 < bridge> <kebscs> how does strong hook even work?
23:39 < bridge> <kebscs> why does it drag when i set everyone's velocity to 0
23:39 < bridge> <teero777> **rust noises** but tbf rust does so much stuff at compile time xd
23:39 < bridge> <teero777> *rust noises* but tbf rust does so much stuff at compile time xd
23:40 < bridge> <teero777> Really? I don't think theyre hyper optimized right?
23:41 < bridge> <totar> well, 40 years of compiler optimization research, the bad ideas get thrown away and the good ones get kept
23:41 < bridge> <teero777> hmm I guess that makes it fast
23:41 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1349150320994816101/196-wu6a98.jpg?ex=67d20da6&is=67d0bc26&hm=6ac42c9addeea70952eda76e2fdd666c01085ca071a38ca68a553f9f6911c6cf&
23:41 < bridge> <teero777> @totar kitchen reference
23:41 < bridge> <totar> can your CPU bake sourdough
23:42 < bridge> <teero777> today it could
23:42 < bridge> <teero777> I was compiling ladybird, running tas thingies and downloading a game. Discord was half dead
23:45 < bridge> <teero777> today it could have
23:45 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks ngl I think the best way to vc with chiller is through ddpg xdd
23:46 < bridge> <totar> ddpg doesn't have 0.7 tho, will he use it?
23:46 < bridge> <teero777> hmmm
23:47 < bridge> <teero777> Okay we need 0.7 chillerbot compat layer ig
23:47 < bridge> <teero777> You actually have to work to talk to chiller
23:47 < bridge> <totar> imagine ddpg gets 0.7 before 0.6 :kek:
23:47 < bridge> <teero777> xD
23:47 < bridge> <kebscs> why does it drag when i set everyone's velocity to 0
23:47 < bridge> <kebscs> nvm, character tick of dragger updates the other tee velocity in own tick
23:48 < bridge> <teero777> 0.7 will need to implement the spatial vc tho xd
23:48 < bridge> <teero777> It's not like the server can magically suck chillers voice out of the cable
23:48 < bridge> <teero777> Maybe it can
23:48 < bridge> <teero777> Idk what jupsti cooked
23:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @nameless_me: don’t ask to ask just ask
23:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can only dm me on other platforms than discord but you can just write teeworlds related questions in this channel it’s on topic
23:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also you can dm fokkonaut if you need DMs
23:52 < bridge> <teero777> chiller when do we get a irc conn to your brain
23:52 < bridge> <teero777> I wanna see what's going on there
23:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not much tbh
