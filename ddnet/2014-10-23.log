00:40 <@deen> run with: gdb ./DDNet_d
00:40 <@deen> and then run
00:40 <@deen> want to see the backtrace
00:40 < KinG_> http://8pic.ir/images/rk03cld9vavppagxpiqw.png
00:40 < KinG_> :D
00:41 <@deen> KinG_: settings -> graphics -> high quality textures
00:41 <@deen> then your tees look better
00:44 < laxa> ok I go to sleep, cya
00:44 < DoNe> cya
00:44 <@deen> bye laxa 
00:44 < KinG_> bye laxa 
00:44 < KinG_> deen:  kobra3 solo? :|
00:44 <@deen> yes, it's released
00:45 < KinG_> deen:  when i check the quality textures and i restart client it's unchecked again
00:45 < KinG_> i guess it's a bug try it urself
00:45 <@deen> it works for me
00:46 <@deen> maybe you have something in your autoexec.cfg
00:46 <@deen> try to clean it
00:47 < KinG_> sv_name "Testserver with DDraceNetwork Features" sv_port 8303 sv_map "gravity" sv_test_cmds 1 # set to 0 for DDraceNetwork game type sv_rcon_password "rcon" sv_register 1
00:47 < KinG_> this is autoexec.cfg :|
00:47 < KinG_> default things
00:47 <@deen> ok, looks fine
00:47 <@deen> weird
00:47 <@deen> maybe you just have too many skins
00:48 < KinG_> and
00:48 < KinG_> just default skins
00:48 < KinG_> ..
00:48 < KinG_> this is a newly downloaded client
00:50 < DoNe> http://pastebin.com/KkaQBVfe
00:50 <@deen> ouch
00:50 <@deen> type bt
00:50 <@deen> and make a bugreport on github if you don't want to fix it
00:51 <@deen> i'm currently busy with other stuff
00:51 < DoNe> k
00:57 <@deen> DoNe: i hope Rollercoaster is finished
00:58 <@deen> Tournament this Saturday + Sunday
00:58 < DoNe> it was finished last time u saw it
00:58 < DoNe> 2 days?
00:58 <@deen> your map on Saturday
00:58 <@deen> other map on Sunday
00:58 < DoNe> ah cool
00:58 <@deen> because they are both solo
00:58 <@deen> and yours is easier, so it comes first^^
00:59 < DoNe> should i ask saavik to look over the map a last time?
00:59 <@deen> would be good, yes
00:59 <@deen> i want to do the same as well
00:59 <@deen> but need to announce tournament first
00:59 < DoNe> k
01:01 <@deen> 30 minutes are enough for Rollercoaster?
01:01 <@deen> i think after 1 hour many would get bored, right, DoNe ?
01:01 < DoNe> dunno if people go crazy with speedrunning
01:01 <@deen> ah, let me try
01:01 <@deen> i'll play the map now and see when i get bored
01:01 <@deen> then that's the tournament time :P
01:01 < DoNe> haha
01:01 < DoNe> wish u fun to play it for 30 mins
01:02 <@deen> and my time will be better than all others in tournament!
01:02 < DoNe> you will take part?
01:02 <@deen> no
01:02 < DoNe> ah i got it
01:02 < DoNe> could we do 45 min?
01:02 <@deen> let's see how long i'm interested
01:03 <@deen> but i won't play on your local server, too laggy :P
01:03 < DoNe> setup a nuclear if you want
01:03 <@deen> nono, my own local server
01:03 < DoNe> gonna send map in skype
01:03 <@deen> i have it alraedy :P
01:03 < DoNe> i want to spec u
01:04 <@deen> no
01:04 < DoNe> ah u got the map
01:05 <@deen> the map is hard without zooming out^^
01:05 < DoNe> you will need more tries to learn it
01:05 < DoNe> its kinda trial and error
01:07 < DoNe> eur, ger and ger2?
01:07 < DoNe> all that new servers
01:08 < Nimda> DDNet GER went back online!
01:19 <@deen> DoNe: servers for testing purposes
01:19 < DoNe> okay
01:22 < KinG_> DoNe: how can i make a 3D background?!
01:22 < DoNe> what?
01:23 < KinG_> a 3D background for a map
01:23 < DoNe> if your monitor supports 3D
01:23 < DoNe> xD
01:23 < KinG_> not like that 
01:23 < DoNe> like what
01:24 < DoNe> what do u mean with 3D bg?
01:24 < KinG_> the background of map is 3D no matter if your monitor support it or not like it turns around and makes you feel that the map is 3D :D
01:25 < KinG_> DoNe:  want to test my map?
01:25 < DoNe> okay
01:26 < KinG_> irn.ddnet.tw:8202
01:27 < DoNe> pw?
01:27 <@deen> 1 min 1 second!
01:27 < DoNe> i had 1 min 3 seconds
01:27 <@deen> it's annoying to kill always
01:28 <@deen> and go back to start
01:28 < KinG_> u have the pw DoNe ?
01:28 < DoNe> at the first part?
01:28 < DoNe> no i dont KinG_ 
01:28 < KinG_> persnuke
01:29 <@deen> DoNe: yes
01:30 < DoNe> make time reset when hitting start tiles in team 3
01:30 < DoNe> sv_team 3
01:30 <@deen> no
01:31 <@deen> many solo maps are cheatable like this
01:31 <@deen> you can get weapon and go back to start
01:32 < DoNe> ah
01:32 < DoNe> should i tele you to kill?
01:32 < DoNe> when you fail in first part?
01:32 <@deen> but then you still have to go to first part from start
01:32 <@deen> hmmmm
01:32 <@deen> the spawn points are set that you have to move so far
01:33 <@deen> maybe we can just not use sv_team 3 and instead use sv_team 0
01:33 < DoNe> what would do that?
01:33 <@deen> then time is reset
01:33 <@deen> everyone is in team 
01:33 <@deen> 0
01:33 <@deen> and we still set collision 0 and hook 0
01:33 <@deen> there are no swithces in the map, so it doesn't matter
01:34 < DoNe> okay good
01:34 < DoNe> did i placed the checkpoints right?
01:35 < DoNe> never used them
01:35 <@deen> yes
01:35 < DoNe> i hope people will like the map 
01:36 < DoNe> how long u wanna run tournament?
01:36 <@deen> i'm still playing
01:39 <@deen> ha!
01:39 <@deen> 01:01.36
01:41 < DoNe> i bet no1 will get under 1 min
01:42 <@deen> i had 01:01 5 times now^^
01:42 < KinG_> DoNe:  i don't have kobra3 solo :D w8 to download then change the map :P
01:43 < DoNe> :D
01:43 < KinG_> or maybe i can just download it from vps :P
01:43 < KinG_> much faster :P
01:43 < DoNe> why u dont change map only?
01:44 < KinG_> idk
01:45 < KinG_> speed 16 bytes great!!
01:47 <@deen> ha!
01:47 <@deen> 01:00.94

01:54 < DoNe> KinG_: dont know
01:58 < KinG_> DoNe:  i have a .js file which i use node to excute in my computer but to do it in linux what should i do?!
01:58 <@deen> shit!
01:58 <@deen> nearly got 00:59
01:59 < KinG_> deen i have a .js file which i use node to excute in my computer but to do it in linux what should i do?!
01:59 <@deen> no idea
01:59 < KinG_> ^_^
01:59 < DoNe> deen that means its able to do the map in under 1 minute?
02:00 <@deen> yes
02:01 <@deen> also, I've been playing non-stop for 57 minutes
02:01 <@deen> and it's still fun
02:01 <@deen> great map
02:01 < DoNe> :)
02:03 <@deen> so, can we set it for 1 hour?
02:03 < DoNe> yes
02:03 <@deen> i needed 30 minutes just to get a feel
02:03 <@deen> then every time was 01:01 or 01:02
02:03 <@deen> should be really close in tournament ;)
02:03 < DoNe> ich konnte das nicht einschätzen weil ich die map gemacht habe
02:04 < DoNe> ich hatte das feeling schon als ich das erste mal probiert hab schnell zu sein
02:04 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=545
02:05 < DoNe> looking forward to this 
02:05 < DoNe> bye
02:05 <@deen> bye
02:09 < KinG_> deen:  why should i recieve permission deny when i'm usning root username? :|
02:09 <@deen> what for?
02:09 < KinG_> home/bor/king
02:10 < KinG_> check
02:10 <@deen> i don't know what you're doing
02:10 < KinG_> i want to use console to use the ".js" file :|
02:11 <@deen> i installed nodejs
02:11 <@deen> type "nodejs send.js blabla"
02:12 < KinG_> oh tnx :X
02:12 <@deen> installed it with "apt-get install nodejs"
02:13 < KinG_> i didn't know that .. :(
02:13 < KinG_> u know the bug to restart vpses that have win server 2003?
02:14 < KinG_> ever heard of RDP gremline deen ?
02:14 <@deen> no
02:14 < KinG_> see the code for send.js
02:15 <@deen> wtf...
02:15 < KinG_> it sends the line to port 3389 and boom vps is down
02:15 <@deen> why are you running that kind of stuff on ddnet servers...
02:15 < KinG_> not running
02:16 < KinG_> just wanted to know how it works on linux :P i deleted it already :P
02:16 <@deen> ok
02:17 < KinG_> it's not that important only win server 2003 have the bug and most of users update it so there is no bug and the very basic packet protecting things or firewall can block it very easily :P
02:17 < KinG_> i go to sleep bye all
02:17 <@deen> bye
02:18 < eeeee> breaking news: windows has a bug
02:18 <@deen> 11 years old, and people still run it on servers
02:19 < eeeee> they call such things "time proven" i believe :D
03:30 < cris272> it's not a bug, it's probably a feature

11:55 < KinG_> hi all
11:55 < KinG_> EastByte:  u here?!
11:58 < pause> Hello all
11:59 < pause> !de-en klang
11:59 < Nimda> Translation: sound
11:59 < pause> !de-en herz
11:59 < Nimda> Translation: heart
11:59 < pause> Makes sense
12:10 <@deen> hi
12:22 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] cinaera opened pull request #78: Fix several bugs for ingame sounds (DDRace64...pr_modulo) http://git.io/8d3V4A
12:25 < EastByte> hello
12:25 < EastByte> KinG_: I'm here
12:25 < KinG_> EastByte: i just made the thing we talked about last night but it doesn't store it in memory but reads it
12:26 < EastByte> so how is the reading done?
12:27 < KinG_> http://uptobox.com/a5u2vmkqz56d      copy it where settings_ddnet.cfg is
12:27 < KinG_> then press any key
12:27 < EastByte> just show me the sourcecode
12:27 < EastByte> I don't have windows
12:27 < KinG_> http://pastie.org/private/gvh4ojhjus9b3ifap1lha
12:27 < KinG_> i guess
12:29 < EastByte> ReadToEnd() : "Reads all characters from the current position to the end of the stream."
12:30 < EastByte> so you you are reading the full file instead of one line
12:30 < EastByte> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.streamreader.readline%28v=vs.110%29.aspx
12:30 < EastByte> try this method
12:33 <@deen> KinG_: can you please stop sending exe files...
12:34 < KinG_> deen: okay ^^
12:35 < KinG_> ok tnx
12:40 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #78: Fix several bugs for ingame sounds (DDRace64...pr_modulo) http://git.io/8d3V4A
12:42 < KinG_> deen:  this means we can place music in map? xD
12:42 <@deen> yes
12:42 < KinG_> nice
12:42 < KinG_> any updates for client?!
12:42 <@deen> not yet
12:42 <@deen> i think i pulled too many things in, now we need to get the bugs in all of them fixed first
12:43 <@deen> don't want to release client with buggy sound
12:44 < KinG_> i want to place a music in my map xD
12:44 < EastByte> :/
12:46 < EastByte> deen: there will be legal problems at some point
12:46 < laxadedi> I am not so sure with such little community
12:46 < laxadedi> and we can filter map before releasing them
12:47 < EastByte> well ddnet maps with gema tracks won't be released anyway
12:47 < EastByte> but if the client gets popular
12:47 <@deen> EastByte: same legal problems as with the images
12:48 <@deen> Hm, i think the name "Ambient volume" is not clear
12:48 <@deen> I'd rather call it "Map Sound volume"
12:49 < KinG_> what about "Sound Map"? :P
12:51 <@deen> EastByte: also, link11 responded and they're asking how much i'm willing to pay^^
12:51 < EastByte> hmmmm
12:51 < EastByte> ~40 eur :)
12:51 <@deen> i'll tell them that i've paid 10-20 per month so far and want to stay withing 30
12:51 <@deen> 40?
12:52 < EastByte> well 30 then
13:32 <@deen> EastByte: got a response^^
13:32 <@deen> EastByte: the cheapest they have is 400 € / month
13:39 < Nimda> Absurd 5 by Cyberpunk just released on Novice at 2014-10-23 13:37
13:54 < Nimda> Springlobe by Themix just released on Brutal at 2014-10-23 13:54
14:19 <@deen> Maybe they can fix the temporary ping jumps @ nfoservers, then the servers would be good
14:51 < o_be_two> hi guys
14:51 <@deen> hi
15:14 <@deen> Hm
15:14 <@deen> So I have this patch here: [PATCH] added prediction for grenades, explosions, hammer
15:14 <@deen> it replicates a lot of server code in the client =/
15:29 <@deen> DoNe: any more sound bugs?
15:29 < DoNe> did not test
15:29 <@deen> i think BeaR fixed them all, i couldn't find any more so far
15:29 < DoNe> i saw fix
15:29 < DoNe> but have no time
15:29 < DoNe> gonna test soon
15:47 <@deen> 50 minutes ago AWS was started in Frankfurt :P
15:48 < Learath2> thats good
15:56 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/T1I9Ig
15:56 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 f8f8f06 def: Rename "Ambient" to "Map Sound"
15:56 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 a0bfc5a def: Add shift + right click to delete a quad (Suggestion by Welf)
15:57 <@deen> RUS being so full must be because i shut down GER
15:58 <@deen> people don't have GER2, FRA, EUR in their favorites, only GER & RUS
15:58 < laxadedi> AWS ?
15:58 <@deen> amazon web services
15:58 <@deen> we tried them out in ireland (thanks to eeeee, but ping was too high)
16:00 <@deen> Interesting ideas if anyone is looking to implement something: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=546&p=4738
16:02 < Learath2> deen: can you get a server in the new frankfurt area for a ping check ?
16:02 <@deen> Learath2: an AWS one?
16:02 < Learath2> yeah
16:02 <@deen> I'm not planning to
16:02 <@deen> we have way too many test servers already
16:03 <@deen> and i don't think AWS is cheap
16:03 < Learath2> did you check on demand prices ?
16:03 <@deen> nope
16:03 < Learath2> Spot prices are way better
17:17 < EastByte> deen: I thought we already have grenade/explosion prediction
17:17 <@deen> no
17:18 <@deen> we have prediction for the path of the grenade
17:18 <@deen> but not how it will impact
17:18 < EastByte> ahh
17:18 <@deen> this sounds like something that would really help players with high ping
17:18 <@deen> and be terrible for code maintainance
17:18 < EastByte> hm :/
17:19 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/0001-added-prediction-for-grenades-explosions-hammer.patch
17:20 < EastByte> prediction stuff is really hard for me
17:20 <@deen> what do you mean?
17:20 < EastByte> hard to understand
17:22 <@deen> hm, it doesn't seem to work^^
17:22 <@deen> ah, cl_antiping_weapons
17:22 <@deen> wow, that's great
17:22 <@deen> only explosion is missing
17:23 <@deen> but feels like playing on localhost when using grenade at ping 300
17:25 <@deen> BeaR: hi! Thanks for the fast fixes
17:25 < BeaR> hey (:
17:25 <@deen> i haven't noticed any other bugs yet, i hope DoNe is still looking
17:25 < BeaR> thanks for testing
17:25 < BeaR> nice
17:28 <@deen> this construct is weird: do { ... } while(false);
17:29 < BeaR> macros ?:
17:29 <@deen> hm?
17:29 <@deen> it executes the code once, so i think { ... } would do the same
17:29 <@deen> aah
17:29 <@deen> they use break internally
17:29 <@deen> now it makes sense
17:29 < EastByte> interesting
17:29 < pause> Such a hackish pattern =P
17:30 < EastByte> better then goto I guess^^
17:30 < BeaR> pretty common, when using macros (:
17:30 < pause> BeaR: Yes, inside macros =P
17:35 <@deen> GER2 has fine ping today!
17:35 <@deen> also, 130 players: 13% cpu
17:35 < BeaR> new hoster?
17:35 <@deen> it's xRoThx's server, @ nfoservers.com
17:36 <@deen> they're in frankfurt and they can deal with ddos
17:36 <@deen> and they don't cost 400 € per month, other than link11
17:36 <@deen> (40 € instead)
17:38 <@deen> ok, here comes the huge commit =/

18:47 < laxa> !de-en alter
18:47 < Nimda> Translation: age
18:47 < laxa> deen: how would you translate all those kids saying : alter
18:48 <@deen> how would i know?
18:48 < laxa> You are german ? :)
18:49 <@deen> maybe someone else knows^^
18:50 < EastByte> I think they want to tell you that you are old
18:50 < EastByte> but not sure
18:57 <@deen> EastByte: what's going on with EUR?
18:57 <@deen> load is 9
18:58 < EastByte> Load average: 12.16 5.43 2.68
18:59 < EastByte> I don't understand what that means
18:59 <@deen> last min, 5 min, 15 min averages
18:59 < EastByte> is it more trustable then the usual cpu load?
19:00 <@deen> it includes other stuff than pure cpu load as well
19:00 <@deen> could also be too many disk accesses or network overload
19:00 < EastByte> everything looks normal
19:00 <@deen> yeah, weird
19:01 < EastByte> maybe it's because of vmware

20:24 < DoNe> does some1 know how to compile teeworlds free on windows?
20:24 < EastByte> free?
20:24 < DoNe> no money
20:24 < DoNe> for compiler
20:24 <@deen> mingw
20:25 < DoNe> looks interesting, hanks
20:25 < DoNe> thanks*
20:41 < DoNe> Windows ist wirklich klasse!
20:42 < DoNe> http://oi57.tinypic.com/17pbw0.jpg Es sorgt immer für meine Sicherheit!
20:42 <@deen> self-compiled?
20:42 < DoNe> no
20:42 < DoNe> newest version
20:42 <@deen> strange, haven't heard a report about this yet
20:43 < DoNe> SONAR.Heurustic.120
20:43 < DoNe> dont ask me what it is
20:43 < DoNe> its the server
20:43 < DoNe> i dont think there are a lot of people running ddnet server on windows with norton
20:45 < DoNe> And it "isulated" the file! xDD
20:46 < DoNe> Maybe cause it tried to go out through a port?
20:46 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
20:47 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
20:49 < DoNe> No, if i set register to 0 its the same
20:49 < DoNe> just kills it an removes it right after it starts
20:49 < DoNe> but no problem, im safe now
20:49 < EastByte> antivirus companies don't target on fixing false positives for mingw
20:50 < DoNe> nothing to do with mingw
20:50 < EastByte> it has to do with mingw
20:50 <@deen> i compiled ddnet-server with mingw^^
20:50 <@deen> you probably don't get that warning with visual studio
20:50 < DoNe> i just downloaded newest version
20:50 < DoNe> its not self comipled
20:50 < EastByte> yea
20:51 < EastByte> but visual studio is horrible
20:51 < DoNe> antivirus is horrible
20:51 < EastByte> microsoft doesn't fix security vulns for months
20:52 < EastByte> so antiviruses are important
20:52 < DoNe> normally i use linux
20:53 < DoNe> i have really no experience about windows
20:53 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
20:53 < DoNe> EastByte: do u know if i can mark the file for norton as safe or something like that?
20:54 < DoNe> or would it destroy my safety?
20:54 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
20:55 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
20:57 < DoNe> deen: you should disable dynamic camera on default
20:57 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
20:58 < EastByte> DoNe: sure you can mark it as safe
20:58 < EastByte> norton should be able to handle that
20:58 < DoNe> ill try
21:01 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
21:01 < EastByte> deen: my sister can't access her university profile online because adobe flash refuses to install on her laptop
21:02 < DoNe> yea it works!
21:02 <@deen> DoNe: why? i like dynamic camera
21:02 < DoNe> i think its bad for ddrace
21:02 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
21:02 <@deen> EastByte: flash for university profile?
21:02 <@deen> DoNe: i've never played ddrace without dyncam
21:03 < DoNe> rlly?
21:03 < EastByte> the webpage requires flash of course
21:03 < DoNe> with a higher mousesense you cant play with dyn
21:04 < EastByte> I always hear my family complaining about windows stuff
21:04 < EastByte> it's pain, really
21:04 < DoNe> adobe stopped support and updates for linux :/
21:05 < EastByte> yea and adobe flash as a plugin actually is dead since ~6 years
21:05 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
21:06 < DoNe> whats going on with CHN

21:12 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
21:12 < EastByte> guess why EUR has that many players
21:12 <@deen> i don't know?
21:13 < EastByte> firewall disabled
21:13 <@deen> really?
21:13 < EastByte> yea
21:13 <@deen> what did that change?
21:13 < EastByte> hm dunno
21:13 < EastByte> the laggs seem to be the same
21:13 < EastByte> but some players had problems connecting I think
21:14 <@deen> some players also can't connect to FRA

21:47 < DoNe> some mappers (juandissimo) place instead of air random tiles that are not used now
21:47 < DoNe> but later functions are added and then everything fails
21:48 < EastByte> maybe he wants to protect his map^^
21:48 < DoNe> could we make every tile thats not used and not air a bit red? or like a half transparent stop sign?
21:48 < DoNe> he made it for ddnet xD
21:48 < EastByte> "not used"
21:48 < EastByte> what does that mean?
21:49 < DoNe> has no function on ddnet servers
21:49 < DoNe> acts like air
21:49 < EastByte> and how do we detect whether a tile doesn't affect anything?
21:49 < DoNe> i dont understand
21:49 < DoNe> just edit the entities
21:49 < DoNe> the img for editor
21:50 < EastByte> ah you are talkin about the entities
21:50 < DoNe> yes 
21:50 <@deen> DoNe: try to do that and see if it works
21:50 < DoNe> if im back at my home computer
21:51 < DoNe> i hate to go through his maps and search for these tiles xD
21:51 < DoNe> a map he made some time ago is full of jetpack
21:51 <@deen> yeah, we had some problems with this already

21:52  * BeaR fights with the beauty of haskell \o/
21:53 <@deen> BeaR: oh?
21:53 < EastByte> o\
21:53 < DoNe> :D
21:53 <@deen> I'll be trying to teach Haskell from Monday on again^^
21:53 < BeaR> dunno, sometimes it's trivial, sometimes just brainfuck :D
21:53 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
21:53 <@deen> BeaR: do you take the Haskell class at TUM?
21:53 < BeaR> y
21:54 < BeaR> called info2 
21:54 <@deen> ah, nice. we talked about it yesterday at university
21:54 <@deen> yes, i know
21:54 <@deen> your professor knows mine
21:54 < BeaR> ^^
21:54 <@deen> our students are supposed to try and participate in your exercises
21:54 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
21:54 <@deen> those competition ones
21:54 < BeaR> oh, we have some sort of challenge system
21:54 < BeaR> y
21:54 <@deen> exactly
21:55 <@deen> but it's a bit unfair, since you have a headstart and we only do haskell for a few weeks
21:55 < BeaR> well, people win who already have knowledge of haskell
21:55 <@deen> obviously
21:55 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
21:55 < BeaR> well I had 2 lecutures so far ^^
21:56 <@deen> same as our students then
21:56 <@deen> third time i'm holding the exercises now
21:56 <@deen> info2 means it's in the second year?
21:56 < BeaR> nop, the third for the normal info students
21:56 < BeaR> afaik
21:56 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
21:56 < BeaR> just need some ECTS
21:56 <@deen> ok, same as at KIT then
21:57 < BeaR> how are the excersices going (: ?
21:57 <@deen> hm?
21:57 <@deen> They only start at Monday
21:58 < BeaR> hm ich meine, wie machen sich deine studenten xd
21:58 <@deen> yeah, i knew that's what you mean. but i haven't even seen them yet, so i don't know :P
21:58 <@deen> and they had nothing to do so far
21:58 < BeaR> ah :D
21:59 <@deen> but usually everyone has problems with this class
21:59 <@deen> not because of haskell, but the lambda calculus, type theory and prolog stuff
21:59 < BeaR> people said last years the exam was pretty easy
22:01 <@deen> no use of ghc-vis in the class by any chance? :P
22:01 < BeaR> nop, seen your thesis, but they didnt mention it so far I believe :D
22:02 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
22:03 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
22:04 <@deen> At least ghc-vis has some users
22:04 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
22:04 <@deen> it's a real horror to get working on Windows and Mac
22:05 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
22:06 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
22:07 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
22:08 < BeaR> well, it's hilarious how long I have to think about doing trivial task compared to c++ e.g :)
22:08 <@deen> yeah, it's another way of thinking, a bit like learning programming anew
22:08 < BeaR> y totally agree on it
22:09 < DoNe> can the sound files for your sound map implementation be endless large BeaR ?
22:09 < BeaR> uhm not endless, I think but you can play common musictracks if you want to
22:10 < BeaR> I haven't set any limit
22:10 < DoNe> cool :D
22:10 < BeaR> not sure if large files pass wavpack 
22:10 < BeaR> but they wont get streamed
22:10 < BeaR> every get decoded and loaded into memory
22:11 < DoNe> would be cool to do maps where story is explained by a voice
22:12 < BeaR> wouldn't suggest with the current sound system
22:12 < DoNe> why?
22:12 < BeaR> audio files can get really huge quickly
22:12 < DoNe> and then it takes long to load them?
22:12 < BeaR> 48k samples per seconds
22:12 < EastByte> also the tw map download is not suitable for big files
22:12 < BeaR> not that long but can easily take up much memory
22:13 < DoNe> what uses you thought about?
22:13 < BeaR> small looped ambient stuff
22:13 < DoNe> like birds in the background?
22:13 < EastByte> <3
22:13 < BeaR> y or rustling wind/leafs, howling, etc.
22:13 < DoNe> deen: how many percent of players on ddnet use ddnet client?
22:14 <@deen> i don'T know!
22:14 < BeaR> 1 min of sound is around 1mb memory, I think
22:14 <@deen> around 50%?
22:14 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
22:14 < BeaR> 10mb memory*
22:14 < BeaR> :D
22:14 < EastByte> :)
