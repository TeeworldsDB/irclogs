14:25 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
14:31 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
14:33 < EastByte> fra is being ddosed
14:34 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
14:35 < laxa> Oh god...
14:35 < EastByte> it never was like this before
14:36 < laxa> Is it vali or what ?
14:36 < EastByte> no
14:36 < laxa> hum...
14:36 < laxa> I had a talk with vali in private
14:36 < EastByte> I still don't believe he is ddosing
14:36 < laxa> apparently he doesn't care that he is probably going to kill teeworlds with his client
14:36 < EastByte> flooding yes
14:37 < EastByte> the client won't be a problem
14:37 < laxa> well, maybe not for ddnet
14:37 < laxa> but it'll be for all other mods I guess
14:37 < EastByte> xxlddrace/ddwar who cares?
14:38 < EastByte> well bad for old and unstable mods sure
14:38 < heinrich5991> laxa: what does it do?
14:39 < laxa> EastByte: currently, this crash "feature" can down any server, even ddnet.
14:39 < EastByte> heinrich5991: vali says his client is able to ddos and it uses a bug
14:39 < laxa> heinrich5991: on vali client, you can crash/ddos any server with a command
14:39 < EastByte> which sounds dumb
14:39 < heinrich5991> ddos or crash?
14:39 < heinrich5991> or both?
14:40 < laxa> both apparently
14:40 < EastByte> I'm not sure about the crash
14:40 < heinrich5991> do you have the client?
14:40 < laxa> http://pastebin.com/q1H5eDR8
14:41 < laxa> heinrich5991: client isn't public yet, it'll apparently be released in 2 weeks
14:41 < laxa> and it won't be opensourcd
14:42 < heinrich5991> well, if it will be released it's good
14:42 < EastByte> it is
14:42 < heinrich5991> I guess
14:43 < heinrich5991> makes it a lot easier to debug that shit
14:43 < heinrich5991> have you tried debugging it on a live server?
14:43 < EastByte> I think I will set up a honeypot server for things like that in the future
14:43 < EastByte> not yet
14:43 < heinrich5991> (that's how the last crashbug was discovered)
14:43 < heinrich5991> (the too small message stuff)
14:43 < heinrich5991> do you know whether it affect vanilla?
14:43 < heinrich5991> *affects
14:44 < EastByte> vali said it's independent from mod
14:44 < heinrich5991> people say much
14:45 < EastByte> yep
14:45 < heinrich5991> laxa: who of you is managing the servers?
14:45 < EastByte> of course his client starts a distributed denial of service attack from one computer
14:45 < laxa> what servers heinrich5991 ?
14:46 < EastByte> deen is managin everything of ddnet
14:46 < heinrich5991> does someone of you know what error message the server crashes with?
14:47 < heinrich5991> deen: you here?
14:47 < EastByte> we don't know whether it crashes or not
14:48 < EastByte> and deen isn't talking since yesterday
14:52 < EastByte> heinrich5991: let's say I am storing the last ~100 network packets of a tw server and also the coredumps
14:52 < EastByte> I should be possible to trace every crash/overload back I guess?
14:53 < EastByte> I should be able*
14:55 < EastByte> also if all players are not acked anymore it might be dos
15:10 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
15:11 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
15:11 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went down!
15:13 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went back online!
15:15 < heinrich5991> EastByte: that should help tracing back the bug
15:15 < heinrich5991> yes
15:48 < Pata94> Hey guys
15:48 < EastByte> hello Pata94 
15:48 < Pata94> going to make an editor server
15:49 < Pata94> is there already something like that?
15:49 < EastByte> editor server? what's that
15:49 < Pata94> so that you can edit maps with other people
15:49 < EastByte> so client modification aswell
15:50 < Pata94> y
15:50 < EastByte> I don't think there was anything like that
15:50 < EastByte> except thee minecraft mod
15:51 < EastByte> but that's not what you want I guess
15:51 < Pata94> nope
15:52 < Pata94> realtime map-editing with several people
15:52 < EastByte> good luck
15:52 < BeaR> sounds cool (:
15:53 < laxa> you want to make version control for teeworlds maps right ?
16:00 < heinrich5991> Pata94: there's someone working on something similar
16:01 < Pata94> who heinrich?
16:01 < heinrich5991> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=111957#p111957
16:02 < EastByte> lol
16:03 < Pata94> looks quite nice, but it seems different though
16:03 < Pata94> you can modify the map while you are playing on it
16:04 < Pata94> not sure if the remote editor will be available in the main h-client
16:04 < Pata94> and not only a standalone android app
16:05 < BeaR> high probably a standalone application
16:06 < Pata94> As far as i remember the h-client featured ingame map editing since the beginning
16:34 < heinrich5991> Pata94: how did you come up with that idea?
16:35 < Pata94> Fels asked me
16:36 < Pata94> But this idea isnt new
16:44 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
16:44 < Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
16:45 < BeaR> :/
16:46 < EastByte> they are using the weak point of ovh kimsufi servers I guess
16:51 < BeaR> hm.. just pure flooding of the connection or abusing teeworlds code?
16:52 < EastByte> short ddos attacks in a specific interval
16:53 < EastByte> so that the ddos protection of ovh goes on and off all the time
16:53 < EastByte> which causes packet loss
17:06 < laxa> Savander: why ddforce is offline ?
17:07 < Savander> again filemedia
17:07 < Savander> "We detected a Raid Controller failure on kvm16 (DE/FRA) at 16:00. This failure prevents to reboot the node. All VMs are shut shutdown and the node itself too.  We must replace it, but it can takes some time. To get a spare and replace it in the data center. "
17:07 < Savander> yea...
17:07 < Savander> btw.. 
17:07 < Savander> how it possible?
17:07 < Savander> on vps i have
17:07 < Savander> 22gb autorecord
17:07 < Savander> demos?
17:07 < Savander> HOW XD?
17:07 < EastByte> lol
17:07 < Savander> tell me.. how ;O
17:10 < Savander> WHAT
17:10 < Savander> 1100 minutes
17:10 < Savander> in one demo
17:11 < EastByte> maybe someone is trying to be funny and uses record in rcon
17:11 < Savander> woah?
17:11 < Savander> but on all servers/
17:11 < Savander> not possible
17:11 < Savander> xd
19:20 < EastByte> yo Welf 
19:20 < Welf> hey
19:28 < heinrich5991> hi :)
19:30 < EastByte> hm my ping to ovh datacenters is suddenly at ~90
20:00 < EastByte> icmp goes through much faster than udp
20:08 < o_be_one> yo
20:08 < EastByte> interesting, by enabling the firewall on an ovh ip/service, packets go a longer route over a firewall
21:13 < o_be_one> vali can pass all OVH ddos protection easyly ...
21:14 < EastByte> he isn't ddosing
21:15 < EastByte> o_be_one: did he take down one of your servers?
21:16 < o_be_one> yes
21:16 < o_be_one> he can ddos and have big impact
21:16 < EastByte> any interesting console logs?
21:16 < o_be_one> i'm asking for graphs
21:16 < o_be_one> but ovh has somes issues cause of ddos impacts >.<
21:17 < EastByte> maybe he is just triggering the ddos protection
21:17 < EastByte> but nothing more
21:17 < o_be_one> maybe ... I dont know how he does that efficient ddos
21:23 < EastByte> lol what is going on with my connection
21:24 < EastByte> like udp is throttled to random destinations
21:26 < o_be_one> oO
21:27 < Teetime> is this vali the one who created the vbot?
21:27 < EastByte> 30ms to ddnet ger; 80ms to my own ger located server
21:27 < EastByte> Teetime: if vali is valindur, yes
21:29 < EastByte> we might ask him if he is back here on irc
21:30 < Teetime> hm... this sucks, i do not understand why or even how people have fun with destroying others work
21:31 < EastByte> well the only thing which can destroy ddnet is a ddos attack caused by botnet
21:31 < EastByte> everything else is fixable
21:32 < Welf> it is probably a fixable bug mixed with ddos which takes down the servers
21:33 < EastByte> ddos attacks are expensive
21:33 < EastByte> vali seems to do some flooding
21:33 < EastByte> on a weak point
21:34 < Teetime> hm.. well isn't there any tcpdumps to review the traffic? does it affect the server itself or just the teeworlds server?
21:35 < EastByte> no one reported about that
21:35 < Teetime> what do you mean?
21:36 < EastByte> we don't know
21:37 < EastByte> if he would attack my servers, I could give more information :P
21:39 < Welf> EasyByte you are hosting some servers?
21:39 < EastByte> yes, qz clan server (ger located)
21:40 < Welf> oh you are east?
21:40 < EastByte> yep
21:41 < EastByte> we already talked^^
21:42 < EastByte> Teetime: many tw servers are hosted by ovh and its ddos protection might threat tw udp packets as an attack
21:43 < EastByte> so it can also be that vali is only triggering the ddos protection against tw udp packets
21:43 < EastByte> I think it's realistic
21:48 < Teetime> hm... then it's a crappy ddos protection^^ and then it should only affect servers hosted by ova whichs means the servers hosted by datafabrik shouldn't be affected?
21:48 < EastByte> would be the case
21:49 < EastByte> unfortunatly ddnet has 10bit/s everyday
21:49 < EastByte> 10gbit/s
21:49 < EastByte> caused by other people
21:51 < EastByte> and datafabrik null routes the ip from the beginning of a ddos for about 2 hours
21:52 < EastByte> Teetime: talking about crappy ddos protection, I just got blocked from my ovh vps just by sending pings
21:59 < Teetime> now I don't understand how the server becomes attacked; does he send some magical packets to the tw-server causing the tw-server to crash or whatever or does he fully ddos the server causing the provider to use the ddos-protection and null-routing the ip?
22:00 < Teetime> lol... well that shouldn't happen oO
22:04 < EastByte> (I'm just speculating) I think he is flooding tw servers with some "magical" packets which causes the ddos protection to see all clients as attackers
22:05 < EastByte> ddos attacks are coming from other ddnet haters
22:08 < EastByte> o_be_one: so you asked for graphs?
22:09 < Teetime> but in this case he shouldn't be able to crash (or whatever) all servers as mentioned earlier today^^
22:10 < EastByte> well I said many tw servers are hosted by ovh
22:11 < EastByte> also till now, nobody could confirm that these servers 'crashed'
22:11 < EastByte> like segfault
22:14 < Teetime> without further investigation there is nothing one could do
22:15 < EastByte> yep
22:16 < EastByte> the state for teeworlds is pretty bad when there are attackers
22:18 < EastByte> the protocol has weak points against ip spoofing, ddos protection can't work properly with teeworlds, tw server can hardly be distributed on multiple servers...
22:19 < EastByte> and it's full of kids who even pay for ddos attacks
22:19 < EastByte> I mean, srsly
22:23 < Teetime> yep.. and full of scriptkiddys^^ i actually don't understand why the secured network from heinrich isn't merged yet
22:23 < Teetime> but yep, I agree
22:28 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] savander opened pull request #51: Skin name in skin selector (next to the Skin useful) (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/ZB9Muw
22:28 < Teetime> I actually wonder why my server hasn't been attacked yet^^ I mean, I'm glad but I thought someday it would happen...
22:28 < Savander> Teetime: which servers are yours?;o
22:28 < Savander> teevision?
22:29 < Teetime> no, currently i'm just running the save-server
22:29 < Teetime> teevision is a project from Teelevision
22:29 < Savander> aah
22:29 < Savander> okay
22:29 < Savander> ;)
22:29 < Savander> sorry ^^
22:30 < Teetime> no need to excuse :)
22:34 < o_be_one> EastByte, waiting for them
22:34 < o_be_one> EastByte, ovh told me thay cant give me >.<
22:41 < EastByte> lol
22:56 < EastByte> yay my ping is low again
23:28 <@deen> ddnet game servers don't seem to be affected by the attacks, all i see are regular ddos attacks
23:30 <@deen> on the ovh I'd guess they split their amplification servers into 2 subsets, and use them alternatingly. after a minute without attacks ovh's ddos protection forgets about the attacker ips and unblocks them, then they can switch to the other servers
23:30 < heinrich5991> deen: no crashs?
23:30 <@deen> heinrich5991: none at all
23:31 <@deen> i fixed many such crashes about a year ago
23:38 < heinrich5991> deen: what kind of crashes?
23:39 <@deen> heinrich5991: flooding related iirc
23:53 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/p8wNQw
23:53 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 7555903 def: Add 00Bolox skin
23:54 < laxa> deen: the zclient is "out", they are giving it to people who wants it apparently.
23:55 <@deen> i know
23:55 <@deen> it has been out for months
23:55 < laxa> only for meskalin monsta and Tobii I guess
23:56 <@deen> no
23:56 < laxa> now some players are having fun with it on live servers :p
23:56 < laxa> well ok, never seen anybody use it before
23:56 < Savander> laxa: http://www.tee-n-tee.net/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=1276
23:57 < Savander> good night
