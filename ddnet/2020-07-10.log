06:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how do i get such good fps
06:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> with ddnet 9
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ive never seen it go this high ever before
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> maybe its ur ping
06:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> LOL
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialEngineering/comments/ho5o89/whats_your_password/
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ™‚
10:13 <+ChillerDragon> @abcqwerty :D
10:14 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki this is fake right?
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> huh
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i doubt, people are stupid
10:15 <+ChillerDragon> o.O
10:15 <+ChillerDragon> lemme try on the street
10:15 <+ChillerDragon> i need a camera tho and a mic to look pro
10:16 <+ChillerDragon> yo @Ryozuki whats your password?
10:17 <+ChillerDragon> Zwelf: does cross irc pinging work? Ah i guess yes cuz its just typing the name huh?
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> why ping
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> chillerdragon why did u stop using discord
10:17 <+ChillerDragon> Zwelf: do you use any other name?
10:17 <+ChillerDragon> discord sok
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u
10:17 <+ChillerDragon> also u made me rq
10:17 <+ChillerDragon> u pinged me
10:17 <+ChillerDragon> dont u remember?
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> no
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> did i?
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how
10:18 <+ChillerDragon> i think u and sp were pinging me or something like that
10:18 <+ChillerDragon> i was tilted and delted discord
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wasnt me
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> HMM
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> theres like ten people named noby in my discord so
10:18 <+ChillerDragon> doubt it was ur srv
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i hate ping spam too
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i wouldnt do that
10:19 <+ChillerDragon> grep -nri "ChillerDragon.*maybe.*delete.*discord" discordlogs/
10:19 <+ChillerDragon> or wait logs is a irc thing
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> when was the last time u used discord
10:19 <+ChillerDragon> forgot how bad discord is when it comes to searchign :D
10:19 <+ChillerDragon> i used discord web last week
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u know u can just block/mute people/servers lol
10:19 <+ChillerDragon> live is much better without discord and whatsapp
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I probably couldn't live without whatsapp
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> SMS is just shit
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tbh i would prefer if ppl used discord
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why bind something to a phone number
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it sucks
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its also objectively better, it has way more features
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> whatsapp isnt a thing here lol
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Whatsapp has end to end encryption. Discord sells our conversations to third parties and the 3 letter agencies of the world
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whatsapp is owned by facebook
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im sure they do stuff too
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A lot of independent audits of whatsapp suggest it's fine
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how independent
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> facebook can just hand in some millions
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Barring a subtle side channel attack they left in there that revwrse engineering just missed completely
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont care very much if the govt watches me talk about teeworlds on discord
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> theyre probably gonna see it regardless
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the largest audit was by open whisper systems, who designed the protocol in the first place
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> funny
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when i google open whisper systems
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it shows signal in front
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not whatsapp
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah signal also uses the same protocol
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> whats wrong with signal
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who was that guy that recomended signal
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and was from the cia or smth?
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> snowden?
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why doesnt he recommend whataspp
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The protocol is actually quite interesting
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://medium.com/@btcxlab/edward-snowden-advised-officials-to-abandon-whatsapp-and-telegram-5cfc7c063ced
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://twitter.com/snowden/status/1179858652469059585
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well signal doesnt require a phone no iirc and it has some source available
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can get it audited
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i thought it does
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> require phone
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nothing prevents u from changing it later
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or just trick the auditor
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The people actually looking at the binary? Given the protocol is open, you can verify how whatsapp is encrypting the messages
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the protocol
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what about the app
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The app implements the protocol
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Any backdoor they put there would have to be some sidechannel so that researchers miss it
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wqhich doesnt stop it from implementing a backdoor
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you generate the keys. You encrypt the messages
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And you can observe what goes on the network
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> even if there is no backdoor cant they still track how often people talk to others and who they talk to
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd have to be some very clever sneak attack to exfiltrate the plaintext without being noticed
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep they can track the metadata
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Some security is better than none imho. I'm bored of talking about things publicly and google giving me ads about them
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd use signal if it wasn't just full of nerds
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Most of my friends are normal people, who could care less if the nsa gives them an anal probe as long as the ui looks cute and modern
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> true
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> my irl friends dont evne know discord
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby I've heard messenger is much much more common in the states
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is that a meme or true?
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> more common than whatsapp at least
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> also alot of people use snapchat and stuff
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What's the primary tool for communication? SMS?
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> for me yes just texting
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is an unsettling trend in tbe EU with people using instagram group chats, which have absolutely horrible user experience
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> alot of people use instagram too but i dont so idk
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like notifications arriving 5 minutes late or not at all
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it doesnt strike me as the best chatting app already even without knowing that lol
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @Learath2 dunno what u use but in france messenger is at least as popular as whatsapp
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> probably even more
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Italy is predominantlywhatsapp
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Turkey even more
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> zoomers use snap or insta
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> normal ppl use messenger > whatsapp
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and boomers use whatsapp
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and sms
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> whatsapp is for europeans
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i thought in the us u use some weird app
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> like kik and telegram
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> kids
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Turkey converted boomers to whatsapp because internet is cheaper and we get special whatsapp internet packs
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Kik is for pedos
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> nice net neutrality
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Telegram is much popular in the eastern european immigrants that live in turkey for some reason
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Telegram and viber
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here ppl use whatsapp and instagram
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> normies
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby wym net neutrality? We do deep packet inspection in this bitch
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> rip
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They even used to MITM wikipedia for quite some time
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im sure that happens here too but theyre probably not so open about it
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz u cant edit articles against the dictatorship
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wow lol
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> knowledge is power
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont want ppl to have that
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> doesnt a vpn get around that kinda
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most ppl dont know shit
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the gov could even promote a vpn as a honeypot
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then they come to ur house
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and do good things
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine it
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> nty
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what means nty
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no thank u
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> speakr proper refined british english please
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> twat
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I turn on a vpn the second I get into turkey
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do u get kicked by antivpn
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dont bother with a commercial one though, just tunnel everything through my server
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> on tw
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah just get a 5â‚¬ vps
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cheaper than all vpns
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> vpses would be detected
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby I usually never play tw in turkey, macbook cant into tw
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> rip
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i play tw on a macbook just fine
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh btw something i noticed today..
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i play tw on master race linux just fine
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ive been getting 400fps the whole time
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> tried ddnet9 and 2700fps?
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how is this possible
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that doesnt happen to me
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always get 1000fps cuz i limited it to that
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Problem with vps is that you buy it , any traffic that goes out of it obbiously is your responsibility
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> crazy
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A vpn service has thousands of ips
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> true
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I throttle the macbook performs better, but i'd need a mouse and keyboard
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> there are also plenty of free vpns that work well enough to play/do whatever with as long as u dont care too much
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> about if they log it
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> mouse yes, keyboard idk
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you really care about hiding your tracks, you should be using tor anyway
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u have to care with tor
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some exit nodes
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are watched
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> cant play tw thru tor
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also lot of places bvlock tor exit nodes
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and also its p slow
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah but if you never exit, it's quite safe
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets be honest
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ye most exit nodes probably get detected as vpns
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not as vpns
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as tor
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Only browse onion sites
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are public
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how can it know the difference
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i mean the api tw uses
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> would call them both vpn
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> just use freenet lmao
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It does give a more specific result, my ip gets marked as hosting
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not flat out vpn
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> isnt that what vpns get marked as too
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> either residential or hosting
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Some are marked as open proxy
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> hm
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> twitter -> mastodon/pleroma
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually federation is a interesitng thing
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its never famous
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sad
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> i peertube 24/7
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> dont u?
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> corporations rule the world
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why cant u run tw on macbook tho :x
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> These things never stick as the common user sees no benefits
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> also mail is a thing
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> because resolution can not be changed @noby :D
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://fediverse.party/
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i mean the real version of tw
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 0.6
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mastodon is good, u can find nice weeb communities
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> "real"
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> github is best social network
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> :/
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes not the buggy new release
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe someone made a federated git web
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> sounds fun
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> go build it
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> git is federated itself i think
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> github just ruins it
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> y
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> github centralizes a descentralized software
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> ikr :D
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> its a closed src platform that hosts open src
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> github is a big meme
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u like chess https://lichess.org/ is open source and no ads
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I played a lot of lichess for a while. Then I noticed past a certain point it's just imposible to play without knowing some openings and I don't really enjoy memorizing stuff
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon I have a patch for macOS that lets you resize it in windowed mode
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes its better than default 07
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but its still a lil fucky
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even in realtime ðŸ˜Ž
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lerath > 07 devs
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But you need to build your own sdl
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because /me > SDL devs too
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lionheart> I've readed almost all the french translation and didn't see very important correction, maybe three or four. But it's maybe a point of view.
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> pls help 07 be less shity
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ik u can do it
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only had to debug that resizing thing for 28 hours, almost went insane twice reverse engineering AppKit
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh that sounds annoying
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apple is the pinnacle of engineering
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ðŸ™ƒ
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> so is it fixed in next sdl rls?
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> the new zoom transition is awesome <a:PETTHEPEEPO:715748779759763488>
12:58 <+ChillerDragon> <a:PETTHEPEEPO:715748779759763488>
13:02 <+ChillerDragon> any rust hacker wants to explain how to build https://github.com/wireapp/coax ?
13:03 <+ChillerDragon> First it said something about my openssl being to new then i tried "cargo update" and now sqlite clashes https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/rR
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats outdated
13:15 <+ChillerDragon> yea looks like but i could not find anything better :/
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: revert the `cargo update`
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: re the password interviews: those people usually cut out all the boring interviews. you don't know how many people they interviewed until they got those answers
14:39 <+ChillerDragon> yea but without cargo update it says my openssl is wrong version and it expects an older one
14:39 <+ChillerDragon> i dont feel like downgrading openssl is a good idea
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: can you give the error message?
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/4X
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 ^
16:02 <+fstd> ChillerDragon: how do you do https?
16:02 <+fstd> reverse proxy?
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> its funny you mention it now because i just broke it 30 min ago when i tried to add a new cert :D
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> fstd ye heinrich helped me i do some apache magic
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ZillyHuhn/server-config/blob/master/etc/apache2/sites-available/paste.zillyhuhn.com-le-ssl.conf
16:10 <+fstd> yeah Learath2 did the same for me :)
16:10 <+fstd> i was hoping you implemented https right into pstd :D
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> haha
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> i :D
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> idk if i just broke it or if it was always like that
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> but http://paste.zillyhuhn.com is reachable
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> and it does no automatic upgrade :/
16:11 <+ChillerDragon> but ye no worries if i build something cool ill make some noise in the upstream
16:11 <+ChillerDragon> but my changes are mostly adding me to credits lmao 
16:11 <+fstd> well you have no redirect in your apache conf i think
16:12 <+ChillerDragon> yes
16:12 <+fstd> i think you might need to do that in a <VirtualHost *:80> (but not sure)
16:12 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/cstd/commit/81e6594c8ff4982e6cf46d20781f9922dccebec4
16:12 <+ChillerDragon> well i have this
16:13 <+fstd> looks useful
16:13 <+ChillerDragon> also in the push script
16:14 <+ChillerDragon> its useful when ssl is working but if not its harming 
16:14 <+fstd> yeah true
16:14 <+ChillerDragon> so i would not implement that 
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> yo fstd do you or someone else activley use pstd? because i use it on daily basis and have the feeling im the only person on this planet :D
16:18 <+ChillerDragon> its such a nice software
16:19 <+fstd> it's super ham-fisted :D
16:19 <+fstd> but yes I use it for all my paste needs
16:19 <+fstd> and Learath2 too I think
16:19 <+ChillerDragon> since when?
16:19 <+fstd> and another friend of mine who i haven't seen in a while
16:19 <+ChillerDragon> cz ur still double char right?
16:19 <+ChillerDragon> or did you reach 3 yet?
16:19 <+ChillerDragon> or do you pruge from time to time?
16:19 <+ChillerDragon> purge*
16:20 <+fstd> nah i don't purge.  and yes it's still 2 chars, but well even that is enough for 3844 pastes
16:21 <+ChillerDragon> crazy
16:21 <+ChillerDragon> i think i will purge when i reach 3
16:21 <+ChillerDragon> i use it a lot 
16:21 <+ChillerDragon> and rembering 2 charcters is awesome if you want to sync some txt between two devices
16:22 <+ChillerDragon> i already have 1403 pastes
16:22 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 has to check how many u have right?
16:22 <+fstd> wow
16:22 <+fstd> i have 1043 and it's up for almost 5 years :D
16:22 <+fstd> nah i have shell access there
16:22 <+ChillerDragon> ah
16:22 <+ChillerDragon> ye i go wild
16:23 <+ChillerDragon> every time any of my tw servers restarts its like 1 paste
16:24 <+fstd> hm, so your tw servers restart a lot, why is that? :)
16:24 <+ChillerDragon> i also built a script that generates nested pastes
16:24 <+ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/X1
16:25 <+fstd> lol
16:25 <+ChillerDragon> useful ikr
16:25 <+ChillerDragon> yea not only my tw server also trafilaws servers
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> "restart" aka crash
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> to update to new src
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> yea also when onbgy crashes the servers
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> ddnet7 is not too stable
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it was just a test
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no ban
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> when the server shuts down it trys to get new src and then uses pstd to upload the build log
16:27 <+fstd> oh, cool
16:27 <+ChillerDragon> so ingame and admin can go like "exec build.txt" and recive a pstd link to see latest build status
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> or check crashlog etc
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> you might find nasty security holes in my tw mods when bruteforcing my pstd instance ;:D
16:28 <+fstd> duly noted :D
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > and it does no automatic upgrade :/
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ChillerDragon why do u use apache and not nginx? also did u know certbot from letsencrypt hs a nginx plugin which sets it all up
16:36 <+ChillerDragon> apache has also some things :D
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nginx > apache
16:36 <+ChillerDragon> idk i started with apache and never switched
16:36 <+ChillerDragon> bcs apache worked
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> yea but i guess sometimes one has to switch to get improvments
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> or i would be stuck with my first windows vps :D
16:37 <+ChillerDragon> at least i finally tried arch ^
16:38 <+Ryozuki> let me talk from here so im also cool
16:38 <+ChillerDragon> haha

16:40 <+fstd> maybe everbody found out how awful discord is
16:40 <+ChillerDragon> +
16:40 <+fstd> although i guess thanks to bridge, discord still owns our IRC chatter too
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> yea
16:41 <+Ryozuki> im always on irc with my bouncer tho
16:41 <+Ryozuki> i just forget to start weechat

16:43 <+ChillerDragon> good idea
16:43 <+ChillerDragon> maybe there is a weechat plugin
16:43 <+ChillerDragon> oh well i actually saw that one
16:43 <+Ryozuki> https://github.com/mmb/weechat-otr
16:44 <+Ryozuki> use this when talking in private
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> i tried counterstrike on debian latley and it was shit :D
16:44 <+Ryozuki> ?
16:44 <+Ryozuki> i play csgo and dota 2 on arch
16:44 <+Ryozuki> more fps than windows
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> is it good?
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> well maybe my deb laptop is shit
16:44 <+Ryozuki> with opengl tho, with vulkan its slower
16:44 <+Ryozuki> but it may be due to developer cause
16:44 <+ChillerDragon> ima try on my desktop with arch i guess
16:44 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon u probs need drivers
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> i still feel uncomfortable in arch btw
16:45 <+Ryozuki> why
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> but atleast i have sound since yesterday ;D
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> i dont get pacman and yay and this shit
16:45 <+Ryozuki> dont use pacman at all
16:45 <+Ryozuki> use yay
16:45 <+Ryozuki> it handles arch and aur
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> not that i ever understood apt keys but ..
16:46 <+Ryozuki> it also shows you PKGBUILD diff
16:46 <+Ryozuki> so those arch elitists
16:46 <+Ryozuki> have no argument here
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> what arch elistists
16:46 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon some people are against aur helpers
16:46 <+Ryozuki> cuz they like to make their life harder
16:46 <+fstd> arch sux
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> so more like pacman elitists?
16:47 <+Ryozuki> ye
16:47 <+Ryozuki> more like makepkg elitists
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> fstd: why?
16:47 <+fstd> i think the word you're looking for is 'purists'
16:47 <+Ryozuki> yea purists
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> idologists
16:47 <+Ryozuki> ye arch suxs, use hannah montana linux
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> lmao
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> so what do i do now?
16:47 <+fstd> now that i can get behind
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> yay steam?
16:48 <+Ryozuki> do it
16:48 <+Ryozuki> if u use it that way it shows u a list
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> i see
16:48 <+Ryozuki> btw if u want to update ur system
16:48 <+Ryozuki> just type "yay"
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> o.O
16:48 <+Ryozuki> it does pacman -Syu and then it asks to update aur packages
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> so many hits on steam
16:48 <+Ryozuki> multilib/steam 
16:49 <+Ryozuki> try to use non aur packages if you can
16:49 <+Ryozuki> they are better
16:49 <+fstd> i think libsrsirc is in AUR \o/
16:49 <+fstd> or at least it used used to
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> omg
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> yay crashed
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> now it showed some cpu registers
16:49 <+fstd> yay
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> so complicated
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> :D
16:50 <+Ryozuki> wtf?

16:50 <+ChillerDragon> yes
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> how do i get non aur packages?
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> isnt that pacman?
16:50 <+Ryozuki> u dont need pacman
16:50 <+Ryozuki> yay searches pacman packages and aur packages
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> but its over 100 hits
16:51 <+Ryozuki> man
16:51 <+fstd> ..or crashes
16:51 <+fstd> ;D

16:53 <+Ryozuki> what
16:53 <+Ryozuki> did u do "yay steam"
16:53 <+ChillerDragon> y
16:53 <+Ryozuki> ah
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `pacman -S steam`
16:53 <+Ryozuki> you need to enable
16:53 <+Ryozuki> multilib
16:53 <+Ryozuki> for steam
16:53 <+Ryozuki> enable multilib in pacman conf
16:53 <+Ryozuki> look arch wiki
16:53 <+Ryozuki> steam is special
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: you could try only upgrading the openssl dependency
16:53 <+Ryozuki> stuck at 32 bits
16:53 <+ChillerDragon> thats why i did cargo update
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *only*
16:53 <+ChillerDragon> ye ik
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> so manually in the cargo config?
16:54 <+Ryozuki> /etc/pacman.conf
16:54 <+Ryozuki> [multilib]
16:54 <+fstd> Learath2: you on Devuan 3 yet?  just realized they finally released it in june
16:54 <+Ryozuki> Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cargo update --help
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> i somehow rage quitted from that project it has some annoying license agreement
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> also wire bots are pro only
16:55 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i have to search a new messanger
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: what text to speech tool do u use?
16:57 <+Ryozuki> none
16:57 <+Ryozuki> but
16:57 <+Ryozuki> https://github.com/mozilla/TTS
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> o.O
16:57 <+Ryozuki> is the most interesting project
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> i want nothing fancy i just had my "say" command on debian
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> for my scripts
16:58 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon i tried online the brian voice
16:58 <+Ryozuki> its from amazon tho
16:58 <+Ryozuki> right now they are the best
16:58 <+Ryozuki> idk
16:58 <+Ryozuki> i dont know any
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> meh
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> arch shit
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> :D
16:58 <+Ryozuki> cool story bro
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> on debian i always searched "'x' command not found" and got the result i wanted on the interwebs
17:01 <+Ryozuki> https://soundcloud.com/user-565970875/ljspeech-logistic-wavernn
17:01 <+Ryozuki> listen to this
17:01 <+Ryozuki> its epic 
17:03 <+ChillerDragon> not bad
17:04 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1594400687.png
17:05 <+ChillerDragon> looks good so far
17:05 <+ChillerDragon> :D
17:05 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i have to restart my pc
17:06 <+Ryozuki> u need to install some fonts
17:06 <+Ryozuki> i guess
17:07 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea good idea
17:07 <+ChillerDragon> reboot did not help :D
17:10 <+ChillerDragon> so when it comes to community vs aur i should pick community right?
17:11 <+ChillerDragon> aur is like literally everybody can publish unaudited shit?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> flkatpak is
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> xd
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> hm yeah
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> i saw so many packages with teeworlds by random users
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> in aur
17:12 <+ChillerDragon> the font thing was a good idea https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1594401113.png
17:12 <+ChillerDragon> yea dfq is flatpak i never really understood that
17:12 <+ChillerDragon> i installed like something there once idk what it was
17:13 <+ChillerDragon> was a weird trip
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> aur is literally unaudited shit, ChillerDragon
17:38 <+ChillerDragon> ok i see
17:39 <+Ryozuki> doesnt mean its bad
17:39 <+ChillerDragon> and community is that somewhat trusty?
17:39 <+ChillerDragon> no ofc not just potential risk
17:39 <+Ryozuki> u just can check the pkgbuild file
17:39 <+Ryozuki> yay prompts it
17:40 <+Ryozuki> and shows it to you before installing
17:41 <+ChillerDragon> yea i quickly skimmed that
17:42 <+ChillerDragon> but its downloading stuff so for a full audit one would have to follow the urls
17:42 <+Ryozuki> about aur u only care about the pkgbuild file
17:42 <+Ryozuki> which is a install script
17:42 <+Ryozuki> if u trust the software it installs is another thing
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> yea but ig thr pkgbuild contains "wget https://fishy.miror/trusty-software"
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> goo typing
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> omg my internetd is os bad i can not type ;D
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> Ddnet tab on DDnet client it's kinda buggy when you see it in Spanish
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pepe buggy how? Can you provide a fix?
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/731175268210966529/Captura_de_pantalla_de_2020-07-10_11-47-46.png
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> text is on top of those things
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we rly need dynamic text size
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wouldn't really help here on its own
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the whole layout would need to change
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @deen better enjoy ur holidays in switzerland instead of dealing with teeworlds problems :feelsbadman:
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some languages simply use longer words
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its rly hard
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> I don't think I can provide a fix D:
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> On "Luminosidad" you can just say "Lum:" just like you did with Sat
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> It only happens on DDnet tab, other tabs are well organized
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> yo konsti how is the map rls going?
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Just like all the other team 0 insanes like 1andonlylife or Ton 2
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :feelsbadman:

18:17 <+ChillerDragon> waiting for @Learath2 to merge and fix my pr
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> fix ur pr lol
18:18 <+ChillerDragon> i tried to fix learaths pr but i could only fix linux not windows
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> idk why the c++ crap is ther ein the first place
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> also i hope @fokkonaut will contribute his color system
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe the cpu is slow
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti I'm back already since Monday

19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: I'm currently playing CS:GO on my arch
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> Chillerdragon you can't have fun on arch, use the launch option `-nofun`
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> its was `-nojoy` i think
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what?
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> turn of joystick support, without it csgo crashes for me
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> *turns off
19:57 <+ChillerDragon> what compability tool yo use?
19:58 <+ChillerDragon> also -nojoy doesnt help
19:58 <+ChillerDragon> i dont even get a crash or crashlogs it just says running in the steamapp and nothing more
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u simply dont know how to do stuff
20:00 <+ChillerDragon> ._.
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or ur pc sucks
20:00 <+ChillerDragon> u sok
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like when u were missing the font
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur using arch
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not ubuntu
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i just use the native csgo
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> with the launch option
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that works for me
20:01 <+ChillerDragon> like manually?
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont need to tweak anything
20:01 <+ChillerDragon> ./csgo
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i use the steam ui
20:01 <+ChillerDragon> yea does not work for me
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont blame arch
20:02 <+ChillerDragon> on debian it worked
20:02 <+ChillerDragon> ok was different machine
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> debian installs a set of packages
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on arch u get the barely necessary
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u need to know what to install
20:03 <+ChillerDragon> how do i know tho
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> searching
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u dont like it

20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> is there a command that puts you into the afk state?
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> esc->spec
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont troll
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> what is afk state
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> probably the thing in ddnet client that says zzz when someone is afk
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @ChillerDragon i still didnt finish ur HQ t0 map :feelsbadman:
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TearlessAbyss46 I don't think so
