15:21 < Hamid_Jigool> hi my friends
15:22 < Hamid_Jigool> i have question
15:22 < Hamid_Jigool> whats Service Name for Teeworlds? i wanna set an srv record dns on Cpanel
15:22 < Hamid_Jigool> please help me
15:23 <@heinrich5991> I think teeworlds doesn't have one
15:23 < Hamid_Jigool> so what can i set for Service Name?
15:26 < Hamid_Jigool> _tee._udp.block.domain.com
15:26 <@heinrich5991> *I'd guess* you can't set a srv record for teeworlds
15:26 < Hamid_Jigool> aw
15:26 < Hamid_Jigool> oom
15:37 <@heinrich5991>    Service
15:37 <@heinrich5991>         The symbolic name of the desired service, as defined in Assigned
15:37 <@heinrich5991>         Numbers [STD 2] or locally.  An underscore (_) is prepended to
15:37 <@heinrich5991>         the service identifier to avoid collisions with DNS labels that
15:37 <@heinrich5991>         occur in nature.
15:42 < Matodor> hello
15:43 < Matodor> need some help
15:44 < Matodor> i rewrite teeworlds server on C#, all is well, but i have some problems with "prediction time reset"
15:44  * fstd_ sighs
15:44 < fstd_> why would you want to do that?
15:45 < fstd_> and clearly not all is well because you're getting "prediction time reset", which probably means "it's too slow"
15:45 < Matodor>  I do not like C ++)
15:45 <@EastByte> nah, probably just wrong implementation
15:46 < Matodor> too slow? ok, maybe errors with server time
15:49 <@EastByte> anyways you should give more information about your problem otherwise we cannot help
15:50 <@EastByte> but I think no one here actually wants to or can help
15:52 < Matodor> sorry, i so bad know english)
15:52 < Matodor> ask, i can answer for more information
15:55 < fstd_> you want people to ask you for information about your problem so you don't have to decribe it yourself?  huh
15:56 < fstd_> i doubt anyone would care enough to do that
15:56 < Matodor> :D
15:57 < Matodor> each second client was freezed with prediction time reset, maybe 1-3 iterates each second
16:00 < Matodor> *a couple of times per second tee was teleported
16:03 < fstd_> look, what sort of answer do you expect?  like "ah, yes, if you get 1-3 prediction times reset, then you have to replace the - by a + in gamecontroller.cpp line 150?
16:03 < fstd_> you need to learn how to debug, and perhaps try projects of smaller size than teeworlds
16:05 < Matodor> how me to debug the server where the "too slow"?
16:09 < fstd_> by having a lot of programming and debugging experience, there is no fixed recipe
16:10 < fstd_> teeworlds is not trivial
16:11 < Matodor>  I know, so I ask the places where there may be errors, the server may be too fast processing, or vice versa - slowly.
16:13 < Matodor> may be too slow server takes snapshots
16:15 < Matodor> if needed i can link to source
16:16 <@heinrich5991> Matodor: how far are you with the server code? :o
16:18 < Matodor> Well, I used to just doing mods, and now (last week) rewrote the entire server)
16:20 < Matodor> heinrich5991:
16:20 <@heinrich5991> do you know a bit of c++?
16:20 < Matodor> ye
16:20 <@heinrich5991> if so, you could probably try to look at the code around "prediction time reset"
16:20 <@heinrich5991> (although I'm not sure that this isn't just some unrelated log message popping up)
16:21 < fstd_> it's a message that the client shows
16:21 < Matodor> now i don't have this error, but client have some little teleportations and reset inputs
16:22 <@EastByte> rewriting the whole server in a different language implies you understood all the mechanics of the teeworlds engine
16:24 < Matodor> i tests with change rate of do snapshots 
16:25 <@heinrich5991> fstd_: yes, but it might still be unrelated to the problems they're experiencing
16:25 < fstd_> sure
16:26 <@heinrich5991> e.g. lots of newbies post the dreaded "autoexec.cfg" not found error message that keeps them from launching their clients? ^^
16:26 < fstd_> i just mean that looking at the (client) code around the message is unlikely to reveal the problem since the problem is in the server code
16:26 <@heinrich5991> ah
16:27 <@heinrich5991> but maybe it helps understanding what the problem is
16:27 < fstd_> yeah i guess it could
16:27 < Matodor> problem with server make snapshots so slow
16:28 <@heinrich5991> at what rate?
16:28 <@heinrich5991> it should send out 25 snapshots per second, generating 50 per second
16:28 < Matodor> hm
16:31 < Matodor> i test with send rate, m_CurrentGameTick % 2 too slow, each m_CurrentGameTick too) need make server faster)
16:32 < Matodor> but it is difficult to find a place in which the brake
16:32 <@heinrich5991> Matodor: there are probably benchmarking tools for C#
16:33 <@heinrich5991> they'll be able to tell you where the server takes the most time
16:49 < Matodor> heinrich5991: hm, server have 25 snapshots rate per second
16:49 <@heinrich5991> they send 25 snapshots per second
16:50 <@heinrich5991> they generate 50 per second
16:52 < Matodor> when i have 50 "DoSnapshot" per second, client not have error "prediction time reset"
17:02 <@heinrich5991> great :)
17:03 < Matodor> but client have some teleportations)
17:29 < Zirax> is rhere any body can teach me edit of ddnet src in windows ?
