03:45 <@deen> Meh, that didn't work. In case anyone is interested: When you optimize the PNGs using zopflipng (with some manual code to prevent color type changes which TW doesn't support) and thereby save > 1 MB then the final zip file ends up 2 MB larger. Not quite worth it
03:46 <@deen> But otherwise zopflipng is pretty impressive, even though it takes forever to optimize PNG files
04:02 < masoudd> Oh the PNG optimizer messes the zip compression?
04:02 < masoudd> The zip compression does a better job?
04:07 <@deen> masoudd: yeah, apparently a bunch of badly compressed png files compress better than well compressed ones
04:07 < masoudd> Makes sense actually
04:08 <@deen> yeah
04:08 <@deen> but i didn't expect it :P
04:08 < masoudd> Yeah I wouldn't have expected it either
11:51 < GoJE_GrEEN> afk ?
11:51 < GoJE_GrEEN> o_O
12:18 < GoJE_GrEEN> H-M-H
13:32  * GoJE_GrEEN slaps masoudd around a bit with a large fishbot
13:40 < masoudd> GoJE_GrEEN: :D fishbot?
