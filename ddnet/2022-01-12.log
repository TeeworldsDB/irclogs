20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what job?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> web dev on some unknown local company
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> cool
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since its a rly small company i can do things my way most of the time
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got here after they were impressed with me after some free internship u have to do to get a certain oficial "degree" here in spain
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I also thought I joined a small company, but they grew a lot in the time since I signed the contract and now ðŸ˜„
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ‘€
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Lmao
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> is it possible to make cursor in-game rotating around u ?
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> like ur cursor is an arrow that always point towards u
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> bcs right now we cant do that
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ahah, we had a spanish intern and i was also surprised that you first get the ingeneer degree, THEN you do the internship
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> You started your new job?
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> What's their business model? Because their DB is open-source, so anyone could use it ?
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, but what large company wants to run their own database without support? So we have some proprietary cloud stuff on top and charge for that. But in principle anyone can run the db for free, sure
