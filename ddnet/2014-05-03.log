00:00 <@deen> i know
00:00 <@deen> would be nice if anyone has a fix for that
01:04 < goo> how was this problem fixed between teams?
01:05 < goo> i still remember when it was reported as a bug, and got fixed
01:07 <@deen> not at all afaik
13:36 < NooBxGockeL> Is there even a way to contribute to the Client or make suggestions for it ? no place seems suitable for such...
13:47 <@deen> sure
13:48 <@deen> just tell me or write on trac
13:48 <@deen> or on github
13:50 < NooBxGockeL> hmmm just dunno about dis, its just like a thing i favored about Gamer Client... the colored Modes in the Serverbrowser ;D (i have coded local version of it)
14:20 <@deen> oh, nice
14:20 <@deen> hmmmm
14:20 <@deen> maybe you could show me
14:29 < NooBxGockeL> something like that http://pastebin.com/V1yhw3JL replaceing all existing... config entries, embedding checkboxes into GUI is open for discussion... I found that quite nice, because it makes the main screen of teeworlds 'not so pale'
14:29 <@deen> will take a look soon, thanks
14:30 < NooBxGockeL> upper one is coloring ping depending on value, <100 = green, <200 = orange, >=200 red... doesnt have to be implemented just wanted some color...
14:31 < NooBxGockeL> if you want i can make a pull request on github, just say it..
14:31 <@deen> I'll take a look first
14:32 < NooBxGockeL> sure its totally up to you what colors you want or anything in source, this is just a POC
15:28 <@deen> Hmmm
15:29 <@deen> I have to say I don't like having colors
15:29 < NooBxGockeL> :'C kay ^^
15:30 <@deen> =/
15:30 <@deen> nearly nothing has colors in tw
15:30 <@deen> and suddenly this window is full of them
15:30 < NooBxGockeL> ye thats the bad thing! it needs more ;D 
15:32 <@deen> i think zClient is also colorful like that
15:33 < NooBxGockeL> hmmm dunno that client, only know GamerClient hClient and DDNet client so far.. and i pretty much liked the colorfulness cuteness of GameClient somehow ^^ Was just my opinion, tho gamerclient also had less colors and only gamemode colored
16:03 <@deen> Apparently others like it
16:03 <@deen> I'm asking around a bit
16:04 <@deen> I'll play with the colors
16:04 <@deen> and add it
16:06 < NooBxGockeL> much love
16:06 <@deen> It's probably good for noobs
16:06 <@deen> and people like me, who don't like it, can disable
16:06 < NooBxGockeL> ye ;D
16:08 <@deen> Thanks for sending me =)
16:08 < NooBxGockeL> nono thanks you for adding ;D
16:25 < NooBxGockeL> BTW what do you think of a display for Jitter ? may or may not be on scoreboard...
16:28 <@deen> You could make the eyes blink on jitter
16:28 <@deen> and disable other eye blinks alltogether
16:29 < NooBxGockeL> that really would be a funny implementation xD
16:29 <@deen> eyes already go sleepy when you're afk for 5 min
16:29 < NooBxGockeL> and in freeze!
16:30 < NooBxGockeL> people could fake jitter then tho...
16:31 <@deen> how?
16:31 <@deen> disable blinks altogether
16:31 <@deen> and blinks are random
16:31 <@deen> eh, not blink, sorry
16:31 <@deen> or yes, blink, twinkle
16:32 < NooBxGockeL> most servers have /emote tho
16:32 <@deen> oh really
16:32 <@deen> never used =)
16:33 <@deen> could nono
16:33 <@deen> that's the wrong blink
16:33 <@deen> i mean the one tees do randomly
16:33 <@deen> like every few seconds/minutes
16:34 < NooBxGockeL> ye sec
16:37 < NooBxGockeL> even DDNet servers have /emote ;D you can simulate a blink with that, but the more i think about it why should people simulate blinks...
16:40 < NooBxGockeL> the emote command only changes the eyes and doesnt make a speech bubble or something like that if you dont know that ^^
16:41 <@deen> do you want to write that or was that more a suggestion for me?
16:42 < NooBxGockeL> general suggestion for anyone to write, im more like a copycat in terms of c++, my main language is java... so if you arent busy and you want to do that id be happy to give it away
16:44 <@deen> are the colors from gameclient?
16:45 < NooBxGockeL> most of em yes >.<
16:45 <@deen> I don't like them
16:45 <@deen> i also made the ping colors gradual between green and yellow
16:46 <@deen> HSL is a lot more convenient than RGB for that
16:46 < NooBxGockeL> sure, im certain you find good colors
17:01 < NooBxGockeL> im off for a while coming back later... cya
21:50 < NooBxGockeL> <3
21:50 <@deen> I released the colors
21:50 <@deen> Are they fine for you?
21:50 < NooBxGockeL> yep! looks awesome!!
21:50 <@deen> =)
