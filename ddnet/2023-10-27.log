14:10 < bridge> <v4ox3r> ya i see, but in ddnet client not yet
14:10 < bridge> <gerdoe> ddnet doesn't support 0.7 protocol

16:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:29 < bridge> <k2d222> gread news for ppl who like coding and poping
16:33 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
16:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i encourage him to play divinity. maybe he finds some sacred source there
16:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i encourage him to play genshin impact. maybe he will find some like-minded individuals on there
16:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why do u share that, are u religious? xd
16:34 < bridge> <Ewan> it's just cool
16:34 < bridge> <Ewan> presumably
16:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what is cool?
16:34 < bridge> <Ewan> that the pope wants kids to code
16:34 < bridge> <Ewan> it's probably a noteworthy thing for the coding channel
16:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mhh if you are not religious it's not really cool i guess
16:35 < bridge> <Ewan> im not religious and i think it's cool
16:35 < bridge> <Ewan> but i think it's cool in a funny way
16:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh ok
16:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to me it's the normal attention seeker behavior
16:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "hi we need young ppl, i talk about gaming now"
16:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i have never taken the pope or any of the catholic church seriously
16:37 < bridge> <Ewan> probably because it was taught to me so skeptically
16:37 < bridge> <Ewan> 'so yeah basically all popes were gay for little boys and had illegitimate children'
16:37 < bridge> <Ewan> that about summed it up
16:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
16:38 < bridge> <Ewan> this is history class
16:39 < bridge> <k2d222> you can dismiss basically any action famous ppl do with that kind of argument
16:39 < bridge> <k2d222> not that it's false, but it's not necessarily true
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, 99% of the time u should just do exactly that
16:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they are not fame, bcs they were not attention seeking 😉
16:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> look in our current world.. doesn't even matter if positive or negative attention
16:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> only attention
16:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they act cool for kids now, but they just want your money, they won't give anything back
16:42 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
16:42 < bridge> <Ewan> donate to the church
16:42 < bridge> <Ewan> are churches tax exempt in many places in europe?
16:42 < bridge> <Ewan> they are country-wide here
16:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can cancel the subscription xd
16:42 < bridge> <Ewan> what subscription
16:43 < bridge> <k2d222> idk, it's a very generic argument that I hear a lot these days and it's just dissmissive and pointless to me, bcs sure this guy seeks attention for money reason or other reasons, but there are different ways to do it and some are better than others. What do you think of this one? also, seeking attention is not always bad
16:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well the taxes are kind of optional
16:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if we'd care that kids do coding, he'd modernize the churches and put computer classes into it
16:44 < bridge> <Ewan> i still don't really get it
16:44 < bridge> <k2d222> sure :/
16:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @mpft the state collects taxes from the people for the church
16:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in germany
16:44 < bridge> <Ewan> but you can opt out of it?
16:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u never were part of the church u never have to pay these taxes
16:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i see
16:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else u can stop doing it, by leaving the church
16:45 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah that sucks but it's not what i mean necessarily
16:45 < bridge> <Ewan> tax exemption means the church doesn't have to pay taxes
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh ok
16:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well  i dunno, but they are defs rich af xD
16:47 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
16:47 < bridge> <Ewan> crooks
16:48 < bridge> <Ewan> at least here they're generally known for doing good deeds. sometimes
16:48 < bridge> <Ewan> food & clothing drives etc
16:48 < bridge> <Ewan> feeding the homeless on holidays or sometimes just cuz
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> its funny
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> re
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> im antichrist
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u on the dark humor side
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i see
16:58 < bridge> <Ewan> lol what
16:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks ill always share this opinion https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6w2M50_Xdk
16:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a very anti religious and pro science philosophical talk
16:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Yes, some of the thinkers to whom I owe my mental freedom were religious, like Newton, a Christian who believed God made the Earth - but showed me why the Earth would have formed without a god's help, or Faraday, who opened all our eyes to electromagnetism - and a world of electrons that obey dice, not gods. The brilliance and physical insight of these and many other religious scientists' minds are the very things that make gods getting humans pr
16:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
16:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Weird...
16:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
16:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> > ....I can see what geniuses said they could not - but then even a mouse on a giant's shoulder sees further if the giant is bowed in prayer.
16:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
16:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> > I'm not against the Creator or Creators, if they exist, if they ever existed. I'm not against the search for the Creator(s). What blows MY mind is that people think organized religion has anything to do with it at all.
16:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I remember that it was good in the beginning but deterioated later on IMO
17:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> well its a philosophical talk so its not the "truth"
17:00 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i still think its funny when ppl go "WE ARE MADE OF STARS!!!!"
17:00 < bridge> <Ewan> we are
17:01 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> no. stars are made of **us**.
17:01 < bridge> <Ewan> what
17:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah
17:01 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean a little bit
17:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> we are stars
17:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> and stars are us
17:01 < bridge> <Ewan> but like. a really little bit
17:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> everything is star dust
17:01 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> stars are us
17:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean a == b is same as b == a
17:01 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> stars have human dust :gigachad: :gigachad: :gigachad: :gigachad: :gigachad: :gigachad: :gigachad: :gigachad: :gigachad:
17:01 < bridge> <Ewan> the amount of human mass of all the matter to ever exist is so microscopic
17:01 < bridge> <Ewan> u cant like
17:01 < bridge> <Ewan> say that
17:02 < bridge> <Ewan> it's misleading
17:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> jupstar writing his bible
17:02 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> cant  banne m dmfmkf  I CANT STOP.LAUGHING
17:02 < bridge> <Ewan> im confused
17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well what i dislike about religions isn't even believing..
17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> besides i think we just determistic(even if not calculatable by us in this universe) atoms
17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> science as of now is defs not 100% sure about most stuff
17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dislike religions bcs:
17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1. ppl come together and focus might on a few selected ppl (ppl close to god)
17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2. religious ppl hate ppl from other religions (bcs other religions can't make sense)
17:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 3. some of the world views in our biggest religions are simply from a society from 2000 years ago, where slavery etc. was normal
17:02 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> in trying to troll but this is too funny
17:02 < bridge> <Ewan> oh
17:02 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> humam dust LOLL
17:02 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess usa players don't know how to troll
17:02 < bridge> <Ewan> that was sad
17:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > religious ppl hate ppl from other religions (bcs other religions can't make sense)
17:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> depends on the religion. I haven't heard that from protestants
17:03 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> id try harder but my work break just ended
17:03 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> plus ive successfully trolled u guys before
17:03 < bridge> <Ewan> still trolling :justatest:
17:03 < bridge> <Ewan> hey guys hookfly not fun with dummy
17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i like the pure form of science, the scientific method, but its true science in a capitalistic place like nowadays has bad stuff, like citing your friends or trying to get urself cited but not in legit ways or smth like that
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even if, let's assume we remove all religions except one "protestants"-one.
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's just a matter of time until u face the same problem again
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs not so open ppl will join
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and create some side religion
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 are u protestant? u always mention them xD
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> afaik they are predominant in germany right
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method
17:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> the religious method is (listen to or read the  bible or whathever text) -> (belive its true) -> (donate  some money to church) -> (maybe get ur kids molested by a old man)
17:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
17:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok im trolling a bit
17:06 < bridge> <Ewan> true
17:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> uh
17:06 < bridge> <Ewan> don't say it
17:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> religious membership in germany went down a lot
17:06 < bridge> <Ewan> 😓
17:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought we were about to get topic checked
17:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> last time I checked it was ~30% of each atheist, protestant, catholics, roughly 5% muslim
17:07 < bridge> <Ewan> and the last ~5%
17:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> but yeah i shared that post because i always find it hilarious when religious extremist promote technology related stuff, because we got to have that stuff when they in the past said it was heretical
17:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but now it's 44% atheist, 25% catholic, 23% protestant, 4% muslim
17:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> atheist or agnostic?
17:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> let's call it non-religious

17:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did u move?
17:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to a EU state?
17:17 < bridge> <gerdoe> xd
17:17 < bridge> <gerdoe> my uni had connections with some german unis and companies

17:18 < bridge> <gerdoe> nah
17:18 < bridge> <gerdoe> im in kazan rn
17:18 < bridge> <gerdoe> too bad for being in harward xd
17:18 < bridge> <gerdoe> my former classmate is going to move to us this year afaik
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tbh harvard isn't something i'd be proud of
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they are very elitist
17:19 < bridge> <gerdoe> idk actually
17:20 < bridge> <gerdoe> the thing i know that he was invited in some high-end economic uni in great britain
17:20 < bridge> <gerdoe> but he refused cuz he wants to move to us kekw
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when u really clever, u can make fast money in US xd
17:21 < bridge> <gerdoe> he was the first person who actually showed me paper about cows and methane xd
17:21 < bridge> <gerdoe> i will never move to us i think
17:22 < bridge> <gerdoe> i live in perfect timeline in russia because sigint and humint haven't grown that much
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd generally be open for it. i think american ppl are more chilled than europeans xd
17:22 < bridge> <gerdoe> europeans are protestants mostly, are they tho
17:22 < bridge> <gerdoe> afaik spain is more chilled than any us state
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is ryo chilled
17:23 < bridge> <gerdoe> hes catalun
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can just ensure you, germans are not chilled 😂
17:23 < bridge> <gerdoe> yeah, thats a fact
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i often see ppl from other countries can't really well handle the german directness xD
17:24 < bridge> <gerdoe> directness?
17:24 < bridge> <gerdoe> you mean in conversations?
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for example yes
17:26 < bridge> <gerdoe> idk maybe im surrounded by straightforward people but my inner circle have no secrets or any ways to say you anything
17:26 < bridge> <gerdoe> idk how to express this actually
17:27 < bridge> <gerdoe> its better to say the truth unless its unethical thing you need to prepare person before saying anything to them
17:28 < bridge> <gerdoe> yay pr
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> most annoying is that american have different metrics for everything xD
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> everyone: only 50 tiles left until finish
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> american: only 5 feet until finish
17:31 < bridge> <gerdoe> huh, do intel or any other global company use metric system instead of american metrics?
17:31 < bridge> <gerdoe> 30 tees until finish
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> true xd
17:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://securelist.com/operation-triangulation-catching-wild-triangle/110916/
17:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> what does chilled mean
17:41 < bridge> <gerdoe> ask jupjopjap
17:41 < bridge> <gerdoe> in my opinion chilled = chilled, like being chill most of the time you live
17:42 < bridge> <catseyenebulous> chilled = chilled sounds good. :D
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u know like, when u go to a store everyone relaxed
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when u go into supermarket in germany.. at least 5 ppl are mad bcs cash registers are full(that includes me too xd). everyone in bad mood
17:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> stuff like that
17:44 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Madstar✪ :tee_thinking:
17:48 < bridge> <gerdoe> highstar
17:49 < bridge> <gerdoe> there's no self-checkouts in germany stores?
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not everywhere
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's slowly comming
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> germany is always 10 years behind netherlands xd
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there it's pretty common now
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but also depends on the region ofc
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bigger cities are usually more modern in these aspects
17:54 < bridge> <Ewan> wow
17:55 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> :justatest:
17:55 < bridge> <gerdoe> huh
17:55 < bridge> <gerdoe> and in three or more years behind russia xd
17:55 < bridge> <gerdoe> or tatarstan
17:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean most ppl still pay with cash xd
17:57 < bridge> <gerdoe> ah
17:57 < bridge> <gerdoe> i was suprised when first heard about any transport in moscow
17:57 < bridge> <gerdoe> like no one accepts real cash
18:00 < bridge> <catseyenebulous> ``
18:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even tho i use card, i still always have like 200€ cash here, just in case xdd
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @gerdoe i have good news
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lavapipe works on windows
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i used

18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> from
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/pal1000/mesa-dist-win/releases
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in powershell i typed:
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> setx VK_ICD_FILENAMES lvp_icd.x86_64.json
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to set the software renderer as default
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> copy all files from x64 into a clean ddnet dir
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then it should work
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or wait, maybe not xdd
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> surface still fails kek
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git revert --all
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> our fallback system trolled me xd
18:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I have officially sort of worked for Valve

18:33 < bridge> <gerdoe> oh no, mingw
18:33 < bridge> <gerdoe> gitroll
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's prebuilt, but nvm anyway
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's sad bcs i want to use it for windows as fallback xd
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in our not existing launcher
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean i could create a surfaceless vk, then copy the image to a directx9 backend
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and should still work on 99% of all system xd
18:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks what command
18:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> u wanted me to run
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nvm
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we were just wondering what mesa version gentoo uses

18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i forgive you, didnt even know u use linux
18:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> huh?
18:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats windows bro
18:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> thats literally powershell
18:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can see the ugly line
18:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> "Select-String driver"
18:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> vs majestic unix "grep"
18:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> although powershell is available on linux as well
18:40 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> whats the key combination to open hacker looking ddnet info
18:40 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Ctrl + Shift + D
18:40 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I think
18:40 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> nope, theres one more

18:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> is F1 scary for you
18:41 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> depends what i can see there

18:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
18:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> powershell have a default alias for cat which is hilarious
18:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> in fact they made quite a few aliases, but they missed grep
18:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the rm alias is literarly broken
18:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can't rm -rf
18:46 < bridge> <learath2> I think it also has `ls`
18:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> because -f in powershell is ambiguous
18:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i have to rm -r -Force every time
18:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ```
18:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> > rm -rf a
18:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Remove-Item: A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'rf'.
18:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> > rm -r -f a
18:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Remove-Item: Parameter cannot be processed because the parameter name 'f' is ambiguous. Possible matches include: -Filter -Force.
18:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> > rm -r -Force a
18:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> >
18:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ```
18:49 < bridge> <Ewan> it's aliased by default
18:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i still grep
18:49 < bridge> <Ewan> and cd to dir and stuff
18:49 < bridge> <Ewan> oh fred posted
18:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @learath2 btw why did you asked me where I live
18:50 < bridge> <learath2> I've been thinking of taking a trip to China, just wondering 😄
18:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> in that case I could literally be anywhere
18:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> unstable jobs be like this
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got a tentative possible job for 40k
18:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> but if you came I would take a leave and hang out for sure
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> from 33k to 40k not bad
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> going up the ladder of european salaries
18:52 < bridge> <Ewan> that's insanely low to me
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know but its different
18:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> my current job is probably stable enough for two years
18:52 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> u know how much my father makes?
18:52 < bridge> <gerdoe> a year?
18:52 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> he gets 1300€ monthly
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i do 2100€
18:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but the problem is that the company is consider moving office to a different provience lmao
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> net
18:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but the problem is that the company is considering to move office to a different provience lmao
18:52 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye a year
18:52 < bridge> <Ewan> this is less than my rent
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> with 40k i would get like 2500€ monthly
18:53 < bridge> <Ewan> :greenthing:
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> my rent is 880
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> with utilities
18:53 < bridge> <gerdoe> crazy payments
18:53 < bridge> <gerdoe> like
18:53 < bridge> <gerdoe> what the hell
18:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> 2500€ is actually pretty close to what I get including benefits and taxes
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i live in center barcelona
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> its like living in beijing
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> or
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> new york
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> for ur local country
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok new york is extremly more expensive
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u get it
18:54 < bridge> <Ewan> u dont even wanna know how much more expensive
18:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> my rent is about 322.85euro
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> new york is like 4k rent
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think
18:54 < bridge> <Ewan> it rly depends on the place
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> cheap
18:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
18:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cockroaches everywhere
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> ew
18:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not really a problem with the building tho, guanggong have a pretty huge pest problem
18:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
18:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not really everywhere either
18:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I've killed about 6 in my house in a year i think?
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
18:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i hate the south roaches tho
18:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> roaches in the north are much smaller
19:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> huh?
19:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> how is it 1am already
19:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I haven't done anything
19:52 < bridge> <patiga> @jupeyy_keks I'm really mad at Godot 2D shaders right now. I need to pass custom data to the shader and thought I'd abuse the color vertex attribute for that.
19:52 < bridge> <patiga> However, since Godot 4.0, the provided Vector4 floats are all converted to u8 for "optimization reasons". But it's documented literally nowhere, except for the migration guide. EVERYWHERE it is a float, when you initialized the data and also when you access it in the shader, I spent more than 3 full hours to figure this out.
19:52 < bridge> <patiga> They made this change and justified it by saying that 4.0 supports custom shader data now, so unusual usages can simply switch to that. HOWEVER, custom shader data is only available in 3D, not 2D.
19:52 < bridge> <patiga> There is actually a pull request which adds custom shader data for 2D, but it looks like it will still take a while https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76276
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> interesting, does the u8 conversion apply to all types? even positions?
19:54 < bridge> <patiga> no. color only
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
19:56 < bridge> <patiga> that means I'll somehow need to work with just position and uv, both vec2
19:58 < bridge> <k2d222> curiosity, do they have their own shading language?
19:58 < bridge> <patiga> yes
19:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> always reinvent the wheel
19:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
19:58 < bridge> <k2d222> pff thats wasteful
19:59 < bridge> <patiga> https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/shaders/shader_reference/shading_language.html
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean they support gles 2.. that really sucks
20:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and i guess most ppl dont want to use GLSL 2.x
20:00 < bridge> <patiga> I guess I'll store the vertex id in position.x, color_env_index in uv.x, position_env_index in uv.y. then I'll have a position_uv texture which I access with the vertex index. then I'll access the envelope_values texture with the env indices.
20:00 < bridge> <patiga> I have one float at position.y left. But I need 2 to get the quad center point for rotation... :saddo:
20:01 < bridge> <k2d222> https://tenor.com/view/suitcase-pack-trying-schitts-creek-struggle-gif-16501310
20:03 < bridge> <patiga> ah, I don't actually use the color vertex attribute since I merged it with the env_values, they are precalculated in there.
20:03 < bridge> <patiga> but how do I use the 8 floats-but-actually-u8 to store an f32
20:03 < bridge> <patiga> *4 floats
20:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @k2d222 when do u share ur awesome GPU projects with us xd
20:04 < bridge> <k2d222> If I had one I'd share it
20:05 < bridge> <k2d222> I'm doing my own programming language atm
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for gpu or cpu?
20:06 < bridge> <k2d222> cpu, it's functionnal, almost lisp-like
20:18 < bridge> <k2d222> how do they even pack an f32 in an u8 seems unrealistic
20:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for color
20:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they will just accept the loss of precision
20:38 < bridge> <gerdoe> courutines?
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> coroutines
20:59 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what kind of data are you passing that can't be a uniform material property
21:00 < bridge> <patiga> I'm passing quad data such as envelope value indices and center of the quad, which might be different for every quad
21:01 < bridge> <patiga> and I have all quads of a quads layer in a single mesh currently
21:01 < bridge> <patiga> though I'm still new to Godot, so if you have an idea on how to improve it, that would be great :)
21:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't know much about godot either.
21:03 < bridge> <k2d222> do you have geometry shaders ? instancing ?
21:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but if you are using quads anyway, why not using a spatial shader and quads directly.
21:04 < bridge> <patiga> I'm not using quads actually, I only referred to the teeworlds term there
21:04 < bridge> <patiga> they need to be triangles for the color interpolation
21:04 < bridge> <patiga> spatial shaders were the 3D ones, no? yea that would work
21:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye the 3d ones
21:05 < bridge> <patiga> neither
21:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> actually do you mean you have one sprite that you want to draw a whole layer on with some tricks?
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you have control over the datatype of the texture coordinates?
21:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's quite weird to think about meshes in godot 2d
21:06 < bridge> <patiga> no, its a very normal triangle-based mesh
21:06 < bridge> <patiga> (2d coordinates only tho)
21:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't know you can use canvas item shaders in mesh
21:06 < bridge> <patiga> I don't think so
21:06 < bridge> <patiga> yea like observed above, the support doesn't really seem good ^^
21:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if you are already using spatial nodes i'd recommend use spatial tho. just use render_type unshaded.
21:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if you are already using spatial nodes i'd recommend use spatial shaders tho. just use render_type unshaded.
21:07 < bridge> <patiga> they are not spatial nodes afaik
21:07 < bridge> <patiga> `MeshInstance2D`
21:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm confused
21:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ah
21:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> never used that lol
21:08 < bridge> <patiga> I guess I could switch to 3D for those additional vertex attributes
21:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you could
21:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can u optionally turn on compute shaders xd
21:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i'm still quite confused about what you are trying to do
21:09 < bridge> <patiga> I mean, is there any drawback to switching to 3D? Is handling the lighting/camera/performance more difficult?
21:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> uniform should be able to hold most extra data you want even for instanced meshes i think?
21:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> uniform should be able to hold most type of extra data you want even for instanced meshes i think?
21:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> theoretically a bit yes
21:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd use a orthogonal projection matrix
21:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if they offer that
21:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if you use render_type unshaded, it's basically sprites
21:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and orthogonal camera is built-in
21:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @patiga only problem i could see is, if depth buffer cant be disabled
21:11 < bridge> <patiga> I want to render quad layers from teeworlds/ddnet maps. Currently, I'm using a non-instanced MeshInstance2D. Each quad in teeworlds has it's own center point, around which the envelope rotation happens. each quad also has it's own envelope data indices (two) and each vertex also has a color
21:12 < bridge> <patiga> the custom instance data in godot can only hold 4 floats afaik. because of that, I don't think I can use instancing
21:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> in unity instanced meshes can have per instance material properties
21:12 < bridge> <patiga> I use a mesh, and not many sprite2D, because I need vertex colors (performance would probably also be a factor here later)
21:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> well if you need vertex colors probably just use spatial
21:14 < bridge> <patiga> If I would use instancing, the 'base' mesh would need to be a simple square, no? Each quad would need the positions of all four corners, alongside the colors and the other data I mentioned
21:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> sounds like it
21:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't know how godot handles instancing tbh
21:14 < bridge> <patiga> would you prefer spatial over cramming the required data into the 2d mesh as described above?
21:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm trying to look it up but it's 3am lmao
21:15 < bridge> <patiga> ow, I don't wanna keep you awake, but thanks a lot for the help!
21:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u use instances you might aswell calculate stuff on the cpu
21:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> actually let me look up how tilemap was rendered in godot
21:17 < bridge> <patiga> afaik either an atlas, or scenes somehow
21:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also a valve employee just tagged me on github
21:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i like that
21:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs of a bug
21:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> btw are you using godot3 or 4
21:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or bcs of job request
21:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
21:18 < bridge> <patiga> 4
21:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nah, i submitted a second PR but it was overlapping with what they are fixing currently
21:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we should infiltrate valve
21:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i expected it but i need that fixes before monday for work so i submitted that anyway
21:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i expected it but i need that fixed before monday for work so i submitted that anyway
21:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> everyone in this chat sends applications
21:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then we invite our selfs
21:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then we invite ourselves
21:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think valve does not hire non experts
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i have chatgpt
21:20 < bridge> <patiga> all ddnet experts here
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'm an expert
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i can ensure you they also hire normal ppl^^
21:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i can ask a valve employee
21:20 < bridge> <Ewan> he's pretty normal
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i talked to some valve staff on the vulkan discord
21:20 < bridge> <Ewan> who
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> who or which?
21:21 < bridge> <Ewan> which fellas
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah, well dunno the names, but let me see
21:21 < bridge> <patiga> valve infiltrating ddnet?!
21:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pixelcluster - Valve
21:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
21:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> whoever that is
21:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also lunarG ppl are also kinda valve staff
21:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he comes from germany
21:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and is 18
21:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont know them
21:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> have u heard of Sascha Willems
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> nope
21:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what khronos, lunarg, valve devs do u even know? XD
21:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i know 1 valve employee
21:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez
21:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gaben
21:25 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
21:26 < bridge> <Ewan> there is obviously some overlap
21:26 < bridge> <Ewan> u see a lot of the same names on org repos and stuff
21:26 < bridge> <Ewan> so i thought i might recognize the names
21:26 < bridge> <Ewan> but it's different territory
21:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @patiga have you already figured out how to pass data to INSTANCE_CUSTOM at least. i remember you said you know there are four floats (vec4) available
21:27 < bridge> <patiga> I know how to do that, yea
21:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can probably just pass an array buffer as a uniform and just store indexes into INSTANCE_CUSTOM while you are building your meshes
21:29 < bridge> <patiga> but `INSTANCE_CUSTOM` should only be available when I use instancing, no? then I'd have many more problems with storing data I think. Am I understanding instancing wrong?
21:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> aren't you trying to use instancing?
21:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or do you just want to pass extra data per sprite and happened to use mesh instance 2d just for making two triangles?
21:30 < bridge> <patiga> no, to recap: I'm trying to store custom vertex data in 2d vertices for shading
21:30 < bridge> <arrowastaken> the problem was vsync idk why was a problem tho, i always had it on and 144 hz limited, and now i have it off and unlimited framrates and is fixed xd
21:31 < bridge> <patiga> yes. I use mesh instance 2d for vertex colors and triangles
21:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ah
21:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i thought you are trying to use meshinstance2d to save performance
21:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so like you are making one meshinstance2d per "quad"?
21:33 < bridge> <patiga> no, I only have a single mesh instance for the entire teeworlds quads layer, so in the mesh there are multiple teeworlds quads, each made out of two triangles
21:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that is what i thought what you are doing
21:34 < bridge> <patiga> true, I could do one mesh instance 2d per teeworlds quad, I hadn't considered that. The most extreme map in regards to quad count is around 16000 in one quads layer iirc
21:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> sounds like you are missing vertex id for uniform buffer
21:35 < bridge> <patiga> yeah, I think I gotta do that
21:36 < bridge> <patiga> (although I'll have to use uniform textures in place of uniform buffers, since only textures are available in compatibility mode :c)
21:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
21:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> GLES3 moment
21:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> GLES2 moment
21:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
21:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> godot 4 dropped gles2
21:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why can everyone drop backends except us 😭
21:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they are still fixing gles3 since the main renderer is vulkan only since godot 4 started
21:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they tried to ignore gles3 even before i think?
21:38 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> convince another backend programmer to help us
21:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but then i have to say. they could simply allow GLSL
21:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as shading language
21:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> btw i mean you have to use spatial it seems like. canvas_item shaders doesn't really give you vertex id, so you can't even pass a uniform and index that per vertex
21:39 < bridge> <patiga> I could store the vertex ID myself xd
21:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> emm. how?
21:40 < bridge> <patiga> well, I could store it in the position.x for example, and retrieve the actual position value in the uniform texture
21:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oh good point
21:40 < bridge> <patiga> ( my face while thinking about the whole thing: :cammostripes: )
21:40 < bridge> <patiga> why doesn't Godot think about 2D shaders :c
21:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but godot 3d sounds really attractive right about now
21:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean...
21:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> this is quite a niche use case
21:41 < bridge> <patiga> it sounds so weird to use 3d in a 2d game
21:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also technically you can just do it natively as a godot module
21:41 < bridge> <patiga> how is custom vertex data a niche use case?
21:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for 2d it really is
21:42 < bridge> <patiga> hm I haven't heard about modules before
21:42 < bridge> <patiga> I'll take a look
21:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> modules is straight up godot source code
21:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you write a module, you compile the entire engine
21:42 < bridge> <patiga> ouch
21:42 < bridge> <patiga> that sounds overkill
21:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean. ye
21:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> either way I think most general purpose 2d engine users wouldn't really think about vertex anyway
21:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> by that point just use 3d
21:43 < bridge> <patiga> I mean, are ~3 texelFetch operations in the vertex shader that costly?
21:44 < bridge> <k2d222> custom vertex data in 2d game doesn't sound far fetched at all
21:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think 2d game is just a concept
21:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
21:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also i think using 3d engines to make 2d games isn't that far fetched either
21:45 < bridge> <TsFreddie> why would they split the two renderer if they are mostly the same
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> depends, but probably no.
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what is your plan now? stream the vertex ids?
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or use instancing?
21:45 < bridge> <patiga> put the vertex id into the vertex data somewhere
21:45 < bridge> <k2d222> ppl use blender to render 2d movies all the time
21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does the shader not offer a `gl_VertexIndex` alternative?
21:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo: i think using spatial shaders might be easier?
21:46 < bridge> <patiga> Can I use 2D nodes in a 3D scene? There is no `TileMap` equivalent 3D node I think
21:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :poggers2:
21:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> emm
21:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> no
21:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you'll need to composite render textures probably
21:47 < bridge> <patiga> nope :d
21:47 < bridge> <patiga> the index is actually accessible in some shaders, but not in the canvasitem 2D shader ^^
21:47 < bridge> <TsFreddie> honestly
21:47 < bridge> <patiga> okay, so I'll try to stuff too much data into the available vertex data, I think I can do that :)
21:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if 2d renderer and toolset is really what you want to use. I'd recommend just modify the engine directly
21:48 < bridge> <patiga> I'd fall back to that maybe if the data cramming fails
21:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I tried adding per light properties before it wasn't that bad
21:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> scons are pretty easy for me to use too.
21:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> scons is pretty easy for me to use too.
21:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it's almost 4am lmao
21:50 < bridge> <patiga> wanna go sleep anytime soon? ^^
21:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, but i think I passed the "fall asleep comfortably" time period
21:52 < bridge> <patiga> aw :/
21:52 < bridge> <patiga> I do appreciate the help a lot tho :D
21:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i have trouble sleeping everytime i have something that i want to make
21:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> then i can't sleep and can't wake up and make the thing in the morning
21:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> every time lmao
21:53 < bridge> <patiga> what's on your mind right now?
21:53 < bridge> <patiga> what do you wanna create? :)
21:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i saw a video of sniper chess i think it was probably easy to make
21:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i saw a video of sniper chess and i think it was probably easy to make
21:54 < bridge> <patiga> ah, the fps chess?
21:54 < bridge> <patiga> https://store.steampowered.com/app/2021910/FPS_Chess/
21:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not really
21:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v75jqiG0wAs
21:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
21:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> basically normal chess, but you shoot each others' pieces in between rounds to physically knock them out or move them.
21:59 < bridge> <patiga> sounds fun to play ^^
21:59 < bridge> <patiga> not sure if it actually improves the gameplay in the long run :p
22:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably not
22:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but I can't make anything for more than two days before I get distracted
22:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> this seems like a two day project to me :kek:
22:00 < bridge> <TsFreddie> in unity at least. but i'm considering using godot which might make it longer
22:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i haven't directly written any netcode yet. since GodotSteam doesn't implement the high level replication stuff
22:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not that godot's high level networking is that well designed by the look of it anyway
22:02 < bridge> <patiga> do you do such projects for fun or to do something with them?
22:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wdym do something?
22:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> like sell them?
22:03 < bridge> <patiga> publish, sell, I don't know
22:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i usually make stuff for fun but keep publishing in mind when i'm making them
22:03 < bridge> <patiga> do you like have a collection of projects somewhere? :)
22:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it did happen like one time where i published biggernouis on google play:kek:
22:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> probably just my itch page
22:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> my fun projects aren't usually games
22:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://tsfreddie.itch.io/
22:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and admittedly non game fun projects aren't that fun looking
22:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo: I made myself a input method which i think it's cool but no one other than me and one of my friend use it
22:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also some of them are unity plugins
22:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and third party translations
22:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>  basically just stuff
22:08 < bridge> <patiga> sounds nice though
22:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> teeworlds was one of the stuff
22:08 < bridge> <patiga> I don't have that many projects ^^
22:08 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
22:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also i think i'm just old
22:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
22:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice the blind game is really well made
22:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye, that's my best performing game on LD
22:10 < bridge> <TsFreddie> then I tried two more time after it, couldn't beat it and just didn't submit them
22:11 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> for a three day project blind jump is probably pretty hard to beat again, in terms of the completeness of the game
22:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did u even made artwork yourself?
22:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> no
22:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it looks so professional
22:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
22:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> two people made that
22:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> although i basically retouched all art assets
22:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> cuz the other guy didn't really made any pixel arts
22:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i have to fix a lot of weird art choices
22:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and the other guy is now my boss at work lmao
22:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> game designers imr
22:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and the other guy is now my project lead at work lmao
22:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1167556943049662486/image.png?ex=654e8f23&is=653c1a23&hm=2e050da69ccd7b8d101275cfd318aea0085bcc507665fb63298a77fc0fac39d7&
22:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the third guy quit in 3 hours and we didn't end up using any of his code so it's actually a team of two
22:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @tsfreddie there is a game that is like bigger nouis just with fruits
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> did u know that xd
22:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye
22:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> they ripped off the game that I was ripping off
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> smallant plays it rn with 4k viewers xD
22:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nothing special
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it could have been bigger nouis
22:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> well probably not in a million year
22:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the original game was pretty big in china
22:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but it bugs me a lot that they didn't even put much effort in that game
22:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the animations are basically non-existent, the merge feedback is trash
22:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> everything just pops into place
22:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> at least biggernouis still tried to use proper animation and sound feedback with teeworlds assets
22:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and yes, i am quite salty about that game
22:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
22:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i really wanted to hop on some streams and just say i made one way before this game. couldn't bring myself to that level of attention grabbing tho.
22:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
22:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and it is technically true, biggernouis released about a year before this exact version
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i know that feeling.. i also kinda dislike to do such things
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i guess if u want the money u gotta sell your soul
22:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i haven't updated my google payment info, so i couldn't really get paid by google on ads for the android version anyway
22:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> lmao
22:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but i did sell biggernouis' source code for 200 euros with the asset stripped to a french company tho.
22:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
22:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh lol, gg
22:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> haven't told deen about it since he was against it. I did make them put clauses to prevent them from using the name / the asset or using the source code to recreate the game with the sameish asset in the contract tho.
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean did the game work out for them xd
22:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> none of my business really. and it was like two weeks ago and it sounded like it was for some play to win scam thing so they probably doesn't care what the game actually is, they just want working games.

22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i c
22:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo: i did sign a NDA for their SDK but they didn't end up sending me that cuz apparently 1000 euros to contract me to integrate the game into their platform is too much
22:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> so in the end i didn't really get to know what product they are making
22:33 < bridge> <learath2> Way too much, an indian dude can hack it in in about 5 days for one fifth of that
22:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo: i know
22:33 < bridge> <learath2> With 10 times the bugs, but who cares. As long as it siphons ad money it’s fine
22:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> still good that you didn't ask for less, I'd imagine
22:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> 200 is less but i have to do zero work for it
22:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> honestly i could probably do it in a few hours based on what they've told me
22:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but 1000euros does include an asset swap since they would want a already running game at that point
22:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:amogus:876956004674338848> didn't really do any of that so who cares
22:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now improve the game and sell it to them again
22:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
22:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
22:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> too bad they learned about ludum dare from my game page during that transaction
22:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
22:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think i have to go to bed now
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes you do
22:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wake me up when smant plays biggernouis

22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>

22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dislike the camera design, but else really great phone
22:55 < bridge> <reitw> Tbh with the back protection the design IS fine, like it
23:19 < bridge> <k2d222> f:q
23:56 < bridge> <totar> what was the original game? I saw all the streamers playing the fruit game and thought about biggernouis but I assumed you copied something too
