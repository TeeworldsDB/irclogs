09:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> don't tae that
09:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> take the other ui sent to deen after that LOL

16:23 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> Jupstar: does ddnet really have that many changes to text? I'm thinking in particular in context of games
16:24 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> Jupstar: we use pre-rendered textures for the time counter just for Ã¦sthetics,  all other text is generated on the fly from the ttf, the most frequent text changes being either chat or % changes in some game attribute
16:24 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> and the latter is only a few characters once a second. big deal
16:25 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> in terms of web browsers, I'm not sure what they do. I bet it depends on circumstances.
16:25 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> there's all sorts of crazy things one has to support on a web page these days
16:25 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> I remember discussing w/ the mozilla guys why adding absolutely any animation to a web page spiked CPU - text was the main culprit
16:26 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> these days browser have gotten better about putting that into textures and offloading to GPU - in part because GPUs have gotten better too
16:26 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> but regardless, I don't see why the choice of font should have any significant impact at all
16:26 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> why not let players use whatever font they want?
16:26 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> well. they probably can right?
16:26 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> just copy over the asset
17:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, but in many locations we might be assuming the width of the font
17:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> instead of using a calculation to get the actual width
17:16 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> huh
17:16 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> odd. definitely should be calculating width of the rendered texture from the font
17:16 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> well. apart from maybe approximations
17:16 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> esp due to unicode
17:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but lots of UI stuff is fixed size
17:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> boxes having fixed size, would look weird if they were different size in each language
17:17 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> ehhhh
17:17 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> you could just have a safety margin if it's a key part of the game layout
17:18 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> but  yeah. overflowing happens
17:18 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> you can choose between truncation, animation scroll, or resizing
17:18 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> deen: https://issues.hedgewars.org/show_bug.cgi?id=275  this is still open - it bugs wuzzy more than the others I think ☺
17:18 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> https://issues.hedgewars.org/show_bug.cgi?id=275#c3  in particular is our problem
19:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the problem is that in the background is a highly refreshed game, so you cant just invalidate rects and render "a bit"
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so you have to "render" the text textures to the framebuffer every frame anyway
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and that is not necessaraily faster then compute the few vertices
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but that depends on the GPU cache, i cant tell for what GPUs , but i assume modern GPUs just keep pretty much all textures near to the processors
19:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ofc only bcs teeworlds doesnt use alot of textures
19:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tripple A games are different level maybe it profits from rendering ready textures instead of swapping the font texture always
19:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tripple A games are different level maybe it profits from rendering ready textures instead of swapping the font texture(with the game textures) always
20:01 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> Jupstar: what I mean is, you don't need to rerender the texture itself every frame
20:01 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> so... why does changing the font help
20:01 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> that's the part I don't get
20:01 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> how does any font change at all, result in any significant perf increase
20:02 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> since the font should only be regenerating textures in like 0.0001% of the frames
20:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno what you mean by changing the font
20:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the theoretic problem i see is, that the text that was rendered on textures to not rerender it every frame also needs processing
20:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
20:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> alpha blending etc
22:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Huday> devs, can you make it so when my friend changes their username for teeworlds, it will change their name in my friends list as well?
22:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> no, that's not possible
