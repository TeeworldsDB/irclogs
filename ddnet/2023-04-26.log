08:37 <+ChillerDragon> fixed my asan not giving line numbers by installing `llvm` weird that it broke but hey its fixed
08:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> wtf
09:27 <+bridge> <Avolicious> not gonna lie, this looks promising
09:28 <+bridge> <Avolicious> Could be a smoother competitor to mattermost, because a lot of bots already exists for discord
09:35 <+bridge> <Faulty> Do we have any resource where can look up pre-rendered maps?
09:35 <+bridge> <Faulty> When need to find a map but can't remember the exact logo (like on https://ddnet.org/releases/)
09:35 <+bridge> <Faulty> 
09:35 <+bridge> <Faulty> Also, maybe someone try to render maps from https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/maps ?
09:41 <+bridge> <Faulty> Is that tool https://ddnet.org/mappreview open source?

09:41 <+ChillerDragon> the cursor looks like its eating the characters hm

09:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yes it is open source. It's bit buggy tho
09:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I recommend using patigas twgpu instead
09:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/tw-webgl
09:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Which is also open source
09:46 <+bridge> <Faulty> Cool, thank you
09:59 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1682495957.png
09:59 <+ChillerDragon> the cursor is overlapping with the border of the letters
09:59 <+ChillerDragon> could use some more space imo @Robyt3
10:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> No
10:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It only overlaps with the outline. Just as the outline overlaps with other outlines
10:02 <+ChillerDragon> https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/web/ @Faulty
10:02 <+ChillerDragon> hope the logo is not a quad xd
10:03 <+ChillerDragon> @Faulty there are also tools to extract mapres from maps
10:03 <+bridge> <Faulty> wow, it's already rendered, great
10:03 <+bridge> <Faulty> yeah, I know
10:11 <+bridge> <Faulty> btw is the https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/mapres contains all mapres from https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/maps  and simply categorized?
10:11 <+bridge> <Faulty> or it's was filtered somehow?
10:12 <+ChillerDragon> no its not all
10:12 <+ChillerDragon> its some mapres i found idk where in a bunch of places
10:14 <+ChillerDragon> i also hand filtered some that very super unteeish or trash. Like a random image from another game or something like that
10:16 <+bridge> <Faulty> hm, got it ty
11:31 <+bridge> <Teero> Would be cool to be able to change the cursor width:brownbear:
12:48 <+bridge> <ReiTW> There was guilded also
14:13 <+bridge> <Faulty> btw founded "Invalid Date" for maps after page 33 on https://ddnet.org/releases/33/
14:13 <+bridge> <Faulty> or does this mean that the maps were published so long ago that no release date was kept at the time?

15:01 <+bridge> <Avolicious> But guilded was like discord, no?
15:02 <+bridge> <Avolicious> But guilded was like discord, no? all closed source, no self-host solution
15:02 <+bridge> <ReiTW> exactly
15:16 <@Learath2> Any idea why a process wouldn't receive SIGHUP when it's controlling terminal has been killed?
15:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> was it daemonized?
15:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> also it's â†’ its
15:17 <@Learath2> yes it was
15:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> actually, I don't have a clue ðŸ˜‰
15:20 <+bridge> <ReiTW> wikipedia only talks about :
15:20 <+bridge> <ReiTW> ```
15:20 <+bridge> <ReiTW> This can be circumvented in two ways. Firstly, the Single UNIX Specification describes a shell utility called nohup, which can be used as a wrapper to start a program and make it ignore SIGHUP by default. Secondly, child process groups can be "disowned" by invoking disown with the job id, which removes the process group from the shell's job table (so they will not be sent SIGHUP), or (optionally) keeps them in the job table but prevents them from rec

15:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i need to setup my irc bouncer again
15:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki how long did it take for u to feel comfortable writing your compiler stuff?
15:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> describe comfortable
15:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i still dont know much
15:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> actually, its like coding in lower level than C
15:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> llvm ir that is
15:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Mh. So over six months
15:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> with ur knowledge u can do the same
15:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But aren't u transforming it to llvm ir with rust code?
15:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the only hard stuff imho is control flow analysys
15:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and phi nodes
15:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but i havent touched other stuff
15:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ok
15:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> actually probably the hardest stuff in making a language would be the frontend
15:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> in case of rust
15:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> type analysis, lifetime analysis
15:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> well i say this cuz im not implementing what llvm does
15:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz llvm gives u for free also hard stuff like optimizing
15:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i would describe what im doing like ppl who use pytorch or tensorflow without knowing really deep the underlying mechanisms
15:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> making a simile to ml
15:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but its rly fun
15:42 <@Learath2> mhhh, bspwm forks, does a setsid() in the new fork creating a new session, then execl()s the bspwmrc, which has a shebang that makes it run through bash, it does things like `gentoo-pipewire-launcher &; sxhkd &` then dies
15:42 <@Learath2> how do these processes in this session not get HUP'd even?
15:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks i was rly lost at first tho, not with llvm ir but with mlir
15:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> what u doing learath?
15:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> pipewire too?
15:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> also whats the state of wayland
15:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> can i run it at 144hz with vsync off
15:43 <@Learath2> there has been a long standing curiosity in my mind, when I kill X, sxhkd dies just fine, but pipewire won't die
15:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it wont die or it restarts?
15:44 <@Learath2> it won't die
15:44 <@Learath2> upon further investigation, things launched inside the bspwmrc don't seem to be getting a signal to die at all, so I don't understand how sxhkd knows to die
15:44 <@Learath2> if I launch pipewire from .xinitrc it will get a proper HUP as expected
15:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/think-smart-gif-22411928
15:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ah
15:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i read it somewhere it should be before any exec?
15:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but i forgor
15:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i have it before i exec i3
15:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> in my xinit
15:45 <@Learath2> I don't mind moving it around, I'm just curious what the rules are at this point
15:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> any ideas on stuff to self host?
15:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i have that urge to self host stuff
15:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> like https://git.edgarluque.com/
15:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Jellyfin
15:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Matrix
15:46 <@Learath2> > All of the processes in a session share a controlling terminal. The controlling terminal is established when the session leader first opens a terminal
15:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Openhub for ur solar panels monitoring
15:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont have panels sadly
15:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> if i ever own a house ill do my own IoT stuff with rust
15:47 <@Learath2> After the setsid(), the execl results in the launching of bash, which should promptly become the controlling terminal :/
15:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Openhub and buy wifi electricity switches
15:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> So u can turn on ur PC from anywhere
15:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i have a aquarium with a betta fish
15:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i always thought of automating stuff there
15:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Gitlab
15:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> giving it food, open and closing lights
15:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Minecraft Server for friends
15:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no friends
15:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i would actually make a service to host cheap teeworlds servers as a startup if ddos wasnt a problem
15:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
15:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> bloat
15:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Tru xd
15:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> That's all I host
15:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> So no more ideas from me
15:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ah wait
15:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Nextcloud
15:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Xd
15:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> HDDs cheap af.
15:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> my server has no hdd
15:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I also monitor electricity usage
15:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> So that also possible without solar panels

15:56 <+bridge> <Learath2> Ah, another mystery solved, if there is no tty attached then a terminal won't become the controlling terminal
15:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i also use prometheus
15:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and deno
15:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> instead of nodejs
15:57 <+bridge> <Learath2> So the terminal dying kills nothing. sxhkd was dying because it lost connection with the x server, not because bspwm died
15:57 <+bridge> <Learath2> Now the mystery is why pipewire won't similarly die when the dbus session dies
15:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz pipewire is god
15:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and u dont question god
15:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> follow templeos teachings
15:58 <+bridge> <Learath2> btw, it's actually quite interesting how complicated these process lifetime things are, much more intricate then I expected
15:59 <+bridge> <Learath2> I didn't even know sessions were a thing
15:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> me neither xd
16:00 <+bridge> <Learath2> I wonder if there is a small application that can die and kill it's children when another pid dies
16:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this reminds me of erlang and otp
16:01 <+bridge> <deen> Just attach the children to the other pid and then let them auto-die when parent dies?
16:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/processes.html
16:02 <+bridge> <Learath2> Can a process reparent itself?
16:02 <+bridge> <deen> Apparently not, too bad ðŸ˜„
16:03 <+bridge> <Learath2> Hm, this is actually quite annoying
16:03 <+bridge> <bencie> sorry but clicking into this channel and reading this first sounds so bad out of context ðŸ˜­ ðŸ’€
16:04 <+bridge> <Learath2> I guess I'll write a small program that waits until x dies
16:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's only possible since pidfds are a thing, I think
16:05 <+bridge> <Learath2> what is?
16:07 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> waiting for a non-child process to die
16:15 < jupstar> @Learath2 gpt-4 wants to help you:
16:15 < jupstar> Learath2 has two main problems to understand:      Why a process wouldn't receive SIGHUP when its controlling terminal has been killed.     Why pipewire won't die when the dbus session dies.  For the first problem, it is important to understand that not all processes receive the SIGHUP signal when the controlling terminal is closed. Daemon processes usually detach themselves from the controlling terminal using techniques such as setsid(
16:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this channel turned into child killing
16:16 < jupstar>  which is the case with the process Learath2 mentioned. When the controlling terminal dies, the process doesn't receive the SIGHUP signal because it is no longer associated with the terminal.  Regarding the second problem, pipewire might not be dying when the dbus session dies because it doesn't have a direct dependency on the dbus session for its operation. While sxhkd dies because it loses connection with the X server, pipewire might 
16:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> sometimes dev slang is quite something xd
16:16 < jupstar> running even if the dbus session is gone. To debug this issue, it would be helpful to check the pipewire documentation or look into its source code to understand how it handles dbus session termination.  Additionally, Learath2 wondered if there's a small application that can die and kill its children when another pid dies. One possible solution is to use a process supervisor like systemd or Supervisor, which can manage the lifetime of p
16:16 < jupstar> s. By configuring the process supervisor properly, it can be set up to terminate child processes when a specified process (such as the dbus session) dies.
16:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> is implementing ur own dbus something extreme?
16:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> suddenly irc
16:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> All statements without guarantee xd
16:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i never looked at the protocol but seems like something to rewrite in rust
16:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> one less systemd dep
16:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> udev :justatest:
16:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> is dbus systemd?
16:19 <+bridge> <Patiga> @Jupeyy_Keks just found this ^^ https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/c5o03v/teeworlds_web_edition_c_game_compiled_to/
16:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think not
16:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> udev is the message daemon part of dbus that is part of systemd
16:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but gentoo uses it by default even if u dont use systemd

16:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh lol reddit got updated?
16:21 <+bridge> <Patiga> don't think so
16:21 <+bridge> <Patiga> I have the sane comment layout
16:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> What is new reddit?
16:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the current reddit
16:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the one with unreadable comments
16:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> where it shows you like 5 comments and you have to click "load more"
16:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> What is old reddit xDD
16:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i use new reddit, but because i like it more for scrolling mindlessly for memes

16:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 did the cia find u
16:42 <+bridge> <Learath2> it's fstd's domain, either he is in an american jail or has a sense of humor
16:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> lmao
16:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Didn't work Learath for nsa
16:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I remember something
16:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> contributed to ghidra
16:43 <+bridge> <Learath2> I may have contributed a couple lines of Java :hypervomit: to ghidra
16:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Xd
16:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :cammostripes:
16:45 <+bridge> <Learath2> There remains one more issue with this set up that I'll need to debug, if I launch firefox through clicking a discord link it gets frozen :/
16:45 <+bridge> <Learath2> clicking a link in discord rather*
16:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Btw do we maintain the IRC bridge source ?
16:46 <+bridge> <Learath2> I don't even know what bridge we use
16:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks do u know if the wayland api is ez?
16:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> how would u think it takes to make my own window manager in rust
16:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It seems like it cut some stuff. But irc-> discord should not cut stuff. Other way around makes more sense
16:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I guess the main API Is ez. But to emulate all x11 stuff or workaround for limitations they have lot of extra protocol stuff
16:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But i never used it
16:48 <+bridge> <Learath2> btw I'd already considered what gpt said, I assumed the new bash instance would immediately become the new controlling terminal in the session, however there is one exception to that rule, and that is O_NOCTTY
16:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Wayland itself is only few thousand code lines xd
16:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://docs.rs/wayland-protocols/0.30.0/wayland_protocols/
16:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The competitors probably much more
16:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im gonna look into this
16:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i wonder the best way to test his
16:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> dont rly wanna mess my system
16:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and i dont even have wayland xd
16:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> should i migrate to wayland
16:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Use smth like sddm and make your own project separate from Ur system in some unused directory
16:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I will migrate after kde 6 is out
16:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It's better than x11 in many regards
16:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u rly are suggesting me to use a systemd program
16:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> heresy
16:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yeah
16:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Shoot into Learaths legs
16:59 <+bridge> <Learath2> <a:angery:987142042616496189>
17:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> probably cut at the IRC server, not the bridge
17:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the bridge we use is called matterbridge
17:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge
17:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i like how gentoo compiling everything pushes u into removing unnecessary stuff
17:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and being minimal sometimes
17:01 <+bridge> <Learath2> good habits :Celebrate:
17:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> sudo emerge --deselect gcc
17:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> lets use rust only
17:02 <+bridge> <Learath2> fwiw they do run a test bench with only clang as the system compiler
17:02 <+bridge> <Learath2> Though I think they still use gcc for the kernel, because kernel weird
17:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> gcc 13 is out
17:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think they wanted to add gccrs
17:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but wasnt in time
17:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://rust-gcc.github.io/2023/04/24/gccrs-and-gcc13-release.html
17:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ok BCS on my client i saw it correctly
17:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the client you sent it from?
17:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the server doesn't tell you what you sent
17:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks btw i bought the 110â‚¬ noctua cooler
17:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/money-dollars-cash-rich-raining-money-gif-3555044
17:14 <+bridge> <Voxel> nice dev log
17:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> what log
17:15 <+bridge> <Voxel> exactly
17:15 <+bridge> <Voxel> this is #developer
17:15 <+bridge> <Learath2> My brilliant invention doesn't work, pipewire seems to disable parent signals itself
17:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yeah. It was the web client. Well doesn't matter IRC is weird if the client didn't even know it's character limit xd
17:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1100808071153995836/image.png
17:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hm?
17:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
17:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i guess u didnt see art attack when young
17:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> that guy resembles a lot
17:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> meme
17:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xD
18:21 <+bridge> <murpi> My game just randomly crashed, if someone wants to take a look:

18:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> what version, nightly or normal
18:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> steam or website
18:22 <+bridge> <murpi> steam, nightly windows 10 64bit
18:29 <+bridge> <Voxel> oh shit
18:29 <+bridge> <Voxel> hold on lemme look at this
18:33 <+bridge> <Learath2> https://paste.pr0.tips/skc?c
18:34 <+bridge> <Learath2> It was surprisingly annoying to get this right
18:50 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ```cpp
18:50 <+bridge> <gerdoe> Kill.m_KillerRenderInfo = m_pClient->m_aClients[Kill.m_KillerID].m_RenderInfo;```
18:50 <+bridge> <gerdoe> 
18:50 <+bridge> <gerdoe> seems to appear with `m_aClients[...]` dereferencing
18:50 <+bridge> <gerdoe> dk tho
18:51 <+bridge> <gerdoe> literally the `killmessages.cpp:210-212`
18:53 <+bridge> <Voxel> im at work until like 5 hours later so like i cant fix it rn
18:53 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ah no wait
18:53 <+bridge> <gerdoe> im wrong
18:53 <+bridge> <gerdoe> there's no references
18:53 <+bridge> <gerdoe> only `m_pClient`
18:54 <+bridge> <gerdoe> strange
19:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh voxel missed a null pointer!
19:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> rust would have protected you, but u didnt embrace it
19:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :trolloween:
19:02 <+bridge> <Voxel> YEAHHHH REDDIT NATION!
19:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> how is this related to reddit tho
19:03 <+bridge> <k2d222> when is the donttalkaboutrustday again?
19:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> yesterday
19:03 <+bridge> <Voxel> it was a nice day
19:03 <+bridge> <Voxel> rust devs are absolute reddit mods
19:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> lol no
19:04 <+bridge> <Voxel> same exact personalities
19:08 <+bridge> <Voxel> anyways ill look into it if no one else does in 5 hours
19:14 <+bridge> <bencie> im getting alot of crashes, could they be related to this?
19:14 <+bridge> <bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1100832389896360006/DDNet_crash_log_11068_2023-04-26_19-06-44.RTP

19:15 <+bridge> <bencie> nonstop crashing
19:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> do u compile ur own client
19:15 <+bridge> <bencie> no
19:16 <+bridge> <bencie> steam version, nightly
19:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks why dont we also release a nightly version with debuginfo?
19:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i know we have the crashlogs
19:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> if i was at home and not with a stupid macos m1 i would look into it
19:17 <+bridge> <Robyt3> The crash logs are all identical to the first one you posted
19:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> robyt is here, we are saved
19:18 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Compiling nightly as release with debug info would be good idea IMO
19:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
19:18 <+bridge> <bencie> also sidenote for voxel that theres other bugs with killfeed now, such as teams now showing up on death, but ill just report it when i can reproduce it
19:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it makes lot of sense xD
19:18 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Then we don't need to decode the crash logs
19:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i guess simply bcs its always 40mb to download
19:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but would make it a bit easier^^
19:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> lets be honest
19:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> most ppl use nightly to test
19:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> well some play yeah
19:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but 40mb on top of 60 is nothing for most ppl
19:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> tbh, we could also completly release with debug info
19:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> who the fuck cares about 40mb xD
19:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> we should imho
19:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah who cares
19:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the benefit we get is bigger
19:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @bencie already back nice. nobody can leave teeworlds
19:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> he didnt leave tw i think just mod
19:20 <+bridge> <bencie> im not quitting tw, just cutting down on online time + stepped down as a mod
19:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but why step down
19:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i bet 95% of all mods are more inactive xD
19:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> indeed
19:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @snail hi, how u doing
19:22 <+bridge> <bencie> yeah i know, i wanna focus on some stuff irl, and stepping down allows me to "stress" less about moderation and remove guilt of not doing anything as a mod ðŸ™‚ i feel bad if i dont do anything
19:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i see i see, lets continue smiling ðŸ¥²
19:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its ok if bencie wants mod he will get it back
19:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest: like me who used to be a mod :justatest:
19:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lmaoÂ³
19:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ryo as mod:
19:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> "Do you like rust?"
19:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
19:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Random person that never coded:
19:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> "No"
19:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
19:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> So you have chosen death
19:25 <+bridge> <Chairn> you don't have to. use tail like this
19:25 <+bridge> <Chairn> `tail --pid=$pid -f /dev/null`
19:26 <+bridge> <Learath2> Where were you 3 hours ago?
19:26 <+bridge> <Chairn> unfortunately ðŸ˜¦
19:26 <+bridge> <Learath2> https://paste.pr0.tips/skc?c here is what I ended up with
19:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Chairn do u teach ur students the art of linux, and the daily sermon on how bad windows is?
19:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i would be the most biased teacher
19:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and not hold bac
19:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xD
19:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡©
19:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks look self referential structs are ez in rust! https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/#example-self-referential-struct
19:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Long ago, the programming world lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Rust Nation attacked. Only the Compiler, master of all four programming languages, could stop them. But when the world needed it most, it vanished.
19:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
19:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> A hundred years passed, and my team and I discovered the new Compiler, a developer named Aang. And although his Rust skills are great, he still has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.
19:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
19:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But I believe Aang can bring balance to the programming world.
19:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
19:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Water. Earth. Fire. Air.
19:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
19:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> C Nation, rooted in the art of simplicity and performance, laid the foundation for generations to come, mastering the element of Water.
19:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
19:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> C++ Nation, built upon the legacy of C, introduced object-oriented programming and template metaprogramming, mastering the element of Earth.
19:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
19:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Java Nation, with its platform-independent bytecode and virtual machine, embraced the power of portability and managed environments, mastering the element of Air.
19:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
19:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> And Rust Nation, rising with its memory safety and fearless concurrency, sought to revolutionize systems programming and claim its place among the greats, mastering the element of Fire.
19:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
19:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Together, these four programming languages shaped the world of software development, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Yet, it is the Compiler's destiny to bring balance and harmony by understanding and integrating the wisdom of all four languages.
19:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> GPT-4 xD
19:31 <+bridge> <Chairn> working, having classes all day this week
19:31 <+bridge> <Chairn> today, i showed 2 groups regex when they had to rename some signals in VHDL
19:31 <+bridge> <Chairn> i prefer tail version ðŸ˜„
19:32 <+bridge> <Robyt3> According to the crash log, there is a null pointer access at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/fcee2fa6a70e0f7dd70d6ecc16e825d5d551077b/src/game/client/components/killmessages.cpp#L212, but that seems impossible to me
19:32 <+bridge> <Chairn> good thing that i read all #developer though
19:33 <+bridge> <Chairn> can `str_copy` overflow?
19:33 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Should be safe unless the size is 0
19:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thats implementation defined ðŸ¤“
19:33 <+bridge> <Chairn> is the size 0 ?
19:33 <+bridge> <Chairn> or even negative maybe?
19:34 <+bridge> <Robyt3> no, it's using the template str_copy, so it uses the array size 64
19:35 <+bridge> <Robyt3> m_pClient can't be nullptr, because it would have crashed earlier
19:35 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Kill.m_KillerID is also in the correct range
19:38 <+bridge> <snail> @Ryozuki hi fellow developer
19:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :poggers2:
19:38 <+bridge> <Learath2> I wonder how tail does it
19:39 <+bridge> <snail> how does it feel to be soon a managee of anxton
19:39 <+bridge> <snail> :gigachad:
19:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @snail did u  learn rust yet
19:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd wat
19:39 <+bridge> <Chairn> well, just look it's implementation ðŸ˜„
19:39 <+bridge> <snail> no i dont want anxton to be my team leader :justatest:
19:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
19:39 <+bridge> <Chairn> anxton, french player?
19:39 <+bridge> <snail> yes but im just memeing
19:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> anxton will lead a company cuz he goes to a top uni
19:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
19:40 <+bridge> <snail> XD
19:40 <+bridge> <Voxel> Yeah, I dunno how to make this as perfect as it can be.
19:40 <+bridge> <Voxel> I just wanted to clean up the killfeed because the way it used to be was ugly af
19:42 <+bridge> <Voxel> r/angryupvote
19:42 <+bridge> <Voxel> r/memes
19:42 <+bridge> <Chairn> damn, another HEC student i guess...
19:42 <+bridge> <snail> HEC LUL
19:42 <+bridge> <snail> far from it
19:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @snail where does he go
19:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i forgor
19:42 <+bridge> <snail> getting to HEC is actually extremely hard
19:43 <+bridge> <Chairn> he said top uni though
19:43 <+bridge> <snail> @Chairn he goes "Enseeiht - Toulouse INP"
19:43 <+bridge> <Chairn> was it technical uni at least?
19:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Chairn its cuz anxton says he will be a better dev and non web dev cuz he goes to a good uni now
19:43 <+bridge> <snail> @Chairn he goes to "Enseeiht - Toulouse INP"
19:43 <+bridge> <Chairn> ah that's just regular engineering school though
19:43 <+bridge> <Voxel> :cammostripes:
19:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ðŸ’€
19:44 <+bridge> <snail> idk he gave this ranking <https://etudiant.lefigaro.fr/etudes/ecoles-ingenieurs/classement-informatique/> and said its top school
19:44 <+bridge> <snail> dunno what this ranking is worth
19:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @snail https://www.fib.upc.edu/en
19:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> where does this uni rank
19:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
19:45 <+bridge> <Chairn> java as air element is laughable given the heavyness of jave vm
19:45 <+bridge> <snail> idk its a french ranking

19:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universitat-politecnica-de-catalunya-barcelonatech-upc
19:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i went to this 1 year
19:46 <+bridge> <Chairn> kinda hard to rate schools, rankings can be easily biased
19:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> true
19:55 <+bridge> <Chairn> this is actually undecipherable:
19:55 <+bridge> <Chairn> <https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/blob/master/src/tail.c>
19:55 <+bridge> <Chairn> but they either use polling or inotify (according to some comments)
19:59 <+bridge> <k2d222> Once upon a time, in the world of programming, there were four languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, and Go. They worked together to create amazing applications for their users, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
19:59 <+bridge> <k2d222> 
19:59 <+bridge> <k2d222> One day, a new language appeared on the scene: Rust. Rust was known for its speed and efficiency, but it had a dark side. Its strict rules for memory management and complex syntax made it difficult to learn and use. The other languages knew they had to act fast to stop Rust from taking over the programming world.
19:59 <+bridge> <k2d222> 
19:59 <+bridge> <k2d222> Together, they went on a quest to find the source of Rust's power. They traveled through treacherous mountains and dense forests, encountering many obstacles along the way. But they did not give up, for they knew that the fate of the programming world was at stake.
19:59 <+bridge> <k2d222> 
19:59 <+bridge> <k2d222> Finally, they arrived at the lair of Rust, where they were met with a fierce battle. Python used its simplicity and ease of use to distract Rust, while Java used its scalability and versatility to outsmart it. JavaScript used its power and flexibility to create complex programs, while Go used its concurrency and speed to overwhelm Rust.
19:59 <+bridge> <k2d222> 
19:59 <+bridge> <k2d222> In the end, the four languages emerged victorious. They had defeated Rust and saved the programming world from its tyranny. They returned home, where they continued to create amazing applications for their users, each language complementing the others' strengths and weaknesses.
19:59 <+bridge> <k2d222> 
19:59 <+bridge> <k2d222> And so, Python, Java, JavaScript, and Go lived happily ever after, knowing that their combined powers were enough to overcome even the most formidable opponent.
20:00 <+bridge> <k2d222> gotta balance the energies
20:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> which gpt is that
20:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the last sentence is weird xD
20:02 <+bridge> <k2d222> the greatest truthest wisest of all the gpts
20:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> dont tell me u wrote it xD
20:03 <+bridge> <k2d222> wth no way too lazy for that XD
20:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im confused
20:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> would a window manager i implement be a wayland server or client
20:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:58 <+bridge> <Learath2> A server
20:58 <+bridge> <Learath2> "Window managers" in "wayland" are part of the display server
21:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh some docs here
21:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html/ch01.html
21:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ryoWM incoming
21:20 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> be prepared
21:26 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> I want a competitor to wayland and x11 just because itâ€™s not annoying enough to have two half working ones. Please build one more @Ryozuki
21:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oof
21:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u need big adoption to make a competitor so its hard for a random to compete
21:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> wayland is probs the future
21:27 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Good that you are not a random
21:27 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Now stop the excuses and get hacking
21:28 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> ryo11land all the way
21:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i wanna make my own environment
21:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> as in, window manager, terminal emulator, ryobash, idk whatt else
21:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and then live in a cave
21:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> with rust plushies
21:29 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
21:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> why not ryost?
21:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ryoOS
21:29 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> TempleOS in holyRust
21:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> making a os is kinda hard
21:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ryost, the language
21:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i followed a tutorial but it stopped
21:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh
21:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> that too
21:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> actually thats more doable  than a OS
21:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/ryoOS
21:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> need to revive this
21:30 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Why reinvent the wheel if you can reinvent the car
21:30 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> missed opportunity to call it ryOS
21:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its still early
21:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i can rename it
21:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> why ryost for the language name tho?
21:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> is that not obvious?
21:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its hard to pronounce as a spanish speaker
21:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ah rust
21:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> os, lang, window manager, shell, terminal
21:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> what else
21:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> templeos had it all
21:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> a vulkan alt xD
21:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i once looked a bit at implementing a usb driver
21:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> god its long the specification
21:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and i dont know much about drivers
21:34 <+bridge> <Learath2> for ryoOS? ðŸ˜„
21:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://wiki.osdev.org/Universal_Serial_Bus
21:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
21:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> making a serial interface  to qemu is easy
21:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thats why ryoOS has tests
21:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thanks to uart_16550
21:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://crates.io/crates/uart_16550
21:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/ryoOS/blob/master/tests/heap_allocation.rs
21:37 <+bridge> <Learath2> try OHCI, should be easier ðŸ˜›
21:38 <+bridge> <Learath2> Actually wait, UHCI is also a thing, maybe 2.0 is easier to target in that case ðŸ˜„
21:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i made this os stuff before i had a job
21:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> now its harder to find time
21:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> sadge
21:39 <+bridge> <Learath2> > Therefore, the system programmer must support all three standards in order to support USB 2.0. 
21:39 <+bridge> <Learath2> Nvm you need to support both OHCI, UHCI and EHCI for 2.0 ðŸ˜„
21:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
21:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> usb is no joke
21:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think supporting the old mouse interface  is easier
21:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u know the big round connector
21:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i forgot name
21:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ps/2
21:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> playstation 2
21:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> PS/2 port
21:40 <+bridge> <Learath2> Oh apparently xHCI does support 1.0 and 2.0 without needing a companion controller, so maybe just implementing an xhci driver is enough
21:41 <+bridge> <Learath2> > Unfortunately, this means that xHCI bears only a passing resemblance to the controllers that came before it, and make it challenging to write drivers for. 
21:41 <+bridge> <Learath2> Ok, nvm apparently implementing USB is pain no matter what you target
21:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xdd
21:41 <+bridge> <Learath2> Don't ps/2 devices just interrupt the cpu directly? ðŸ˜„
21:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1100869440008101918/Ps2-kbc.png
21:42 <+bridge> <Voxel> thinking about what other ui elements need to be touched up. i dont think there are any
21:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> >  It involves a controller (e.g. "8042 chip" on PC compatible systems), the mechanical and electrical details of the communication itself, and a device.
21:42 <+bridge> <Learath2> The freeze bar can use some work
21:43 <+bridge> <Voxel> in what sense? i think it's fine right now
21:44 <+bridge> <Learath2> In the sense that you can remove it and replace it with stars because it's devils work
21:46 <+bridge> <Robyt3> I tried adding markers for every second to the freeze bar, but I seems the important part about the stars is the rhythm. Maybe we should add back a sound for freeze seconds ticking down?
21:46 <+bridge> <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1100870547782504468/image.png
21:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> did we have a sound before? ðŸ˜®
21:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe flashing the bar when it hits a second mark
21:47 <+bridge> <Robyt3> I never play with sound lol
21:47 <+bridge> <Robyt3> If it's not the sound then I'm not as convinced about the rhythm argument
21:47 <+bridge> <Robyt3> I think flashing could be too irritating though
21:47 <+bridge> <Voxel> ehh, might be too distracting
21:48 <+bridge> <Robyt3> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6028#issuecomment-1414298132
21:55 <+bridge> <Ravie> might be a good time to bring this up, long ago I reworked the freezebar and other stuff and put it all together in one image, is someone interested in updating to it?
21:55 <+bridge> <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1100872789361184819/image.png
21:56 <+bridge> <Voxel> yes PLEASE
21:57 <+bridge> <Voxel> i absolutely hate extras.png
21:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> whats extras.png
21:57 <+bridge> <Ravie> the image with only snowflake in it
21:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> what are the shield weapons?
21:58 <+bridge> <Ravie> as you can see we can also remove weapon shields from game.png and get rid of arrow.png
21:58 <+bridge> <Ravie> they're a redesign for the ugly ones currently in game.png
21:59 <+bridge> <Ravie> someone used the HUD shield as pickup and also made weird art choices for them
22:00 <+bridge> <Ravie> some people also want recolorable weak/strong so colors are part of the image now
22:01 <+bridge> <bencie> yeahhh this change would be nice af
22:01 <+bridge> <bencie> +1
22:08 <+bridge> <Patiga> I currently still think a slightly thinner/thicker hook to visually represent that would look cleaner. I don't think the transition between the textures would be noticable
22:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then we could finally merge game.svg xd
22:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> only entities and some minor mapres missing
22:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and we are complete HD ready
22:36 <+bridge> <Ravie> oh no
22:43 <+bridge> <Voxel> nah he means svg compatability, not 4k stuff
22:43 <+bridge> <Voxel> i thinks
22:43 <+bridge> <Voxel> @Jupeyy_Keks right or wrong
22:44 <+bridge> <Ravie> I mean using HD render of some smelly remakes is still worse than the real thing
22:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ?
22:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The remakes are often better than the original
22:50 <+bridge> <Ravie> nah
22:51 <+bridge> <Ravie> it's rare, stuff like vanilla tilesets will never be as good as the original
22:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Well u don't have to use them
22:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I trust facts. Vanilla stuff is often off 1-2 pixels
22:52 <+bridge> <Ravie> to me at least the subtleties of the original are more important than some more resolution, which someone remaking might not understand
22:52 <+bridge> <Ravie> it irks me when some line is slightly too thick or a little crooked
22:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds like Jupstar is saying this is the case for vanilla stuff
