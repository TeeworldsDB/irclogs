00:20 < bridge> <ReiTW> chillerdragon: what's your website again for the netcode documentation ? (0.6 DDNet)
00:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/06/system_messages.html
00:20 < bridge> <ReiTW> ah thanks 😄
07:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 0.6 stuff is a bit less documented than 0.7 and ddnet specifics are not documented at all yet .\_. But ye what Heinrich sent
07:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@ReiTW)
07:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @heinrich5991\: pro mozilla contributor https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1543
10:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Nice, next step: make Firefox great again
10:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1546
10:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> cool young project, lots of stuff to be fixed
10:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> feels like rust in the old days *nostalgic noises*
10:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 when will u join Mozilla? You like network, u like rust, you like Firefox
10:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds like a good match indeed
10:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> dunno
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And they like backward compability😂😂😂😂😂
10:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> like I do, unironically ^^
10:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: do you know whether there's a bytes type in ruby?
10:45 <+ChillerDragon> i knew u gonna ask me that xd i never bothered to check for my network stuff i used a array of ints and then a packer function
10:45 <+ChillerDragon> but i would not be suprised if there actually is none
10:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://ruby-doc.org/3.2.2/String.html
10:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > A String object has an arbitrary sequence of bytes, typically representing text or **binary data**. A `String` object may be created using `String::new` or as literals.
10:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so `String`, maybe?
10:46 <+ChillerDragon> yes thats the closest
10:47 <+ChillerDragon> when packing those int arrays they get represented as a string
10:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> does ruby have an interactive interpreter?
10:47 <+ChillerDragon> yes irb
10:47 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684313272.png
10:48 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684313294.png
10:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
10:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> irb(main):003:0> [255].pack("C*")
10:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> => "\xFF"
10:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
10:48 <+ChillerDragon> yes its super weird tho
10:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so it supports non-utf8 as well
10:48 <+ChillerDragon> because it looks like a regular string
10:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds like ruby doesn't distinguish between bytes and strings
10:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which I'd consider a language design flaw, like in C/C++
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684313348.png
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> look at this madness
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> maybe im just python brainwashed xd
10:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you look at it with a C++ lens, this looks sensible
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> yea ruby tries really hard to not be technical and easy to use
10:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> from python/rust, this looks like madness
10:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> anyway, thanks for the hint
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> in c++ you have the escape sequences tho
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i can blame it on my irb having bad color support
10:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the escape sequences?
10:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which do you mean?
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> if \x would be colored like in python i would not complain
10:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> lol ^^
10:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's "just" a syntax highlighting issue
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> yes
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684313449.png
10:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe your editor can highlight it?
10:51 <+ChillerDragon> is that even valid c?
10:51 <+ChillerDragon> i never used that in c
10:51 <+ChillerDragon> only \n
10:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
10:51 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684313498.png
10:51 <+ChillerDragon> ok my irb sucks xd
10:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> equivalent to `"hello world\042"`
10:51 <+ChillerDragon> ye so it C 
10:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> :p
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> > And they like backward compability😂😂😂😂😂
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> !jup xd
10:54 < chillerbot> @Jupstar ✪
10:55 <+ChillerDragon> ez irc replies
10:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: so it's going to take a couple more days at the very least if I wait for my bytes PR
10:56 <+ChillerDragon> ye open src is slow ik
10:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is that fine, or should I try publishing the huffman stuff without the niceties
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> yes yes
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> im somewhat blocked by it to continue working on snap stuff in my py lib buts fine there is plenty other stuff i can work on isntead
10:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you answered an "or" question with "yes" 😄
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> axaxaxax
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> is that fine,
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> yes
10:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ok 🙂
11:00 <+ChillerDragon> does it generate py stubs btw?
11:00 <+ChillerDragon> for type annotation
11:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what generates py stubs?
11:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it generates some python code for calling the rust code
11:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it doesn't have type annotations AFAICT
11:01 <+ChillerDragon> sad
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> i was hoping the mozilla thingy looks at the rust types and adds nice annotations to the py code so my ide can show my type hints
11:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds doable, but not implemented
11:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> probably a nice project :p
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> :D
11:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm not kidding ^^
11:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> see that I made a couple of issues and PRs 🙂
11:10 <+ChillerDragon> i know ur not
11:10 <+ChillerDragon> its still kinda funny
11:10 <+ChillerDragon> im a giggly guy
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> I will not do it. But I would appreciate if you do it hehe.
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> You can put it on your cv for the mozilla interview :p
11:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> giggles
11:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> are there english words with 3 gs like this one
11:28 <+ChillerDragon> 2 g is also cool already imo
11:28 <+ChillerDragon> snuggle, jiggle, wiggle 
12:02 < bridge> <Learath2> I can do 4 gs. Giggling
12:03 < bridge> <Learath2> Goggles, Aggreeing
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Already 16 hours since ryo mentioned rust the last time
12:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
12:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> holding back to not get banned
12:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hello ban avoiderzuki
12:16 < bridge> <itgjlop7h> #iltech\:matrix.org
13:30 < bridge> <Chairn> why though? They're exactly the same thing, array of data
13:31 < bridge> <Chairn> okay, main difference is null terminated string
13:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because being able to rely on an encoding, or that the string is well-formed is very powerful
13:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it allows you to print stuff to the console without having to consider stray non-utf8 bytes e.g.
13:32 < bridge> <Chairn> same for bytes, you don't know what they represent (i.e. encoding)
13:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's what you get with a separate string type
13:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you know that it represents unicode codepoints, e.g. encoded in utf-8 in rust, or something weirder in python
13:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it sets a clear boundary in the type system about who is supposed to check stuff
13:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's kind of like optional types, I guess
13:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you see why optional types can help produce better code than implicitly nullable pointers?
13:35 < bridge> <Chairn> i don't even know what optional types are 🙂
13:36 < bridge> <Chairn> but i think i see your point
13:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> optional types are like "either a file or nothing"
13:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in C/C++, they're sometimes implemented as pointer which can have a value or be nullptr
13:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in C++, references are not nullable, they always represent a value
14:02 <+ChillerDragon> Im not too sold on the whole some none thing in rust but i guess i just lack some time actually writing rust
14:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's not a rust-only thing, other language have it too ^^
14:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> even C++ got it
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Hello rustians. Someone knows an technically equivalent to atomicptr which forces me to check for null? Else i guess I have to write it my own;)
14:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its ADTs
14:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type
14:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicPtr.html ?
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That doesn't enforce a nullptr check sadly
14:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what do u want to do
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I have a pointer and it's either valid or nullptr
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And to not forget nullptr check i now wrapped it
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So NVM the question
14:24 < bridge> <Chairn> ```c++
14:24 < bridge> <Chairn> MyClass operator->()
14:24 < bridge> <Chairn> ```
14:24 < bridge> <Chairn> no ?
14:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Urgh, a cppstian
14:25 < bridge> <Voxel> how do you pronounce that
14:26 < bridge> <Voxel> :justatest:
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Something similar to Czech
14:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you kinda have to add some kind of ownership concept to the atomicptr though, right?
14:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> to make it safe
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can only guarantee the safeness BCS it's an explicit function call inside the lifetime of the object, and is not called from multiple threads
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So unsafe rust here
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Else I'd need a arc mutex, but I'm in a hot path. So prefer small overhead
14:32 < bridge> <Voxel> thats counterinutitivd
14:32 < bridge> <Voxel> thats counterinutitive
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I didn't write the function that i call, nothing i can do really
14:33 < bridge> <Voxel> ah
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But good idea, the wrapper should directly return the mutable reference, then i don't have to struggle with dereferencing ^^

16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh shit
16:53 < bridge> <ReiTW> sony just need to acquire take two
16:53 < bridge> <ReiTW> and ez win
17:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would u say its safe to grant network access aslong no other IO is allowed?
17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh dos is maybe a problem
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe i should only grant access to ddnet.org xd
17:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or strong rate limit, 1 request per minute
17:17 < bridge> <Learath2> what are you even making?
17:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> gg
17:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i oficially implemented a hashmap in llvm ir
17:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> pro moves
17:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> need to iron out some bugs tho xd
17:19 < bridge> <Learath2> why did you do it in llvm ir btw? 😄
17:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the hashmap is like a native type of the language
17:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and cuz i can
17:20 < bridge> <Learath2> you could technically implement it in terms of arrays in your language, but I see
17:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wonder
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i play around with wasmer
17:21 < bridge> <ReiTW> wut are u doing
17:21 < bridge> <Learath2> cool cool cool
17:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks @Learath2 would u consider leaving (my current job, 33k) for another (50k+) that might not be as interesting as the one i have?
17:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im faced with a hard decision
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i personally would never give up on a job as long as i like it
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as soon as i dislike its fine
17:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah same
17:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but 50k+ is life changing
17:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
17:22 < bridge> <Learath2> not as interesting bus is it still rust?
17:22 < bridge> <Learath2> but*
17:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye its rust too
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mhh ok
17:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but probs harder to learn from others
17:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the culture at my current company is amazing
17:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> everybody is a dev
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well really depends on if u need the money
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i tell if u get a job u dislike, its horror
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it gets worse every day
17:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah i know xd
17:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i had a bad  job once
17:23 < bridge> <Learath2> Here is what I'd do, I'd tell my boss that I've received a 50k+ offer and ask him whether he'd be willing to give me a little raise so I stay
17:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i had to use nodejs
17:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah i probs will do that
17:23 < bridge> <Learath2> or even better "so I can have something I can think about"
17:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its a good excuse to say, hey this is actually the current market rate for my abilities
17:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
17:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i never talked about this before with a company
17:24 < bridge> <Learath2> If you don't mind a more boring job then just take it imo, if not then just use it as leverage for a raise
17:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i always left, cuz i didnt have attatchments
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can also ask him why he cant pay more
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> trick him xd
17:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i never asked them to pay me more
17:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> more like when we negotiated
17:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i came from a 25k salary
17:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i boldly asked 33k
17:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i got 33k
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lel
17:25 < bridge> <Learath2> If you can get another 7k~ out of it to meet you in the middle then it might be worth sticking around
17:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 33k is rly gud here
17:25 < bridge> <Learath2> Another 7k is enough for 7 japan trips a year
17:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but idk the real rate for devs like me
17:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> who r good
17:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 70k
17:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i guess
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> depends on the region tho
17:26 < bridge> <Learath2> I mean if you have an offer for 50k+, then that's about the rate I guess 😄
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but in big cities u should easily get 70k with 4-5 years experience
17:26 < bridge> <Learath2> That's how capitalism works, you are worth as much as the industry is willing to pay, not more not less
17:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> do u ask this to HR
17:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or ur direct boss
17:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wonder
17:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im bad at this corpo stuff
17:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> boss
17:27 < bridge> <Learath2> boss I'd think but I'm not a corpo either
17:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tell him he either pays or he shall call you boss from now on
17:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> boss here being project manager
17:27 < bridge> <gerdoe> why not? you will have new persons to talk with
17:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in my company i have more ppl to talk with than this new one
17:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and they are all rust devs
17:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and  erlang elixir
17:28 < bridge> <gerdoe> hm no way
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki r u tryhard person?
17:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont doubt this company i am rn can pay me 50k
17:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think they can
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or do ur 2 commits and call it a day
17:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> depends a lot on what project im working on
17:28 < bridge> <Learath2> don't be this bold if you want to keep the job 😄
17:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if its something i like
17:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im the most tryhard
17:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> bnut i know how to slack
17:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> there are days i cant bother
17:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and do 1 commit to make it like im working
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so tell the boss u really like the job and invest lot of time in it and you are worth the money
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can ensure u he wouldnt just fire u
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in worst case he says no
17:29 < bridge> <Learath2> this, neoliberals love this
17:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i once asked my PM what does he think about me, he told me i was rly good, i also asked the teach lead, who worked at apple, he said i was like a 10x dev (or maybe joking idk, this probs doesnt exist), but yeah they consider me good
17:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> s / teach /tech
17:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the new company is also way smaller
17:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i mean i dont think they fired anyone for asking a rise
17:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
17:31 < bridge> <Learath2> I would honestly stick around if the work was more enjoyable, but there is no reason not to atleast leverage it for a raise
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> always act as if rents are extremly expensive
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and shit like that
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> all the stuff the neoliberals want to hear 😂
17:32 < bridge> <Learath2> Cost of living is going up you know
17:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
17:32 < bridge> <Learath2> Don't say anything about "tight labour market" they hate that
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if learath is boss, he'd be like: i don't believe your neoliberal talks
17:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> "bleeding engineers due to low pay"
17:33 < bridge> <Learath2> If I'm boss we share profits
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> OUR company
17:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> WE
17:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/meme-our-now-gif-21036569
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl_Tj82asR4
17:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why i feel shy
17:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to ask for this
17:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i hate my social skills
17:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :fuckyousnail:
17:34 < bridge> <Teero> *ate
17:34 < bridge> <Learath2> this is why bossman gets a yacht 😄
17:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
17:35 < bridge> <Learath2> 1 share of the profits to everyone + 0.5 extra shares of it for me because I'm boss
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the irony is, if u actually like the job you shouldn't.. because you know you are valuable to the company
17:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u demotivated af and think a money increase will help
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it wont xD
17:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> should i ask for advise to someone i feel im closer in the company first
17:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i talk more to the tech lead than the PM
17:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xdd
17:36 < bridge> <Learath2> nooo, don't think like that, what does liking the job have to do with a raise?
17:36 < bridge> <Learath2> If you want the best for the company, maybe, but I guarantee you they aren't re-investing that 7 extra grand they don't give oyu
17:37 < bridge> <Learath2> they are reinvesting it into champagne and cars
17:37 < bridge> <Learath2> is there like a yearly review or sth? maybe you'd feel more comfortable asking there?
17:39 < bridge> <Learath2> I guess it could teechnically sour your relationship with your boss, in which case you can just take the new job 😛
17:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
17:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill ask someone in confidence
17:40 < bridge> <Learath2> Let's put it this way, I know a fair bit of capital owners and they don't mind paying extra to keep good employees
17:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well my direct boss and the tech lead are not capital owners i think xd
17:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i know the bossman a bit, he probs doesnt mind paying for good ppl
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ask elon musk if he can give u more money
17:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs u worth it
17:42 < bridge> <Learath2> Now that I think about it a bit more, maybe I'd just take the new job. A job is kinda a means to an end, I just want enough money so I can do the things I enjoy
17:43 < bridge> <Learath2> I guess that's why my initial advice was more tilted towards using it as leverage, because in my mind if they don't pay more I'd just leave for the other company anyway
17:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 society has set up us all in that talking about money is something bad
17:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> specially about ur salary
17:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sharing ur salary is a big nono, because employers will realize stuff
17:53 < bridge> <Learath2> it's all a trick so they have all the leverage in the employment market
17:54 < bridge> <Learath2> if you don't know the market rate for a rust developer of your caliber, how will you know what number to ask for? but employers always know what you are technically worth, it's right there on the balance sheet
17:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 often big companies have like >1m$ profit per employee
17:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or more
17:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also, this gained skill about llvm itself is extremely valuable to me
17:55 < bridge> <Learath2> probable, they make a shit ton, and every dime they don't pay you is a dime they can use to pay executives which can better exploit you to increase profitability or give to shareholders who will be happy and invest in the dudes next venture
17:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think u can count with multiple hands ppl with llvm experience
17:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (idk for real tho xd, it always looks like such a c losed group)
17:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
17:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my company is private tho
17:56 < bridge> <Learath2> the entire system is built to funnel money upwards 😛
17:57 < bridge> <Learath2> even better, only a couple people get to take home all the leftovers
17:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 the worst is
17:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> bossmans often have good social skills
17:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in that they will make it seem they deserve  it
17:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk how to say it
17:58 < bridge> <Learath2> yes, especially in the tech field, the executives, managers, the boss they all outclass atleast me socially
17:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but well atleast the bossman in this company is a programmer
17:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or was
17:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk how much now
17:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he often says stuff like "dont bother the engineers with useless meetings/stuff" (rly simplified)
17:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
17:59 < bridge> <Learath2> I have listened to two executives at a turkish cryptocurrency exchange talk about absolute horseshit for 2 hours over a meal, these people had absolutely no idea what the fuck they were saying, they made more than what any engineer in Turkey I know makes
17:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
17:59 < bridge> <Learath2> That is nice to have in a boss ngl
17:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nah but this boss knows his stuff
18:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he knows erlang, elixir, julia
18:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rust
18:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he HATES cpp
18:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and haskell
18:00 < bridge> <Learath2> Julia was so promising 😦
18:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and jokes about haskell being fobidden at the company
18:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xddd
18:01 < bridge> <Voxel> why
18:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he argues (and often quite well) that you can make better distributed systems using erlang/elixir managing for example rust software, etc
18:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and well cpp is unsafe kek
18:02 < bridge> <Voxel> did an intern accidentally erase an entire database with shitty cpp code
18:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont know any cpp code in this company
18:02 < bridge> <Learath2> maybe I should learn some Erlang
18:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u should
18:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but quickly go to elixir
18:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and gleam
18:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> erlang is more like the step
18:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> into BEAM
18:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://gleam.run/
18:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> gleam runs on the BEAM
18:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (erlang VM)
18:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and has rusty syntax
18:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and typed
18:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wanna learn it someday

18:04 < bridge> <Ravie> cpp is not unsafe, your cpp code is
18:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> mimimi
18:04 < bridge> <Voxel> @Ryozuki which vim would i want if i wanted something fast and flexible, something like how VSCode does plugins? i think plugins carry the entire VSCode experience xd
18:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no vim
18:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if u want something fast and easy to setup
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> first ur on the wrong place
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> windows
18:05 < bridge> <Voxel> thanks for the help!
18:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> np"
18:05 < bridge> <Learath2> second you should use rust
18:05 < bridge> <Learath2> no idea what that has to do with editors, but use it
18:05 < bridge> <Voxel> learath i will despine you like a fish
18:06 < bridge> <Voxel> anyways i wanna try a terminal code editor in general just to know the experience
18:06 < bridge> <Learath2> Just use vim
18:07 < bridge> <Learath2> or neovim I guess, ryozuki likes neovim
18:07 < bridge> <Learath2> when helix gets more mature I guess that'll be the recommendation 😄
18:08 < bridge> <Learath2> No electron, say no more. Literally the sign of good software

18:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
18:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://lapce.dev/
18:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this will be the vscode replacement
18:08 < bridge> <Learath2> I should actually give it a try, it's been long enough, maybe helix is good now
18:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > Native GUI with GPU acceleration in Rust, no more waiting on launching the editor, and any lag on your keystroke will be treated as a bug and get fixed.
18:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > WASI plugin system
18:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > 
18:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > You can write a plugin for Lapce with any programing language that compiles to WASI. Choose a familiar language for writing a plugin without learning a new language.
18:09 < bridge> <Voxel> okaay ill try neovim
18:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rust devs rly know how to make good stuff
18:09 < bridge> <Voxel> i was considering tgat
18:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Voxel try it
18:10 < bridge> <Learath2> Fwiw, the vim experience is jarring for the beginner. It's just dozens of keybinds
18:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lapce comes with language  servers
18:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u get all
18:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > Batteries included
18:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > 
18:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > Code syntax highlighting using Tree-sitter, much faster and better than regex based highlighting. Also with built-in LSP support, to give you code intelligence like code completion, diagnostics and code actions etc.

18:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh man it rly is faster than vscode
18:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u open a filer and everything is colorful
18:16 < bridge> <Learath2> Ah, still no plugins in helix

18:35 < bridge> <gerdoe> its double gated
18:36 < bridge> <bencie> did u solve them all?
18:37 < bridge> <gerdoe> yup
18:37 < bridge> <bencie> i give up, too much brainpower required :brainouis:
18:37 < bridge> <gerdoe> they asked me to send secret word on their email lol

18:47 < bridge> <Learath2> LOL 5 was too easy nvm
18:48 < bridge> <gerdoe> yeah it resets previous restrictions /shrug
18:49 < bridge> <Learath2> my trick for 5 worked for 6 aswell, that just leaves 7
18:49 < bridge> <gerdoe> yeah same
18:49 < bridge> <gerdoe> but 7 was a bit harder to figure out
18:49 < bridge> <gerdoe> for an ai of course :troll:

19:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u probs have the development category collapsed
19:13 < bridge> <Tsin> nope it was just showing 1 channel
19:13 < bridge> <Tsin> for whatever reason
19:21 < bridge> <Learath2> lvl 7 was actual pain but I got it

19:45 < bridge> <Voxel> i thought it wouldbt send??
19:45 < bridge> <Voxel> one sec
20:14 < bridge> <Voxel> first thing im doing when i get home is installing lapce and then configuring it
20:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its very beta tho
20:15 < bridge> <Voxel> ah
20:16 < bridge> <Voxel> i can only imagine how good it'd be when its actually a full release
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> !rust lol top G matricks contributed to rust lang already before ryo was born https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/1794
20:23 < chillerbot> @Ryozuki
20:28 < bridge> <Voxel> wtf
21:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye he told us
21:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u missed matricks on dc
21:16 < bridge> <jao> what year was ryo born
21:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 2000
21:26 < bridge> <Voxel> wtf you're only 3 years older than me
21:26 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Does anyone know how frequently does controls.cpp under game/client/components is updated? Is it proper to set the input there?

21:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You mean how frequently the input is queried from the hardware or how frequent it is sent to the server?
21:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah wait I think I misunderstood you. So you mean how often the OnRender of components is called?
21:40 < bridge> <gerdoe> ccontrols updates every frame and every event that relates to input
21:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Holy shit lmao
21:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Cool stuff
21:41 < bridge> <gerdoe> you can look for ccomponent->onrender() and ->oncursormove() calls
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😮
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> FNG
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 3d
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> finally
21:41 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Godot now can render with Vulkan ;)
21:41 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yes!
21:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how much FPS
21:42 < bridge> <gerdoe> @noby new field of experiments
21:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How did you even hook godot into a actual client?
21:43 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> prob 75 cause I haven't disabled vsync
21:43 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> chillerdragon: I stole my code from the KoGAI which used fifos for the communication between the client and python
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> can u enable vkray?
21:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Impressive that it works this well
21:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@Reteah)
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or raytracing over the vk backend
21:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s funny how such a familiar 2d map looks so strange in 3d really trippy
21:47 < bridge> <gerdoe> pov you are a fng player
21:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> taxes :p
21:49 < bridge> <Learath2> ok 4 trips still isn't so bad
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if raytracing can make an ugly game like quake 2, look good
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how will teeworlds look with it

21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> make unhook metallic
21:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for epic reflections xD
21:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ;) first things first though need to actually play from the 3dclient (godot) and I haven't hooked up input in this direction yet
21:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> raytracing first
21:51 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xDD
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> godot will get vk raytracing in 4.1 only
21:54 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> maybe something like this https://www.godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1550 ?
