00:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> imo it should be possible to see who voted what. What do you think?
00:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> It could help agianst the whole server pressing f3 on funvotes
00:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> everything old is new again 😛
00:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ?
00:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> we had that at some point
00:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> yes?
00:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> yea, probably pre-ddnet and maybe even pre-ddmax times 😄
00:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> we defnetly need it agian
00:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> don't remember the effects of it
00:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> like for real ppl dont care
00:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> they always vote yes
00:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> and im not sure who is doing it
00:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i want to talk to the people
00:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> btw i just got banned
00:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> 1 sec ago
00:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> after over 1h of racing
00:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Kyosuke> xD @ChillerDragon come private please i need you XD
00:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 how was it implemented? when you could see who votes what
00:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> request a list of all votes via chat command?
00:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> it said "***[name] voted yes" in chat
00:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> that would be spammy
00:49 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ye taht would be bad
00:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> but an optional chat command to check last vote would be dope
00:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> bit more work to code cuz u have to store it somewhere
00:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> it's stored anyway I think
00:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ye?
00:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ill checkout
00:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i suck at coding but i try
00:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> but I'm not sure whether I want public votes
00:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> would some1 merge it
00:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> are u supporting funvotes?
00:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> no
00:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> I mean, that's a rhethorical question, right?
00:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> it should be
00:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> but it sounds like you really do
00:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i mean why should votes be anonymous
00:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> it is only good for pressing f3 all the time without giving a shit
00:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> hmm, Anonymous Votes ? I men
00:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> mean
00:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Teeworlds is anonynomus enough
00:55 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> But it could make big spam. Will be abused by spammers.
00:55 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> no
00:55 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> /get_last_votes
00:55 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> prints all votes only to you
00:57 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Practical usage of this?
00:58 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> talking to the people who votes yes on funvotes
00:58 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> maybe people will use brain and check situation before vote next time then
01:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <snail> votes should rly not be public..
01:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <snail> just creates bad blood
01:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Just take vote system from popular games
01:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> aand implement it into teeworlds
01:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <worstwish> you'd see me f3ing everywhere
01:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> we need to think more wide
01:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <snail> whats vote system from popular games
01:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <worstwish> @Savander every game has the same voting system as tw lol
01:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> From bigger studios
01:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <snail> yes but
01:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <snail> what is it
01:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> i said, we need to think more wide. it was suggestion
01:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> to reasearch
01:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <snail> in the games i play u cant votekick ur teammates
01:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> cs:go
01:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> but i dont think u can just take other systems and expect them to work in tw
01:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> play cs:go with 1 friends and u solved teh voting problem
01:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <snail> but thats same as tw
01:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> how it works in battlefield?
01:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <snail> ah no
01:11 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> No, we can't. But we can take lesson from these games
01:11 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> probably, they researched better than we

11:58 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> @heinrich5991  same problem with osxcross like with my VM, c++11 support doesn't seem to be there: #error <atomic> is not implemented
12:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Kyosuke> @deen its you who occupe to test differents mods on tw or ameliorate some differents mod ? (i search who is the responsable of mods in tw (block ddrace and all  this mods)
12:19 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> take a look on github in the credits of each mod
12:20 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> I did some DDNet work, but DDNet is based on DDRace by greyfox
12:20 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> some other mods I made a few changes, but not much
12:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> ddnet blocker servers at least are same mod as normal ddnet
12:24 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> @heinrich5991 ah, maybe I should compile new clang version first with build_clang.sh, will try that
12:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Kyosuke> @deen ah ok do i need account on github for look ? and i think we need to do a new concept for block
12:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> "ddnet blocker servers at least are same mod as normal ddnet" deen 2k18 
12:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon>

13:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> oke i thought u are talking about all blockservers and they use normal ddnet
13:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> nvm
13:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> no idea what others use
13:56 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> but last time I checked they were mostly DDNet
13:57 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> oh nu
13:58 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> I see some ancient +DDRace and XXLDDRace and exec! seems to be running "BW", whatever that is

18:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <fokkonaut> deen will there be a "fix" for the big gaps (aka really high detailed) together with the use of open gl 3? i mean open gl 3 for anti lag in zoom etc and the "default" textures would be nice

19:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> this is the sql code ddnet uses to  build the top5points table
19:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> ```
19:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> SET @prev := NULL;
19:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> SET @rank := 1;
19:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> SET @pos := 0;
19:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> select Rank, Name, Points from (select (@pos := @pos+1) pos, (@rank := IF(@prev = Points,@rank,@pos)) Rank, Points, Name from (select (@prev := Points) Points, Name from %s_points order by Points desc) as ll) as l LIMIT %d, 5;
19:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> ```
19:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> with this points table
19:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> ```
19:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> +-----------+--------+
19:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> | Name      | Points |
19:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> +-----------+--------+
19:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> | timakro   |    611 |
19:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> | timakroa  |    100 |
19:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> | timakroaa |      0 |
19:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> +-----------+--------+
19:40 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> ```
19:40 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> i get this
19:40 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> ```+------+-----------+--------+
19:40 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> | Rank | Name      | Points |

20:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> no, i just hope it works when its bigger haha
20:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> it works with ddnet, soo
20:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> just to see if it repeats the last value or 0 is bugging it out
20:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> in ddnet we don't have anyone with 0 points tho
20:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> right, might be the 0
