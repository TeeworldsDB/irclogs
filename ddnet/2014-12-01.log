00:04 < laxa> xrothx, deen, anyone, I am searching for a host for a minecraft server
00:05 < laxa> vanilla one, I guess it should not take as many ressources as a moded one
00:05 <@deen> laxa: Harmony Hosting?
00:06 <@deen> in france, good performance, cheap, kind of ddos protected, specialized in minecraft hosting
00:06 < laxa> if no one hosts me, I guess I'll take something like a 10euros at HH yeah
00:06 < laxa> I don't need ddos protection :)
00:06 < laxa> but I guessed we could maybe make a ddnet kind of minecraft vanilla server
00:07 < laxa> knowing you, you won't like the idea :D
00:07 <@deen> of course not
00:07 <@deen> :P
00:07 <@deen> I don't even have minecraft
00:07 < laxa> well, anqel rented a basic server at nitrado.net with only 4 slots, I had to give her money to increase to 8 slots
00:07 < laxa> and we are playing between friends of teeworlds
00:08 < laxa> but I don't like the performance of the server, and I think it would be more worth to get a root server instead of webinterface hosting
00:08 < laxa> even EastByte came online today on it :p
00:08 <@deen> i wouldn't want to run it together with TW servers
00:08 < laxa> ok
00:08 < laxa> then I have your answer
00:08 < laxa> that was just a simple question :)
00:09 <@deen> because of how resource hungry minecraft tends to be
00:09 < laxa> it is horrible
00:09 < laxa> it lags on my pretty recent computer
00:09 <@deen> and players complain to me for every single lag on ddnet
00:09 < laxa> recent graphic card
00:09 < laxa> CPU isn't too bad
00:09 < laxa> but the game has high fps drops...
00:10 < laxa> hum, I guess xrothx will want to have condition on the server, so I guess I have to take a HH hosting then :(
00:11 <@deen> minecraft also takes a lot of memory
00:11 <@deen> something we don't have at all, especially when xrothx reduces it on GER :P
00:12 < laxa> Yes I know, it's fucking "impressive"
00:12 < laxa> some people told me, you need like 200 MB per player
00:12 <@deen> oh wow
00:12 < laxa> wtf are they storing inside their ram ?
00:12 < xrothx> laxa: linux? 
00:12 <@deen> and I'm complaining that TW needs 1 MB per player
00:12 < laxa> I think you need 200MB per player with moded game, 
00:12 < laxa> 1 MB per player for tw really ?
00:12 < xrothx> deen:  laxa  can host on the same (if you set it up)
00:13 < laxa> deen doesn't want
00:13 < laxa> I don't wanna annoy him
00:13 < laxa> I guess it's all better if I get my own hosting server for minecraft exclusively
00:13 <@deen> well, it's xrothx's server, so he can run your minecraft on it if you guys want that
00:13 < xrothx> laxa:  I have a 8gb 6cpu 
00:13 < xrothx> deen:  Do you think it is good for ddnet ger or you advise to not do it? 
00:14 <@deen> I just don't even run any of my other projects on ddnet servers because I'm afraid of the sligthest lags
00:14 < laxa> Nah it's ok xrothx
00:14 < xrothx> deen:  ok, 
00:14 < laxa> I'll get HH server for 10 euros in 1 month if we still play minecraft I guess
00:14 <@deen> laxa: or 5 €
00:14 < xrothx> laxa:  I have a ovh server 8gb 6cpu that you can use free untill its over
00:14 < laxa> it's not that much money, I am working after all and living at my parents
00:15 < xrothx> laxa:  Je suis serieux la, tu peux l'utiliser gratuit
00:15 < xrothx> tu veux quel OS? 
00:15 < laxa> linux
00:15 < laxa> debian 7
00:15 <@deen> http://www.harmony-hosting.com/ unreachable, good sign :P
00:15 < xrothx> ok
00:15 < laxa> il périme quand ?
00:16 < laxa> On a un serveur payé pendant encore 27 jours, on a besoin de déménager seulement si on a plus de joueurs qui arrivent, donc c'est pas vraiment urgent, je préfère juste voir en amont les possibilités que j'aurais. Mais je suis un peux comme deen, j'aime bien avoir le contrôle total :p
00:17 <@deen> now that I set up donations I'm remembering that I was thinking about shutting down DDNet before^^
00:17 < xrothx> deen:  Never
00:18 <@deen> the game isn't really running well anymore, Broken wanted to close USA, Chile is down anyway, Europe laggy
00:18 < xrothx> laxa:  tu veux english ou fr? 
00:18 < laxa> xrothx: pas besoin de serveur avant 27 jours :p
00:18 < xrothx> ooh.. :P 
00:19 < xrothx> Anyone something with 8gb ram 6cpu? 
00:19 <@deen> xrothx: is that a question?
00:20 < xrothx> yes
00:20 < xrothx> deen:  Do you want it? 
00:20 <@deen> nope
00:20 <@deen> I have an unused 6 cpu system as well
00:20 <@deen> which I'm not paying for, so I don't think I can give it to you, laxa
00:21 <@deen> Hm, could you get in trouble for that?
00:22 < xrothx> deen:  there are 3days left
00:22 < xrothx> you want to use it? 
00:22 <@deen> xrothx: nope
00:22 < xrothx> ok :) too bad
00:22 < xrothx> paid for a month
00:22 < xrothx> didn't even use it
00:22 <@deen> ouch =/
00:23 < xrothx> only for shitty php coders that promessed me the webinterface & didn't care about working on it
00:23 <@deen> 6 cpu + 8 gb ram for a php webinterface?!
00:24 < xrothx> not just the webinterface
00:25 < xrothx> it would be to host the servers aswell
00:25 <@deen> ah, then it makes sense
00:25 < xrothx> yes.. 
00:25 < xrothx> but nobody seems to be able to do something
00:25 < xrothx> I reducted my demands.. --'
00:27 < laxa> I guess you won't find a coder for free
00:27 < xrothx> Never said I wanted it free :)
00:27 < laxa> especially for a closed project with no outside use
00:27 < laxa> oh
00:27 < laxa> you wanna pay a webinterface to host for free ?
00:27 < xrothx> yes
00:27 < laxa> hum ok
00:27 < xrothx> look: 
00:28 < laxa> I don't have the skill I think, and the main reason is : I don't wanna work outside work right now :)
00:28 < xrothx> http://prntscr.com/5bx0jo
00:28 < laxa> but if you pay, maybe I can ask some friend
00:28 < xrothx> These are the steps
00:28 < xrothx> I need #1 now :) 
00:28 < laxa> but the friend I am thinking of won't do it in PHP
00:28 < xrothx> python I guess? 
00:29 < laxa> ruby
00:29 < laxa> but he is already working outside of work
00:29 < laxa> so he is already really busy
00:29 < laxa> I am not sure #3 and #4 are "legal"
00:29 < laxa> you can't get free license to host for free I think
00:30 < laxa> you can get TS license like me if you wanna use it for your personal usage : friends/clan/community etc...
00:32 < xrothx> I will pay to host for free ;)
00:32 < laxa> lol
00:32 < laxa> Gl finding a coder then
00:32 < laxa> If you are that motivated, you could learn yourself :)
00:33 < laxa> php is not really hard 
00:33 < xrothx> I know
00:33 < xrothx> But I m more for the marketing & everything around it
00:34 < xrothx> laxa: Does he know Teeworlds? 
00:34 < laxa> yes, but to be honest, I don't think he has time, and I am not sure he would be interested :(
00:34 < xrothx> laxa:  Because I search somebody that knows teeworlds, understands how it works and understand the needs. Not just a coder
00:34 < xrothx> laxa:  okay.. well, I can pay ;)
00:34 < laxa> I guess you won't find someone which suit your needs :x
00:35 < laxa> I can ask him tomorrow then
00:35 <@deen> i guess most of the teeworlds coders are in some of the irc channels
00:35 < laxa> but if I were you, I would search a free coder, it's for free project anyway
00:35 < laxa> or maybe you could ask teevision for their interface :D
00:36 <@deen> yeah, it's not like there aren't other projects like that
00:36 <@deen> teevision, teecloud, teeserver
00:36 < laxa> Yes, I guess your best chance to make your project real is to find some partners that would help you achieving that
00:37 <@deen> Also, I could shut ddnet down, then the demand for such a project would increase a lot!
00:37 < laxa> deen: don't you dare !
00:37 < xrothx> laxa:  teevision doesn't want it :)
00:37 < laxa> So bad :(
00:38 < xrothx>  Teecloud doesn't want to share it, but he will build a system for me to add my server & use his name & interface (not what I want) 
00:38 < xrothx> teecloud maker is busy with univ. He is busy the new couple months
00:38 <@deen> teecloud already thinking about reselling^
00:38 <@deen> hey, I'm also busy with university and no one lets me shut down ddnet!
00:39 < laxa> And another thing, ddnet is the only alive project that is really working on teeworlds, you are already sponsoring it
00:39 < laxa> I am considering that teeworlds outside ddnet is dead
00:39 < laxa> so I would not waste time on something that has high chances to just slowly die
00:39 < xrothx> teeserver will probably not like to see me coming.. because they will see me as a concurrent. And he is a company ;) 
00:39 <@deen> most mods aren't actively developed anymore =/
00:39 < xrothx> laxa:  Its my hobby ^^^
00:39 < laxa> teeworlds isn't being developped at all
00:40 < xrothx> laxa:  I am willing to pay for it ^^
00:40 <@deen> chilean servers are back alive now that ddnet chile is down :P
00:40 < xrothx> laxa:  Its like my : WhatShouldIDoWhenIComeHomeFromWorkOrSchool :D
00:40 < laxa> as I say, only ddnet is living, ddnet is eating more and more active player from the teeworlds community everyday
00:40 < laxa> it might end even like this : everyone plays ddnet, not teeworlds
00:40 < xrothx> laxa:  I m not only going to offer ddrace, all mods should be accepter :) 
00:40 < laxa> yes I know that
00:41 < laxa> but since those mods aren't being developped, they'll I guess, loose players overtime
00:41 < laxa> same for teeworlds
00:41 < laxa> same for everything
00:41 < laxa> ok
00:41 < laxa> nice chatting
00:41 < laxa> but I gotta sleep :p
00:41 <@deen> good night laxa :P
00:42 < laxa> Gotta learn sharepoint tomorrow, I need to stay awake when watching those boring videos of microsoft...
00:42 < xrothx> gnight
00:42 < xrothx> lol laxa  :P 
00:42 < xrothx> you ll only learn from those videos.. :P 
00:43 <@deen> laxa: and still you want to run a Microsoft Minecraft server!!!
00:43 < laxa> lol
00:43 < laxa> it runs on linux :p
00:43 < laxa> and it's Mojang
00:43 < laxa> not microsoft
00:43 < laxa> they just own it afaik
00:47 < eeeee> that's what they want you to think
00:48 < eeeee> and next day you'll have clippy in minecraft
01:15 <@deen> xrothx: if you want to run all kinds of teeworlds servers, maybe you could do that on the ddnet servers
01:16 <@deen> we basically have servers everywhere, but I'm only interested in the DDNet mod itself
01:16 <@deen> and the servers mostly have a bit of room, especially since other mods are pretty small on memory
01:21 <@deen> I'm pretty much doing that right now, just by hand
01:22 <@deen> people come to me and say they want something hosted, they send me their configs and i set it up
01:22 <@deen> like block, zcatch, bomb
01:26 <@deen> good night
01:45 <@deen> Ah yeah, Zikkie's new TW movie: http://youtu.be/4Pyqmw2S1Rw or http://ddnet.tw/Western%20Movie.mp4 (can't access the YT video from Germany)

02:57 < eeeee> EastByte: do you happen to know how teeworlds manages to colorize GL_ALPHA texture?
04:01 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
04:05 < eeeee> yay finally the text works http://tw.qwe123.info/DDNet_x86_d.html
04:12 < shorefire> deen: can I pm you?
10:11 < laxadedi> deen: Death Valley Skeptar & Juandissimo 7:07.72 YeitjS2HP9c
12:11 <@EastByte> eeeee: cool
12:15 <@EastByte> "added some random opengl crap which somehow fixes the black text"
12:15 <@EastByte> atleast you know what you are doing :)
14:30 <@EastByte> http://eastbit.net/priv/upload/
14:30 <@EastByte> my uploadscript works so far
14:31 < xrothx> I see ^^
14:31 <@EastByte> I don't need tw maps^^
14:32 < xrothx> lol
14:32 < xrothx> i see a bug though
14:32 < xrothx> He stays on 100% after you uploaded
14:32 < xrothx> You should make it go back to 0 & possible to add another file after
14:32 <@EastByte> yep 100% means finish
14:33 <@EastByte> I don't care about user-friendliness :D
14:33 < xrothx> Okay haha
14:33 <@EastByte> the next time a friend of me wants to give me a file, I
14:33 <@EastByte> 'll just give him this link
14:34 <@EastByte> and I'm happy
14:34 < xrothx> 480kb/s? 
14:34 < xrothx> 8kb atm
14:34 < o_be_one> hi friends :)
14:34 <@EastByte> the speedmeter doesnt work properly
14:34 <@EastByte> websockeets are strange
14:34 <@EastByte> hi o_be_one 
14:34 < xrothx> its pretty slow I think
14:35 <@EastByte> I get up to 2MB/s here
14:35 < xrothx> might be my speed then.. 
14:36 < xrothx> EastByte:  It comes on your pc? 
14:36 < xrothx> Or on your server/hosting? 
14:38 <@EastByte> it's running on my server
14:40 < xrothx> Then you now have the ddnet client for windows on your server :) 
14:40 < xrothx> Its a nice uploadtool, but its pretty slow 
14:41 <@EastByte> it tries to send 4096 bytes per ms
14:41 <@EastByte> should be 1M/s if your uplink is fast enough
14:47 < laxadedi> no https
14:47 < laxadedi> bad !
14:47 < laxadedi> oh, there is, but no automatic redirection :p
14:47 <@EastByte> wait, no
14:48 <@EastByte> it doesn't work currently
14:48 <@EastByte> the websocket server is running in nodejs without https
14:48 <@EastByte> so I had to disable https in my webserver
15:59 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: websocket conn failed
16:58 < xrothx> Hello
16:58 < xrothx> Anyone here with linux experience? 
17:01 <@heinrich5991> xrothx: somewhat I guess
17:01 < xrothx> heinrich5991:  To start a tw server in linux, is it the same as on windows? 
17:01 < xrothx> Exec the executable ? 
17:01 <@heinrich5991> somewhat
17:01 <@heinrich5991> yes
17:01 < xrothx> okay
17:02 < xrothx> Thank you :)
17:02 < xrothx> All I needed ^^ heinrich5991  ty
17:23 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: server isn't running
17:23 <@EastByte> I'm trying to do nginx websocket forward now
17:23 <@EastByte> xrothx: yea executables usually need to be executed to work :)
17:42 <@EastByte> okay nginx does it well
17:46 < xrothx> EastByte:  ^^ Never worked with linux before.. :) So.. ^^
17:46 < xrothx> I thought it would be waaaay harder then on windows
17:47 < xrothx> but it turns out its as simple ^^
17:47 <@EastByte> generally it's not
17:47 <@heinrich5991> it's mostly *different*
18:29 < laxa> deen: don't forget the new hall of fame video :p, and there is a new one coming out tonight if I don't forget too
19:19 < o_be_one> EastByte, you left nodejs for nginx for you project ?
19:26 < eeeee> why do you use websockets instead of splitting the file in chuncks and XHR-ing them?
19:36 <@EastByte> eeeee: because I like websockets more
19:37 <@deen> laxa: where is it? You didn't write me a line
19:38 < laxa> yes this morning deen
19:38 <@deen> thanks
19:38 < laxa> another one coming in 20 minutes or less
19:39 <@deen> laxa: you're supposed to write the player names, not mapper names...
19:39 < laxa> hu ?
19:39 <@deen> you wrote "Skeptar & Juandissimo"
19:39 <@deen> that's the mappers!
19:39 <@deen> not the players!
19:39 < laxa> oh fuck :D
19:39 <@deen> anyway, fixed and up
19:40 < laxa> if you ever played Half life guys

19:41 <@deen> eeeee: it's much laggier with text?
19:41 <@deen> (at least for me)
19:41 <@deen> pretty cool that it all works, I'm impressed, eeeee 
19:42 <@deen> haha, you can quit the editor
19:42 <@deen> can't reach the master server^^
19:42 <@deen> need udp in emscripten =/
19:48 < eeeee> deen: text adds two more sources of lags: first is just more quads (each character is two extra quads), second is rendering of new characters from ttf fonts on character cache miss
19:49 <@deen> eeeee: =/
19:49 < eeeee> second one is especially bad on firefox for some reason
19:49 <@deen> true, looks much better in chromium
19:49 <@deen> looks like 60fps while firefox looks more like 15
19:50 < eeeee> what version is your firefox?
19:50 <@deen> 33
19:50 < eeeee> also can you look in console?
19:50 < eeeee> maybe asm.js compilation failed
19:50 <@deen> i have no idea about javascript, how to check that
19:50 <@deen> ?
19:51 < eeeee> press F12
19:51 < eeeee> then click console
19:51 < eeeee> look for messages about asm.js and webgl
19:52 < Nimda> TheVoiD by ٭ıƞdex'<3 just released on Moderate at 2014-12-01 19:47
19:52 < eeeee> on windows ff works just as fast as chrome for me, but on mac ff is like way slower
19:52 < eeeee> maybe it's the same issue for you
19:52 <@deen> somehow f12 works everywhere except on emscripten^^
19:52 < eeeee> mh
19:52 < eeeee> sdl grabbed the kbd probably
19:52 < laxa> Koule 5 mikey12 Maple 2:05.76 dQ7srNJhRY4
19:53 < eeeee> you can get the console from menu
19:53 < eeeee> Tools->Web developer->Web console
19:53 <@deen> well, now firefox crashed^^
19:53 < eeeee> lol
19:53 < eeeee> nvm then
19:55 < eeeee> emscripten output was crashing browsers a lot a couple years ago when i first tried it
19:55 <@deen> ah ok
19:55 < eeeee> seems they still didn't manage to fix that
19:55 <@deen> thought it was my setup
19:55 <@deen> just tried again and same result
19:55 < eeeee> what distro are you running?
19:55 <@deen> gentoo
19:56 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: crashing browsers suggests a sec vuln, no?
19:56 <@deen> with my very old graphics card
19:56 <@deen> could try archlinux with an intel card
19:56 <@deen> only 7 years old probably
19:56 < eeeee> heinrich5991: it's probably wrapped in several layers of sandboxes so unlikely actual sec vuln. annoying DoS at most.
19:56 <@deen> heinrich5991: not necessarily, but possible, I would say
19:57 <@deen> still laggy on archlinux/firefox/intel graphics
19:58 <@deen> eeeee: does it change anything when you don't do a debug build of DDNet?
19:58 <@deen> but a release build?
19:58 <@deen> chromium fine
19:58 < eeeee> oh it's actually a release build, don't mind the _d
19:58 <@deen> ok
19:58 <@deen> that reminds me, I want to benchmark DDNet server and client on -O2, -O3 and -Ofast
20:00 <@deen> laxa: I think I need to write a format checker for you :P
20:01 <@deen> laxa: any of the videos 60fps?
20:13 < eeeee> one possible vector of optimization would be porting tw client to more modern opengl so that emscripten doesn't have to do emulation
20:13 < eeeee> but we need a real opengl pro for that
20:14 <@deen> yeah, i was just pushing values around in my computer graphics class until the 3d scene looked ok, so my opengl skills are kind of limited^^
20:15 < eeeee> well you don't actually need that much skills, just enough to translate the fixed pipeline stuff like all those matrix transforms into shaders
20:15 < eeeee> but i feel like it would take me a month to learn about all of that and get it working
20:16 <@deen> looks like the -O level doesn't matter much for teeworlds
20:17 <@deen> pretty much the same results from -O1 to -Ofast
20:17 < eeeee> -o0 vs -o2 probably matters
20:17 <@deen> yeah, -O0 is terrible^^
20:18 <@deen> jump from -O0 to -O1 is 100% in performance
20:18 <@deen> then it stays about the same
20:18 < eeeee> is that for server?
20:18 <@deen> both
20:19 < eeeee> how do you benchmark it?
20:19 <@deen> with 64 dummy clients
20:19 <@deen> so nothing realistic
20:19 <@deen> i join 64 dummy clients and look at the cpu % of the processes^^
20:19 < eeeee> doesn't sound very scientific
20:20 <@deen> nope
20:20 <@deen> i don't want any 1-3% improvements anyway
20:20 <@deen> wanted to see if there is anything bigger possible
20:30 < laxa> deen: all videos from now on will be 60 fps
20:30 < laxa> so yeah, the 2 from today are "60 fps", actually they are 50 fps
20:30 < laxa> I don't know if youtube encoding render them as 60 fps though
20:31 < laxa> but the original video is 50 fps
20:31 <@deen> intel compiler isn't faster either

21:08 < Maple> laxa: for the music in the videos, maybe add free of rights music
21:08 < Maple> there are a few channels that give out music that you can use for whatever you want
21:09 < laxa> Maple: I don't wanna invest time to find music for videos
21:09 < laxa> especially since I would want to find songs that would be good for everyone
21:09 < Maple> sec
21:09 < laxa> and that's impossible
21:09 < laxa> and then, most viewers are german, and germany is shitting on youtube music
21:09 < Maple> some small ambiant song will do the trick
21:09 < laxa> so
21:09 < laxa> no thanks
21:09 < Maple> meh
21:09 < Maple> wait
21:10 <@deen> yeah, can't even watch zikkie's new video in germany...

21:11 < Nimda> [YouTube] Title: Royalty Free Music: The Best Of The Best - Show #1 | Rating: 4.67/5.00 | Views: 101,561
21:11 < Maple> you can use linkyoutube to download the music
21:11 < Maple> just add "link" in front of youtube in url
21:12 < Maple> this is just some random electronic music and it would fit well speedruns
21:13 < laxa> then I need to edit the video for sound etc, I don't know how to
21:13 < laxa> it's too annoying really
21:13 < laxa> and not everyone likes electronic music
21:13 < Maple> it doesnt matter
21:13 < Maple> anything is better than nothing
21:13 <@deen> yeah, use death metal instead, everyone likes that
21:13 < Maple> xD
21:13 < Maple> i think it would  give a parodical aspect to the video

22:11 <@deen> looks weird, maybe searching for vulnerabilities
