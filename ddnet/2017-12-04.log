00:19 <@heinrich5991> fstd: TKEN is used to indicate in the connection request that the client understands the challenge-response thing
00:20 <@heinrich5991> so as far as I can tell, ChillerDragon and ReiTW38 both receive a flood of legitimate connection request packets
00:20 <+fstd> i see
01:25 <+nemo2> you guys have DOSing jackasses too?
09:23 <+fstd> haven't ddos jackasses been an ongoing issue in ddnet for like years?
10:01 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> not just ddnet
10:01 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> teewoods is ddos game num1
10:03 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> lol fstd? aren't u dis super oldschool teewods dude with the picture of a tee with ‚ù§ emotes and a shotgun i guess. I used it for my yt video which got claimed for copyright reasons because i was scammed xd
10:05 <+fstd> aw :s
10:05 <+fstd> yeah that's me
10:06 <+fstd> pic unrelated http://penenen.de/twparticle.png
10:06 <@deen> nemo2, fstd: yeah, lots of hosters threw us out following 10-100 gbit/s ddos attacks. still getting attacks now, but doesn't look so bad anymore, at least we're not taking down their entire data centers anymore
10:07 <@deen> fstd: looks like fun, what are you doing?
10:07 <+fstd> that pic is way old back in the blocker days; i was testing how far the player limit can be pushed
10:08 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> yo guiis does some1 know how to use boost -.- ?
10:08 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> im too knoop to include boost asio.hpp
10:08 <+fstd> IIRC 256 was okay but with 512 the collosion code really started showing its O(n^2)
10:08 <@deen> fstd: heh, I think I also tested up to 256 and it worked ok-ish, at least 1 core was not at 100% cpu yet
10:09 <@deen> or maybe it was only 128
10:09 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i think it was 128
10:09 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i tried it too but ddnet clients didnt like it -.- was only working with vanilla clients
10:10 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> https://i.imgur.com/ki8gpPV.png
10:10 <@deen> you have to link against the lib as well
10:10 <@deen> not just include it
10:10 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> uhm
10:11 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> g++ -I %boost_path% src/*.cpp -c
10:11 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> thats my linker
10:11 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> it works with other boost files
10:11 <@deen> some might be header only
10:11 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> boost/array.hpp works
10:11 <@deen> but if the boost lib is not header-only, then you need to link as well
10:11 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ah k
10:11 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> how? xd
10:11 <@deen> http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html#link-your-program-to-a-boost-library
10:12 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ty
10:12 <@deen> any reason for using boost?
10:12 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i was suggested to use it
10:12 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> im trying to create a 2d multiplayer cross platform game
10:12 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> without graphics
10:13 <@deen> I'd recommend just C++14 without boost
10:13 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> my plan was to use no libs or frameworks or engines or stuff
10:13 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> sounds great
10:13 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but i failed xd and also ppl told me doing everything from scratch is hilariously over complicated
10:13 <@deen> sure, but you learn a lot
10:13 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> sounds great
10:14 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but how do i start i rly suck
10:16 <@deen> have some data structure for the world with tiles, players, implement moving the player and interacting with these tiles (bumping, standing, jumping), make a way to display this into graphics/terminal output, think about what data to send over the network to synchronize states
10:17 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> the problem is i have no idea how to send data over the network and i cant find a cross platform solution
10:18 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> the web only told me non crossplatform and or stuff i didnt undertsand or was abel to compile
10:19 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i had the plan just to send the position of the players as a first test. But idk how to start ._.
10:22 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> as far as i understood there is no c++ crossplatfrom networking stuff because unix and winsockets are different. And i have to work with #ifdefs i guess
10:22 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but do u know a nice place to learn this networking stuff?
10:22 <@deen> work with ifdefs or use a networking lib
10:22 <@deen> or wait for c++30 or something
10:23 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> xd
10:23 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i thought boost is a networking lib
10:25 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> you recommended using plain c++
10:25 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> c: that sounds great beacause it was my plan. Well i keep trying to search sumsing in the web ...
10:44 <@deen> ah, so that's why you wanted to use boost. yeah, they probably include networking
10:46 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> do u still recommand oing it with plain c++?
10:46 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> do u still recommand doing it with plain c++?
10:46 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i just compiled my first networking code idk what it does but it compiled xd
10:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> use tw's system.c üòõ it includes networking
10:50 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ikr
10:50 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but i dont want to steal lal
10:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Savander how do you feel about codeigniter?
10:50 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i already stole the str_format func
10:50 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> xd
10:50 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> and tw networking is very twish i guess and its hard to understand ._.
10:51 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but as i said i just did my helloworld networking so all fine i guess. going well so far
10:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @ChillerDragon the stuff in system.c is not really twish, it's just C
10:54 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ok maybe ill have a look at it agian if i failed my current code

16:30 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> @nemo2 there Is a ddos Motivation for teeworlds Server hosters who want more players on their Server ----> ddos all Other servers 
16:30 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> 
16:30 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> Or for trolls who think its funny.
16:30 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> 
16:30 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> But i don't understand who is ddosing servers for days. Its clearly not for fun. But i can't find the ddosers Server that fills up. As far as i know the most played block Servers are ddnet and rei and i dont think that ddnet ddoses rei and rei ddoses ddnet lul. So i have no clue what the morivation these days is
16:32 <+nemo2> could be a power trip I guess
16:32 <+nemo2> no way they could impact a large company
16:32 <+nemo2> so they attack what they can
16:33 <+nemo2> I guess if you have a few thousand fairly tech savvy individuals accessing your server there's bound to be a few assholes who react that way to some minor slight
16:33 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ._.
16:33 <+nemo2> the dude who attacked us last time was annoyed that we kicked him off the server because he was deliberately sending messages that were screwing up the Qt frontend.
16:34 <+nemo2> he was quite proud of his discovery and felt he should be allowed to randomly kill the lobby visitors at will
16:34 <+nemo2> and tried to use threat of DDoS to force us to allow him onto the server
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> What Server ?
16:35 <+nemo2> oh... the hedgewars one.  sorry. that's where my experience is
16:35 <+nemo2> he was using a ton of VPNs so for a while we had to restrict server to registered accounts ‚òπ
16:35 <+nemo2> he did in fact succeed in taking server down a couple of times, but I guess he got tired of paying for DDoSes
16:37 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> Hmmm
16:37 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> Lyfe Is struggle
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <cinaera> come to the rust side, we got networking primitives in the std üëÄ
18:37 <+nemo2> oh. did you guys see kyren's awesome post on Chucklefish's new game ?
18:37 <+nemo2> It's really a great AMA 
18:38 <+nemo2> https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/78bowa/hey_this_is_kyren_from_chucklefish_we_make_and/
18:38 <+nemo2> the haskell mittens thing was awesome. and the C++ float sort shocked me too
18:56 <+ReiTW38> Hi people is there a way to migrate the networking part of the server from singlethread to multithreading?
18:57 <+ReiTW38> I'm such bad for that :/
19:02 <@heinrich5991> ReiTW38: is there a reason you want to do that?
19:03 <+ReiTW38> yea, mostly against attacks
19:03 <@heinrich5991> I don't think the network stuff is a bottle neck
19:03 <@heinrich5991> mh
19:03 <+ReiTW38> Well, singlethreading for tw is too bad, i think multithreading would help much
19:04 <+ReiTW38> for networking*
19:07 <@heinrich5991> you have observed 100% cpu usage I guess?
19:08 <+ReiTW38> yeap
19:51 <+nemo2> oh wow. server is single threaded??
20:02 <+ReiTW38> normally, yes
20:02 <+ReiTW38> :/, but we REALLY have to switch to multithreading
20:25 <@heinrich5991> ReiTW38: not sure tbh
20:26 <+ReiTW38> I'm quite sure o:, even the buffer
20:26 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: what would you parallelize?
20:26 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: how about game rooms?
20:26 <@heinrich5991> each server is a "game room"
20:27 <@heinrich5991> you don't have multiple of those on a single server
20:27 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: uh. so when a game is started, that's a new server instance?
20:28 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: everyone can start a server. the server host a game round. when the game round is over, it'll host the next game round
20:28 <@heinrich5991> but note that game rounds aren't as special in teeworlds as they are in hedgewars
20:28 <@heinrich5991> you just join the game at any time and leave it at any time
20:28 <+nemo2> so... when I joined the network and several dozne rooms are listed
20:28 <+nemo2> those are actually server instances
20:28 <+nemo2> one server. one game.
20:29 <@heinrich5991> yes
20:29 <+nemo2> what is the thing that tracks those announcements then?
20:29 <@heinrich5991> oh, the master server
20:29 <+nemo2> ah üòù
20:29 <@heinrich5991> it just reports a list of IPs
20:29 <+nemo2> no chat, no statistics, no info messages of any kind? that's all from servers?
20:30 <+nemo2> but ok. in a model like that I can see why there's no point in threading
20:30 <@heinrich5991> no global chat, no statistics, no info messages
20:31 <@heinrich5991> it's kinda decentralized
20:37 <+eeeee> more kinda worst of both worlds tho, in vanilla you still cant play when masters are down and there are spoofed responses and spam servers and clients' ips are exposed... 
20:38 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: we'll do https master server one day :)
20:39 <+eeeee> better make sure it's REALLY switched to multithreading
20:42 <@heinrich5991> ??!?
20:47 <+nemo2> most web libs are threaded already
20:47 <+nemo2> if you're doing an https master probably will get that as part of the package
20:47 <@heinrich5991> in my PoC we just put a file for nginx to serve
20:48 <@heinrich5991> I don't have to care about the https on the server side there ^^
20:50 <+nemo2> sure why not
20:50 <+nemo2> doubt it updates so often that static would be unreasonable
20:53 <@heinrich5991> I was updating the file every second :D
20:53 <@heinrich5991> or no, whenever sth changed
20:55 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: the idea was to put cloudflare in front of our master server
20:55 <@heinrich5991> in order to make DoSing it harder
20:56 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: huh... they were only dosing the master? how odd
20:56 <+nemo2> seems the natural approach would be to attack each of those poor weak subs
20:56 <+nemo2> prioritising by number of players
20:56 <@heinrich5991> no, they also attacked the master
20:56 <@heinrich5991> :D
20:57 <@heinrich5991> which made joining a new server pretty much impossible
20:57 <@heinrich5991> not really fixed until now btw
20:58 <+nemo2> so... in that decentralised model.  how do players keep track of who they are playing with? is there a player db anywhere?
20:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Only nicknames, without db
20:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no register, no anything to autorize
20:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> authorize
21:00 <@heinrich5991> no accounts
21:00 <@heinrich5991> you just start the game and start playing
21:01 <+nemo2> hm
21:02 <+nemo2> could have them phone in to a registration server tho...
21:02  * nemo2 shrugs
21:02 <+nemo2> faking identities seems oddly entertaining to some people
21:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> We had few big discussions about authentication  tho
21:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=4979
21:04 <+nemo2> another advantage would be statistics
21:04 <@heinrich5991> for original TW, this was sth to avoid, according to the original dev
21:05 <+nemo2> huh
21:05 <+nemo2> dunno why
21:05 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: anyway FWIW, since we are super ultra lazy, we just took the existing Drupal accounts, that people were already using for the website, and checked 'em from the game
21:05 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: there's an itsy bitsy little connector unc0rr wrote that does that
21:05 <+nemo2> it also has caching since it used to be website and game were on separate machines so it helped perf a bit
21:06 <@heinrich5991> ah
21:06 <+nemo2> people do appreciate it I think.  It lets them exclude trolls more easily for example
21:07 <+nemo2> one thing we never got around to implementing was hashed (24h rotation or whatever) IP banning - some poor folks get harassed by same person using guest accoutns. workaround for now is disallowing guest accounts
21:07 <+nemo2> (from your room)
21:08 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: oh... if you do end up doing something just as lazy as us, here's a cute thing we added to mariadb üòÉ  
21:08 <+nemo2> https://hedgewars.org/download/Index.xml
21:09 <@heinrich5991> ?
21:09 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: http://www.unicode.org/Public/security/8.0.0/confusables.txt  it's a fair chunk of this loaded in as a mariadb collation
21:09 <@heinrich5991> what's that?
21:09 <+nemo2> due to accoutn spoofing
21:09 <+nemo2> scroll down ‚ò∫
21:09 <+nemo2> it's pretty nifty tho since it let us do drop-in anti-spoof to the existing db
21:09 <+nemo2> would work on any mariadb/mysql
21:09 <@heinrich5991> ah
21:09 <@heinrich5991> we have this: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/scripts/generate_confusables_data.py
21:10 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: so... you do have user account registration?
21:10 <@heinrich5991> no, run on every single server ^^
21:10 <+nemo2> oh...
21:10 <@heinrich5991> it's still annoying if you have the same name twice on the same server
21:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Kyosuke> @irclink  stop spam
21:10 <+nemo2> ?
21:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> @Kyosuke  they are devs
21:11 <@heinrich5991> on the discord side, @irclink posts all the messages from the IRC chat
21:11 <+nemo2> ah
21:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Kyosuke> @Savander  so they cant stop talk right ?
21:11 <+nemo2> same as here then
21:11 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: so... this is not a dev channel?
21:11 <@heinrich5991> it is the dev channel
21:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's dev channel
21:11 <+nemo2> ok
21:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you don't want to be a part
21:11 <+nemo2> well tough for them then üòù
21:11 <@heinrich5991> it is linked to #developer on the ddnet discord
21:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> leave
21:11 <+nemo2> oh haha
21:11 <+nemo2> all the more reason to not be sympathetic
21:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Beefywhale> what's the point of this dumbass irc bot
21:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Kyosuke> oh yea i see ok sorry but it spam XD
21:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then mute it?
21:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You can do it easily
21:12 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Beefywhale @Kyosuke you can mute this channel
21:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Beefywhale> nah
21:12 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> right-click it on the left side
21:12 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> and click mute
21:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Beefywhale> I just think it's dumb
21:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Beefywhale> If people wanna see irc they can just join it
21:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It's not dumb, since most devs sits on IRC
21:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and this is official ddnet dicsord
21:13 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: BTW, why is the ddnet dev channel not on freenode?
21:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Kyosuke> @heinrich5991  yea but if i wait 10 minutes i will have the email of "you missed a message from #developer "... how deactivate it ?
21:13 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> even if you mute it?
21:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> If you mute it, there's no message
21:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> only when someone mention you with @
21:13 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: historical, because #teeworlds is on quakenet as well
21:13 <+nemo2> ah
21:14 <@heinrich5991> actually, using this nifty bot, we could migrate to freenode
21:14 <@heinrich5991> :)
21:14 <+nemo2> ‚ô•
21:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Kyosuke> yea... @Savander really ? i always receive it without mention... i go try again
21:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Really, i have muted all channels
21:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but not #developer
21:14 <@heinrich5991> ^^
21:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and i don't have any notifications
21:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what's better with freenode? ^^
21:15 <+nemo2> just most FOSS projects are on there these days
21:15 < Beefywhale> petetion to remove irclink bot top kek
21:15 <+nemo2> apart from the gnome/mozilla affiliated ones
21:15 <@heinrich5991> what nemo said
21:16 <@heinrich5991> quakenet is gaming, but mostly proprietrary games
21:16 <+Beefywhale> kek
21:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> right
21:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> good to know
21:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I used IRC only for Teeworlds, tbh
21:16 <+Beefywhale> oh shitttt my mask isnt on
21:16 <+Beefywhale> rip my ip
21:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> too oldschool thing
21:17 <+nemo2> I still use IRC a ton
21:17 <+nemo2> I even use it to interact with Slack
21:17 <+nemo2> since they thoughtfully include an IRC gateway
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Beefywhale> Loool
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Beefywhale> who even uses slack
21:17 <+nemo2> ssh + tmux + irssi ‚ô•
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Twitch.tv uses IRC for chat
21:17 <+nemo2> quite a lot of people, but mostly I use it for playing Ingress
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I used it to test chat bot :D:D
21:17 <+nemo2> but yeah, I don't get the appeal of discord or slack frankly
21:17 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: you're this guy: https://xkcd.com/1782/ :P
21:18 <@heinrich5991> but yea, just the next iteration of closed-source chat apps :(
21:18 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: heh.  yeah, well, the protocol has been around for ages, most everything supports it..
21:18 <@heinrich5991> ^^
21:18 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: but mostly it's due to FOSS
21:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> üòÑ
21:18 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: moznet, gimpnet and freenode are keeping IRC active for me
21:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> For m,e things like discord are just another level of abstraction
21:18 <@heinrich5991> I'm not on gimpnet
21:19 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: I'm on it basically for gimp, or if I ever want to ask some gnome-related qeustion
21:19 <@heinrich5991> I just join on-demand there
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Like in programming, you can make library, then someone else will make another level of abstraction to use it, and over and over again
21:19 <+nemo2> but I like doing art stuff and there's a lot of experienced artists on gimp
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> === NPM
21:19 <@heinrich5991> I'm on mozilla for rust ^^
21:19 <@heinrich5991> ah
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> one package cause 150 packages to download
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> üòÑ
21:19 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: I joined moznet back in.... '98 or so ‚ò∫
21:20 <@heinrich5991> I was a little child back then :P
21:20 <+nemo2> but. yay rust!
21:20 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: so was I. ok. a big child. ok. technically an adult
21:21 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: anyway, if you guys do decide to add a centralised db, and it happens to be mariadb, that index file should be fairly drop-in
21:21 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: MariaDB [hedgewars]> select uid,name from users where name = 'nerno';  
21:21 <+nemo2> | 1413 | nemo |
21:21 <@heinrich5991> heh
21:21 <@heinrich5991> nice
21:21 <@heinrich5991> the classical rn = m :)
21:21 <+nemo2> it's one of the easiest confusables to type ‚ò∫
21:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I don't hink, that we ever will have centralized db
21:22 <+nemo2> well you have one for the forum
21:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> due to our friends from teeworlds :D:D
21:22 <+nemo2> you could just plug the game into it
21:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Ddnet has point system
21:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> now it's connected to nicknames, but if we will make accounts, then people could steal those points
21:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> in general, it's big deal at the moment to make all people happy
21:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ^^
21:24 <+nemo2> oh... so you do have registration
21:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> nope
21:24 <+nemo2> oh. points per server I bet
21:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> DDnet has centralized DB
21:24 <@heinrich5991> no, actually global points on ddnet
21:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> for points
21:24 <+nemo2> huh
21:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but it's connected to nicknames
21:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you can use whatever nickname you want
21:24 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: https://ddnet.tw/players/nemo/
21:24 <+nemo2> so... all you need to do is add a password to that and boom you have auth?
21:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> even those from top 10
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It could be simple üòÑ
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> But then, how we can verify
21:25 <+nemo2> oh how nice. someone is earning points for me
21:25 <+guenstig_werben> hey
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if the guy is the right guy?
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Hey
21:25 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: well, as long as I have a vote in this, we'll never register nicknames
21:25 <@heinrich5991> accounts is okayish
21:25 <+guenstig_werben> @heinrich5991 you got 5 minutes of time?
21:25 <@heinrich5991> but reserving nicks is not IMO
21:25 <+nemo2> well, first come first served. prompt for pass on use of nick
21:25 <@heinrich5991> guenstig_werben: sure
21:26 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: huh. don't see what the big deal is, but whatev
21:26 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: see all the big gaming networks today
21:26 <@heinrich5991> they allow duplicate nicks :)
21:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Yea, we though about UID, without nickname dependency
21:26 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: dunno. I don't really use any big gaming networks ‚ò∫
21:26 <+nemo2> heinrich5991: but... it would not surprise me if there's a uid backing, so people get to know people in right context and with right history
21:26 <+nemo2> Ingress still requires uniqueness, only one I'm familiar with
21:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Generally, the problem is that we don't want to make people mad, because they lost their points.
21:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> DDNet has 4 years
21:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's 4 years of playing for people
21:27 <+nemo2> well right now the points are getting all mixed up anyway.
21:27 <+nemo2> some other nemo is playing too 
21:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Yes, but to get 10k points
21:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you need to finish houndreds maps
21:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> even the hardests
21:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> not everyone can do that
21:28 <+nemo2> just give both people who claim the nick the points.  could still use uid or unique nicks.
21:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> is there a limit for http request on ddnet.tw/ranks?
21:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> else its possible to steal data so people dont loose their points after going down
21:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> So, we would hav elike few people with same amount of points
21:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?
21:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> wait my post is far out of context
21:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> just realized now, nvm
21:29 <+nemo2> Savander: since you're into discord - is there by any chance a direct IRC connection mechanism in discord, like slack has?
21:30 <+nemo2> Savander: I basically never log into slack using anything but irssi these days
21:30 <+nemo2> except if I'm on mobile
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> No idea, at this moment
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> iirc discord is against third party clients
21:30 <+nemo2> oh. boo
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> that bridge is served by learath2 I guess
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's bot
21:30 <+nemo2> well eff them too üòù
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> listening for a messsage on irc and discord
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and sends to both channles üòõ
21:30 <+nemo2> yeah familiar w/ IRC bots üòâ
21:30 <@heinrich5991> Savander: it's mine!
21:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> oh! I thought it was Learath2 üòÆ
21:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> Savander fakenews!
21:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :<
21:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> im sorry!
21:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> nut nemo2 you could build a third party client via api
21:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> but u wont get the full client experience ofc
21:31 <+nemo2> oh darn
21:32 <+nemo2> funny. same thing w/ slack guys
21:32 <+nemo2> "we don't have a good ncurses client, but why would anyone not want to use our awesome gui client?"
21:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Slack is a bit laggy forme
21:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and, I don't understand sense of it
21:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> why anyone should use it?
21:34 <@heinrich5991> team chat in companies, I heard
21:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I using it, for laravel cchat
21:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> they ar eon slack
21:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but, it's just chat.. I don't see special abilities
21:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You can PM, you can make channels
21:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and assign people to it
21:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> oh, and send images, and videos
21:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but every modern chat can do it
21:52 <+nemo2> sounds good to me.  
21:52 <+nemo2> no need to overload things
21:52 <+nemo2> but yeah. I think it was intended to just be an enhanced IRC for existing company systems
21:53 <+nemo2> which is probably why their integration still works pretty well. and probably would work even better if they didn't only reluctantly support it
