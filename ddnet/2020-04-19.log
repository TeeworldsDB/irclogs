06:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> Hello! How can i disable replays of my best race?
06:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> 
06:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> And sorry for my english :)
06:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> cl_race_show_ghost 0
06:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> Thanks!
06:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> I think maybe there is a bug in solo part. When one player touch the switch, the other player can be affected as well.  I am not sure if that is expected. This map's name is #megaRosenkohl
06:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/701294024744632350/maybe_solo_bug.mp4

06:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> more clear vesion
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> itâ€™s expected yea
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Eki> ðŸ¤”
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> Hello again. Can i set tunes only for 1 player?
10:16 <+ChillerDragon> doubt
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> Ok
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> hm
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> 
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> Command laser is not defined. Why :/
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> where
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> maybe it is still rifle?
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @TimiT you mean with the ddnet mod or generally, by coding it?
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> Mod
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> Ddnet server
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://releases.llvm.org/10.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> llvm 10 released :o
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://releases.llvm.org/10.0.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like it has support for  C++2a
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> How create commands? Only edit code?
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @deen do you know how i can make the players-cache work with python3?
13:24 <+ChillerDragon> TimiT what kind of command do you want to create? But it usually involves writing code yes.
13:25 <+ChillerDragon> @TimiT if you want to create admin commands i covered that in a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2pFajc0PYg
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon you program exactly like I do ðŸ˜„
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if everyone else also does that? I really like working from something observable in the client
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> Chat-commands
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> Thanks
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 if u want to test on macos u need to isntall the library https://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @jao import diskcache?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's compatible to py2 + py3
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2139/files#diff-a2beba57a7886142c6043b3f9010ff22R24
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `status` â†’ `Status`
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> new github username ryo?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need to turn `^((\?)?[ifs](\[[\w\d]+\])?(\s*|$))*((\?)?r(\[[\w\d]+\])?$)?` into C
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is that?
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> just include some regex lib
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it matches valid teeworlds argument strings
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Preferably before oy starts getting mad
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> :D
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> struggel
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I'll use a finite state machine
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon ye
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 done
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @deen cache.get('jao') works as expected on python2 but with python3 it returns None
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> Hello again! I made map on last version on ddnet, load it into ddnet7, but when I run it, game freeze like windows xp
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> What should i do to fix it?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> Hello again! I made map on last version on ddnet, load it into ddnet7, but when I run it in teeworlds, game freeze like windows xp
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TimiT> Hello again! I made map on last version on ddnet, load it into ddnet7, but when I run it in teeworlds, game freezes like windows xp
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @jao oh no, so that probably means they are not compatible...
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, who wants to switch all our server scripts to py3?
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TimiT that's weird, haven't heard of it. you could upload it somewhere for someone to take a look
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Hello, if I add custom tunings to the client, then the unpacker throws errors when receiving a tunechange from the server. How does DDNet clients handle that?
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @TimiT you mean load the map with teeworlds editor?
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen I want
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 good luck!
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> do you need any hints?
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. where are the scripts I need to port
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> on ddnet.tw in servers/scripts
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess for what jao needs ranks.py & players.py have to be in py3. they use ddnet.py though, which is used by everything else too
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so i guess the easiest way would be to make ddnet.py py2/py3 agnostic and then port ranks/players
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the clean approach would be porting everything
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 your RepackMsg doesnt work for clientid -1 (to everyone)
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> guess you need two packets, one for 0.7 one for 0.6, then decide (server gets the info from the 0.6 packet)
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @jao it might actually be a unicode thing. could you try cache.get(u'jao')?
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (came up with that thinking about what you have to keep in mind when porting to py3)
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut yeah, never figured out how to fix that either
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen if it's a problem in py3, he should rather try b"jao"
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> u"jao" and "jao" are the same in py3
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> cool, that works
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> b'jao'
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but ddnet.py still needs to be ported to py3 compatibility
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> getting invalid syntax there in line 810
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> python3 scripts/test.py to try
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut generating two packets for every packet sounds so wasteful though ðŸ˜¦
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 seems like the only way to go
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/unique-clan/unique-race/commit/b713e8b2038f49474adeefc7d990e511004f82a2#diff-25bcc1bcfab43c7e0957ca2fa89fe34fR597-R604
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> timakros fix
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But that wont work when doing it like you want
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's even worser
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so 2 packets :P
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there must be an elegant way to do this
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but then we shouldnt call it RepackMsg, instead PackSixup
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, maybe just one packet, and while sending it we re-set the data and the size
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> either to pMsg->.. or Pack->
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> depending on the version
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> problem is pMsg no longer contains the msgid at all
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why?
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm so off my game this week, I keep coming up with the shittiest of ideas
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut because we pack it later so the msgid translation can happen at the very end before we send out the messages
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i try something
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that branch is broken btw, it might not work at all
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I will work on my mod, but thats the same basically
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> when it comes to the general idea
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we might need to go even lower then CServer
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont think so
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but lower then CServer we don't know about CMsgPacker
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that'd make things so spaghetti
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> as always @heinrich5991 had the right idea to begin with, this quickly gets ugly when we do it inside the source
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 i dont get any better than you, for my need I also needto support IDs >= 32, but I dont really get something
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what will you do with IDs >= 32?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 0.7 has some
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also, I guess if we can't do the translation at the lowest level, maybe we'll have to do it at the highest level?
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no idea, i just need >= 32 :(
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Where we actually first start to pack the message
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What's the problem with >= 32? it should pack just fine into a byte
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> atm i cant get it to work (still the old system)
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well nvm, lets first clean that up
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wait, you are on 0.7 you shouldn't have any trouble sending 0.7 messages
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 msg 32 and up take more than a byte
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it's left shifted once (for the system flag), and there's a continuation and sign bit
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, how does 0.7 handle that?
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> where does the system flag go?
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 0.7 fixes the packing
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so that multi-byte integers aren't a problem anymore
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the system flag is packed right at the beginning
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (bit hacky if you ask me, but it's fine)
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we also fixed the problem no?
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mayhaps
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but when repacking, you mgiht need to shift the packet by one byte if the new ID is longer/shorter
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut you can use the same approach I am using, but I think I'll migrate away from it
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why?
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm thinking of moving the translation all the way up to where we initially pack the message
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> shit but then we don't know who we are sending it to
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> we do need 2 packets
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you see a way out of this? If we repack it at the very end before sending we need to generate two packets, one for 0.6 one for 0.7, if we repack it any lower than that the network will need to be aware of CMsgPacker and that's just spaghetti. If we repack where we first decide to send the message we don't know the target thus we don't know how to pack it
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we should re-do teeworlds in protobuf ðŸ˜›
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess generate two packets for every packet that goes out to more than one target?
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜¦
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if even you don't see a way out, I guess I'll have to go with that
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `error: unable to index file datasrc/maps`
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> whats that? i am updating my mod to 0.7.5
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i have some maps of me in that folder
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 can you have a look at my build test btw? It fails since I merged your GetDataSize stuff from vanilla. https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/runs/582507528
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah, i know it i guess
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/commit/97118a0c4ed1bccd51d45a978f909d4ad8050a0b
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why are these embedded images so big, so annoying
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> o.o
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> when entering a link like this `<link>` it wont show the preview
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not a "fix test" btw, it's a "fix implementation" ðŸ˜‰
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜›
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, I get what you mean, but before your commit i handled it the ddnet way, i just merged the conflict wrong
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but your datafile reported wrong sizes, that's a bug ðŸ˜› not a broken test
