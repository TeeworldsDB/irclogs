00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Shouldn't they run in parallel if they are independent?
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they both need access to the terminal
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so can't run them in parallel
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That's an interesting CPU+GPU combo ðŸ˜„
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where do you get the GPU from?
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The G stands for integrated AMD GPU on an Intel CPU, doesn't it?
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I remembered that I was suprisied when they worked together
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> interesting, seems to be the case
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm just using the onboard graphics card
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so some intel stuff
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh right, addition on-die intel graphics
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we could cache the terminal output and print it out when test is finished only
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just 2 seconds for me, so doesn't matter
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> someone with nvidia optimus can test,
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if setting the default GPU to intel or nvidia vice versa changes the order the graphics card are displayed in the client (settings -> graphics -> graphics cards)
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> someone with nvidia optimus can test,
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if setting the default GPU to intel or nvidia vice versa changes the order the graphics card are displayed in the client (settings -> graphics -> graphics cards)
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in the vulkan backend
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> someone with nvidia optimus can test,
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if setting the default GPU to intel or nvidia vice versa changes the order the graphics card are displayed in the client (settings -> graphics -> graphics cards)
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in the vulkan backend (and always restart the client)
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> someone with nvidia optimus can test,
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if setting the default GPU (in the windows setting or nvidia setting or both) to intel or nvidia vice versa changes the order the graphics card are displayed in the client (settings -> graphics -> graphics cards)
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in the vulkan backend (and always restart the client)
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but ninja buffers the output, make doesnt
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Ryozuki @heinrich5991 you know why it's necessary to install some dependencies from visual studio for rust on windows ?
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> is it optional or ?
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> `Rust requires a linker and Windows API libraries but they don't seem to be
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> available.`
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ah ig this explains
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ^ or anyone with a laptop with dual GPU
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on windows
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on windows 10+
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oh
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> good thing i didn't do it yet then ðŸ™‚
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> On macos too?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we currently dont build a vulkan backend on macos, so this would only help if you'd build it with molten-vk enabled ^^
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> Ok
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> hi, i try to compile teeworlds cause i want to start coding with it. well i dont know whats wrong but i installed everything i need and still i cant select teeworlds for compile it. any help? ðŸ˜„

19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its probably easier to use the cmake gui to generate a `.sln` which u then can open in visual studio.
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Or use vscode
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thiink you need to pick a configuration
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> i think better to use vscode for now ðŸ™‚
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> how i do this? :))
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think u misinterpreted me, visual studio code != visual studio
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why do u even want to develop for teeworlds?
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> teeworlds is almost dead
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ddnet's source is also open source
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> sometimes its not about if a game is dead or not, if no one would play it i would be still the one who is here and wanna code something for it
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> create some cool things which players want idk, its my fav game so why not ðŸ˜„
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i am just confused that you ask in ddnet discord for help ^^
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> "or"
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> oh, im wrong here? can you tell me where i can ask that?
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well not wrong, but teeworlds also has a discord
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> i just downloaded teeworlds for test, could also use ddnet no problem ðŸ™‚
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do as you wish its just important to understand that ddnet is already quite different to teeworlds
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> could you tell me why? Arent ddnet is based on teeworlds?
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ddnet for example requires rust, u can read through ddnets readme to get most stuff installed, ddnet also has a vscode workspace, which might help to get started
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes but the code bases are already quite different
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> teeworlds is more simple, some stuff is cleaner. but the maintainer is basically dead, so dont hype yourself to upstream changes ^^
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> lol
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> i dont wanna do changes
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ddnet client is more powerful. with more features more graphics backend, more network exntesions etc.
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> i was kinda planing to create a server with an own modification
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> note here, that if u base it on 0.7, ddnet clients wont be able to join your mod
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> idk what i wanna do, just for test now i wanna know how i compile it. after i got it i may start with think what i want
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> i know that already, thanks
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> want to do a server modification where 0.6/0.7 can join ðŸ˜‰
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> and i guess there is already some servers who have this
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> anyway, with vscode u can probably simply open the directory, vscode's cmake extension will automatically find your c++ compiler and configure the workspace for you
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with visual studio, i dunno how well their cmake support is already.
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that's why i suggest if u want to use vs, use cmake-gui to create an .SLN project file
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or simply search the internet, how to open a cmake project ^^
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> i never used cmake XD
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and also make sure to have submodules checked out with git
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> i guess i want to use vscode to compile. i try to do it like in this video but like i said it does not show me the application teeworlds.exe or server.exe 
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> 
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsoGOfBqPns
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ddnet already allows this, besides this is a HUGE undertaking. It took some very interesting hacks in the low level network code and hours of manual labour handling the differences in the game protocol of 0.7
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean go for it, but making the 0.7 patch from scratch would take a lot of your time ðŸ™ƒ
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> didnt know but good to know, still wanna do an own modification with my own idea ðŸ™‚
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just go ahead and try
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> its fine
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it seems like u never coded in c++ before anyway?
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so for the first project just test out some things ðŸ˜‰
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> for first project i wanna compile it ahah
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> just did some basics things nothing special yea
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On the top. Where it says Keine Konfigurationen. Do you get any options?
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1057002035855241216/image.png
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> yea
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pick x64 debug. That should give you run options
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1057002365485580309/image.png
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> only open some file
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On the bottom, in the log thing. Do you have a cmake tab?
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In the dropdown maybe? Sorry I haven't touched windows in like 4 years for development
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1057003180573081681/Screenshot_20221226_213237_Discord.jpg
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> yea i have but its clean
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a feeling you dont have cmake installed. Did you pick it when installing vs?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> second lemme look i dont remember
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> haha ye probally was the problem. installing 3gb now. brb ðŸ˜„
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 3gb cmake ez
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> no i installed the wrong c++ item there too installing it now
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> no i installed the wrong c++ item there too, installing the right now
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> was just troll, but visual studio generally is really huge ðŸ˜„
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its better than my whole OS xD
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> xdd im thinking about to get a dual boot soon
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oO, vscode workspace?
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> cmake is only 100mb on my computer
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> other/vscode/ddnet.code-workspace
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> never tested on windows tho xd
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> does it read it auto?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> looks like the file has only build target, so its fine as i use command line tools
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it suggests all extensions u need
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what, cmake and c++ extensions?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> they're the ones everyone has
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont understand what u are trying to say
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it has language server, targets, some sane defaults, clang-format config..
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what exactly do u want more
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> my ddnet folder has a .vscode folder with an almost empty settings.json
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> nah i install a c++ tool too, i download the wrong one
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Jupeyy_Keks i prefer to use tools separately from the IDE in general to not be trapped using some tools ^^
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wtf xxD
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well do as u like
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i prefer to be effective than hipster
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> im limited by windows compilation time anyway ðŸ˜„
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well your 2 core 100 yrears laptop i'd also consider hipster
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> mingw and msys are notoriously slow because they use almost raw gcc code, so they had to workaround some system calls that don't  exist in windows, and it's freaking slow
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah, i compile ddnet faster in a VM than on windows
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> + it's 8 cores
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> hipster
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u live in EU right
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you mean European Union? Don't we all here?
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 4 germans, 1 french, 1 spanish/catalon, 1 turk living in Italy
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> true story
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 1 american if i count Voxel
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but probs like 8 germans xd
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> I count deen, heinrich, robyt3 and you
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> zwelf, robyte, deen, heinrich, me (MURPI 100% confirmed) ravie and few hunderets more

20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> got this both errors
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> yea
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you should add compiler to the PATH variable
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> how i do this? :3
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't even know what's the visual studio compiler is called
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't even know how is the visual studio compiler is called
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't even know how is the visual studio compiler called
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you gotta add the path of the compiler to the PATH variable
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> i dont understand anything there
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> why i need to add these things you saying me right now. in the youtube video where the guy compile he only download visual studio, python and git lol
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how did you call cmake?
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> from visual studio?
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> i just installed cmake from the internet cause i dont find it in vscode
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> are you using vscode or visual studio?
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> those are not the same
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> oh
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> visual studio
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> the community version sorry
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so you called cmake from visual studio or from command line?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> from visual studio
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> ctrl + s
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> thats it
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> and got these 2 errors
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://www.mindfactory.de/shopping_cart.php/basket_action/load_basket_extern/id/9389aa2211653a0a0b6d9e0df51a1eaf23bb3466f8b3c1f140e
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> here for 300â‚¬
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> depends if you target -msvc or -gnu
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, i don't really know, i've never used visual studio
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> someone here who use?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> except robyte and chairn most are probs linux devs
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> :/
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I mostly don't use Visual Studio either, but if I do, I generate the project files with standalone cmake
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the "Ausgabe anzeigen von"
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you give us a screenshot of the dropdown menu?
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even back when I did use windows I either used mingw or nmake+cl
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i only used cmake-gui xd
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the build should work in msvc just fine, I'm doing that when I test the cmake build on windows
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (msvc has native support for cmake)
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> @heinrich5991
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> well got this 2 errors only now
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not the dropdown menu
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you tell us where you got the errors from?
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> wdym
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where do you see these errors?
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you give me a screenshot?
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> sorry pc crashed need to start visual studio again
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> @heinrich5991 sorry it takes me a time to start everything

21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seems you moved the teeworlds directory after it was already open in msvc
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you maybe delete the C:\teeworlds\out folder?
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> yes
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> delete the out folder
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> or the folder which are in
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the out folder
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> dunno
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> well worked, let me try the same with the ddnet src for being sure i know how it works
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dont forget to install rust for it
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <benla> ahaha pc crashed again, well thats it for today. gonna look into it tomorrow. ty for help
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're welcome
