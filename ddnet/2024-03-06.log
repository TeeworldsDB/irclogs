04:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i've always heard that unsigned is better for raw data and signed is better for text
04:10 < bridge> <Ewan> in practice there's very little difference
05:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ wtf where did you get that name from xd
06:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Depends on the shell. Thats one of the portability hacks. Tbh I usually avoid sed -i in my scripts because its so annoying. Creating a temporary file is much more portable. So the issue is that macOS sed -i refuses to work without backup file. But the backup file is not supported by linux. So you need basically a if statement saying. If mac do backup else do nothing. And the -i'' hack does that in some cases I still think it fails on most mac

06:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> i use clangd. Go send your compiler flags
06:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I use mason. But ddnet does not work out of the box. I assume because of the generated code. This has to be a solved problem by one of you i just cba to reinvent the wheel here

07:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> all i had to do is add `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1` to cmake command
08:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jupeyy_keks webgl doesn't support geometry shaders, a gg
08:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Switch to webgpu. But maybe they also don't support it xd
10:15 < bridge> <teero777> For clang yea
10:15 < bridge> <teero777> For clang-tidy yea
10:15 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, I definitely remember fraunhofer holding mp3 patents. I wonder how that happened with EU not doing software patents to begin with
10:17 < bridge> <teero777> Then symlink the generated file to the main folder
10:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i dont have to symlink anything :p
10:19 < bridge> <teero777> Hmm. I had to do it for nvim clangd
10:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> This ^ or cxx_compiler_ Something ( im at Work and cant Check atm, i Made it an alias so i dont remember lmao )
10:34 < bridge> <learath2> @heinrich5991 it seems they really did hold patents to it. I guess these are not "software patents" for some reason. EP0393526A3
11:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> note that `signed char`, `char` and `unsigned char` are three different types
11:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> whether `char` has a sign or not depends on the platform, but AFAIK independent of that, it's a type different from `signed char` and `unsigned char`
11:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in that manner, I think you should use `unsigned char` or `uint8_t` for bytes, and `char` for text
11:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> name me one shell where `-i` and `-i''` isn't exactly the same
11:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdrgon
11:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon
11:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I have no clue why this wouldn't be a software (or math) patent
11:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there are no math patents either in europ AFAIK
11:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there are no math patents either in europe AFAIK
11:43 < bridge> <learath2> I think(tm), the patent does not represent itself as a computer software patent, or a math patent. It's just the right amount of both to be considered neither. As in the math and the software are a means to an end, rather than the things getting patented
11:44 < bridge> <learath2> Article 52 is the piece of law that grants these exceptions to patentability and it is worded in such a bizarre way with that "as such" at the end that it's hard for me to interpret
11:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> has the mp3 patent been tested in court?
11:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I've only found settlements wrt. that patent yesterday
11:48 < bridge> <learath2> It's for some reason extremely hard to google for this stuff. But I'm guessing not
11:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it might be related to the fact that google tries to prioritize new results
11:50 < bridge> <learath2> Also this is like the core patent. There are like a dozen more around this that patent more specific parts of mp3. Maybe they litigated one of those somewhere

12:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> is this unholy?
12:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-18.1.0
12:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> llvm 18 is out
12:04 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> that hurts -.-
12:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's wrong with it?
12:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> these are conventions I've seen in software
12:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> use `unsigned char` if you mean bytes and `char` if you mean strings
12:05 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> the standard states that it's in general undefined if `char` is `signed char` or `unsigned char`
12:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> implementation-defined
12:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but yes
12:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> wait no
12:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's implementation defined if `char` is signed or not
12:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but it's never `signed char` or `unsigned char` AFAIK
12:07 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> ```The signedness of char depends on the compiler and the target platform: the defaults for ARM and PowerPC are typically unsigned, the defaults for x86 and x64 are typically signed. ```
12:07 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> >The signedness of char depends on the compiler and the target platform: the defaults for ARM and PowerPC are typically unsigned, the defaults for x86 and x64 are typically signed.
12:07 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> > The signedness of char depends on the compiler and the target platform: the defaults for ARM and PowerPC are typically unsigned, the defaults for x86 and x64 are typically signed.
12:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this does say anything about the point of contention
12:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this does not say anything about the point of contention
12:09 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> erm yes, `signed char`, `unsigned char` and `char` are distinct types iirc
12:09 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> (even if `char` is one of the other 2 under the hood)
12:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I just verified this using a compiler
12:11 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> sqlite works for different platforms and doesn't want to mess around with what `char` really is on the concrete platform/compiler ^^
12:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it wouldn't matter for sqlite3
12:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it could simply™ cast it to `char` just at the API boundary if it wanted to be internally oblivious of `char`'s signedness
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Just use char8_t
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then u epyc c23 coder
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also it's unsigned
12:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But this whole mess about data types is something I always disliked about c and cpp
12:19 < bridge> <learath2> As with most other things, C suffers from still supporting ancient shit
12:19 < bridge> <cyberFighter> like ddnet
12:19 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i get it
12:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xdddd
12:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Based
12:20 < bridge> <learath2> No need to support ebcdic, no need for CHAR_BIT to be anything but 8
12:20 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> there were architectures with less than 8bit/byte :D
12:21 < bridge> <meloƞ> Looks at the External json that cant be merged because we still support.. what was it, Ubuntu 12(?) and some other really old fkn distros and they dont Support latest upstream :cammostripes:
12:21 < bridge> <learath2> The keyword being "were"
12:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> link?
12:21 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> hey, they for sure run some military weather station
12:22 < bridge> <meloƞ> #7703 Heinrich
12:22 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7703
12:23 < bridge> <learath2> There are also some exotic embedded stuff that uses chars bigger than 8 but honestly they can just compile with an older compiler. C23 has no reason to be able to target a DSP or whatever designed in the 80s
12:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that doesn't look like "ubuntu 12", but even now, "the currently newest fedora version"
12:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://repology.org/project/json-parser/versions
12:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps we could use rust to parse json ^^
12:26 < bridge> <learath2> I must be getting scammed on my internet bill. 93€ for 2 months is insane
12:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> 🤤
12:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> Wtf
12:27 < bridge> <learath2> Mh, not an amazing fit I imagine. You'd either have to fill a complex C++ structure from rust or have C++ call into rust to retrieve fields
12:28 < bridge> <learath2> I'd do the latter fwiw, if you want to give it a go
12:28 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> > The size of the byte has historically been hardware-dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size. Sizes from 1 to 48 bits have been used.
12:29 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> :D
12:29 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> try to write portable code with this
12:30 < bridge> <learath2> Well C truly makes this sort of portability easy. Unless you are doing something with the bit representation of a char, you'll be fine
12:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I was thinking the first, the structs we parse into aren't that complicated
12:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I wouldn't say "easy". maybe "possible"
12:31 < bridge> <learath2> But then you need to generate a struct from each of our json schemas which we don't even have because we don't really enforce
12:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think C is compatible with a 1-bit `char` btw
12:31 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> I ask myself what the difference between `signed char` and `unsigned char` is on a 1-bit-byte architecture ^^
12:31 < bridge> <learath2> Can't be less than 8b iirc
12:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because a `char` must be able to store `[A-Za-z0-9]` IIRC
12:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> Im developing a restAPI in rust that Kind of does that, and communicate to IT using ddnets http, curl stuff, If i understood it correctly thats what you meant ?
12:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> link?
12:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> Private still :P
12:32 < bridge> <learath2> Not really. We were talking about using ffi
12:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> Can Send parts to you in DM later when im Home
12:33 < bridge> <learath2> Just directly calling into native code compiled from rust
12:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> I c
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Http client would have been perfect fit for rust
12:36 < bridge> <learath2> Yep, not performance critical. I considered it but then I didn't feel like rewriting the entire thing
12:37 < bridge> <learath2> Tbf I doubt there is much overhead to the c++ bridge, so a lot can be done in rust
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I only mentioned it BCs of the struggle we had with our job system and curl lately
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I guess from a learning POV you learned new stuff xd
12:39 < bridge> <learath2> I really don't like the job system tbh
12:40 < bridge> <learath2> If I were doing teeworlds from scracth in C++ I'd probably look into using something like folly::future with green threads
12:40 < bridge> <learath2> Or at the very least I'd implement something with an API resembling folly futures. Chaining and being able to control execution locality is so useful
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I used reqwest with tokio. The only thing I can complain about is that reqwest takes 20ms to start the client
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That's as much as the vulkan backend
12:43 < bridge> <learath2> Fwiw, rust wouldn't have saved us from any of those either. The issues were with logic at the edge of the interface with aborting
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah dunno. My io aborting is like 5 lines of code xdd
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Raii carries
12:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> rust's futures can be implicitly aborted, it's pretty built into the system
12:46 < bridge> <xv.15> anyone can send me a file to host insta laser lan server?
12:47 < bridge> <zhn> i think they talk about using current rust-cxx-bridge to parse json in rust and work with it in cpp
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```rust
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> // else path is only for the internal state
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pub fn cancelable(mut self) -> Self {
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>         if let TaskState::WaitAndDrop | TaskState::CancelAndDrop = self.task_state {
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>             self.task_state = TaskState::CancelAndDrop;
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>         } else {
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>             panic!("the cancelable call has no effect on this task, because it was not part of the task queue. Use the join handle directly.");
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>         }
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>         self
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>     }
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> // in the Drop impl:
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> TaskState::CancelAndDrop => {
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>                 let mut inner = self.io_batcher.borrow_mut();
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>                 let task = Self::drop_task(self.queue_id, &mut inner);
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>                 #[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>                 task.abort();
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>                 #[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>                 task.cancel();
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>             }
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ````
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i do it over the join handle of tokio (and whatever i use on wasm) and they simply support aborting as a function call.
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i hope it formatted well xd
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```rust
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let http = io.http.clone();
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>         io.io_batcher

12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>             })
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>             .cancelable()
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> example spawned task to download server list as text
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which auto cancels
12:53 < bridge> <zhn> use hyper xd
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think it uses hyper under the hood
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it simply gives me an idiomatic interface.. perfect, because i doubt the ddnet client or server will ever need performance critical http requests xd

12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tru xd
12:55 < bridge> <zhn> idk if quic fits for it
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @xv.15 ping chillerdragon
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> who just spawned
12:56 < bridge> <xv.15> @chillerdragon
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @xv.15 i happen to know some of the zillyinsta devs irl
12:56 < bridge> <xv.15> he talks with a bot
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it's fully local, probably not
12:56 < bridge> <zhn> ChillerDragon: spawnkill
12:56 < bridge> <xv.15> its confusing
12:56 < bridge> <xv.15> ok help!!
12:56 < bridge> <zhn> he's on irc
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> make sure not to use the master branch
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there are segfaults on the master branch as a political statement
12:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xdd
12:57 < bridge> <xv.15> what
12:57 < bridge> <xv.15> im cofnused
12:57 < bridge> <xv.15> why cant it be like alivefng where u just press run server?
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> master is a wording used in slavery
12:57 < bridge> <zhn> yep it ran rm -rf ~/ on mine server after first segfault
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk alivefng run server is there a gui with a button? :D
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @xv.15 what are you looking for?
12:58 < bridge> <xv.15> insta laser
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what do you need zillyinsta for?
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fng is not implemented yet
12:58 < bridge> <xv.15> just insta laser lol
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just iCTF
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no iDM
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is that working for you?
12:58 < bridge> <xv.15> nope i couldn't figure out anything
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but iCTF is what you want ye?
12:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> have you ever compiled a teeworlds server?
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does that work on w11's new terminal? xd
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i bet he uses windows
12:59 < bridge> <reitw> No
12:59 < bridge> <xv.15> nah most i did was run a fng server which was literally just running an exe
13:00 < bridge> <reitw> rm works but it's not the same binary, you can't -rf
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so you want to run it on your windows machine locally?
13:00 < bridge> <xv.15> yes
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah too bad. u can't troll linux users with that, would be cool to be at least able to do it for windows users
13:00 < bridge> <reitw> U have since the ls
13:00 < bridge> <reitw> Then*
13:00 < bridge> <reitw> There's some tools in windows11 now but sometimes they work differently
13:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @xv.15 windows is untested but you can be my Guinea pig if you want
13:01 < bridge> <xv.15> as long as i don't get sent maleware thats fine 😁
13:01 < bridge> <xv.15> as long as i don't get sent malware thats fine 😁
13:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> as a language model i can not send malware
13:02 < bridge> <xv.15> ok lets test it
13:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gimme 10min to download and upload some m$ exe with asian bamboo network
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or you know what
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just use the old version thats ok the new only added bugs
13:03 < bridge> <xv.15> why do you speak with a webhook btw
13:03 < bridge> <xv.15> what version
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ZillyInsta/ddnet-insta/releases/tag/v1.5
13:04 < bridge> <zhn> he's on irc
13:04 < bridge> <zhn> thats why
13:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1709726642.png
13:04 < bridge> <zhn> pigeon mail when
13:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> click here and enjoy virus
13:04 < bridge> <xv.15> ok
13:04 < bridge> <xv.15> done
13:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then unzip it and there is a DDNet-Server.exe that you should just be able to run
13:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hopefully as smooth as alivefng
13:05 < bridge> <xv.15> 🙏
13:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 10mins was probably too ambitious anyways xd https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1709726742.png
13:06 < bridge> <xv.15> am i stupid
13:06 < bridge> <xv.15> or is that just ddnet
13:06 < bridge> <xv.15> 🫣
13:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a
13:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> set sv_gametype xd
13:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``sv_gametype iCTF``
13:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in your config
13:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> more config options are documented here https://github.com/ZillyInsta/ddnet-insta?tab=readme-ov-file#configs
13:08 < bridge> <xv.15> is that f2 or something in the files
13:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> autoexec_server.cfg is where your configs go :) 
13:08 < bridge> <xv.15> alr
13:08 < bridge> <xv.15> found it
13:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there should be one already just delete the entire content of the file and then add in your configs
13:09 < bridge> <xv.15> in this case just sv_gametype iCTF?
13:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye
13:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: hey 😏
13:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe also ``sv_rcon_password youradminpass``
13:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yo milk
13:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am browsing ur dotfiles rn
13:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lookin for ur clang options
13:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not finding it
13:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I dont have any
13:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> XD
13:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bruv
13:10 < bridge> <xv.15> i did it but now my maps don't show !!!
13:10 < bridge> <xv.15> but it works
13:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if at all chiller would add miners, not viruses xd
13:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maps don't show automatically
13:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you mean in the votes?
13:10 < bridge> <xv.15> ye
13:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you need to add every vote manually
13:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: did u try that cmake flag?
13:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what maps do you have?
13:10 < bridge> <xv.15> just the classic fng map
13:10 < bridge> <xv.15> how do i make the server start with that
13:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sv_map classic_fng_map_name
13:11 < bridge> <xv.15> alright
13:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``sv_map openFNGBeat64``
13:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and to add map vote ``add_vote "ctf1" "sv_map ctf1"`` for ctf1 for example
13:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat idk i dont use cmake
13:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> oh
13:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what u use :thonk:
13:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/kickstart.nvim/blob/ae9dc893373ce2deaebd336ee806b1147c2e2074/init.lua#L542
13:12 < bridge> <xv.15> that under the sv gametype correct?
13:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @xv.15 yes or above
13:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in a new line 
13:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how do u compile ddnet
13:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ?
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> with cmake
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but this is for vim lsp
13:13 < bridge> <xv.15> did that but now the server cant run probably because openfngbeat64 isnt actually the map name
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not compile
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd @xv.15 
13:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> can u gimme the cmake command
13:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> u use
13:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats not related to my vim
13:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i use this ``mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j69``
13:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which i aliased as bam ofc
13:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``alias bam='mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j69'``
13:15 < bridge> <xv.15> chiller after adding a map called openFNGBeat64 in my map folder it will work fine right?
13:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> eh yes @xv.15 :D 
13:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you already have the map right?
13:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how is it called
13:15 < bridge> <xv.15> finally done
13:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pro
13:15 < bridge> <xv.15> thansk chillerdragon for the viruses
13:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks for the bitcoin
13:16 < bridge> <xv.15> enjoy
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you having a ictf lan party or what are you doin?
13:17 < bridge> <xv.15> having ictf lan party lol
13:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: ur clangd tries to find the file cmake makes
13:19 < bridge> <zhn> invite us too!!
13:19 < bridge> <xv.15> its lan
13:19 < bridge> <xv.15> how do i do that
13:19 < bridge> <xv.15> i cnat ipforward cuz 5g
13:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: if u use dis  `cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 ..` ur lsp will work
13:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> milk thanks vim overlord lemme try
13:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fk my lua has buggos
13:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it works very pog! 
13:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ima add that flag to my bashrc c: 
13:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> noice
13:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat thanks prolly saved me like 3 hours of figuring that shit out my self xd
13:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i had the same problem with clangdeez nuts first time when i tried to write c++ code xD
13:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ur such a primate
13:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the forced deez nuts jokes xd
13:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am still waiting for him to mention teeworlds on stream
13:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it should happen any second now
13:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> any helix users? :justatest:
13:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wats dat
13:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> code editor
13:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://helix-editor.com/
13:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Im lost without heinrichs dissector
13:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> anyone wanna decipher some tw packet ? :D 
13:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> as fun challenge
13:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon>
13:30 < ws-client> https://twnet.zillyhuhn.com/?d=08+04+02+9c+6b+cb+da+42+0e+07+06+00+40+27+6e+61+6d+65+6c+65+73+73+20+74+65+65+27+20+65+6e+74+65+72+65+64+20+61+6e+64+20+6a+6f+69+6e+65+64+20+74+68+65+20+67+61+6d+65+00+06+0b+0f+9a+51+9b+51+b3+92+ad+b9+0b+9f+01+00+03+00+06+00+00+00+00+00+14+00+00+01+0b+00+da+c8+f0+91+02+cc+b0+d0+b1+02+da+e8+d8+f0+0b+ff+ff+fb+f7+0f+ff+fd+fb+f7+0f+ff+fd+fb+f7+0f+ff+ff+fb+f7+0f+40+de+e4+d0+b1+03+ff+ad+98+a1+01+ff+fd+fb+f7+0f+ff+fd+fb+

13:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its teeworlds 0.6.5
13:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and the parser does seem to parse it wrong
13:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> pass
13:32 < bridge> <teero777> Looks nice might try later ve been looking for a vscode replacement
13:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> can i paste there snapshot bytes from demo? :thonk:
13:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> neovim :gigachad:
13:34 < bridge> <teero777> I have made myself a good config but I'm not comfortable yet
13:34 < bridge> <teero777> I am always switching back and forth between nvim and code
13:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i closed vscode one day and never opened it since
13:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat i don't parse snaps yet and also it needs full packets not only parts
13:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ah gg
13:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but soon(tm)
13:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
15:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> Ggwp chillerdragon nice bait
15:47 < bridge> <learath2> I've been very happy with my nvim setup, I add keybindings as I need them so it's easier to keep in mind
15:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> glad you liked it, i remember you beeing unsure about using it or not :D
15:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> glad you enjoying it, i remember you beeing unsure about using it or not :D
15:50 < bridge> <learath2> One thing I've been missing is multiple cursors, but instead of getting a very complex extension that implements it, I've been trying to get used to the vim way
15:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you give an example of when you'd use multiple cursors?
15:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> multiple cursors? where you edit 20+ loc at the same time?
15:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> i've only ever used it to comment out stuff in vsc without using /**/, but even then, you can just g[lines]/ in vim to do that (i think?) atleast i dont remember binding that myself
15:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> multiple cursors? where you edit multiple loc at the same time?
15:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I comment lines using ctrl + v, select lines u need, shift + i, `//` :owo:
15:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> i avoid visual as much as possible :kek:
15:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> so i keybinded everything to normal
15:57 < bridge> <zhn> i've used multiline cursor in jsonmodels kekw
15:57 < bridge> <meloƞ> °-°

15:57 < bridge> <zhn> its kinda useful with help of ctrl+arrows
15:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> an email starting with "It's not scam" is always a good sign, what are airdrop projects? crypto stuff?
15:58 < bridge> <meloƞ> (thats what google said)
15:59 < bridge> <0xdeen> I too would start my scam mails with "it's not scam" and then ask for 10 minutes access to my Github account 😄
15:59 < bridge> <0xdeen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1214950598353358878/Screenshot_2024-03-06_at_15.59.34.png?ex=65faf9eb&is=65e884eb&hm=45896acef2210346c7794c216a017873ee19950723b38f2dea9cf0fb3bdb524d&
16:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
16:00 < bridge> <zhn> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airdrop_(cryptocurrency)
16:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> ye found that aswell
16:00 < bridge> <meloƞ> i mean hey, its only 10 minutes!
16:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> ANd you could get 1200 yuan!
16:01 < bridge> <0xdeen> maybe it's related to some Nim code I wrote a while ago, but I don't think I even care enough to check if this is a real scam or a crypto-scam
16:01 < bridge> <zhn> its both ig xd
16:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It literally said that it's not scam
16:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> fair enough, ey deen, mind redirecting that e-mail to me? i need that 1200 yuan, my coffee machine just broke
16:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> fair enough, hey deen, mind redirecting that e-mail to me? i need that 1200 yuan, my coffee machine just broke
16:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ez 1200 to donate for ddnet :santatrollet:
16:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ez 1200 yuan to donate for ddnet :santatrollet:
16:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 153€, not bad
16:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but still, with a non-zero probability of getting scammed, working some hours to get 153€ sounds better
16:05 < bridge> <learath2> well if you have an ethereum wallet already you could just claim it, there is no way they can get to your private key from something signed with your public key
16:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> where does it say "signed with the **public** key"?
16:07 < bridge> <learath2> well if you have an ethereum wallet already you could just claim it, there is no way they can get to your private key from something signed with your private key
16:07 < bridge> <learath2> fixed 😄
16:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> signing something you don't understand with your private key sounds very dangerous
16:08 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, doesn't sound particularly dangerous to me, atleast not in the sense that it might compromise your security
16:09 < bridge> <learath2> It might be compromising legally
16:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> compromising your current or future funds on this address
16:15 < bridge> <learath2> I was talking about your github ssh private key, but even if it was your wallet private key, I don't understand at all how signing a message can compromise anything
16:16 < bridge> <learath2> What sort of ethereum signed message are you thinking about that could compromise your current and future funds on this address?
16:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> github ssh key is even worrse
16:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> potentially free ssh auth for ddnet.org
16:18 < bridge> <learath2> Ok you have to elaborate on this attack because it breaks everything I know about asymmetric cryptography
16:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> i checked and my account can receive 5000 flt
16:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> but the ssh thing looks iffy
16:19 < bridge> <learath2> btw, they didn't implement it like that, I misunderstood their script. They give you an ethereum private key that is encrypted using your github PUBLIC key it seems, then with that private key you sign the address you want the FLT in
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw the starknet drop is real
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know cuz i claimed that one
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> and got a substanciable amount of cash
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> i will not disclose kek
16:21 < bridge> <learath2> If I got in any of those drops I would just immediately sell it btw, these shitcoins are usually only worth something right after they are allowed to be traded
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill just say its more than the ddnet funding of this year
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats what i did
16:29 < bridge> <learath2> @heinrich5991 pls send elaboration, I have banks to hack
16:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sec
16:38 < bridge> <ar1gin> ddnet nfts when :gigachad:
16:40 < bridge> <learath2> I want the bluekitty nft
16:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> twinbop
16:40 < bridge> <ar1gin> I would by all the twinbops my wallet allows me
16:40 < bridge> <ar1gin> :owo:
16:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Im paying all my money for twerking twinbop nft
16:53 < bridge> <miguilim> I will try to parse it using teeframe later
16:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> (me wanting some mermydon_twinbop2)
