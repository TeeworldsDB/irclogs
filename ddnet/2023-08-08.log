01:27 < bridge_> <kdaniel> eyo warum mutet mein client leute die ich nicht als friend habe standart m√§√üig? ich muss immer die leute als freund adden um die aus player zu unmuten und dann kann ich die wieder entfernen?
01:27 < bridge_> <kdaniel> eyo why does my client unmute people i don't have as friends by default? i always have to add people as friends to unmute them from player and then i can remove them again?
01:29 < bridge_> <bencie.> cl_show_chat_friends 0
01:30 < bridge_> <bencie.> i dont really like the name of this command
01:30 < bridge_> <bencie.> there's cl_show_chat_friends and cl_show_chat_system and they both behave differently even though their names are similar
01:30 < bridge_> <bencie.> cl_show_chat_friends enables friend only mode, whereas cl_show_chat_system enables or disables system messages
01:31 < bridge_> <bencie.> `cl_show_chat_friends` enables friend only mode, whereas `cl_show_chat_system` enables or disables system messages
01:31 < bridge_> <bencie.> there's `cl_show_chat_friends` and `cl_show_chat_system` and they both behave differently even though their names are similar
01:31 < bridge_> <bencie.> `cl_show_chat_friends` toggles friend only mode, whereas `cl_show_chat_system` enables or disables system messages
01:33 < bridge_> <kdaniel> where is this command in settings? just want to know
01:33 < bridge_> <kdaniel> but thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
01:50 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> Any solutions?

02:14 < bridge_> <nekorul> I would like to make some comments on my experience with multi-view, when any tee other than the one you marked first kills, it gets removed from the multi-view camera focus. This can be quite annoying when multi-view works like this in short solo maps. Maybe this feature can be developed further to make players adjust its features in the way best suitable their own experience.

07:44 < bridge_> <wus_blood_doing> is it because global ipv6 is noprefixroute? im just going out on a limb here
08:02 < bridge_> <wus_blood_doing> may be because isp has security shield
08:19 < bridge_> <wus_blood_doing> stuck registering ipv4 too so has to be ^

09:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> open ports
09:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> iirc multiview is meant for teams not solo
12:29 < bridge_> <Assa> how long does it usually take for a release? Is there a schedule or is it more or less feature based?
12:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Usually 1-2 months.
13:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> depends on robyt activity
13:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
13:42 < bridge_> <Assa> okay, thank you ^^
13:43 < bridge_> <Assa> okay, thank you, asking again in septembre ^^
13:43 < bridge_> <Assa> okay, thank you, asking again in september ^^
13:44 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> why?
13:45 < bridge_> <Assa> working on a map requiring a feature which is merged in the current master, but not present in the current release
13:46 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> i see, which one is it tho? havent been up-to-date lately
13:47 < bridge_> <Assa> the elasticity feature, so bouncy and sticky blocks (with tune layer) üòé
13:47 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> they added that? :D lol. I just added a elasticity tune in my mod like a few days ago, after having it on my todo for ages xD
13:48 < bridge_> <Assa> yes, heinrich asked me if I will finish it, and I implemented all required fixes/changes
13:48 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> how do the sticky blocks work?
13:48 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Very cool, do you have the pr?
13:48 < bridge_> <Assa> negative elasticity, and maybe some other changed tuning values (ground_control_speed, ground_control_accell, ground_jump_impulse (preferably 0))
13:49 < bridge_> <Assa> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5398
13:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @essigautomat is this not included in the upcoming releasE?
13:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > [Client] Implement elasticity tuning values (ground_elasticity_x/y) [AssassinTee]
13:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @essigautomat it is
13:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u just need to wait till #announcements releases
13:52 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Very cool
13:52 < bridge_> <Assa> @ryozuki that's why I was asking when I should expect the new release
13:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> read the message?
13:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
13:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in announcements
13:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dislike ppl who dont read :p

13:53 < bridge_> <Assa> I didn't even know you are announcing new releases in advance
13:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> tell me if u need more red  kek
13:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this has been a thing
13:58 < bridge_> <Assa> ah nevermind it's marked as client feature
13:58 < bridge_> <Assa> (why?)
13:58 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> probably deen went through it quick and didnt really look at it xd

14:00 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> i hope the chat glitch is fixed now
14:01 < bridge_> <Assa> only 1 week until my map needs to be finished, gotta map quick
14:02 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> just dont poop until u finished it
14:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Nothing better than a bit of drama about some useless topic
14:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Which glitch
14:07 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> i'd say like 30-40% of the time when the chat is opened, everything gets buggy, like it used to be when you are out of the world. i think there used to be a cl_clear or whatever, which had the same effect if no background was applied to a map
14:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah, that's a driver bug. Use Vulkan then it's gone
14:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It probably won't get fixed ever
14:08 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> how is it a driver bug, if it got introduced like 1-2 versions ago?
14:08 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> :D
14:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's probably IME related
14:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah windows
14:08 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> i use open gl 3.3 i think
14:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The os for the elite
14:09 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> xd
14:09 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> anyways, it's a newer bug, definitely came with the last 1-2 versions or smth
14:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah there was a big ime update
14:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's since then
14:10 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> hm, and can't that specific part or whatever be reverted? i really dont know how it works
14:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well it's some windows/Nvidia internal bug
14:10 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> why is it only triggered in chat?
14:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> There is nothing to be fixed here. Just use Vulkan
14:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why is it only triggered with OpenGL
14:10 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> i wont use vulkan, sorry, not trying to disrespect your work, but i just prefer the look with gl 3.3
14:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Chat maybe opens some ime stub
14:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It looks 1:1 the same
14:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If not then that's also a driver bug
14:11 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> not really, and the hookline is buggy
14:11 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> i'll start by updating my nvidia driver when i get home xd
14:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Show screenshots
14:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Of these bugs
14:12 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> i will once it happens again, i didnt think u needed it. iirc i reported this bug once already, sec
14:13 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> @jupeyy_keks
14:13 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> also look at the bottom left "All:"
14:14 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> and while the chat is opened, also things like freeze turn darker, i cant really describe it :D

14:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_computing
14:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Much of the power consumed, and heat dissipated, by conventional processors comes from moving information between logic elements rather than the actual logic operations. Because superconductors have zero electrical resistance, little energy is required to move bits within the processor.
14:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> >  Superconducting logic can be an attractive option for ultrafast CPUs, where switching times are measured in picoseconds and operating frequencies approach 770 GHz
14:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks future in our hands
14:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 770ghz
14:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Omg would be beyond epic
14:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rsa no longer safe

16:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://manifold.markets/QuantumObserver/will-the-lk99-room-temp-ambient-pre
16:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> there is a prediction market
16:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> people bet
16:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 19% on yes rn
16:27 < bridge_> <robyt3> Doesn't make sense to me that this would fix the issue. There shouldn't be a limit to the command length anywhere in the console system except for temporary commands, which this shouldn't be
16:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but when money is involved its diferent
16:27 < bridge_> <screeeny> xD
16:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u want a vector then?
16:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe i misunderstand
16:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the issue at hand xd
16:28 < bridge_> <robyt3> You'd need to investigate why the limit to the command length applies to config variables
16:28 < bridge_> <robyt3> It should only apply to temporary commands, which are commands that the server sends to authed clients
16:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it fixes the issue tho i see the help rendered
16:29 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yeah, but it's not a clean fix for the issue IMO
16:29 < bridge_> <robyt3> This would also increase the length of commands that the server can send. Not sure if that's a good idea
16:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```cpp
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> void CConsole::RegisterTemp(const char *pName, const char *pParams, int Flags, const char *pHelp)
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> {
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     CCommand *pCommand;
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     if(m_pRecycleList)
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     {
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         pCommand = m_pRecycleList;
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         str_copy(const_cast<char *>(pCommand->m_pName), pName, TEMPCMD_NAME_LENGTH);
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         str_copy(const_cast<char *>(pCommand->m_pHelp), pHelp, TEMPCMD_HELP_LENGTH);
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         str_copy(const_cast<char *>(pCommand->m_pParams), pParams, TEMPCMD_PARAMS_LENGTH);

16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         char *pMem = static_cast<char *>(m_TempCommands.Allocate(TEMPCMD_NAME_LENGTH));
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         str_copy(pMem, pName, TEMPCMD_NAME_LENGTH);
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         pCommand->m_pName = pMem;
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         pMem = static_cast<char *>(m_TempCommands.Allocate(TEMPCMD_HELP_LENGTH));

16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     }
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its used here
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its also used in rcon in 1 line
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe just put 2 constants for sizes xd
16:31 < bridge_> <robyt3> `RegisterTemp` should not be called for config variable through
16:31 < bridge_> <robyt3> Doesn't make sense since they are not temporary
16:32 < bridge_> <robyt3> In `CConsole::Register` it just takes the `const char *pName` directly
16:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ok ill look a bit into it
16:40 < bridge_> <robyt3> The other usage looks like the issue
16:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> ```cpp
16:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> char m_aCommandName[IConsole::TEMPCMD_NAME_LENGTH];
16:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> char m_aCommandHelp[IConsole::TEMPCMD_HELP_LENGTH];
16:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> char m_aCommandParams[IConsole::TEMPCMD_PARAMS_LENGTH];
16:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> ```
16:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> Is used in `game/client/components/console.h`, so the local console is also limited to these values
16:42 < bridge_> <robyt3> And also `char aBuf[sizeof(m_aCommandName)]` in `console.cpp`
16:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @robyt3 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6983/files
16:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> check now
16:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> tested with asan xd
16:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> seems to work
16:45 < bridge_> <robyt3> Nice. Maybe would be easier without the nullptr checks
16:45 < bridge_> <robyt3> If you initialize the pointers to `""` instead
16:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> true
16:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That's the spirit xd
16:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xdd
16:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i have a rust mentality
16:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> check everything

16:51 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/scripts/languages/update_all.py
16:52 < bridge_> <robyt3> But this imports other python scripts in the same folder
16:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye
16:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if only we used toml directly
16:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or some format
16:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
16:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> actually we can do that
16:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lets migrate
16:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im always for revolution
16:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Rewrite the script in rust
16:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> robyt wouldnt understand it then too
16:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dunno
16:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @robyt3 do u know rust
16:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe he secretly learn
16:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> For ddnet
16:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> he is secretly a rust pro
16:53 < bridge_> <robyt3> No, but I guess it's the next programming language I learn when I ever have enough time
16:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nice
16:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Epic ddnet admin moment
16:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> btw
16:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> my asan shows stuff even with suppresions
16:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think
16:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> (not this pr)

16:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> unknown module  means some lib right
16:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not ddnet
16:56 < bridge_> <robyt3> Shouldn't this show debug symbols in DDNet though?
16:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but maybe its from a external library without symbols
16:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im building with debug and -DDEV=ON
16:56 < bridge_> <robyt3> you can look up the address with `gdb`
16:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im gdb noob
16:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
16:57 < bridge_> <robyt3> `gdb DDNet`, then `info symbol 0x13c843e`
16:57 < bridge_> <robyt3> `q` to quit gdb eventually

16:57 < bridge_> <robyt3> I though we had suppressions for those
16:58 < bridge_> <robyt3> I thought we had suppressions for those
16:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh ye
16:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i didnt run it with sup under gdb
16:58 < bridge_> <robyt3> But that address is from the ASAN log
16:59 < bridge_> <robyt3> And your log doesn't show symbols for json for some reason

16:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well i ran gdb without suppresions
16:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk how to pass the line
16:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
16:59 < bridge_> <robyt3> gdb should be unrelated to those suppressions
17:00 < bridge_> <robyt3> Can you look up the other symbol addresses (the number after `DDNet+`)?
17:00 < bridge_> <robyt3> Maybe you linked with a system json library instead of compiling it from source
17:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
17:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> (gdb) set env UBSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=./ubsan.supp:log_path=./SAN:print_stacktrace=1:halt_on_errors=0 
17:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> (gdb) set env ASAN_OPTIONS=log_path=./SAN:print_stacktrace=1:check_initialization_order=1:detect_leaks=1:halt_on_errors=0

17:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> (gdb) run
17:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
17:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> now i got this setup
17:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dont see the json thing now
17:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ==3925==LeakSanitizer has encountered a fatal error.
17:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ==3925==HINT: For debugging, try setting environment variable LSAN_OPTIONS=verbosity=1:log_threads=1

17:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> No symbol matches 0x13c843e.
17:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if we use a lib, then ye
17:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think
17:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dont have submodules
17:03 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yeah, we link with a library with it's available, but I don't think it's from the submodule
17:04 < bridge_> <robyt3> I don't really see the purpose though because we could just always compile a fixed version from source and would have problems with mismatching versions installed from the system
17:05 < bridge_> <robyt3> I don't really see the purpose though because we could just always compile a fixed version from source and would not have problems with mismatching versions installed from the system
17:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dont think its a mismatch its simply the UB wasnt supressed cuz i didnt pass the suppression
17:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> with the supression file it doesnt show
17:06 < bridge_> <robyt3> I mean that we need to ensure that the json parser version in our source matches the version that package maintainers use, or we can run into issues
17:06 < bridge_> <robyt3> I recently tried to update the json parser and was reminded that it's not so straightforward
17:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
17:08 < bridge_> <robyt3> I wonder if we should update Wavpack at some point. Our version is from 2006
17:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why not
17:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well i use system iirc
17:09 < bridge_> <robyt3> 1. Would need to make sure it doesn't change how any existing sound sounds
17:09 < bridge_> <robyt3> 2. Lots of work because they completely refactored the API
17:10 < bridge_> <robyt3> 3. Need to ensure package repositories have the version of Wavpack that we use
17:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> link to the lib?
17:11 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yeah, probably better anyway
17:11 < bridge_> <neben> error from the release candidate

17:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd i meant a link to the docs xDD
17:11 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://github.com/dbry/WavPack/blob/master/doc/WavPack5PortingGuide.pdf
17:12 < bridge_> <robyt3> Does `libssp-0.dll` exist in the folder with `DDNet.exe`?
17:13 < bridge_> <neben> nah
17:13 < bridge_> <robyt3> How did you update? Looks like it broke.
17:13 < bridge_> <robyt3> Download the ZIP again, the file should be in there
17:13 < bridge_> <neben> Okay
17:15 < bridge_> <neben> Seems like yeah sorry for that
17:16 < bridge_> <robyt3> Did you update by only copying the `exe` or how did this happen? Would be interesting to know how these issues during updates happen
17:16 < bridge_> <robyt3> Or ingame-updater or steam?
17:17 < bridge_> <neben> I didnt even update it, I just downloaded the zip, extracted and launched the exe ü§∑
17:17 < bridge_> <neben> I dont know what I did wrong tho, but after downloading again it was in it
17:18 < bridge_> <robyt3> Maybe we just forgot to add the dll to the zip and later fixed it, I don't know
17:19 < bridge_> <learath2> It‚Äôll mostly all be fixed by #5842 hopefully
17:19 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5842
17:19 < bridge_> <learath2> But I keep rebasing it, which uses all my energy then I get back to here and don‚Äôt have the energy to fix the final remaining windows compilation issue, then it goes stale again
17:20 < bridge_> <neben> #1
17:21 < bridge_> <neben> #0001
17:21 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1
17:21 < bridge_> <robyt3> lol, easily broke the check for numbers below 50
17:21 < bridge_> <learath2> There is lots of UB in the current updater because it assumes http requests happen one by one sequentially, but the new http module does them in parallel asynchronously
17:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> soon 20k commits

17:42 < bridge_> <Voxel> when 0.7 support finally finishes and we can join 0.7 servers, will people **play** them?
17:58 < bridge_> <learath2> Probably not, but let chiller enjoy his dream
19:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's quite possible they confuse my 0.7 fng servers with 0.6, since they are named equally xd
19:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Feature wise 0.6 is further
19:23 < bridge_> <learath2> We'll also need to dedupe the list somehow now that I think about it
19:24 < bridge_> <learath2> Dont want people joining bridge servers accidentally when we support both
21:45 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> If I understand it correctly, the client 'll show one list item per server (not one item per address): https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5949#issuecomment-1667909172

22:17 < bridge_> <solayer> how??
22:17 < bridge_> <solayer> omg
22:18 < bridge_> <zwelf2> chillerdragon (and other interested): I've added a torrent file to conveniently download the ddnet discord archive. If you want to search through it, you can use grep on the download ^^. I've made it a private torrent without peer discovery, so it's currently only a better http download. https://archive.strct.cc/bt/2023-08-07-ddnet-discord-archive.torrent. I could turn peer discovery on, but I think the bandwidth of the server is enough.
22:19 < bridge_> <solayer> hey
22:19 < bridge_> <solayer> how do you talk to Chiller?
22:20 < bridge_> <zwelf2> he's just offline xD. just be patient
22:20 < bridge_> <Voxel> why do u want to talk to chiller so much
22:20 < bridge_> <zwelf2> he's offline xD. just be patient
22:20 < bridge_> <solayer> he is cool
22:20 < bridge_> <solayer> lol
22:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> he will read your ticket
22:26 < bridge_> <solayer> ok
