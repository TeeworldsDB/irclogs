04:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Is there a chance that a bigger drive can slow down a vm?
04:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or did i mess something up here? xd
08:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> in my experience, vms have lots of trouble with disk access
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea seems like
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh btw if you add ``.`` to you path you save a lot of typing of ``./`` :greenthing:
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon I hope that's a joke. Otherwise try: `echo "#!/bin/sh\necho 'rm -rf /'" > ls; chmod +x ls`
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Also note the same problem with LD_LIBRARY_PATH
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Also note that LD_LIBRARY_PATH=MyNewPath:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH will add `.` to LD_LIBRARY_PATH if it was previously empty since empty string is the same as `.`
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can improve disk IO by giving an entire disk to your VM
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> instead of having files on yet another FS
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xxxD
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i guess i need multiple disks then o.O i only have one drive in my laptop meh
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i actually expected bad things to happen when adding . to path but i didnt expect someone to know what will happen o.o
18:16 <@deen> @ChillerDragon you could try a partition too, also helps compared to files
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea ill try thanks
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its weird imo that the 30 runs smooth and the 80 gb vm struggels
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> both files
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, weird
