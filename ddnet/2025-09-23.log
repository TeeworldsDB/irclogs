00:05 < bridge> <Assa> they should open a ticket, but the PR robyt link was only integrated into yesterdays (mondays) nightly
00:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ono crashes
00:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Where are the backtraces!
00:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2: weren’t you working on automated crash reports?
03:42 < bridge> <lahcxn> Today i joined a server and developed my way through LearnToPlay
09:42 < bridge> <Assa> The hook collision line bug count is now officially at 8, making them more broken then the old speedtiles 💀
09:56 < bridge> <Assa> Learath don't answer, he's trolling
09:56 < bridge> <Assa> obv bait, no triangulation
09:56 < bridge> <learath2> I’m working on 80 different things including moving across europe and doing a full time masters program. Soooo one day we might get automated crash reports
10:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa do we have an ddnet issue for https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2977 ?
10:18 < bridge> <Assa> I was writing one rn, you were faster
10:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** blazingly issuer
10:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** maybe you should hide your DDNET backtrace from the TEEWORLDS issue xd
10:19 < bridge> <Assa> I already know where this is crashing btw
10:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** me too
10:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its in the trace xd
10:19 < bridge> <Assa> OnMapLoad it reads nullptr quads
10:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** `pSrc=0x0`
10:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** `pSrc[SrcIndex].m_Skip`
10:20 < bridge> <Assa> it clearly says DDNet.exe :justatest:
10:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes
10:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** still troll 
10:21 < bridge> <Assa> I am troll, didn't even notice that I was writing in teeworlds issues xD
10:21 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** no you didnt ofc
10:22 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but now that you know i think its not nice leaving other projects traces there
10:22 < bridge> <Assa> also I think I found out how to crash ddnet as well with a bug since 18.4
10:22 < bridge> <Assa> do you know how I see the screen values?
10:22 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** imo it is rude to report bugs from forks upstream
10:23 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** screen values?
10:23 < bridge> <Assa> Yes, if you manage to line up ScreenX0 perfectly, the client should crash in rendering xD
10:23 < bridge> <Assa> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7922#issuecomment-3322893594
10:24 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** u mean if they are in some dbg hud?
10:24 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** idk
10:24 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont do gfx
10:45 < bridge> <Assa> time to crash 18.4
11:01 < bridge> <Assa> Crashed ✅ I can now crash 18.0 and know, that the bug is not present in the new version. I can also create a pull request removing this debug assertion and doing a better validity check
11:01 < bridge> <learath2> That’s illegal, don’t be crashing clients <a:angy:708860880498196542>
11:01 < bridge> <Assa> I am crashing clients in order to crash less clients 😠
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Not crashing != not having a bug tho.
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Hiding bugs usually just leads to more bugs
12:00 < bridge> <Assa> Yes, but I understand how this happened and tried to explain it. Ofc you can continue hunting ghosts
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I see no explaination at all
12:01 < bridge> <Assa> >  because X0 was able to be bigger then XR in principle
12:01 < bridge> <Assa> Click on the issue, there is a bigger explanation
12:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That is not an explaination of the bug
12:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That is the explaination of the crash
12:02 < bridge> <Assa> Guess I'll spin up the debugger and reproduce again
12:05 < bridge> <Assa> The bug is, that X0 >= X1 and the layer is still beeing drawn, or do you want to know how X0 and X1 are beeing set?
12:06 < bridge> <Assa> @jupeyy_keks btw the reported crash was on normal zoom and I can crash it on normal zoom
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> OK then tell what leads to this value
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> A bug in our projection?
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Especially on normal zoom
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The camera goes out of bounds?
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That is the issue right?
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Like out of map bounds or smth
12:27 < bridge> <Assa> The crash itself is here `unsigned int NumVertices = ((Visuals.m_pTilesOfLayer[y * pTileLayer->m_Width + XR].IndexBufferByteOffset() - Visuals.m_pTilesOfLayer[y * pTileLayer->m_Width + X0].IndexBufferByteOffset()) / sizeof(unsigned int)) + (Visuals.m_pTilesOfLayer[y * pTileLayer->m_Width + XR].DoDraw() ? 6lu : 0lu);
12:27 < bridge> <Assa> `
12:27 < bridge> <Assa> 
12:27 < bridge> <Assa> If X0 > XR, then NumVertices underflows
12:27 < bridge> <Assa> link to old code: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/36825f51715569c77598a206dbaf0b3212982184/src/game/client/components/maplayers.cpp#L905
12:28 < bridge> <Assa> XR is X1 -1
12:29 < bridge> <Assa> I find it really hard to reproduce right now, the debugger lags on the map border there
12:29 < bridge> <Assa> it's a bug on the map border , because this clips X0 and X1 value
12:31 < bridge> <Assa> it would help if I'd link the right old code from 18.0 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/6888f75fac87096e153f61f2a5db5903450c5927/src/game/client/components/maplayers.cpp#L1004
12:31 < bridge> <Assa> here is the bug: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/6888f75fac87096e153f61f2a5db5903450c5927/src/game/client/components/maplayers.cpp#L1017
12:31 < bridge> <Assa> Should have been X1 >= m_Width
12:31 < bridge> <Assa> 
12:31 < bridge> <Assa> Any my PR didn't even fix it, it was fixed between 18.0 and 18.4
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but your pr moves random stuff
12:33 < bridge> <Assa> "random"
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ifc if you magically fixed it. Just explain wtf the bug is
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> How hard can it be to reproduce it
12:34 < bridge> <Assa> you need to be at the map border and produce exact x1 and x0 values
12:34 < bridge> <Assa> how hard can this be?
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes that would be the correct answer
12:35 < bridge> <Assa> It was fixed between 18.0.3 and 18.1, I want to pinpoint the commit now
12:38 < bridge> <Assa> ~It was fixed between 18.1 and 18.2, I want to pinpoint the commit now~
12:38 < bridge> <Assa> ~~It was fixed between 18.1 and 18.2, I want to pinpoint the commit now~~
12:40 < bridge> <Assa> 18.3 to 18.4
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @essigautomat so why not simply check if x0 >= x1?
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in the continue
12:48 < bridge> <Assa> the loop has nothing to do with x0 and x1, it iterates over rows
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and it skipped the row if x0 > x1 previously
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dunno what you refactored
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but the > simply gets >=
12:50 < bridge> <Assa> it skips every row if X0 > x1 previously, you can move this out of the loop
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Anyway, without the assert it sounds to me that you could make zoom = -1 and crash client
12:51 < bridge> <Assa> and then there is the X0 <= XR check in my PR, which prevents this
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Good, but you ignore the case
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> previously if x0 really was bigger it crashed
12:51 < bridge> <patiga> wow if you haven't seen https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/295908390956433410/1419937088232620094 yet, its worth it :heartw:
12:51 < bridge> <patiga> my favorite ddnet animation as of yet by far
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is not the same
12:52 < bridge> <Assa> I don't think a crash is more desirable, I can add the debug message for the else case
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i just told you a case
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which could fuck up some stuff, if you dont prove otherwise
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyway, @essigautomat now neutral again. this bug only happens in 18.0-18.4?
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not before not after?
12:54 < bridge> <Assa> I only managed to crash it in 18.0, the issue was only about 18.0, as far as I can tell it was there until 18.3
12:59 < bridge> <Assa> do the screen values swap with zoom = -1?
13:00 < bridge> <Assa> because the PR i provided shouldn't crash, it should just render nothing
13:00 < bridge> <Assa> because the PR i provided shouldn't crash, it should just render nothing, if this is the case
13:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> This one? https://m.bilibili.com/video/BV1oHp2zPEPt
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> 18.0 code:
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> ```
13:06 < bridge> <Assa>             if(X0 > X1)
13:06 < bridge> <Assa>                 continue;
13:06 < bridge> <Assa>             int XR = X1 - 1;
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> ```
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> 
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> `If X0 == X1, XR < X0` which underflows NumVertices
13:07 < bridge> <Assa> 
13:07 < bridge> <Assa> How can this happen? At this point idk
13:07 < bridge> <Assa> Solution: Check if XR >= X0, what my PR does
13:07 < bridge> <patiga> yea, sry chiller ^^
13:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> yea it’s cute :3
13:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But before 18 it did not happen, right? So there was a check previously preventing it.
13:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But anyway, if you tested with negative value fine, just write it in your PR
13:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wtf is `git replace` ?? and why did it not create conflicts????
13:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i just swapped out a old commit in the history not affecting any shas on top of it. Not creating conflicts even if the other commits were based on the now outdated changes??????
13:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it gets even weirder
13:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the code still compiles
13:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ?????
13:34 < MMC> https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/3570832/#3571069 gem
13:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git replace me
13:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Do i want to click a random link by a random person?
13:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** looks like 4chan
13:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chiller you go first
13:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** pretty boring
13:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and non tw related
13:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> delete
13:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** git replace is giga troll ngl
13:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it creates just a fake history
13:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** not doing any actual changes to the code
13:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** well that also sounds op to bypass reviews xd
13:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but not useful for me who actually needs to replace
13:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf
13:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git replace is super epyc
13:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** u know it?
13:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> didn't know it's so cool
13:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No, I just read about what it can do
13:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** u understand it?
13:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** for me it did random garbage
13:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok but export & importing kinda sucks
13:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Would be cool if it just works in a repo
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You can fix old commits without changing history kinda
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But only to a certain limit
13:38 < bridge> <Assa> I don't get why this should crash with a negative zoom value, except if you think that this should invert the screen. If you set `zoom -29` you zoom out of the map. Can you specify what you mean?
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I expect that
13:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ but i want to change history.. i guess i need rebase then
13:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i wonder if i can cherry pick during an interactive rebase xd
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or just swap out the sha in the rebase editor
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** that might actually work
13:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You want to truely change history?
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its pr
13:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `git rebease --interactive HEAD~4`
13:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Best tool
13:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> of git
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i have two branches
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** branch a and b
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** b is based on a
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** a got force pushed
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** b has commits on top
13:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** now i need to get b updated with the new commits from a
13:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git rebase interactive you can just change commit hashes
13:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** interesting
13:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i will try that
13:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fakin git replace sidequest xd
13:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gl
13:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i wonder if i need to delete .git because i dont understand git replace xd
13:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Honestly just start from scratch
13:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git init --bare
13:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fr
13:41 < bridge> <robyt3> `git checkout b`, `git rebase -i a`, then discard commits from a in the interactive rebase log to keep only original commits from b
13:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sick
13:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** o
13:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Chiller just use llm no joke
13:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont trust it
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I bet these questions got answered 200000 times
13:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** last time i asked llm with git question it couldnt help me
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And they are accurate enough
13:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i lost my merge head
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
13:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i still dont know how to get it back
13:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its so easy to lose it
13:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and llm rly didnt get me
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno, once it's pushed to github it will stay
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You can restore anything
13:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** no
13:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** imagine dis
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Even if you force push
13:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** u have conflicts
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So just randomly push your stuff for backup
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** then you solve them
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** then you do `git merge --continue` ye?
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or rebase --continue
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I never merge
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I always rebase
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** same thing
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but u wanna do rebase --continue rite?
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** now
13:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> At some point
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the big danger is
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** that it is quite easy to break `git rebase --continue`
13:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if u ran the wrong command
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in worst case you do git rebase --abort
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Dunno wtf you done
13:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you cant
13:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you cant abort
13:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or continue
13:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if you lost the merge head thing
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf? XD
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Show me your prompt
13:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it says THERE IS NO REBASE HAPPENING
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No way it suggested to fuck up that badly
13:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** happens quite often
13:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** for example if you do `git rebase --committer-date-is-author-date`
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What are you using, Cellegen AI?
13:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont use ai
13:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i can hallucinate on my own
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you commited stuff you can restore, they have a hash somewhere
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> How hard can you fuck up
13:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thing is
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Only stupid you can do is force reset without ever having commited
13:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** some commands like --abort or --continue only work while rebasing or merging
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So always type git stash before resetting
13:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and that depends on some file being there
13:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and that file is easy to lose
13:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No matter if you use the stash ever again
13:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** then i am done solving all conflicts
13:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and cant finish
13:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i could only create a new commit
13:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but not finish the rebase or merge
13:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok
13:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** maybe i suck at pomting idk
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Nah
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I simply don't believe you
13:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ez
13:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont think its that of an edge case given how often it happens to me
13:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** omg
13:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i will show u sec
13:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** need to create conflict

13:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fr
13:53 < bridge> <kebscs> not that bad
13:54 < bridge> <kebscs> client's default is comfort for long time now
13:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Idc anyway, just update pr for whoever cares
13:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Wtf really?
13:55 < bridge> <kebscs> yea
13:55 < bridge> <Assa> aaaaaaaaa this assertion issue makes me crazy
13:55 < bridge> <Assa> why did 18.0 crash for me this one time exactly there?
13:56 < bridge> <Assa> why can't I reproduce it
13:56 < bridge> <Assa> all bs
13:56 < bridge> <kebscs> cl_assets_entities default value is default but im pretty sure it was comfort for me when i installed game
14:00 < bridge> <kebscs> or maybe is not, on phone i have default
14:00 < bridge> <Assa> that's in general an issue if you have text written over something and text in an image itself
14:00 < bridge> <kebscs> wtf
14:01 < bridge> <kebscs> should be comfort though, since its shipped with the client and looks way more modern
14:01 < bridge> <Assa> like you will unbreak sbs entities and break others instead
14:01 < bridge> <kebscs> yea thats why i dont like the old entities, text on texture is bad
14:02 < Jfif> Hi
14:03 < bridge> <kebscs> hi
14:03 < Jfif> Test
14:06 < bridge> <Assa> @jupeyy_keks can we merge https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10936 ? I am pretty sure you and I can count to 1
14:08 < bridge> <Assa> And together, we're 2 ❤️ :owo:
14:15 < bridge> <Assa> @kebscs since you tested the hook collision line, did you test different tuning values?
14:17 < bridge> <Assa> because of tune hook_length 9999 and hook_fire_speed 1 :omo:
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok
14:18 < bridge> <kebscs> ah right
14:18 < bridge> <kebscs> i found 1 now with tune
14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And i thought chiller is our new merge bot
14:18 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1420021468649099294/image.png?ex=68d3e18c&is=68d2900c&hm=5b62b6e12f47e476e8f96b17f7d74badf8f70f8772653ba604070357d90e7302&
14:18 < bridge> <kebscs> this should extend to cursor, not player hit pos
14:18 < bridge> <Assa> chiller is skillchecked for anything related to gfx 🙁
14:18 < bridge> <kebscs> tune hook_fire_speed 1; tune hook_length 600
14:19 < bridge> <kebscs> ah nvm
14:19 < bridge> <kebscs> idk whats going on
14:19 < bridge> <Assa> wrong actually 💀 this is how it should look like
14:19 < bridge> <Assa> yeah
14:20 < bridge> <kebscs> well idk why this works like that
14:20 < bridge> <kebscs> but ig works fine
14:21 < bridge> <kebscs> length with no tunes or basic tunes is good
14:21 < bridge> <kebscs> and with tele outs
14:21 < bridge> <kebscs> so better than before
14:21 < bridge> <Assa> explanation:
14:21 < bridge> <Assa> The hook takes longer than 5 seconds to hit the player, so the simulation ends and we hit the case I added for unknown hook states. Unknown hook is blue and for exceeding simulations the length is only an approximation
14:22 < bridge> <Assa> same happens with 2 teleouts, hook will color blue
14:22 < bridge> <kebscs> yea but idk why it doesnt launches towards cursor
14:22 < bridge> <kebscs> jank physics
14:22 < bridge> <Assa> exactly
14:22 < bridge> <Assa> xD
14:22 < bridge> <Assa> this is also why I give up on small hook lengths and hook_fire_speed <= 0
14:22 < bridge> <Assa> I don't even want to know what a negative hook fire speed does
14:23 < bridge> <kebscs> wait 1 more thing
14:23 < bridge> <kebscs> line isnt attached to player when you hold hammer
14:23 < bridge> <kebscs> do same thing as with tele
14:23 < bridge> <Assa> same thing as with the teleouts, do you wish the line to be visually connected (even if it doesn't color and doesn't hook there)
14:24 < bridge> <Assa> alright
14:28 < bridge> <Assa> @kebscs you can't do that, that would break the jank physics, Id need to add an extra line element for it
14:29 < bridge> <kebscs> add the short line to vLineSegments
14:34 < bridge> <Assa> this is actually really useful, you can predict where a hook goes into a wall:
14:34 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1420025458438963231/screenshot_2025-09-23_14-33-38.png?ex=68d3e544&is=68d293c4&hm=51a09b57c4555a8306de954f24f8abf77e26b9cda35988b007178dca37b8f7de&
14:36 < bridge> <Assa> jank physics will have a kink of course
14:36 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1420026154869456906/screenshot_2025-09-23_14-35-53.png?ex=68d3e5ea&is=68d2946a&hm=ffeb2a56dc984ec3deb42ab5fc2078137d98a0a70447c2241a04279da86a04cf&
14:46 < bridge> <kebscs> ok now its perfect
14:47 < bridge> <Assa> it still suffers from floating point precision issues, but compared to before, I would call it a day
14:47 < bridge> <learath2> What is this even 😄
14:47 < bridge> <Assa> the hook collision line rework I am working on
14:48 < bridge> <Assa> and before you say the second image is wrong, it isn't
14:49 < bridge> <learath2> Is that really how far the hook makes it before getting to the hook from tele?
14:49 < bridge> <Assa> no, the second image is from a simulation time exceeded state with jank physics
14:50 < bridge> <Assa> and the hook actually follows that line
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> I don't get how we can have an indeterminate state for a finite process
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> What does it mean for the "simulation time" to be exceeded?
14:51 < bridge> <Assa> with the right physics, I can make your hook take a million ticks in the future and bring your PC into it's knees
14:52 < bridge> <learath2> Do our tune bounds even allow that? Wouldn't using the hook in such a state also do that?
14:53 < bridge> <Assa> the hook line simulates the actual hook up to 5 seconds in the future with my PR. Currently it's unlimited and I can bring my PC to lags with it
14:53 < bridge> <Assa> no, the hook is calculated tick by tick, the hookline is calculated all in one frame
14:54 < bridge> <Assa> the tune bounds allow that
14:54 < bridge> <learath2> Ok, I see the issue. Why not simulate the hook line tick by tick too?
14:54 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe do it 10 ticks at a time to simulate the "instant" effect
14:54 < bridge> <Assa> this would need a full restrusture but would be possible
14:55 < bridge> <Assa> also you would need to hold still in order to get this effect, what if the player moves in the next tick?
14:55 < bridge> <learath2> Guess it's not worth it
14:55 < bridge> <kebscs> i like current code, maps should use these tunes
14:55 < bridge> <Assa> I limited it to 250 ticks, e.g. 5 seconds
14:55 < bridge> <kebscs> i like current code, maps shouldnt use these tunes
14:56 < bridge> <Assa> because I assume that if the hook takes longer, the hook line loses it's value
14:56 < bridge> <learath2> Well move = restart simulation is probably the sanest idea if you want to give that a try
14:56 < bridge> <learath2> For sane tunes it should look pretty much the same if you simulate like 50 ticks at a time or so
14:57 < bridge> <learath2> But yeah very doubtful if the amount of reworking needed is worth the trouble
14:58 < bridge> <Assa> also this wouldn't be stateless, I'd need to track this for every player of the possible 64
14:58 < bridge> <learath2> Another good point though we probably already store enough state to derive your newly required state
14:59 < bridge> <learath2> No, we don't
14:59 < bridge> <learath2> So yeah, more state needed
14:59 < bridge> <Assa> you'd at least need to store enough information to know where to continue the simulation
14:59 < bridge> <learath2> Which can be derived from the tick the simulation started at, no?
15:00 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, we don't store that currently, so yeah, new state
15:01 < bridge> <Assa> storing a tick is not enough, if you mean that <.<
15:01 < bridge> <Assa> but yeah
15:01 < bridge> <Assa> because we accumulate quantization errors
15:04 < bridge> <Assa> so we'd at least store the position, the hook tick, and the direction
15:04 < bridge> <learath2> 5s is probably good enough, it's just very arbitrary. So I'd worry there might be a combination of tunes and amount of players where it does still lag
15:04 < bridge> <Assa> oh and the player target position to detect changes
15:05 < bridge> <Assa> I agree, would you prefer a config variable for this?
15:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> If this is about hook prediction you can curve the hook depending on ur and that's enough for me
15:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Ur velocity*
15:06 < bridge> <Assa> and we don't do that lol
15:07 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, not a horrible idea, but it's really hard to get config options in nowadays
15:07 < bridge> <Assa> do we actually oO
15:08 < bridge> <learath2> Idk what he means by curve, but technically if you are going fast enough you can get your hook inside a gap and by the time it hooks onto something you will be well past the gap. Soo, very technically the hook will curve
15:09 < bridge> <learath2> Or more correctly the path of the hook will appear curved from the perspective of the tee
15:09 < bridge> <Assa> the line shows the path the hook head takes, not what the hook animation should look like
15:10 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, it's not something you need to take into account at all
15:10 < bridge> <Assa> because the chain will just connect the head position to the player, you can easily see this with telehooks

16:05 < Brap> IN LOVING MEMORY OF AOE
16:05 < Brap> We gather with heavy hearts to remember Aoe, Valid Trans Woman who lived simply but left a lasting mark on those who truly saw her. Short in stature and thin in frame, she resided in a modest hut, lived on her own terms, and walked through life with a spirit that was raw, real, and entirely her. Of Lesothese descent, Aoe cherished her roots and found deep joy in the bold, comforting flavors of Leso cuisine.
16:05 < Brap> Meals with her were more than sustenance-they were expressions of love, memory, and identity. Food was one of the many ways she kept her culture close, and she shared it generously. She was a person of contradictions-gentle but blunt, quiet but unforgettable.
16:06 < Brap>  She bore a scent that many found hard to ignore. Earthy, unapologetic, and part of the unfiltered truth. She carried in every aspect of his life. Aoe did not pretend. She was who she was. Tragically, Aoe became heckin' infamous. We do not pretend to understand the weight she carried, nor the pain that brought her to that moment. But we do know this: she mattered. Her life, in all its complexity, was worthy of love, compassion, an
16:06 < Brap> Let us not define her by how she left us, but remember her for how she lived-with honesty, depth, cultural pride, and a stubborn refusal to be anyone but herself. May we carry forward her memory not only with sorrow, but with tenderness and truth.
16:06 < Brap> Rest peacefully, Aoe. You were seen. You are missed. You are loved.

16:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> mom, multischeduling is hard af
16:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i refactored my scheduler cuz i had bugs
16:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> now i got a better scheduler, but i want to use oneshot timer in lapic, which means the timer is not periodic and i must reset the counter when i reschedule for example
16:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> the problem is depending on ur logic u can not set the timer again and the current cpu goes idle, this is how u save power when nothing to do
16:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u usually wake up with an external interrupt
16:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i have a. bug where some schedulers go idle forever when they shouldnt xd
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> rip
16:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn atomics

18:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Didn't thought they'd ever update it again
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> directly found a super obvious bug. scrolling doesnt remove the hover element

19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @essigautomat i dont see it happening with normal zoom in 18.0.. like how?
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Your map border explaination is good, but i dont think in 18.0 it can happen
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let's assume x0 == width
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```cpp
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if(X0 >= pTileLayer->m_Width)
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>         DrawLayer = false;
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> -> cannot happen.
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Let's assume it's width -1
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> X1 would be == width:
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```cpp
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if(X1 > pTileLayer->m_Width)
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>     {
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>         X1 = pTileLayer->m_Width;
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>         DrawBorder = true;
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪>     }
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> => X1 - 1 >= X0
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What I can imagine is that zoom is very small (near) so that x0 == x1 or that zoom is negative
19:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or this is some weird ass floating point thing..
19:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But x1 is always ceil and x0 always floor
19:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Must be some insane behavior
19:04 < bridge> <robyt3> AFAICT, the zoom level should always be clamped to minimum `0.01f`

22:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it must be some accidently git-blame-myself
22:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> does default client really not have this
22:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its a lock on ddnet instead of a key
22:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> weird
22:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no its just not
22:24 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** are you some git diffing?
22:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that is wack
22:24 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** to minimize upstream diff?
22:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> git pulling and being confused
22:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ddnet really doesnt show account servers as an icon
22:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that is crazy
