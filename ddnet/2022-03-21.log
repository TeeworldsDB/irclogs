01:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> Wcast-qual is a real mess in engine/shared/snapshot.cpp
08:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @snail nice video
08:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ѕα∂ℓσνє🖤> i dont have my pc and he is not good with computers :justatest:
08:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> how do i change lsit of .o files for linking with our cmakefiles?
08:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i've never used cmake other than as a user
08:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we generate CMake  objects, that is basically a bunch of o files
08:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> see e.g. engine shared
08:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <snail> ye its insane
08:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> and without cuts
08:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, but it's always in a single directory
08:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> more objects more directories
08:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> :?:
08:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> ❓
08:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> you want to change the list
08:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so add
08:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> engine-shared1
08:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> engine-shared2
08:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> but it's not compilation i change, only link
08:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> you can control the compilation then too
08:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> make -j20 engine-shared1
08:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i miss the time with makefiles you could just change 😢
08:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dont miss these times xD
08:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cmake has everything you need
08:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> me neither
08:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> with proper makefiles, you could change things with just environment variables 😄
08:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cmake can do that too
08:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> CC=clang cmake ..
08:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for compiler flags:
08:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-Werror"
08:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets be real, rust is superior cuz it has cargo.toml
08:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and a better dep management
08:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
08:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://crates.io/
08:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just CFLAGS also works, don't need to use a cmake flag
08:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u know there is a shitload of new c++ devs on windows
08:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk how they manage
08:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well they probs do projects without deps
08:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz the moment they need them
08:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> holy shit
08:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> must be rly shit
08:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but you can always change them without cleaning the cmake dir with the -D param
08:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the env flags are only cached once (first run)
08:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> probs managed c++ XD
08:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe they use vcpkg, heard it's acceptable-ish
08:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine thinking u need a 12gb ram ide when u have vim with cmake
08:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
08:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bloat
08:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I prefer my ide to use 32g, 12g is child numbers, what is that a puny browser?
08:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think i managed to do it 🙂
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> lol, the bot is faster to link that than my browser to load the issue after posting it 😄
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Learath2 
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> deen on macos has a weird bug:
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> his main and graphic thread both wait on the same condition variable
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> both (and all calls made on them, wait, notify) are protected by a mutex
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the only way this can happen imo is, that a wakeup is lost:
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> But this shouldnt happen with a mutex protecting the condition variable
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Another possibility is that the graphics thread does not notify the main thread when it started
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i purposly added a check
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/68a4404701d53d5ce6d50db19eb0f3337bd67cec/src/engine/client/backend_sdl.cpp
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I don't see how both threads should ever wait on the condition variable at the same time
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> `m_BufferSwapCond`
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Graphic thread waits on:
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/68a4404701d53d5ce6d50db19eb0f3337bd67cec/src/engine/client/backend_sdl.cpp#L74
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> main in call of:
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/68a4404701d53d5ce6d50db19eb0f3337bd67cec/src/engine/client/backend_sdl.cpp#L1112
12:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mhh maybe its bcs of the fallback not cleaning up something correctly
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, why is there 2 condvars?
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I just noticed that many client components use both "m_pClient" and "GameClient()" although "GameClient()" just returns "m_pClient" 😄 Lacks a little consistency. Although "GameClient()" is used significantly less, especially it is used often when also accessing the textures that are loaded in gameclient.
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Not Keks ^^
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mh yeah not needed, but i doubt that causes the bug
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It makes it a bit hard for me to reason about the flow, maybe if we clean that up the issue would be more obvious?
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> A notify before wait would also be lost, I was trying to look for that but it's not obvious at all
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> possible, but i kinda start to believe we forget to cleanup a thread or smth
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, first thing I'd do would be to reduce this to one condvar if possible just so it's easier to reason about
12:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sorry, I can't look more into it right now, I can take another look when I get home
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh and luckily this happens at the very start of the initialization so it should be easier to debug
12:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah thanks, weird its not reproducable for me 😦
12:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Have you checked that you are both on the same sdl version?
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think GameClient was added later
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> GameClient should be used imho
12:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> im not, but since its inside our code i assume its our bug 😄
12:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or deen didnt rebase correclty or smth xD
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the only thing that comes to my mind from a cursory glance is that 2 condvars 1 mutex being sus
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Especially when they are guarding just one condition
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but doesnt this make it safe
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that its only one condition
12:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the same condition
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the one is simple the waiter for main thread
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the other the waiter for other thread
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that's how they split
12:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It sounds safe, but it definitely throws of my in-brain concurrency analyzer 😛
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 😄
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/of/off/
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> but why m_pClient is a protected member variable, all components have access to it, why the indirect way over the function call? For access from outside I understand that. Is it about readability or is there another reason?
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Not Keks Oh you are checking m_Started, so it's 2 conds 2 condvars but one is sorta guarding 2 conds
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe just assume best case and spin on m_Started? That's what a futex would do aswell
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> if both wait for the same condition, maybe it's because the lock order is not the same in both?
12:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Since it's a one direction change you can also sleep if you don't want to be busy waiting for it, though it might be better not to yield to the scheduler anyway since the gfx thread will come up very quickly anyway, might aswell keep the cpu
12:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'll just use 1 cond, its not unsafe to have 2 conditions. they are chronological split
12:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> started never occurs afterwards anymore
12:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> easier refactoring is usually the reason
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> now that i think about it, i think thats exactly the problem
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so you are right
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i forgot that condition variables only work bcs they are atomic as soon as you call notify or wait
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and this isnt given with 2 different ones
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> \\o/
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> independent of the mutex
12:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you are looking to do m_Started another way, maybe craft an empty buffer and the gfx thread can immediately finish it and set the buffer to nullptr letting you know it's ready for more
12:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> One less variable too
12:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd i think i'll let deen test for now
12:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dont want to overkill for now
12:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Makes sense, hopefully that fixes it up
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Not Keks do you happen to know why this happens?
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/955435748323106856/screenshot_2022-03-12_19-33-42.png
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what opengl
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently happens with gl3, @Cøke suggested disabling it would fix it in his map testing channel
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then its the asset itself i'd say
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was just a bit concerned whether a lot of maps exhibit this and testers just disable gl3 instead 😄
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or driver
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> Nothing wrong with the tileset lol
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> It's Client side
13:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you post the tileset so @Not Keks can take a look?
13:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> U can exteact
13:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> I'm not at PC rn
13:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> U can extract
13:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if we have an issue with borderfix or dilate
13:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> It happens for some more ppl who got a old client or opengl3
13:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> It happens for some more ppl who got a old client or opengl
13:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> It happens for some more ppl who got a old client or opengl on
13:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> It's normal 1024x1024
13:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> 64x64 tiles
13:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> It's the same I used in multeasy btw
13:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's 960x960, looks messed up only on gl1 for me
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Looking messed up on gl1 sounds like it hasn't been borderfixed, but honestly I don't even know if you are supposed to borderfix now
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Not Keks I keep forgetting, what is the state of the two renderers? Are they supposed to be giving identical results on a frame by frame basis?
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> nope, borderfixed tilesets will look messed up on anything newer than gl1
13:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And non-borderfixed ones look broken on gl1 still?
13:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> ofc
13:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> but in this case it looks more messed up than just no borderadd
13:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> gl must have difficulty with this resolution for some reason
13:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> closer look
13:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/955439244686549033/screenshot_2022-03-21_13-13-56.png
13:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah that's why this caught my eye. It looked very wrong for some reason
13:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> I used normal 1024x1024
13:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> Idk why this happens
13:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> pipou must have exported at the wrong resolution when he edited it I guess
13:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Only Jupstar, master of all 3 gfx backends can save the world
13:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah trust opengl 3.3 xd
13:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> That idk, I just fixed the bugged spikes
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> looks similar to skins that aren't divisible btw, pixelly af
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> opengl 3.3
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 3.0
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and 2.x 
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> should all render it correclty
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 2.x has no mipmaps so it might look oversharp
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gl 1.x defs looks shit
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> But why it's fine for me?
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> Just don't use the 3.3
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> XD
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what is your GPU?
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> my opengl 1.0
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> buy new pc xd
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> use software opengl renderer
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> no
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 3.3 is the reference btw, that's what you should be testing on as it's probably going to become the default soon-ish
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> directx 10
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> plz add
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> XD
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we have vulkan, thats enough
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> Why should we test 3.3 when I don't even use this
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> Xf
13:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Cøke open client, press f1 and see what your GPU is
13:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in purple
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> gl1 looks shit on all newer maps tbh
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its 1% of users xd
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and they probs have some weird 4:3 monitors
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because gl1 renderer is almost never the one chosen, so we want the maps to look correct for everyone not the few people that has to use gl1 because of hw/driver issues
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just ignore xd
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> It's like I have to test a map for ppl with weak PC :troll: idk if they can load it or not, how should I check it
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> :troll:
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet you also use atleast the gl3 renderer. Almost no one ends up with 1 or even 2 picked
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> only intel GPUs on windows doent use GL 3.0 thats true
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> default is 3.0
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> I used nothing, I just fixed the spike
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not the 3.3 if you unchecked it I guess. Idk how the settings work now
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> many do not have open-angle version 3.3
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> YAY
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah unchecking makes it 3.0
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> maybe it's possible to make a workaround in gl1 to fix this borderadd bug? seems like just some issue with texture coords
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> Ich habe aber AMD @Not Keks
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> latest client?
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> Ne aber relativ neu
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> anyway, then its a driver bug 3.0 and 3.3 use the same shader
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dont see why they should look different at all
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> (for tile maps to be precise)
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wym? For a gpu not to support opengl 3.3 you need to go back like 3 decades
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> no
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> can you post your hardware?
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> oka
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> But I wonder why the old tileset works, just for a few ppl with very old client doesn't work
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> The tileset from Multeasy
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> old client = broken
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> anything before ddnet 14 should be broken
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/955441706239660072/unknown.png
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> win7 is out of life
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> no
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> NO
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just accept the truth
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the industry doesnt wait for win7 for ever
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> NOOO
13:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @eeetadam so you don’t have a gpu? Just integrated gfx?
13:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> ye
13:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> pc 2007 year
13:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> 2008*
13:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> intel says its form 2009, it should actually atleast have GL 2.1
13:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> So many blocked massages lol
13:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> :cammo:
13:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> no it's edited and the one with new spikes is 960x960
13:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> switch to linux then it might work xd
13:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> Ok idk why pipou did this
13:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> no
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then use software rendering or accept that your pc is dead
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i bet the integrated GPU isnt much faster than the CPU
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess there are iGPUs that are 1.5 decades old that don’t support 3.3
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> What u mean edited
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> tried
13:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But 2.1 still renders the same way so mappers should test on 3.3

13:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> why not use directix instead of opengle?
13:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> I have used another for clues, but deleted the complete old one
13:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> why not use directx instead of opengl?
13:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> :troll:
13:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> when jupstar finishes vulkan and is bored again :troll:
13:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we have vulkan,  why bother with dx
13:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> intel core 2 duo lmao
13:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why downgrade rendering for a person that wants to stick to win7 so desperatly xd
13:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> Bei mir kommt morgens auch immer der Vulkan aufn pott
13:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can buy a raspberry pi 4 for 50€ and have a better pc
13:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ttrue xd
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we do not embrace propietary
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> HEHEHEHA
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iif u have a pc from 2008 its ur fault
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i am always suprised these machines still work
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'd assume the coolers fail at some point
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well maybe rly old processors dont heat that much
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> yes
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4YPcDeyYd0
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> 120
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there u have
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok and 2008 is also "just" 14 years xd
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> degrees
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> 120 degrees
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if he can even run win10 tbf. What even is a core2duo at this point
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its better to use linux
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> no
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah for old hardware its a must have
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> n
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> except you playing win98 games xD
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> Wtf
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this guy is just trolling
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i know
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can’t upgrade to win11 because my mobo from 2014 doesn’t have a TPM
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is no benefit anyway
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> yay
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> 200 degrees
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u will get #ads in ur file browser
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> nice
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Win98 games work like a charm under wine
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah except if they have CD lock
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that always sucks hard
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don’t want to anyway, so it’s good that there is something stopping it from auto upgrading while I sleep
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 use https://reactos.org/
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to play old win games
13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I remember downloading NoCD patches when I was a young lad
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/955444829515567134/2022-03-21_13_36_29-DDNet_Client.png

13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> WTF HOLY JESUS
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> modern opengl OFF
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats with this guy reaction
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> hehehe
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/955444993387028490/unknown.png
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> oka
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> How is he getting 4.6 with modern gl off @Not Keks?
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/955445013339316254/unknown.png
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> im dead
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> .
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why r u on rc
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when 15.9.1 is out
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> i dont like manual update
13:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> and a new version was bugged for me so i changed back
13:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats the bug
13:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> it's been a while i don't know exactly, but what i can remember is that the editor crashed often
13:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> worked over hours on a map -> crash -> all for nothing so i changed to the better version :justatest:
13:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> bruhs
13:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/955446117397581904/unknown.png
13:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this reminded me of https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/58-sales-and-over-38-of-bug-reports-from-linux-said-one-dev-but-its-been-helpful/
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> @Not Keks come on test server
13:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> i changed to 1024x1024 and looks like the same
13:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> still opengl off
14:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wtf how did it try directx 12 first, guess mesa 22 changed smth 😄 sry didnt know
14:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eeetadam> ok
14:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its just a string reported by the driver, not the chosen backend
14:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
14:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ogl 1.x
14:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/955457366441222214/screenshot_2022-03-21_14-25-10.png
14:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 3.0
14:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/955457379389022259/screenshot_2022-03-21_14-25-31.png
14:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 3.3
14:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/955457402134736976/screenshot_2022-03-21_14-25-48.png
14:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> vulkan (not implemented by AMD, so maybe interesting)
14:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/955457454089588826/screenshot_2022-03-21_14-26-07.png
14:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> except 1.x i dont really see a difference
14:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Cøke
14:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> are they meant to look any different? or being the same the best route?
14:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Being same is good
14:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> ?
14:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> what should i look at
15:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> hllo I didn't use the leak command on f1 but my client seem to use the old way (I don't see EUR, etc.. but ping), any idea?
15:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> After you connect once to a server the ping will be cached, maybe that's what you are seeing
15:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Learath2 I didn't connect to all servers from the list
15:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> and why is this now bugged?
15:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cøke> used now 1024x1024
15:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wait i come
15:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> @deen i think we need to select which switch statement we want to assert and which are inoffensive
15:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, probably
15:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> that's the difficult choice 😄
15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> can't you set a grep to look for all the dbg_msg to see if they are often triggerred?
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <The World> how do i reset mouse sensor value back to normal
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <The World> i used bind x "+toggle inp_mousesens 1 100000000"
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> in practice no one does that, but when server crashes it gets noticed
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> inp_mousesens 200
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and with just a dbg_msg it can be difficult to debug, a coredump helps more
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> ♥️
15:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> :heartw: :heartw:
15:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> finally xd
15:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> now i can rebase all my stuff xD
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @deen for the changelog you can also add that the video renderer got an upgrade, wanna see if it runs correctly for everyone
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then they might purposly test it
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oooh we have a VK backend now
15:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Cellegen | HU do you own the generic unhookable as SVG? and if, are they accurate?
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :justatest:
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> i can make it today if you want
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> poggers
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vulkan by jupstar
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED: 🍷
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to celebrate
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES_Wine:678210604464603146>
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and also time to find broken drivers
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt it build artifacts
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the checks
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont to compile on windows
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wanna compare
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> found it
16:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/suites/5738919643/artifacts/190259741
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont want to compile on windows
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it normal i defaults to opengl 3?
16:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2200 fps on a full mult server
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/955485716207534120/unknown.png
16:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its poggers
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks does it give more fps to increase the render thread count
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> more consistent frames probs
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mine is at 3
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess u set it at half of real cores
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> thinking about making accurate gameskin svg
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> thinking about making accurate gameskin svg today
16:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> ah yes, finally somebody helps 😛
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no i set it to 3 always
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 3 gives really good results already
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> on ARM theoretically it can improve efficiency to use more cores
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> since its not more work
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a intel core 2 duo
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just same work on all cores
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with 3 render threads
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
16:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> XD
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Not Keks I'm installing https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang manually since glslang tools are not available on Debian 9
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Version differences shouldn't matter, right? I just took the latest
17:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
17:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> should be fine
17:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> vulkan_core.h does not exist in Debian 9's libvulkan-dev
17:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> does it compile without?
17:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, well that was easy 😄
17:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ah no
17:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> just failed a bit later

17:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> a define
17:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> let me add that check
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ddnet 16 changelog really has alot of various contributors doesnt it?
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> lol, and some people mocked me for using gcc 7 😄
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes
17:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its actually more sad that this is legit c++17 code
17:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, I guess GCC 6.3.0 doesn't support C++17 as well as expected
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> anyway
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 2023 debian 9 dies
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then we upgrade xdd
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mark these words
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> 😄
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> noted

18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> is it possible to see the changelog already?
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not as a log, but as commits
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> ah ok

18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice i already enjoy the 1 trillion crash logs we'll get now xd
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Better than crash reports without crash logs
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 😉
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> "It crashed, I did nothing special" is pretty annoying to debug
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> true
18:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets hope drmingw works good enough. I only tested it a bit yet with a friend^^
18:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> WIP accurate gameskin SVG
18:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> building from the ground up to make it as grounded and close as possible

18:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> woah vulkan backend :D
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cool, @mind ^ 😄
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> @Not Keks i can use it on wayland without any tweak right?
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> should just work ™️ i had crashes tho
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but not in the driver
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in the window manager xD
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> lol
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well kde wayland is not really finished
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so i guess thats fair
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wayland bloat X ez
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u rly use wayland
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with locked vsync
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah thats the K.O. argument still xd
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mind> @Voxel  you only need to do the hammer, I already have all the other stuff 😄 (I even have a hammer, but I used the old 0.6 game.png for it)
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> @Ryozuki yeah i don't feel any lag
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i do
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> vsync war
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> @Ryozuki i use sway with freesync i dunno does it makes difference
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> Oh alright! Thanks for telling
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 join the war
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @mind team up xd
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> What are we fighting about?
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vsync
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah nothing special. the old ppl like vsync xd
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or dont notice xd
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't want to, because Jupstar is too mean
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> old ppl aka 27y old +
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the old "ppl like vsync"
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> Would it be possible to add a option to sort the scoreboard by ID? It would help identifying people right next to eachother more easily
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/955525074499293184/unknown.png
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> died to the bird ahead
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks make a algorithm that adds arrows to names in a smart way and names are separated
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2222 ddnet
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hud
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> or maybe just that the tee you hover over has its nameplate on top
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah a cursor mode would be nice
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for scoreboard and spectating

18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> amd is such a huge contributor in linux kernel xd
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nvidia should take notes
18:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> amdgpu is like 2-3mios isnt it
18:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
18:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > - Most significant on the AMD side is the new AMD P-State driver for Zen 2 and newer systems with ACPI CPPC support exposed by the platform. AMD P-State is aimed to provide greater desktop/mobile power efficiency than the ACPI CPUFreq driver. I'll have out some fresh benchmarks soon.
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for me my motherboard is still the most unefficient thing xD
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cpu and gpu are ok
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u own a M1 mac turn to freedom with https://asahilinux.org/
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stallman will smile at you

19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah i hope they have a working vulkan driver soon xddd
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> finally gotta see what M1 can do
19:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ngl best feature of ddnet 16 is select search string on CTRL+F XD
19:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i use it so often
19:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> is that for the server browser search?
19:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> is the New Vulkan graphics renderer in nightly ?
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> i dont have it yet
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> no
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> only in rc1, will be in nightly in 6 hours 😉
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> alright thanks! i really want try it out
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> since we build nightly at fixed times, but release candidates when we prepare for a new release
19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> so its in the release canditates now? ok ill try it out
19:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> ok i have like 10% more fps and they are waaaaay more stable! i like that!
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah the 2nd point is where vulkan shines
19:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> much better frame times
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> more fps in CPU bound scenarios mostly
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so opening scoreboard or many tees visible
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> another mate has from 2.5k fps to 4-5k
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 😮
19:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> LETS GO
19:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Paralix> i have a problem with the client, after some time i get fps lags, but if i switch resolution it fixes itselfi have a problem with the client, after some time i get fps lags, but if i switch resolution it fixes itself

19:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks
19:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeeah not really a bug
19:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> you are free to set the driver version
19:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> since DDNET_DRIVER is set manually
19:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> you can also do gfx_backend Ryo-OS
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> is it called vulkan because your computer will melt afterwards?
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if you are german yes
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or is vulkan also french?
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks vulkan logo is made by AMD and DICE
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice xd
19:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> vulkan is generally made by AMD
19:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mental api
19:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mantle
19:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Paralix> but is it normal that I have sti lag with the good pc?
19:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(API)
19:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> well vulkan sounds and looks like volcan in french
19:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez
19:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> and vulcanology is volcano science
19:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in german its literally vulkan xd
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> literally cast from the hell forge 😄
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> can happen thorugh:
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> overheating
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bad PSU
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> broken hardware(not correctly attached)
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> update drivers
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and i read disable discord on windows
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> few ppl swear on it
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Paralix> now i try the beta client
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah maybe vulkan can fix it
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> opengl support is really dated
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> do i need to install a lib to compile new version?
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> git submodule update
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i just made a fresh clone
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> with recurse-submodules
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what does it complain about
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> COMMAND;GLSLANG_VALIDATOR_PROGRAM-NOTFOUND;
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i see the bug
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do 
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> git revert ed9f285071ac0296ac5545c5769b70fe46908238
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and tell me if it works
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> that's my hash 😦
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> nope
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> doesnt work
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok weird
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> what OS are you on @Chairn ?
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> On Linux, yes, dependencies required
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> they are in README.md
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think chairn is on old debian
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> he is on windows
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> at least last time we talked xd
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> no, im on ubuntu18.04 right no
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :weird:
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ubuntu 20 needed
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> 😦
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or install glslangvalidator manually
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ubuntu 18 dies in april
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no need to support xd
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok 2023
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but still xd
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why old stable on desktop pc
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> this one?
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang/releases/tag/11.7.0
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> yup 5years LTS
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes i think so
19:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, I also built that @Chairn
19:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> for the official build vms
20:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> ah it seems to work
20:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> building ddnet now
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> well run_tests still fail
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we used ubuntu 18 ci until 2h ago
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what does fail?
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> src/test/scores.cpp
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4853
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> just tried with the fresh clone and same results 😦
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just update to ubuntu 20 xD
20:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> update on the hammer: so far the fault% is very subtle, but still noticeable when comparing in game
20:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/955545378156056586/unknown.png
20:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> ~~this is extremely difficult LOL~~
20:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> that doesn't look too accurate :justatest:
20:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> timakro are you there?
20:33 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1647891174.png
20:33 <+ChillerDragon> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
20:34 <+ChillerDragon> someone forgot to gitignore dat bitsh
20:35 <+ChillerDragon> @jupjapjatsur
20:35 <+ChillerDragon> SOS
20:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Astramast> #questions come 2s
21:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> :o the vulkan renderer is fast 5000 fps -> 8500fps
21:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wtf 8500 is good, are you on windows or linux?
21:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> windows
21:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> I have a 3070 and 5600x
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok nice
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> it's a bit overkill for teeworlds xD
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> true, but nice fps xd
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> 0.075ms less input delay
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez xd
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> chillerdragon how fast are u
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what bot do you have xD
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> one that write poggers on linked issues xDDD
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> i wish there was an easier way to compare the base and the svg with inkscape ...
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> i know exactly what type of thing id want but its too much to ask for tbh
21:41 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar i always got github open on 2nd monitor and mostly there is my last issue/pr the power of ajax gives me instant feedback even while playing tw xd
21:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> The big jupstar update:poggers:
21:42 <+ChillerDragon> pogstar
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ta!zenyuki> DDNet (Teeworlds) runnin with Lua script right?
21:44 <+ChillerDragon> ?
21:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xD now comes the programming language war
21:44 <+ChillerDragon> fak irc got no reply support 
21:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Ryozuki @Learath2 come
21:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ta!zenyuki> :D
21:44 <+ChillerDragon> bash > lua
21:44 <+ChillerDragon> change my mind
21:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rust > lua
21:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> change ryos mind
21:44 <+ChillerDragon> bash > rust
21:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lua is like a bad dream
21:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> factorio uses lua for modding
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why i never modded factorio
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sad life
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xD
21:45 <+ChillerDragon> bam uses lua so lua is great
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xdd
21:45 <+ChillerDragon> #makeddnetbamagain
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> chillerdragon still bam support
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> til the end
21:45 <+ChillerDragon> yes
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ta!zenyuki> i just was wandering
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ta!zenyuki> :greenthing:
21:45 <+ChillerDragon> i wish we had 3 build systems
21:45 <+ChillerDragon> bam, autoconf and cmake
21:46 <+ChillerDragon> autoconf is nice because it uses shell
21:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> auto make
21:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bro
21:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> plsss
21:46 <+ChillerDragon> shell is always good
21:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i only say that if we used rust we wouldnt see deen creating issues with segfaults
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
21:47 <+ChillerDragon> lol
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but with panics xd
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> way easier to debug
21:47 <+ChillerDragon> its not a c++ issue
21:47 <+ChillerDragon> its a deen issue
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xD
21:47 <+ChillerDragon> if he wouldnt create them all would be good
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its cuz its only deen who makes issues with segfaults
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz he has the servers
21:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> well, i get lower fps on vulkan strange :d
21:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wayland :monkalaugh:
21:48 <+ChillerDragon> how to test da vulkan that gave me so many headache during merge ?
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> what is wayland relevant ? :D
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz it locks ur vsync
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> You guys know why i get
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> ```
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:614 (message):
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Vy0x2>  You must install Vulkan libraries to compile the DDNet client
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> ```
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> even tho i installed it and the env flag is set?
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i get pretty much same fps between x and wayland for vk
21:49 <+ChillerDragon> i use X11 BTW
21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nori u had AMDGPU right?
21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> radeonsi is simply better in GPU bound
21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly?
21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use amdgpu too
21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> no i mean it's lower then my display speed
21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> yeah i use amdgpu
21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=radv-radeonsi-13&num=2
21:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bit dated
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but probs never caught up
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i feel thats a lie
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so to sum up depends on the task
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2017 is old
21:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but open scoreboard on 64p server with vulkan and OGL
21:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then u see how vulkan crushes OGL
21:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> i just zoomout to test it
21:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> i had 300 fps on opengl and 30 fps on vulkan
21:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> zoom out is gpu bound, but thats really bad fps
21:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i have almost identical
21:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dunno, try to update driver i guess xd
21:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> it's rolling release distro so latest :D
21:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then downgrade xD
21:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or try x xD
21:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> nah i am very happy with wayland
21:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> no compositor configuration or no tearing
21:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> happy
21:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok lets not start this again xD
21:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao vsync
21:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just file a bug report
21:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> on amd's freedesktop gitlab
21:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> it doesn't matter vsync or not if you don't feel lag
21:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES_Old:

21:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nori> btw i also bought amdgpu to use wayland so i am never gonna back to xorg xD
21:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah idc tbh xD
21:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u cant buy amdgpu
21:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a free driver
21:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i have amdgpu and good fps xdd
21:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> troll
21:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the wayland devs not allowing to disable vsync is just being jerks
21:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know automake is called autohell for a reason right? 😄
21:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they just trolls xd
22:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's "I know better than the user syndrome", I bet wayland is a freedesktop.org project
22:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> "It won't break the principle of "every frame is perfect" for anything but games; any sane non-game application will never even consider an immediate presentation mode and most compositors will ignore the request for any non-fullscreen windows. "
22:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
22:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> This is simply a k.o. argument
22:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not like my compositor doesnt also do vsync, it just gets disabled on games
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know another freedesktop.org project that knows better than all users
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> go ahead
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i love these flame wars xd
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its initrc
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> s*stemd
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> right
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xDD
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gentoo is bloat cuz u have to download sources
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so it bloats
22:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll:
22:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> jokes on you, you can actually not keep sources with a simple portage patch
22:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its actually a bit bloat because with the 3rd stage u get manuals in shitload of languages u dont know
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> half the unzip time is manual lang files
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> :troll:
22:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :troll1:
22:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> heyo, is this a new update with 16.0 where if you spectate someone, you can still see yourself on scoreboard, you dont go into Spectators section
22:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> intentional or bug?
22:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> probably something to do with [Server] Fix specteam 1 not showing teammates while spectating/freecam in solo [sjrc6]
22:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> for me it still puts me in the spectators
22:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i think that's a good change anyways tho
22:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> in rc1
22:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> rc1?
22:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> release candidates, #announcements
22:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> yeah
22:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> I'm using that

22:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> oh
22:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> you're right huh
22:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> if I build the client myself I don't get this issue, only from the steam version
22:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lol true
22:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> weird stuff
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> Hi, do you know, is it possible to create by default disabled laser doors, disabled laser hooks, etc. on switch layer? I know that it is possible to set a turn off tile on way earlier on the map, but this is not suitable in my case. 
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> If this is not possible, maybe someone knows how incompatible it would be to add a switch button (default on/of) (same way as number and delay field placed) for this behavior to the editor? Or maybe add one more door tile that disabled by default. Does it make sense to create an issue?
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <T tee> yes
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <T tee> there's a command for that
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <T tee> wait 1min
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <T tee> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/955577213040877568/unknown.png
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <T tee> look the last line
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <T tee> switch_open [number of the switch]
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Faulty> aha, so it's configurable for whole map
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <T tee> yea
