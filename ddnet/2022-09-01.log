00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there anyone using firefox that can check if twitter videos volume control works for them?
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Send one vid as example
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://twitter.com/firefox/status/1433533531859337217
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes works
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can you change the level of the volume?
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what version of firefox are you on and what OS?
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> +
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014661060613120120/unknown.png
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> windows 10
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I'm on 105 maybe that's what's broken
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nope I can't even on 104.0.1 :/
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> works for me on 140.0 and 104.0.1
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> works for me on 104.0 and 104.0.1
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> any plugin that might be the problem?
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tried with a completely clean profile
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> decrease your os sound
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tried all the way back to ff65, so it's something about this specific computer, bizarre issue :/
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Impossible to debug with the way they obfuscate their shitty website too
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can open it with the devtools if you set the attributes to of the control slider to `css-1dbjc4n r-13w96dm r-1867qdf r-1p0dtai r-11d23sj r-ws9h79 r-h8hv3c r-xyw6el r-1yzf0co r-u8s1d r-v2u3o6` by hand
06:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @fokkonaut
06:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014755354824937472/unknown.png
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Still editing pose, but this is so cute so far!
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> indeed, did u try how it looks both feet mirrored?
06:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea
06:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014759356593623163/unknown.png
06:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> mirroring things is super ez with how the animations are set up
06:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is it better or this?
06:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah u do it direction dependent
06:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats cool
06:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but i think u see too less of the back foot
07:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> alright
07:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> at least on the top images
07:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Yeah, I fixed that already.
07:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I do have another question: How do we detect if a player is holding down a the shoot key when AFK? I don't want the weapon to be concealed if they're firing it.
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Input.m_Fire&1
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Nice!
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Thanks!
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> np
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L391-L392
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You only have to check that for those weapons
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Other weapons can not be held
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, it would be easier tho to work with the reloadtimer
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that would make it also more mod compatible
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Every character that's being sent to the client has an m_Attacktick
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Yeah, I could have it where if LastAttackTime is over something it will by default switch to the concealed state
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Or that
08:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> m_AttackTick's value is the current Tick when a weapon got fired
08:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it's used to display the shooting animation for example
08:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it's definitely used in client/components/players.cpp
08:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Yeah, they're shortened down to AttackTime and LastAttackTime in the code
08:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Yeah, they're shortened down to AttackTime and LastAttackTime in players.cpp
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea but i think taking attack tick is the best way to go tbh
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> better than checking for weapon
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I'll try AttackTick
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> :giga_chad:
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> AttackTicksPassed in CPlayers::RenderPlayer
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> That's also being used for the recoil animation aswell as hammer/ninja hit animation
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I know that, they're both using these floats in the code.
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014783922011377724/unknown.png
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yup
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I think we're secretly on the same page but think we're talking about something different LOL
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I think you will be able to fumble somethign together using that haha
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You might wanna check the fire delay tunings aswell, so that you dont put the weapon on the back when the tee is holding while afk & the attacktick > currentTick - firedelay
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> @Learath2 there is no lerp on calculation, only at rendering the hook, but what I noticed is, holy fuck it has over 200 lines of code for only the hook
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest: 💦
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> how bad can it be to code a proper character
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <* Mahdiyar ≿ ᴮᴱᴿᴹᵁᴰᴬ> @gerdoe To a lower version?
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> so it has:
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> handling variable to be on right states, when certain values have reached
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> hook calculation
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> and most silly of all: conditions for all fucking states individually
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> the last part is what takes over 100+ lines of code
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> and holy shit, I have to go through all 200 lines of code, just to know how the fuck hook works
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> welcome to gamecore
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> you make this sound easy ;_;
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i know this is a stupid complaint but do i have to use a pointer to get these to work? Like `CCharacter *pName`? Or something else?
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014792753739206726/unknown.png
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> depends what u're doing
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No, you work on the Client (dont touch prediction folder)
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I can help you later today, I'm at work :D
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Voxel you can access tunings from CPlayers using `m_pClient->m_aTuning`
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Oh, okay
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> m_pClient->m_aTuning[g_Config.m_ClDummy]
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am thinking about what the best way would be though
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Voxel the easiest would be to simply check for ActiveWeapon == GRENADE or RIFLE or SHOTGUN
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and m_Fire&1
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> go with that for now
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```c++
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if(Afk && (Input.m_Fire&1) != 0 && (ActiveWeapon == WEAPON_GRENADE || ActiveWeapon == WEAPON_SHOTGUN || ActiveWeapon == WEAPON_LASER)
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>    DontPutWeaponOnBack();
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I'm thinking of a way too
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I just have it as this for now:
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ```bool IsActive = !m_pClient->m_aClients[ClientID].m_Afk || LastAttackTime < 1.0f;```
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The client does not even know about the Input of others, so yea
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> did you try whether that works? print some dbg_msgs
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Well visually, it works.
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014799704342671400/unknown.png
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> show how the weapon on back looks like
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it's cool that the tee is still sitting :D
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Let me find a tee with a weapon and everything
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Should probably find afk tees on my srv
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> haha
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014800105452359750/unknown.png
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> maybe its a bit far out?
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe, yea
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it might be funny to render the hands to show the tee is actually not holding the weapon xdxd
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> louis suggested that, but i don't think the renderer will let the hands be in front
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> depends :D
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> everything is possible
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but anyways, more important that the back weapon is correct
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Much better.
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014800890508619796/unknown.png
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014800890827382895/unknown.png
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yep
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think u should try it on default skin
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> turn on vanilla skins only
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i cloned this when that still crashes the client LOL
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oof
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> if only there was a way you could force yourself in an afk state
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> join my server, go `/1vs1`, then do `/1vs1 <anyname>`
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then ur in afk
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ohhh
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Voxel use kill to stop creating arena
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> none of my weapons get sent during it and i only get to see me for one frame
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mh, maybe cuz ur in spectator?
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wym for one frame?
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014802763701571584/unknown.png
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> it immediately switches to the arena creation thing
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh yeah, u dont have weapons in that area i forgot
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea, but u do see urself
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> no the arena creation is somewhere different i think
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u dont need to do it xD
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its just to get the afk state
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for testing hd
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for testing xd
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> crap i forgot to give the hammer a special pose too
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014803543246508052/unknown.png
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> one second
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> why not centre it to the hand of the tee? would it make sense?
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> why not centre it towards the hand of the tee? would it make sense?
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> well to be honest i think it gives off a better indicator the tee is sleeping when the weapon is on its back.
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> maybe just the way the tee looks is weird
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I'll make some presentations on how would I approach it
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014804571161378876/unknown.png
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i barely needed to do anything and this is perfect
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> You could turn the weapon aiming down instead of up@Voxel
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i feel like the transition between beign afk and waking up would be weird then, because when its facing up, the gun kind of still retains its sense of direction
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> to be honest i think there's more of a chance for the AFK pose to be added in than the running state, so i might revoke the running and back it up on a notepad
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Okay i get what you mean about the transition. Good point
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I think I'll go to sleep and continue this tommorow.
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> noo
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I didn't do it yet; but I will have half a day to think about it. I'll give out my final conclusion then.
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> @Voxel
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014809259420176414/unknown.png
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I don't think a Tee lying on the ground would look good
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> with no hand rigging to support it
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I like the particle idea, though if I were to add it in, I would need to study the code a lot before inputting it in. Also a slot in the extras image would be used.
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Lowering the weapon is also not bad i guess
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> imo lying it would make it better
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I could try these different states when I get back.
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Not sure about space efficiency however.
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Not sure about space efficiency however. (In terms of viewability)
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> don't stress on that, it won't ruin performance and if the game's growing like that, you expect it to take more space.
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I meant something different, but after the Icons.otf edit I'm less worried about filespace
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I meant more as, your viewspace in game. If there's a bunch of tees AFK next yo each other it would be hard to tell what weapon they're holding
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> highlighting the tee with body-shadow
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> But that would look weird, depending on skin
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> that would be even more messy imo
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Well, you gotta work through conditions like these too, even if it wouldn't look good on a t0 perspective, it just means that t0 has flaws
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> and not your design choises tbh
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> on Solo maps doesn't matter really, on dummy maps too, but on novice and above might
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> is it possible to have a 'render all' button in demos section? can someone competent implement that?
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014813320466927637/unknown.png
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> "the feature doesnt suck, the server does for making the feature look bad!"
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> imagine sitting through like 5 hours of rendering all ur demos LOL
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> the feature doesn't suck, rather the choises for map design which lead for more open areas as a feature
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :kek:
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> aka stronghold
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> exactly :justatest:
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> why
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Why would anyone want to render all demos
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that is not really possible
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Create a python script that does that
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> By looking at the screen
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> really? what is the problem?
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> well all the replays, to not render them one by one
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You cant really render it all at once
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> *why?*
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> i don't need to render them all in once, just one by one, everything thats in the current folder
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> i don't need to render them all at once, just one by one, everything thats in the current folder
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> ```
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> For demo in demos {
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl>     demo.render()
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> }
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> ```
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Lol
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> That would be possible, yeah
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but there should definitely be a cancel button or something, imagine doing that on auto demo folder
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Omg
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Ssd rip
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> ye, cancel would be nice, but you can also alt+f4
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Btw is there a way to change bitrate?
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <* Mahdiyar ≿ ᴮᴱᴿᴹᵁᴰᴬ> hi how compile source fng in mingw ?

12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Maybe open an issue on github
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> can you teach me how?
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Sure, do you have an account?
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lumpy ◐ω◑ (ru)> ye, I think so

16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/795002618056671292/951022215716044830/73851526-BDE3-4FF3-8F7C-58C66B911D63.gif

16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Coding in java just makes me appreciate rust non-existant nulls

19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> will this change physics tho
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Yo, can we have an option to have only the team leader lock the team?
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> like, within 3 days, cuz the event on #off-topic will be a goner, if many people troll with locking teams
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> disable kill & leave
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if they join the team the have to finish
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> SAO
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> even at the start?
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> where kill protection is not active
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> once its a one time team
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> @Not Keks this event won't go well if kill protection won't be active at the startline
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> people will just kill randomly and if they are clever, kill in a different time
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but they would not be able to kill xd
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> would kill protection be on if the team reaches a certain limit?
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I need 100% conformation, cuz it's a once in a life event, sort of
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its not a once in a lifetime event lmao
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do you host the server?
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I need 100% confirmation, cuz it's a once in a life event, sort of
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just votekick trolls
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> the last event like this was at least 5+ years ago
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> it feels like eternity
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> (by fikmesan)
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if avg lifespan were 80 itd be a 16 in a lifetime event then
