00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Just don't DoS the server :trollet:
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> if only it were that easy
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> ðŸ˜¬
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> just curious, how strong does server need to be to run a DDNet server? I mean like how strong are "offical" ones ðŸ¤”
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> memorywise u need very little
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> To run?
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> I feel problematic
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> A potato is sufficient
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> So for example.. 2GB + idk 1core would  "works" for 64 people?
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yes
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> more than enough
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Depends on the one Core but yes even bad cores work
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> And why i have 1000-2500 fps and i often feel lagy ðŸ˜”
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Itâ€™s because your eyes are fast
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Hehe
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> the quality of the network connection can have a big impact
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> True... Maybe i need to buy 165Hz..
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Not on frame rate tho
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> well yea it wont affect the frame rate the game renders at
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> I have a duper 1000 net, but it still lags 90% of time on kog
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> If it is not consistent it shouldnâ€™t be your monitor speed
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> kog is not too stable
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> True
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Also i had a few month/week break
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> And answer me
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Why this game is now not only german, not only even eu, but its just china game?
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Btw your bat is amazong
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> ironic that they have unstable servers specifically dedicated to hosting some of the most inherently faily maps there are
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Ya but lags have much bigger impact on kog than normal ddrace
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> And why is chiller a bot ðŸ˜­
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> they're on IRC
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> the bot is a chat bridge bot that transfers messages between the discord and IRC channels
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Matrix nowerdays
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> ah
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Oh, is this legal from Discord PoV? Don't they tend to ban you? Do you need to register an extra Discord account for that?
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I've read that unofficial clients are not legal; I won't find the message right now but despite of various "we love open source" messages here and there on Discord, they still close the protocol and deny reverse engineering.
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Oh, is this legal from Discord PoV? Don't they tend to ban you? Do you need to register an extra Discord account for that?
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I've read that unofficial clients are not legal; I won't find the message right now but despite of various "we love open source" messages here and there on Discord, they still close the protocol and deny reverse engineering.
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Ok, probably you're using this one: `https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord#setting-up-discord`
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> webhooks are allowed
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> and hes not using an unofficial discord client
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> You canâ€˜t ban me from discord if I donâ€™t have discord \:p but ye Iâ€™m banned from discord \:D
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Discord tos sok
02:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> u
02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> souly confirmed bot
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> What did you do? You tried linking your Discord account with Matrix?
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> No linking. I just use Matrix and the bridge
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> What did you do to discord
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> I know, but why did u get banned?
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> Why can't i play ddnet from school pc
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> It says no servers found
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> try turning off your schools firewall
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://bgr.com/tech/internet-is-scrambling-to-fix-log4shell-the-worst-hack-in-history/
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> :monkaS:
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> Ye, they probably are blocking non-standard ports
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> I could play in September but i cant play recently
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> Can you open https://master1.ddnet.tw/ in the web browser (to check if ddnet itself is blocked) or try to connect to a ddnet server by putting `ger1.ddnet.tw` into the server address and click connect (to check if only the server list doesn't work, but gameplay traffic gets through)?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <playboi carti> @motzix
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> they probably block UDP connections
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> :lol: classic
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Most people who know teeworlds played in in school at some point
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Most people who know teeworlds played it in school at some point
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> I'll check next time i get a chance
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Itâ€™s discord â€¦ so they donâ€™t tell \:D

20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ALittleHappy use space instead of dots!
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD> I read mine wrong the first time because of that lol
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> replies are now working through the matrix bridge :hey:
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> So you didn't violate ToS?
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I did
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> Well how did u violate ToS?
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I used a custom client at some point
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> Oh I see
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> But that was way before the ban
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> [Edit](https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/920044065591009300): Well how did you violate ToS?
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> Huh
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> weird
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I assume they didnâ€™t like me switching to browser version + tor
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> Lmao
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> Maybe that's the reason
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> But I can only guess
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> Yeah welp
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> The edit on Discord is weird
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> It creates another message

21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> It's not possible to edit other peoples message, so theres no way around that problem
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> Ah I see
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ah no, thats wrong
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> Yeah, cause I've seen other bridges working just fine with edits
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I kinda got confused there cuz you're in both irc and discord, lol
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> Yeah lol
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <unexploredtest> And this is actually from Matrix
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/920046906300858459/unknown.png
