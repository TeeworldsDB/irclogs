01:33 <@deen> haha
01:33 <@deen> and you can't kick them
02:46 < eeeee> hmm
02:46 < eeeee> sounds srs, will take a look now
03:33 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] eeeee opened pull request #205: hacky bans fix (DDRace64...bans_fix) http://git.io/vUhAn
03:34 < eeeee> ^ at least shouldn't break anything and seems to work
03:34 < eeeee> doing it properly would take a while
03:35 < eeeee> deen: ^
03:37 <@deen> hanks
03:38 <@deen> thanks*
03:38 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #205: hacky bans fix (DDRace64...bans_fix) http://git.io/vUhAn
03:39 < eeeee> okay sorry it doesnt work
03:40 < eeeee> i only tested vanilla
03:41 <@deen> hm, doesn't even compile
03:42 < eeeee> yeah have to add "const"
03:42 < eeeee> not sure why vanilla compiled
03:48 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] eeeee opened pull request #206: fix the fix (DDRace64...bans_fix) http://git.io/vUhpM
03:49 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/vUhph
03:49 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 6e3a14c eeeee: fix the fix
03:49 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 92c9d72 Dennis Felsing: Merge pull request #206 from eeeee/bans_fix...
03:55 < eeeee> well, but at least someone found the web client useful ;D
04:05 <@deen> haha, yes
04:05 <@deen> i give a ban for a day, and suddenly I see "javascript tee" all day. at the end I figured out why :P

19:10 < laxadedi> Anyone here ?
19:10 < laxadedi> I am trying to figure out that :
19:11 < laxadedi> Uint8 *wav_buffer;
19:11 < laxadedi> function(&wav_buffer);
19:11 < laxadedi> function is asking for **Uint8 ptr
19:12 < laxadedi> I know what is ** TYPE
19:12 < laxadedi> but I dunno what is that &(*(type))
19:16 < Learath2> its obv type
19:16 < laxadedi> obv type ?
19:16 < Learath2> obviously
19:18 < Learath2> you first dereferance it then reference it so you get the same thing 
19:18 < Learath2> unless i completely misunderstood your question :D
19:21 < Learath2> laxadedi: it feels like that function is expecting a buffer like arrays of arrays of uint8 not a pointer to a pointer to a uint8
19:21 < Learath2> or more likely a pointer to an array of uint8s
19:22 < laxadedi> hummm
19:22 < laxadedi> https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_LoadWAV?highlight=%28%5CbCategoryAPI%5Cb%29%7C%28SDLFunctionTemplate%29
19:23 < Learath2> laxadedi: well it even gives an example
19:23 < laxadedi> yes
19:23 < laxadedi> I read it
19:23 < Learath2> so your question is ?
19:23 < laxadedi> hence my question
19:23 < laxadedi> they give &(*(Uint8)) to the function
19:24 < laxadedi> instead of declaring a **Uint8
19:24 < laxadedi> Well, I'll do some tests
19:24 < Learath2> its the same thing actually 
19:24 < Learath2> pointer to a pointer to uint8
19:25 < Learath2> its so the library can modify the actual pointer
19:26 < Learath2> you should check how arguments are passed in C 
19:27 < laxadedi> ok, I get it now ^^
19:27 < laxadedi> you give the ref to ptr
19:27 < laxadedi> Thanks :)
