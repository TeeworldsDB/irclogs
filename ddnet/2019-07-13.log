00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> Cant you guys check if the mal differs from downloaded maps and then rename the map that is being downloaded
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> Map*
01:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut did you figure out why the file was not found?
01:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No
01:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Probably the download failed a bit
01:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And then it got stuck
01:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and failed to Download again because broken file is there
01:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> connection was to ZAF, so maybe some packages got lost or idk
01:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> but you download from ddnet.tw or no
02:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> idk
02:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> was fng server from ddnet zaf
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> can't get the stupid json_builder to link for the life of me
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm done trying, I'll replace the json library with something more approachable
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> might try https://github.com/nlohmann/json
19:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> why do you want to use json? py is good
19:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ?
19:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> he wants to do stuff with json in c++
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> i though he is working on masterserver
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> ye there's json stuff
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> hm im wondering why nobody used the old methods, because more then 1 person published resolution for the attacks but nobody accepted them and they are all on github
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> what do you mean about big  change
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> from 0.6 to 0.7
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> ???
19:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> no
19:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> = more players from tw 0.7
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> @Learath2 what's the problem with json-builder? Easiest way of getting it to work is probably just placing the files in the json-parser folder
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> Then you just have to add the two files to 'DEP_JSON_SRC' in CMakeList.txt

20:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I couldnt get it to link properly, it pissed me off
21:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't sound like a problem caused by json-builder
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> feel free to link it and give me a commit, or it's getting replaced by a library that doesn't give me a hard time
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> Is https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=6593 still wanted? I could work on it
21:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon u disapointed me
