01:02 <@deen> Learath2: but it's special in the sense that it's different for each platform
01:02 <@deen> we have a few more binaries, should update them in the same way too
03:37 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
03:38 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
03:43 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
03:44 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
12:35 < Learath2> the http download is way too fast to calculate the speed :D
12:35 <@EastByte> yay
12:36 < Learath2> Its all done i just need to find a proper way to signal that the download is done to the client so it can SendReady()
12:39 <@EastByte> sounds good
13:10 < Learath2> EastByte: actually finished it and its slower then tw map download for some reason
13:11 < Learath2> atleast for a small map like xyz_ddrace2
13:11 <@EastByte> tcp's fault?
13:11 < Learath2> I think its me getting the header twice
13:12 < Learath2> i first check for a 404
13:22 < Learath2> EastByte: definately faster on bigger maps 
13:22 <@EastByte> good
13:22 < Learath2> the double check affects standart download too so on small maps the old client is always faster
13:22 < Learath2> need to fix that somehow
13:24 <@EastByte> well on really small maps we could simply fallback to map transfer via gameserver
13:24 < Learath2> yeah i dont think there is a way to fix it so ill leave it as is
13:37 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #125: Add HTTP download for maps (DDRace64...dd_webdl) http://git.io/o9pAcA
13:38 < Learath2> not quite as polished as i'd like 
13:38 < Learath2> but should do
13:39 <@deen> Nice!
13:40 <@deen> So, does it fall back to regular download if our http download server goes down?
13:40 < Learath2> yeah that 1 sec delay is caused by the fallback checking if it can do the http download
13:40 < Learath2> else it goes back to standart download
13:41 < Learath2> again not tested on linux but i dont see why it should fail to work on there
13:42 <@deen> Thanks for all the work, Learath2 
13:42 <@EastByte> hmm one second sounds quite a lot
13:42 <@deen> I'll take a look at it later
13:42 < Learath2> not sure if its one second there is just some kind of delay there
13:43 <@EastByte> establishing a tcp connection can take much longer
13:43 <@EastByte> let's do some heavy testing this evening :)
13:44 < Learath2> dont think it could be fixed tho
13:44 <@EastByte> well the server could send chunks simultaneously
13:45 <@EastByte> and stop when the http download works
13:45 < Learath2> that would waste the bandwidth if we are downloading over http anyways
13:47 <@EastByte> I'm more counting the stability and speed
13:47 <@EastByte> nvm we
13:47 <@EastByte> 'll see how this goes
13:47 < Learath2> also deen you might not want to merge anything i made until i find a way to fix the indentation and whitespace issue
13:48 < Learath2> b/c my editor decided that it doesnt like tabs but would rather use spaces
14:01 < Learath2> EastByte: any idea how i can fix all those spaces to tabs ?
14:22 < WolfAlex> Learath2, in most editors you can change that in the config
14:53 < Nimda> DDNet USA went down!
14:54 < Nimda> DDNet USA went back online!
15:05 < Learath2> WolfAlex: indeed found it
15:19 < Learath2> deen: anything else that needs to get done ? I quite like doing these for practice
15:22 <@deen> Learath2: there were some issues on github
16:40 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
16:41 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
19:05 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
19:05 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 572
19:05 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 711 users online at 2014-12-21 20:13:02
19:07 < Learath2> i love how just DDNet gets as many players as the whole teeworlds had in 0.5
19:07 <@deen> 50% of the current players online
19:09 < Learath2> deen: will you go over the http stuff tonight ?
19:10 <@deen> i don't know =/
19:13 <@deen> not sure if i want to see code
19:13 <@deen> I've been looking at code 18 or the last 24 hours
19:13 <@deen> of*
19:13 < Learath2> ouch
19:13 <@EastByte> that's not enough!!
19:13 <@deen> and now the machine I was working on crashed
19:13 < Learath2> what do you do for a living if i may ask ?
19:13 <@deen> no more 32 core xeon with 256 GB RAM for me^^
19:14 <@deen> I'm working on a research paper as part of my master thesis^^
19:14 <@EastByte> no more?
19:14 <@deen> it has problems restarting
19:14 <@EastByte> :/
19:25 <@deen> oh, and for a living I hold practical programming paradigm courses at university
19:26 <@EastByte> I overheard that^^
19:26 <@EastByte> quite cool
19:26 <@deen> They're totally fun
19:27 <@deen> Don't need to prepare much and just talk about programming languages with students
19:27 <@deen> and program some easy stuff
19:27 <@EastByte> as an experienced programmer not hard I guess
19:27 <@deen> I'm not experienced in the languages we do^^
19:27 <@deen> only haskell
19:28 <@EastByte> ^^
19:28 <@EastByte> I'm going to make an introduction to python in my class the next hours
19:28 <@deen> but prolog, scala, x10, java bytecode?
19:28 <@EastByte> java bytecode :D
19:28 <@deen> yes, terrible
19:28 <@EastByte> I once wanted to be a java reverse engineer :3
19:28 <@deen> but we do some compiler stuff too, so we need some bytecode
19:29 < Learath2> I once tried to get a computer club going at my school the IT shut us down after seeing "suspicious" stuff on school computers
19:29 <@deen> oh, and 0 people did the exercises over christmas :P
19:30 < Learath2> "suspicious" stuff was apparently C++ source files
21:22 < o_be_one> hey happy new year !!
21:22 < o_be_one> deen, i'll move ddnet can to new can host in some month, i'll tell you, it could take 2 months to 1 year
21:23 < o_be_one> it could be*
21:23 < o_be_one> it could be in 2 month to 1 year
21:23 <@deen> ok
