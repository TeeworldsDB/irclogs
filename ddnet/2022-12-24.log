01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nothing> Hey is there any possible way to fix coil whine ?
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nothing> Hey is there any possible way to fix coil whine ? I think its coming from gpu
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Reduce or increase  fps. Sell gpu
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nothing> limited it to 1k i guess i should go lower
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> Is there a way to loop something on ddnet client?
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Yes, remove the coil
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> What exactly are you trying to loop
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I don't think you can loop anything automatically
03:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> easier to remove the GPU üòÑ
03:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no coil no power
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> Whining about coil whine won't help, you should man up and set the right example, then maybe it will stop
03:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nothing> ur right
06:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> I want to create a rainbow effect on my tee
06:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> Every second change the color
06:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> Does the console support functions?
06:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> There is a ratelimit for how often you can change colors of your tee on standard servers
06:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> That's sad
06:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> And you can't make it automatically change colors in the default client
06:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> So I'd have to make my own changes on the client
06:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> What you can do though is make it change colors when you move left/right, hook or fire
06:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> That's sad
06:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> But that only works with n colors
06:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> Being n the direction keys
06:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> And no, the console doesn't support functions but you can use .cfg files that can have console commands
06:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> How do they work ?
06:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> With cfg files you can add more
06:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> My client doesn't have cfg files
06:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> I mean it has one for Kog
06:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> No, you create them yourself, a .cfg file is a normal text file
06:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> Then I invoke it with the exec command?
06:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> Or is it automatically loaded
06:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Yes you have to invoke it somehow
06:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I guess binding the exec command to a key is a good way to do it
06:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> Is there any default command that has a delay by default
06:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> You cannot make delays between commands in the console
06:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> What about triggering color change on mouse movement
06:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> So if you try to change the colors of your tee twice in a short amount of time it will probably ignore one of the commands
06:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> You can only use binds for buttons and mouse movement would be an event and not a button
06:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bonobobo> This is extremely sad
06:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I think what you are trying to achieve would take time to set up correctly and the outcome wouldn't be satisfying
10:04 <+ChillerDragon> So sad to see such fundamental libraries being barley maintained :/ https://github.com/yaml/libyaml/pulls so many nice open prs being ignored for weeks/months
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Classic: https://xkcd.com/2347/
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> ye :D
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> merry christmas üôÇ
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ill spend it on a plane
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But merry christmas
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :giftee_green: :giftee_red:
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Merry Christmas! You too Chillerdragon if you're reading it!

13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <.sneaky> Who can compile my source code for ddnet please üëâüëà:cammo:
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> u
15:06 <+ChillerDragon> microsoft can
15:06 <+ChillerDragon> upload to github let the pipeline build the artefacts for you :)
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <.sneaky> Im have got errors in cmake(
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it would be easier if you share more information
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i also dont go to the doctor and tell him i have a problem without naming it exactly lmao
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <MilkeeyCat> he does :troll:
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <.sneaky> @Jupeyy_Keks can i compile ddnet without cmake?
16:00 <+ChillerDragon> no but you can compile ddnet++ without cmake
16:00 <+ChillerDragon> heheh
16:00 <+ChillerDragon> bam masterrace
16:00 <+ChillerDragon> @.sneaky do you want to compile vanilla ddnet or did you make changes to the code? if you made changes it is likley not a issue with ddnet but with your changes
16:01 <+ChillerDragon> but as or king jopstar said share your logs and error messages and the unpaid techsupport team of ddnet will create a ticket for you
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> a different build system also wont make it easier
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u probs forgot to initialize the submodules
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u have this pnglite error some ppl had
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <.sneaky> Btw what components i should be added in vs?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> extensions in vscode?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> else dunno what u mean

16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hi
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> From frankfurt
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Hallo
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dieKartoffel> Whattt
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dieKartoffel> Is this Frankfurt?
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dieKartoffel> LOL
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dieKartoffel> Haha never was in Frankfurt, just saw it on videos
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> No
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its from the flight
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ill try frankfurter from frankfurt
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hope the airpor one is good enough
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :kek:
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> Has anyone ever developed an app for ios?
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> Or development for apple?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> No
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But maybe in future
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U will have to learn swift
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> And a new macbook üò¶
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Got one
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> I got a macbook pro from mid 2012, I thought I‚Äòd keep it that I can use xcode, but latest xcode is 12.4 on catalina
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> >Please note, starting April 2023, all iOS and iPadOS apps submitted to the App Store must be built with Xcode 14.1 and the iOS 16.1 SDK.

18:44 <+ChillerDragon> yes old mac hardware is such a pain. Its basically useless unless you put in a lot of effort. Might probably be easier to cross compile from linux :D
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> Sad
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had an extremely sad currywurst at frankfurt
19:43 <+ChillerDragon> xd
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Airport that is
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I think mine was sad
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But the potato salad was rly guf
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Gud
19:44 <+ChillerDragon> good*
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Whereabouts are u?
19:45 <+ChillerDragon> sus
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Frankfurt airport
19:45 <+ChillerDragon> dont tell this old man your location
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> About to board soon
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> A 13h flight
19:45 <+ChillerDragon> DEUTSCHLAND
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hf. I hope I can make my way there once more
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I hope there are chargers
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> üôè
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> Teeworlds was in appstore around 2014 but its not here since long time
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> i still have it on my 10 years old ipad :poggers2:
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> I could use that https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/ maybe, but I‚Äòd rather buy a second hand macbook
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> I could use that https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/ maybe, but I‚Äòd rather buy a second hand macbook that runs xcode 11.
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> I could use that https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/ maybe, but I‚Äòd rather buy a second hand macbook that runs the newest xcode.
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh, just 1 hour from me
