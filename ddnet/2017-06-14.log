16:28 < Ryozuki> weired that void CGraphics_Threaded::SetColor(float r, float g, float b, float a) 
16:28 < Ryozuki> ranges from 0 to 1
16:29 < Ryozuki> instead of 0 to 255
16:29 < Ryozuki> those floats
17:36 < Ryozuki> ddos
23:51 <@deen> Ryozuki: Why is that weird? It only makes sense to make them range from 0 to 255 if you want to store them in uint8
23:52 <@deen> and here floats are used, so 0 to 1 is an obvious scaling
23:56 < eeeee> with floats it would be easier to upgrade ddnet to HDR
