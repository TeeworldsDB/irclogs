16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 design decision: should the client tell the server what it wants to see or should it just send the screen width/height?
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm leaning towards the former because it makes client modding a bit easier
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> former for me too
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just send the rect the client wants to see
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. interesting
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> <overengineering time>
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 should it include fields for "which client id should the rect be centered on"/"which x,y coordinate should the rect be centered on"?
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> currently I was only sending width/height
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you think it the center is a good prop? maybe just send the two points that define the rect?
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> copied refactor to trunk
