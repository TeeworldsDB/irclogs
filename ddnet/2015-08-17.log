00:39 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/
00:40 < Savander_> nice!
00:40 <@deen> all the old def- repos auto-redirect to ddnet
00:40 < Savander_> :))
00:40 <@heinrich5991> good job
00:41 <@heinrich5991> deen: just today I looked up whether github.com/ddnet was still available
00:41 <@deen> heinrich5991: i asked the github people to give it to me and they did^^
00:41 <@heinrich5991> but I see it's you who had it
00:41 <@heinrich5991> oh
00:41 <@deen> nope, i didn't have it
00:41 <@heinrich5991> that's nice of them
00:41 <@deen> you can take over unused names
00:41 <@deen> but have to manually talk to them
00:43 <@deen> which i guess most people don't know
00:43 <@heinrich5991> including me :)
00:43 <@deen> maybe i would've gotten github.com/df or github.com/de for myself instead
00:44 <@heinrich5991> I wonder whether they do that when you don't already have an obvious name like ddnet
00:44 <@deen> github.com/a is unsused :P
00:45 <@deen> https://help.github.com/articles/name-squatting-policy/
00:45 <@deen> "Inactive accounts may be renamed or removed by GitHub staff at their discretion"
00:45 <@deen> so it's always a manual decision, no idea if they would just give you "a" for fun
00:46 < Savander_> maybe you need to have good reason ^^
00:46 < Savander_> eg. like DDNet
00:48 <@deen> now the github button on http://ddnet.tw/ finally makes sense
00:48 <@deen> not sure whether github counts as a social network
00:49 <@heinrich5991> good night you guys, good job on getting github.com/ddnet :)
00:49 <@deen> good night
00:49 < Savander_> good night, i have to go too
01:38 <@deen> Hope I didn't put anything private in^^: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web
02:25 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/v3Nzk
02:25 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 15b69bd def: Update def- -> ddnet
06:09 < o_be_one> <Chairn> cant we just make ban works for name as well?
06:09 < o_be_one> good idea, like in irc, but banning port seems to be a good way too, cause all bots use same port ..
06:10 < o_be_one> i want to do a TW bot in bash, any free source for this ?
06:27 < o_be_one> marcella flame players with ddos ...
08:32 <@EastByte> o_be_one: tw bot in bash?
13:23 < laxadedi> o_be_one: in bash ? This is completely absurd to me, the best you could do is to make a simple program that connects to a server and say something, or maybe stays connecter to the server
13:23 < laxadedi> why bash ?
13:31 < Xenoad> Hallo/Hello
13:39 <@heinrich5991> hi!
14:05 < laxadedi> Hey, is there any data compression in teeworlds ?
14:05 < laxadedi> (in the network)
14:09 < laxadedi> I am going to develop a simple VNC client + server with Win32 API, currently the compression/decompression is handled by https://code.google.com/p/miniz/
14:09 < laxadedi> Seems to be already pretty good from what I can read
14:10 < laxadedi> and I think I'll use a binary stream for the network (dunno if that makes real sense said like that)
14:10 < laxadedi> Just want your opinion if some other compression would be better, like gzip for example
14:11 < BeaR_> sup
14:32 < Shiki_> sup BeaR_, ctf is missing you
14:43 < o_be_one> hello
14:44 < o_be_one> laxadedi & EastByte, in bash cause it's easier for me to code with it :p. But maybe i'll do with python (i'm really noob with this) :/. Python "bot" sources without gui (Linux) ?
14:49 < laxadedi> I guess it would be possible, but really painful, bash is for scripting. A bot is more than a script.
15:02 < o_be_one> yes sure, seen an IRC bot yesterday in Bash, was funny :p
15:03 < o_be_one> just here : https://github.com/Newbrict/bash-irc-bot
15:09 < fstd> o_be_one: please don't use .sh extensions for bash scripts, thanks, the portability police
15:10 < fstd> besides, on the first glance it doesn't seem like you're using any bashisms so you might as well make it a POSIX shell script with a #!/bin/sh shebang
15:13 <@EastByte> laxadedi: tw uses huffman compression in network
15:14 < laxadedi> Yeah, but tw network protocol is plain text, not binary right ?
15:14 < laxadedi> you can set deflate to use huffman only as I have seen on the source file
15:14 <@EastByte> I don't understand
15:15 <@EastByte> it's a binary protocol which uses huffman optionally
15:20 <@heinrich5991> laxadedi: it's not a text protocol
15:20 < laxadedi> ok
15:21 < laxadedi> Is huffman really good on binary protocols ?
15:21 < BeaR_> why not?
15:21 <@EastByte> it depends on the huffman table you are using
15:21 < BeaR_> depends on your table
15:21 < BeaR_> \o/
15:21 <@EastByte> e.g. it makes 0 bytes just 1 bit long
15:21 <@EastByte> (for tw)
15:22 < laxadedi> Hum ok, well, I guess I'll see that later x)
17:09 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/v3heP
17:09 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 6ab2a55 east: Disable vanilla antispoof on password protected servers
17:10 < Savander> hi
17:10 <@EastByte> shit happens
17:10 <@EastByte> hi
17:12 < Savander> Antispoof is possible to implement to another gametype? Such as zCatch?
17:12 < Savander> i mean, it need a lot of changes in zCatch or not ::p
17:13 <@EastByte> Savander: I have a patch ready for that
17:14 < Savander> it'll be great protect for  ddnet zcatch, i guess
17:30 < Savander> how server knows, where to send data? 
17:30 < Savander> i mean
17:30 < Savander> sv_register
17:30 < Savander> ^^>
17:31 < Savander> client has master.cfg
17:31 < Savander> what about server?
17:31 <@EastByte> it looks up the dns names
17:31 <@EastByte> master1.teeworlds.com etc.
17:32 < Savander> its hardcoded?
17:32 <@EastByte> the dns names, yes (I think so?)
17:32 < Savander> hm
17:33 < Savander> i thought about "custom master server", whether it's possible
17:35 <@EastByte> apparently not
17:38 <@heinrich5991> Savander: you can use custom master servers, but currently it's an either custom or standard
17:38 <@heinrich5991> no way to register both
17:44 <@EastByte> is there a config var for that?
17:47 < WolfAlex>  /etc/hosts <- route master1.teeworlds.com to your own ip
17:48 < o_be_one> heinrich5991: never seen that you are TW official mod, what's your job in TW ? Just doing moderation or you dev too ?
17:49 < Savander> ahm
17:49 < WolfAlex> (if you want to use your own master in the client, does not work for the server)
17:50 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: moderation, steam and transifex right now. not an official developer, only have a few PRs in the queue
17:51 < Savander> WolfAlex, then master in the client are useless ^^.
17:51 < o_be_one> ok interesting ^^ i dont know "transifex", what is it ?
17:51 < Savander> it can be hardcoded in client like in a server
17:51 < Savander> doesn't need master.cfg 
17:52 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: the translation platform, we're currently half-using
17:52 <@heinrich5991> due to communication problems in the team, however, we don't use it for 0.6.4 right now :/
17:52 < WolfAlex> the masters.cfg is only to show you the IPs of the masters if i remember correct Savander 
17:52 < Savander> WolfAlex, but for what? It's not needed
17:52 <@heinrich5991> Savander: if dns is unreachable
17:53 <@heinrich5991> also if dns takes too long
17:53 < Savander> in master.cfg you have domains
17:53 <@heinrich5991> yes, and the IPs
17:53 < o_be_one> heinrich5991: oh :/ i hope communication will be better fastly ..
17:54 < Savander> then explain me this
17:54 < Savander> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=115253#p115253
17:54 < Savander> i mean
17:54 < Savander> why this guy receive only 100 servers
17:54 < Savander> from 1000~
17:55 < Savander> he can't receive data from master2, so maybe somewhere there is a problem?
17:56 < WolfAlex> Savander: tell him to lower br_max_requests
17:56 < Savander> what i does?
17:57 < Savander> max request in second or?
17:57 < WolfAlex> uhm i think it was max parallel requests
17:57 < WolfAlex> a server times out after 1(or 10?)sec
17:57 < WolfAlex> higher number -> fast refresh but high packet loss
17:58 < Savander> i have 25 now
17:58 < Savander> on this setting
18:08 <@deen> o_be_one: CAN server is behaving weird, load 16-20, I think the kernel is overloaded
18:08 <@deen> Savander: that guy should use ddnet client
18:08 <@deen> Savander: it keeps requesting the servers until they answer
18:09 <@deen> so it's better with packet loss
18:12 <@deen> o_be_one: back to normal it seems
18:17 < Savander> TW-Map Viewer has possibilities to run demo? I mean, it's possible to modify this code to run demo?
18:18 < Savander> if it can show you map, with tiles and everything, so maybe it's possible to export moves etc
18:18 <@EastByte> you want to implement it? fine :)
18:21 < Savander> just askin
18:22 < Savander> i don't have enough skills to do even more than a simple console program, where you can add few numbers
18:30 <@EastByte> Savander: well it
18:30 <@EastByte> 's a lot of work
18:30 <@EastByte> damn return key
18:32 < Savander> im more artist, than coder
18:32 < Savander> :p

18:46 < Savander> haha
18:54 < Nimda> NightSky2 by Zaiross just released on Moderate at 2015-08-17 18:51
19:10 <@deen> o_be_one: ok, load on CAN back to 25, server acting weird
19:15 < o_be_one> deen: hum maybe ddos ?
19:15 < o_be_one> deen: i havent access to this server ...
19:23 <@deen> o_be_one: you mean you don't have the password or you can't connect to it?
19:24 <@deen> o_be_one: nah, it's no ddos, the system just seems broken, kernel overloaded or disk maybe
19:27 < o_be_one> deen: i mean there is no password allowed, the server only allow SSH key, and there's only yours in
19:27 < o_be_one> but its maybe just a work from OVH, it will be back soon i hope
19:29 <@deen> o_be_one: EastByte has access too^
20:02 < o_be_one> ok
20:06 < o_be_one> and what about website design update deen ?
20:11 <@deen> o_be_one: dunno, i was never involved with that
20:16 < o_be_one> i think its from you ive seen the begin of something new
20:24 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] cinaera opened pull request #291: HSV color picker for quad points (master...pr_editor_scale) http://git.io/v3jEU
20:33 < o_be_one> EastByte: wich language was your stats ig bot ?
21:06 <@EastByte> o_be_one: hm not sure what bot you mean
21:07 <@EastByte> the twstat backend for server information or the tool I used to log tw messages?
21:08 < o_be_one> the one to log messages
21:08 < o_be_one> but didnt known that twstat is tw bot too, cause its js scripts
21:12 <@EastByte> the one that logs messages is simply based on teeworlds
21:12 <@EastByte> so written in C++
21:14 <@EastByte> twstat is not a tw bot, I just thought about it because you mentioned 'stats'
21:18 < o_be_one> oh ok ty :)
21:36 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/v3jhm
21:36 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 8dec8d7 east: Fixed chat highlighting
21:46 <@EastByte> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/291 <- awesome work by BeaR :)
21:57 < Savander> its only for quad?^^
21:57 < Savander> still awesome
21:57 < Savander> :D
22:06 <@EastByte> this is what happens if a developer starts mapping^^
22:07 <@EastByte> he maps the editor instead of maps
22:15 < Savander> xDD
22:57 < Savander> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=115263#p115263
22:58 < Savander> !!!
22:58 < Savander> xD
23:10 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/WR5qlZSf7751
23:10 < Savander> why one tee is freezed
23:10 < Savander> and one not?
23:24 < fgfdgffgfg> Savander: cuz upper just came from freeze and need some time?
23:26 < Savander> nope
23:26 < Savander> inifnite freeze
23:26 < Savander> i mean, it looks like, upper is in freeze
23:26 < Savander> but this below not
23:29 < Savander> we should continue this ?http://ddnet.savander.pl/ or we should do another one? 
23:31 < fgfdgffgfg> status 12000 online xDDD
23:31 < Savander> XD
23:31 < Savander> xDDDDDD
23:31 < Savander> FUTURE!
23:32 < fgfdgffgfg> change it to 12132 or something =)
23:32 < Savander> it's only for test
23:32 < Savander> :p
23:33 < Savander> but, i don't like this
23:33 < Savander> ( i mean numbers next to status)
23:37 < Chairn> how can i bind multiple action on one key without a .cfg file?
23:38 < Savander> something;something
23:38 < Savander> ;something
23:38 < Savander> in quotes
23:40 < Chairn> doesnt work
23:40 < Savander> what you want
23:40 < Savander> to do?
23:40 < Chairn> for instance : bind i say "hello"; say "smurf"
23:41 < Savander> try double quotes maybe
23:41 < Chairn> doesnt work either
23:42 < Chairn> i think it doesnt work with say command :D
23:42 < Chairn> but it works with other
23:42 < Savander> maybe
23:42 < Savander> because "say" has quotas too
23:43 < Chairn> indeed
23:45 < Savander> hmm
23:45 < Chairn> in fact, it works
23:45 < Savander> maybe we should fix it?
23:45 < Savander> eg.
23:45 < Chairn> its just that second say doesnt appear thx to flood protection
23:45 < Savander> say should expect paragraphs too?
23:45 < Chairn> i tried bind i "say hello; +fire"
23:46 < Chairn> it says hello and fire ^^
23:46 < Chairn> t
23:46 < Savander> works?
23:46 < Savander> but
23:46 < Chairn> so say stop on ;
23:46 < Savander> with quotas too?
23:46 < Chairn> nah
23:46 < Savander> hm
23:46 < Savander> wird
23:46 < Savander> what if
23:46 < Savander> say blablabla\;
23:46 < Chairn> if you try bind i "say "hello"; +fire"
23:46 < Savander> ??
23:46 < Chairn> it stop on second quote
23:46 < Savander> it shouldn work
23:46 < Chairn> and then Wrong syntax, say +r
23:47 < Chairn> if you want ; in your say you can use quotes, but you cant bind multiple action without using .cfg file
23:47 < Savander> ,eh
23:47 < Savander> but that's fine i guess
23:48 < Savander> ;p
23:48 < Chairn> but atleast it works for all others command i guess
23:51 < Savander> say_team
23:51 < Savander> xD
