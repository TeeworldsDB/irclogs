00:41 < bridge> <cyberFighter> how is genericore 7 only by marvinproductions btw
00:43 < bridge> <furo321> What do you mean?

00:44 < bridge> <cyberFighter> wait theres a marvin logo in genericore 1
00:48 < bridge> <cyberFighter> ok i checked all maps and genericore 1 should have amol & marvin, and 7 should also have amol & marvin, unless i dont have context
00:51 < bridge> <furo321> Marvin Productions is a old clan which √Ömol was a part of, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDRMyQ64Uoo> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
01:37 < bridge> <Ewan> the skin server responsible for providing fallback skins to the proxy at `https://uniqueclan.net/proxy/skin/` now automatically "fixes" skins which have errors in the client
01:37 < bridge> <Ewan> the fixes are sometimes barbaric but i found that usually the errors relate to improper geometry or PNG chunk type (effectively color space) and i manually account for both of those
01:38 < bridge> <Ewan> if using the proxy like this nothing has to change atm
01:38 < bridge> <Ewan> if using the server directly the request must now look like
01:38 < bridge> <Ewan> `https://tw.starbo.lt/read/fix/*`
01:39 < bridge> <Ewan> instead of
01:39 < bridge> <Ewan> `https://tw.starbo.lt/read/*`
01:40 < bridge> <Ewan> do u think it's better to have a potentially fucked up skin and error unprompted (e.g. when someone joins and they have an erroneous skin) or fix it like im doing
01:40 < bridge> <Ewan> or should they be fixed on a per-skin basis... i think i have too many for that
12:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> would be nice to clean up the list of skins. or just not server invalid skins at all
13:15 < bridge> <shyzo.> Is there a way to filter demos by demo marker? earlier it used to be easy to see what demos you marked anything in. now in version 18.0.3 the workflow is kinda rough, cause you have to click on each demo to see if you marked anything in it. Or am i missing something?
13:31 < bridge> <robyt3> The Markers column was removed because I didn't consider it to be very useful (#7311). We could either add it back, which means less space is available for the demo name especially on 5:4 resolutions. Or we could add a more detailed filter for demos similar to the filter in the server browser.

13:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> how do i setup a way for my client and server to communicate with each other in a seperate docker container? i've setup a docker network and changed the URL the client uses to communicate to the server to the name of the docker container, but it just wont work
14:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sos https://observer.ddstats.org/ down
14:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> uhm ryo how can i search a server here? https://ddstats.org/
14:55 < bridge> <shyzo.> I think the marker column was quite usefull for content creators, at least i used it all the time. I mean a Filter option for "has at least one Marker" would also be a valid option i guess. But i guess the column might be the easier method since we already had that feature before? But im not an IT guy so idk xD
14:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Adding the column back would be easier, yeah, I'm just not sure it's useful enough that you can sort by the number of markers. A filter option would be cleaner, although it would be more work because there is no filter for demos right now except the quick search.
14:58 < bridge> <robyt3> On 5:4 there isn't much space for adding another column, or even filenames of normal length would be cut off

15:00 < bridge> <cyberFighter> can we raise like 100 euros so deen doesnt have a 5:4 monitor and remove support for it
15:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @melo∆û yes network sounds good. What do you use to test the client and server connection and how does your dockerfile look like?
15:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> this is how my docker-compose is structured atm - i am simply testing it by letting the client ping to it and saying Ok when a pong is returned
15:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1218925250872606770/image.png?ex=66096f9a&is=65f6fa9a&hm=aa4cf3d22b74dad8a6ff92abfb6c9f581ce76103acff1d4dea9de7b2636310ce&
15:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Yes the demo marker column is indeed important for content creators. @shyzo. @robyt3 +1 from my side
15:14 < bridge> <robyt3> Column or filter?
15:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @melo∆û not booting element now to look at your image sorry. i dont have time to debug docker now anyways maybe someone else has
15:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> :P understandable
15:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> when cli image viewer?
15:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im not in the cli
15:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when stop using discord
15:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they banned me from their image cdn
15:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> its hard keeping track on what you are on, idk stuff about IRC, Matrix, etc
15:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @robyt3 i did not see the new thing yet but if you removed the info wether a demo has markers from the list thats a big downgrade. A filter was there too already if i remember correctly.
15:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I dont have a client available right now to check but i swear i used to scroll the entire list a few years back and then click sort to see all demos with markers
15:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @melo∆û yea you don't have to i am everywhere. But the interesting news is that discords images are not closed. So I can no longer see them. Unless I boot matrix where the matrix bridge copies them over.
15:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> now closed*
15:20 < bridge> <robyt3> The question is whether we just want the column to sort by the number of markers back or whether adding a filter tab to the demo browser would make sense, where you'd have a checkbox "Has markers". Though adding a separate filter tab might also be annoying because you can't see the info of the selected demo at the same time then.
15:21 < bridge> <robyt3> Unless we try to the show the demo info and filter at the same time instead of in separate tabs
15:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I don't care if it filters or sorts the result is the same I can see the relevant demos
15:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I remember the loading the meta data by scrolling the list was annoying not sure if that has been addressed yet.
15:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @robyt3 now that i think about it i do care. Filtering is worse than sorting. Because I used the amount of markers as weight for relevance.
15:48 < bridge> <borsmatyas02> can you please implement a function where if you press kill button for 3 sec, you dont have to type /kill ? it would make my life easier
16:20 < bridge> <shyzo.> Oh thats true. But who even uses 5:4 nowadays xD i think using 16:9 as a standard option would be the most useful
16:22 < bridge> <shyzo.> +++ the option to refresh the whole demo folder and immediately see all demos that have markers in them and the option to sort for that was just awesome for quickly dealing with demos
