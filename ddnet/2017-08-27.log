11:46 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> I know, updating database right now
11:47 <+ddnet-discord> <RayB.> ah
11:47 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> not sure why it takes so long though
11:47 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> might be stuck somewhere
11:48 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> or just because our database is kind of big now
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> hey guys
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Curl not found (using bundled version)  * Freetype not found (using bundled version)  * Ogg not found (using bundled version)  * Opus not found (using bundled version)  * Opusfile not found (using bundled version)  * PythonInterp found  * SDL2 not found (using bundled version)  * Zlib not found (using bundled version) Configuring done
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> is that bad?
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> in cmake gui
17:13 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> nope, fine
17:13 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> that's why we have the bundles
17:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> k thx
20:27 <@heinrich5991> sctt_: ask here :)
22:50 <+sctt_> hello @heinrich5991 !
22:52 <+sctt_> i've written to you cause i've managed to write a new map_resave to solve the issue i posted on github
22:52 <+sctt_> i changed the logic completely, i'm parsing single elements now as io.cpp does
22:53 <+sctt_> but the result map makes the client crash.... i hope maybe you could give a look to my source :(
23:09 <@heinrich5991> sctt_: why did you change the logic? ^^
23:10 <+sctt_> cause GetSize didnt work, so i thought i'd just load everything with GetType, check the actual size, and compare them
23:10 <@heinrich5991> you can fix GetSize if you want
23:10 <+sctt_> for example, i noticed that Items GetSize is always 8 bytes less
23:11 <@heinrich5991> yup
23:11 <+sctt_> yeah but i can't fix it if i don't know what are the differences between the correct one and the wrong one :(
23:12 <@heinrich5991> you already realized that one :)
23:12 <@heinrich5991> you have to subtract sizeof(CDatafileItem) from GetItemSize
23:12 <@heinrich5991> maybe rename that function in CDataFileReader
23:13 <+sctt_> oh
23:13 <@heinrich5991> GetItemSize -> GetItemSizeRaw
23:13 <+sctt_> i was whinking about doing just a minus 8 xD
23:14 <@heinrich5991> and then make a new function GetItemSize that takes the result of GetItemSizeRaw and subtracts 8
23:14 <@heinrich5991> not 8
23:14 <@heinrich5991> I mean sizeof(CDatafileItem)
23:14 <+sctt_> oh yes i could try it
23:14 <+sctt_> but sure also getDataSize is wrong
23:14 <@heinrich5991> yep
23:15 <@heinrich5991> but I can also tell you why :)
23:15 <+sctt_> cause my maps were messy even when i fixed item size
23:15 <+sctt_> oh :O
23:15 <@heinrich5991> oh, it seems it was already fixed
23:15 <@heinrich5991> use GetUncompressedDataSize
23:15 <@heinrich5991> but since GetDataSize is completely useless
23:16 <@heinrich5991> maybe just remove that function and rename GetUncompressedDataSize to GetDataSize
23:16 <+sctt_> mmmmmm
23:16 <+sctt_> ok i will try that :DDD
23:16 <+sctt_> that seems great
23:19 <+sctt_> meanwhile i'll try, would you like to see the other code i made?
23:19 <@heinrich5991> sure
23:19 <+sctt_> it's about 100 lines... only if you have time for that ofc
23:19 <+sctt_> ok :D
23:19 <+sctt_> do you have an email?
23:20 <@heinrich5991> it's just one file, right?
23:20 <+sctt_> yes
23:20 <+sctt_> a small one
23:21 <@heinrich5991> then you could put it into a pastebin
23:21 <@heinrich5991> do you have a github account?
23:21 <@heinrich5991> otherwise: https://pastebin.mozilla.org/
23:21 <+sctt_> oki
23:21 <@heinrich5991> if you have one, go here: https://gist.github.com/
23:23 <+sctt_> https://pastebin.mozilla.org/9030830
23:35 <+sctt_> hey i modified the size methods as you told me
23:35 <+sctt_> and it works!!!!
23:35 <+sctt_> :DDDDD
23:35 <+sctt_> thank you very much!!
