00:43 < bridge> <blazulite> I got a plenty of criticism for adding the left bar so I'm currently working on a concept to replace it with an upper bar instead
00:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> owo i like the left bar
00:55 < bridge> <blazulite> I will let yall choose which one is better anyway
01:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1413301594853871626/image.png?ex=68bb6f2e&is=68ba1dae&hm=056e2036a483c27d06e35f9a56064b027d4f005a70bb14ea7b2a635e72a26700&
01:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> some people dont deserve domains
01:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> some popular guy said 67, it went viral and anything related to 67 is "67", so basically 69 but not as demure

04:06 < bridge> <teero777> https://youtu.be/15_-hgsX2V0?si=lkF1B9a0GpU3BfLT
04:06 < bridge> <teero777> this is so good xd
04:37 < bridge> <blazulite> ohh yes I saw this
04:37 < bridge> <blazulite> I love it
06:02 < bridge> <blazulite> Is there any actually safe way to do portforwarding locally?
06:11 < bridge> <Ewan> inherently unsafe
06:11 < bridge> <Ewan> leave the ports open with a firewall on
06:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
06:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean port forwarding is in reality just configuring the router firewall
06:41 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
07:20 < bridge> <pilonpl> Well you are also routing packets to a specific local ip address
09:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssssssssssssssssaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
09:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you deleted my best friend `MapScreenToGroup`
09:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** 812093123 call sites broken 
09:40 < bridge> <pioooooo> 7777
09:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
09:40 < bridge> <pioooooo> :kek:
10:35 < bridge> <Assa> ???
10:35 < bridge> <Assa> Skill issue? What's the problem?
10:36 < bridge> <Assa> Reminder that MapScreenToAnything are just MapScreen wrappers
10:44 < bridge> <Assa> Honestly if you need MapScreenToGroup you are probably fundamentally doing something wrong
10:46 < bridge> <Assa> If you know the RenderGroup just call Render on it
11:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yea i figured
11:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but i really cba to change the code that works :/ 
11:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa I just added it back xd
11:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-ux/blob/8e79f0623af501703d85ee203b45ece7e3aa187c/src/game/client/components/chillerbot/chillerbotux.cpp#L47-L56
11:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i just want to draw some lines and rects into the world
11:12 < bridge> <Assa> probably in the game layer right?
11:12 < bridge> <Assa> Then you just need MapScreenToWorld xD
11:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** makes sense xd
11:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thanks mr render guru
11:19 < bridge> <robyt3> `if(time_get() % 10 == 0)` this can't be right, you are checking the nanoseconds timer for every 10th nanosecond, which isn't generally possible with the resolution that this timer provides
12:14 < bridge> <Assa> remote control in chillerbot ðŸ¤” enables remote cheating
13:05 < chillerbot12> Elo @chillerdragon I just wanted to remind you that: fix callback hell by moving findnext to outer scope
13:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon u lazy xd, its really not hard to change
13:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) u mean the screen thing?
13:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** bro idk the code is all magic and duck tape for me
13:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well my solution was just delete them, they werent doing anything
13:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** now that i know about the MapScreenToWorld it does indeed seem obvious tho
13:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i didnt try but i assume it would render wrong then because i was currently in the HUD context not world context
13:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or however it is called
13:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa <:justatest:572499997178986510>
13:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can easily get from world context to hud context
13:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> then use save screen to get back
13:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why not
13:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1413487831200043038/image.png?ex=68bc1ca0&is=68bacb20&hm=25f416684d3d4ab6a9e12e94b8c34a3ffe645cb73ee2fa202ddc0e5e2cb6cf8a&
13:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you should even be able to approve for "ive given it a once over, lgtm"
13:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i agree
13:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** this limitation makes minimum merge approval bypasses particularly op
13:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lets say you have 10 maintainers that can not push to master or merge but approve. And with 3 approvals they can also merge.
13:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** now they can not approve their own pr
13:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh i see
13:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so the 3 approval minimum has to be adapted to that (1 lower)
13:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well i think thats fine
13:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> whichever it is (self approved allowed or not) you would base the approval count on
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** meaning if they open a pr from another account (fake account or just a different account without merge rights) they have 1 more approval on their own pr
13:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> o
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it encourages fake accounting which imo is bad
13:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> they wouldnt have a fake account for a project which requires 3 approvals
13:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe an intern xd
13:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or maybe like they cross send prs
13:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> they have a rotor of who submits eachothers prs
13:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** teeworlds-community was affected by that issue
13:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> whats that
13:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/teeworlds-community/teeworlds 
13:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i handed out approve and merge if enuff approval rights to a bazzillion ppl
13:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** true open source true community driven
13:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** to replace afk oy
13:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1413489116347105300/image.png?ex=68bc1dd2&is=68bacc52&hm=393c4bc5686007e387709b51f23df331d484f6cd8aa48aab6fc270d850238598&
13:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** also ddnet rule to not merge ur own prs soks
13:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1413489190288756766/image.png?ex=68bc1de4&is=68bacc64&hm=2d4fcf81391ebd9823b6f04cf9bcdb20582077caeb0c3bbd8d79587c0802540f&
13:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thats why robyte created his smurf account dobrykafe to be able to merge his own prs
13:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> :pepeRage:
13:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) the project ended when oy returned
13:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> lmao
13:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> did teeworlds just hard reset to his
13:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> did teeworlds just hard reset to this
13:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** other way around
13:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i hard reset to teeworlds
13:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so teeworlds community was pointless?
13:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** not really
13:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i like to think it motivated oy to return
13:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** also it brought lots of dev activity back
13:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> x-x
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its motivating to see your prs being reviewed and merged
13:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> poor prs waiting
13:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i still dont see the point of 0.7 dev x-x
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** even if the reviewers are random and the merge is into a random repo
13:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> just make ddnet cover all of 0.7 behaviour and go from there
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** there was more activity over all and we also encouraged to pr upstream as well
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so it helped tw a bit
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) and drop 0.6 agree
13:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but ddnet does not support ctf/dm/lms and so on
13:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so it cant compete with teeworlds
13:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> most vanilla gamemodes are completley supported
13:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> in terms of prediction and showing stuff
13:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** not server side
13:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> lms isnt because theres no skull
13:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (and zcatch)
13:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well ddnet-isnta is basically that
13:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so easy to merge xd
13:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no one touches server as a matter of principle
13:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> might break physics
13:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i wonder if we can get 0.7 skull emojis for ddnet
13:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) there is 
13:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i added it
13:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> o
13:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** in 0.7 mode
13:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> any reason its not backportable?
13:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** to what=
13:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** 0.6?
13:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah
13:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so zcatch and lms can use it in ddnet-insta
13:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** there is no 0.6 protocol for skull
13:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** would have to be 0.6+ddnet
13:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah so add it
13:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but yes can be done ofc
13:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but not really
13:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** because the person who sends those prs died
13:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** furo rip
13:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> "thos" prs?
13:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** he would port all 0.7 stuff to 0.6+ddnet
13:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh right
13:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i be new furo?
13:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nice yes send pr
13:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> hmm
13:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why for sixup do we not set the 0.6 data
13:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and instead do SixUp() ? sixupdata  : normaldata
13:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk wat u talk
13:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `            bool IsDead = Client()->m_TranslationContext.m_aClients[pInfo->m_ClientId].m_PlayerFlags7 & protocol7::PLAYERFLAG_DEAD;`
13:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @sollybunny: go add yellow team to ddnet please
13:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wait nvm the example i wanted to use wasnt actually existing
13:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yellow team?
13:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Red
13:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Purple
13:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Blue
13:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yellow
13:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I want threesome ctf
13:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Tripple scoreboard
13:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And yellow flag
13:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ooh that would be cool
13:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wouldnt that be a new team?
13:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> spectator red blue yellow
13:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So all 3 ctf players can get their own team xd
13:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes thatâ€™s what I said
13:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also spectator is known as purple
13:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh i saw flag
13:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and was like
13:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ah yes player flag
13:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Cring ddnet dev
13:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wha
13:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Capture the flag
13:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yes i am aware
13:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
13:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> bool IsDead = Client()->m_TranslationContext.m_aClients[pInfo->m_ClientId].m_PlayerFlags7 & protocol7::PLAYERFLAG_DEAD;
13:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
13:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> would i instead use normal player flags
13:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for this
13:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and use translation to turn 7 dead into 6 dead
13:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
13:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do i need to turn 6 dead into 7 dead for client
13:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do i need to turn 6 dead into 7 dead for client->server
13:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> does any server do anything with a dead player flag
13:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The client doesnâ€™t send dead
13:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Imagine xd
13:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but it could
13:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Imagine xd
13:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i pressume for non mods it just gets filtered
13:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but there could be some 0.7 mod which breaks if we dont translate it
13:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Moderators?
13:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no u ddnet dev
13:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> game mod
13:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> game modes
13:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Shit u got me
13:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> hehe
13:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But imagine xd
13:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Client sending skull
13:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> We get every custom client spam flipping skull flag every tick on every server
13:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wait why is there a player flag7?
13:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Makes no sense
13:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1413493090437566587/image.png?ex=68bc2186&is=68bad006&hm=f4c17284d4afc02e90d7fb1de5f4ab3fa0bda677df841fdd59238d6eb7e0fbfa&
13:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Different flags
13:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> bruh
13:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so why the translation context call beforehand
13:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wait do we have a seperate list for 0.7 down player flags/
13:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk
13:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wait do we have a seperate list for 0.7 down player flags?
13:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Do I look like 0.7 dev?
13:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yes
13:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Fair
13:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> everything tw dev
13:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But Iâ€™m not developer
13:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk the code
13:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i will ignore its existance
13:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But donâ€™t send new pr
13:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am officially banning you from pr sending
13:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Until you close some
13:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You have too many open prs
13:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `ExPlayerFlags = ["AFK", "PAUSED", "SPEC"]`
13:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> err
13:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Donâ€™t conflict my ass
13:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> With input flag
13:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> are ex player flags input flags?
13:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes I think
13:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk
13:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
13:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> okay
13:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im a bit confused why there would be two
13:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Donâ€™t do it
13:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just fix your old draft prs instead
13:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or I will go crashout
13:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ermm
14:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon u have 28 open prs
14:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** all ready
14:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** none draft
14:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> grr
14:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** just someone forgot to merge them
14:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> merge em urself B)
14:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> spam ping roby
14:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** soon
14:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i need alter ego like rossbit first
14:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so i can bypass merge own pr rule
14:03 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ok to be fair i have one draft
14:03 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** 128p pr
14:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> what if i am actually your alt account you have been farming social credit with
14:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so you can eventually get 2 merge accounts
14:03 < bridge> <learath2> So chiller is the reason we have so many prs
14:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah not me
14:03 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes'nt @learath2 
14:03 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but all free to merge
14:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> [Pepe_Pray](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/854905383142555689.gif?size=48&animated=true&name=Pepe_Pray)
14:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so i blame no merge own pr rule and afk other maintainers
14:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but yes many open prs are by me
14:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** some of the prs i have open since years are free 2line epic prs
14:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) are you aiming to obtain merge rights?
14:05 < bridge> <learath2> epic as in breaks everything but makes it nicer to implement some mod you like?
14:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> not particualrly
14:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont trsut myself
14:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 those are the others
14:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 7777 mentioned
14:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> bzainga
14:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 that these are controversial i understand
14:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but i mean there are actually free merges where its unacceptable that they were not merged within the first 10 minutes after being opened
14:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** like https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10596
14:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10467
14:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) i am planning to farm rights to make ppl maintainer to make you maintainer
14:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> "farm rights"
14:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes
14:07 < bridge> <learath2> I can see why this one wasn't merged quickly. Fixes nothing, potentially breaks things, and you admit you aren't even "too sure"
14:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> become admin?
14:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 ._.
14:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) game ddnet
14:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> game ddnet?
14:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** idk
14:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the behaviour for showing hook coll is so messy

14:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar âœª JupDragon is not a gh user it is a org so it has no ssh keys
14:57 < chillerbot12> ding dong ping pong @chillerdragon  @chillerdragon @chillerdragon @chillerdragon: backdoor josspit
14:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i can invite your github user does that work?
15:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** I invited you. The url to accept could be https://github.com/JupDragon/invitations i made it up xd
15:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you have full owner access to the entire org
15:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** Keep in my as my lawyer you have lawyer client confidentally and can not incriminate me
15:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> keep in mind\* aaah
15:18 < bridge> <remakepower> I got `delta unpack failed! (-3)` by using 0.7 client to join DDNetPP, and connection is blocked. Will it be fix?
15:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Thatâ€™s weird
15:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Let me check
15:25 < bridge> <learath2> When deprecate 0.7?
15:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> When remove 0.6
15:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @remakepower i can not reproduce
15:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @learath2 @chillerdragon i would like you to consider that your two requests are not confl;icted
15:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** for me 0.7 works fine
15:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) not really we go quic only
15:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** move to ddnet-rs protocol
15:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i mean
15:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if ddnet-rs is modular enuf we can have 0.7 and 0.6 support nicely
15:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i was told that physics could just be replaced easily and there isnt a seperate server & prediction
15:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @remakepower which 0.7 client do you use?
15:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i tried pure vanilla master and it connected just fine on my local machine

18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> start ddnet-rs
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> click top left
18:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oof
18:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ok gimme an hour to build
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> rest should be hopefully self explaining
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u can download nightly from github
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs/releases/tag/nightly
18:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wat was compile and run command again?
18:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** they were so complicated
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> cargo run
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or what
18:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oh that works? xd
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xD
18:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i remember 100 flags and shit
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> wtf? XD
18:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** idk
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in fact that is what i like about rust
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's pretty much always ez to build no matter the project
18:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** all my 3 screens turned black for 3 seconds
18:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** gg thanks for virus
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> flags are only for steam or ffmpeg support.. dont need for account
18:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it also rearanged my windows
18:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wtf is this
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lel
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> deserved
18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> for nsa ping
18:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i dint
18:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** faaak
18:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** chrizundco@googlemail.com 
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> hello
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> stop leakin xd
18:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
18:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.f8a4620f-846c-4556-b028-6f5436e68be5.png
18:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** aaaaaaaaaaa
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> tja
18:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** Too Many Requests! Wait for 86336s
19:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** bro what is this?
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok i restart
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> for u
19:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it lets me input space
19:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** either trim
19:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or allow multiple tries
19:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** this is trap ux
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> oke
19:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** crashout
19:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thanks for unban
19:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** very hot
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if u'd read the issue on ddnet-accounts it says, i am to lazy to evaluate a good amount of tries in the rate limiter bucket
19:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** also the email is trap
19:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if i double click the code in the email
19:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it selects a space
19:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** setup to fail
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ikr
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i hate that too
19:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** learn html
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but the ui could simply ignore spaces
19:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** im sure its possible
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that is what i work on now
19:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes that would be good too
19:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** where my password xd
19:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or username???
19:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** watf
19:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> no need
19:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's linked to your email
19:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.c9a9c044-ef69-4634-86cf-06395bc53470.png
19:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u better have good pw there
19:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** woah
19:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** in my mail?
19:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the profile name is from my in game name?
19:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** are there even usernames?
19:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if u login again u get new email
19:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> no from email
19:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** FROM EMAIL?
19:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it leaks email?
19:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> bruh
19:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> bun bun@sollybunny.xyz
19:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes you leaked yours now
19:03 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but others dont see it?
19:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** u have a server up @Jupstar âœª can we meet in game?
19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> we can meet on any server
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> chiller are u using rustsoftware?'
19:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ye
19:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar âœª i dont want c++ server
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> rus servers usually work
19:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wait for me!!
19:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1413570614261710868/image.png?ex=68bc69b9&is=68bb1839&hm=08cfbf3e81811c115f0e7d841143c646cb21f5f5a2154ab3d4e57889092ca38d&
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok but dunno they all broken af
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it used to work
19:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i want rust server
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> probs need to update the server bin
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> okhe i try
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> btw updating the id very hard
19:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
19:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** noshit
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bcs there are refs to other tables
19:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i have to ask chatgpt hehe
19:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i wanna see ur db burn
19:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** u have backups right?
19:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ```
19:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails (`ddnet_account_test`.`credential_email`, CONSTRAINT `credential_email_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`account_id`) REFERENCES `account` (`id`))
19:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ```
19:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i made this shit fail safe
19:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i have no backups lmao
19:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's a test db
19:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ono
19:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wdym test db
19:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** im trying to aquire low id acc rn
19:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes but it's not official db
19:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** bruv
19:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** where official db
19:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, i wait for accounts longer than anybody here
19:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> hehe
19:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so not there yet? hm
19:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> can i get a different username than my email
19:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> x-x
19:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ok in test db im fine with id 57
19:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** solly doxed him self again xd
19:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> her*
19:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> what do u think about the kernel having a db available with syscall interfaces
19:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i have a domain of course i have the emails for it
19:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> setup
19:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ddnet-rs sure is laggy ;--;
19:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yea its wonkey
19:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i cannot make account sob
19:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i cant join c++ but c++ is boring anyways
19:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe it doesnt like email with space in it
19:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i want to give native rust another try
19:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but my attention span officially ended
19:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar âœª thanks for trying the id thing i really appreciate it. But if its only test db then its wasted effort anyways so no need.
19:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok
19:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 2 servers on
19:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wowo
19:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** where
19:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in filter disable legacy servers
19:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then u see them
19:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** hook and fire doesnt work xd
19:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it decided that i dont get all of my screen anymore
19:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1413572759568646206/image.png?ex=68bc6bb8&is=68bb1a38&hm=4f957e7783970306bfb08fbf5ae41b9592d628e03d9056a390d100d264783e57&
19:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> erm
19:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ill check back in a year
19:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** WAIT
19:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar âœª 
19:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i forgor
19:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** why i wanted to meet u in game xd
19:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno
19:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** I DO
19:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** come back
19:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i just didnt do it while in game
19:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** got distracted by everygting
19:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yea the screening is a bit wonkey
19:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** which is funny because im sure josspit played a major role in what makes the same thing so smooth in c++
19:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's not fps related
19:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yea but didnt u also polish all the windowing?
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ah u mean sollys screen
19:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno what his problem is
19:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** idk why im stuck so much in the past xd
19:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i doubt it's a valid issue
19:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i also had some weird screen things
19:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its like as bad as cs2
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> maybe it's bcs u both had old configs
19:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** sorry for the low effort issues i hope they still help :c 
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but I'd say the window handling is better than in ddnet, except that on windows exclusive fullscreen doesnt work which is a winit limitation
19:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** no way
19:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ddnets window handling is smooth af
19:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ddnet-rs literally dos my entire setup
19:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** 3 screens pitch black for like 2 seconds
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u mean in menu?
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mh?
19:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** when booting the client
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno dude
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> booting client takes <200ms for me
19:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** debug build
19:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** cargo run
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah wow
19:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but only happend the first time
19:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but still
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the shader compiler is very aggressive
19:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ddnet never does stuff like that
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> try this
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> gl.full_pipeline_creation 0
19:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it only blacks one screen
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that is nice for debug
19:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yea im not complaining

19:47 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> 
19:47 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> What should i do? Tried to compile ddnetpp
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bcs ddnet has no blur filters
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> this shit creates like 200 times the shaders
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ddnet-rs has blur and stencil
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u can disable pre compiling with cmd above
19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> rest is a matter of driver quality
19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mesa amd is simply best
19:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if the very first client start takes a second thats fine
19:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but it should black other screens
19:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** shouldnt
19:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @skibidisigma8261451 can u build pure ddnet?
19:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** do you have rust installed`
19:49 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> Didn't tested
19:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** go test
19:49 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> Yea
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bro it doesnt blakc other screens xDD
19:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i tell u
19:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it happend
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that was either a config thing or your fcking driver sucks
19:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** my entire room when dark
19:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i thought it was power outage
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> why would a user app have control over other screens
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> answer me this question
19:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** idk xorg
19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok u found my secret cmd
19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sh("randr --blackscreen");
19:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
19:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar âœª do you even see what i mean in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs/issues/137 ?
19:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** imo much harder to see in a clip like that
19:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** in game u feel it so much stronger
19:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes
19:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> when u hit the wall it teleported slightly
19:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i see it the strongest when looking at your tee sliding below me
19:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** when u move in and out you teleport hard
19:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.3075b7b5-166b-4b76-8c5c-1a93a26fd187.png
19:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** also these hooks
19:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i miss twice
19:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** with my perfect aim 
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i should write a different game (physics) and see how much is physics bug and how much prediction timer
19:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah wow without antiping or with
19:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** with 
19:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> anyway, i only focused on editor after release
19:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and then i had no more time
19:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fair
19:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> now i can ofc do 2 fulltime jobs again
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> like i did when i started ddnet-rs
19:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it all obviously takes time
19:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but as long as you can reproduce we good
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but i can ensure you, you have nothing else in life then xD
19:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if this is a me issue im fuked
19:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** what else do you need
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> good issues are already good
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bcs then i dont forget
19:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** are my issues good? :c
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> good _enough_
19:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** phew
20:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @kebscs: broadcast tick is missing a Array prefix
20:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> cba to review on GitHub mobile itâ€™s too limited
20:07 < bridge> <kebscs> done
20:08 < bridge> <samuloll123> Heyo, if i spec i always dissapear if im a server like that. How can i setup that i just simply spec?
20:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> \/pause
20:08 < bridge> <samuloll123> Thx
20:10 < bridge> <kebscs> they should make a git commit --amend argument so i can amend to not the top commit
20:10 < bridge> <kebscs> without extra shenanigans
20:10 < bridge> <kebscs> just git commit --amend HEAD~2 or smth idk
20:14 < bridge> <robyt3> Broadcast text also needs another `a` prefix because it's a nested array now
20:15 < bridge> <kebscs> done
20:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> what's up with latest ddnet beta btw
20:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's  ass slow compared to 19.1
20:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @essigautomat what have u changed
20:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> why is 19.1 so much better than current nightly
20:17 < bridge> <kebscs> :tear:
20:17 < bridge> <kebscs> was supposed to be better
20:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i get like at least 30% more fps on 19.1
20:18 < bridge> <kebscs> 19.2 had bug with skin loading eating fps
20:18 < bridge> <kebscs> but that was fixed 19.3 i think
20:18 < bridge> <kebscs> so idk
20:58 < bridge> <robyt3> Ingame, in menu or generally?
20:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ingame ddnet server on ctf1, entities
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> beta from steam
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 19.1 downlaoded from website
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> steam overlay was off
21:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Stepfunn is currently on Nightly, trying out the new antiping preinput feature and he didn't feel any difference at 80 ping
21:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> One has to have low ping the other high ping
21:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> both have to hve feature on
21:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> otherwise it wont work
21:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> also the low player ping needs to increase prediction margin
21:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> e.g. in case of ping 80 to at least 40
21:03 < bridge> <cellegenrih> So if the other tee (which is not me) has higher ping than me, it won't work at all?
21:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then it will work to make his ping lower
21:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @jupeyy_keks ermmmm, i might have to rescind my issue
21:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i swear when i was playing before it was 20fps
21:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but now that im trying now 60fps is fine 120fps is not beign respected im apaprently getting 400?
21:04 < bridge> <cellegenrih> In Stepfunn's case, he's playing it with that feature on by default and he does not really experience any smoothness on any tee
21:04 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Nor me with my dogshit internet
21:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> when scoreboard is open theres no position smoothing
21:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and i recon lots of chat caused lag
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well if he has ping 80 and someone else has ping 40
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then ping 40 has to add prediction margin of at least 20 (to have 60 in total)
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then it should be as if both have ping 60
21:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Is this a specific feature?
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that is how the feature works
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the amount of ping you sarcrifise the other player gets in return
21:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and only the lower ping person can sarcrifise ping
21:06 < bridge> <learath2> It is probably one of his commits, I donâ€™t remember anyone else messing with anything thatâ€™d impact framerates at all
21:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it may have also been some windowing mode, cuz i messed around with those
21:06 < bridge> <kebscs> i mean it removes 10s by default bcs margin is 10
21:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but even on full clb zoomed out ims till getting 120fps which is better than ddnet by miles
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> gm
21:07 < bridge> <kebscs> you all swear by 20ms fast input ðŸ˜‚
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i can only tell ya, scoreboard uses lot of fps bcs of blur
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> blur sucks too hard, and chatgpt is still too bad to make it better ðŸ˜¬
21:07 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I thought this feature would work without any specifics
21:07 < bridge> <cellegenrih> eh.
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and i dont want to do research
21:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> blur is just hard work for gpus
21:08 < bridge> <kebscs> it does but its not very noticeable
21:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (without specific hardware for kernals)
21:09 < bridge> <kebscs> but if you duo someone you can cooperate and have low ping feeling
21:09 < bridge> <kebscs> e.g 1 person from eu other from us would make game playable
21:10 < bridge> <learath2> Remove blur
21:10 < bridge> <melon> when implement picom compositor
21:11 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Hope it gets improved a lot more
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i actually want glass design
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but i am too bad
21:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> please enable transparency so i can add "transparent tiles" to my map and have like a youtube tab open in the bg? yk
21:11 < bridge> <learath2> The weird effect ios notifications have?
21:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> like cinema
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1413602574082379807/Peek20-20After.png?ex=68bc877d&is=68bb35fd&hm=608e3291a13734603dccad9eaf2410e99c5181da80a82dc04ae27c794bf81a66&
21:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> like cinema (bazinga)
21:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but yeah apple uses more glass now too
21:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that doesnt look blurry
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> that's aero glass
21:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> aero glass was cool
21:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> glassy
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> ios thing is different
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> but it's a cool feature
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> their modern blurs are still very cool imo
21:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if win7 would have less ugly icons
21:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it would be still sickest design
21:13 < bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/OverShifted/LiquidGlass just steal it?
21:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> chatgpt: please steal this ^ without build errors
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1413603074915700876/image.png?ex=68bc87f4&is=68bb3674&hm=554b198e1638302ea92c8dfe9637ab190528b444b194d87b38b2add5aac03dab&
21:14 < bridge> <learath2> Donâ€™t use chatgpt, ezclap
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but then i have to use brain
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> these are "acrylic" and "mica"

21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> good fx
21:14 < bridge> <learath2> Isnâ€™t the difficult to implement part figuring out the mathy bits in the shader? You can yoink that part to minimize thinking
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i am in all seriousness scared how these tools slowly get useful
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the current copilot etc. can open terminals compile, read the compile errors, fix them
21:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and move along
21:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ofc that doesnt mean that your program then works as expected
21:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but still sick
21:15 < bridge> <learath2> Iâ€™m scared of what will become of us when everyone offloads all their thinking
21:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> as if 90% of humanity isnt dumb anyway
21:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i am ok to increase it to 91
21:16 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah but this is making the 10% dumb too
21:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah or we all will be managers ðŸ˜¬
21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> make the customers stupider and more dependent
21:16 < bridge> <learath2> Middle manager world
21:17 < bridge> <learath2> And the 10% is actively dying too, and for younger people itâ€™ll be less and less. Weâ€™ll all be asking chatgpt what subway surfers episode to watch next on our HUDs
21:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i think rn the best you can be is a senior engineer.. bcs you understand how good software looks like and at the same time can use AI in a useful way to command them to do the right thing
21:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> they just need to get bit better
21:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> let's say 500% better
21:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @0xfaulty do you know that you got an ssl error? https://0xfaulty.com/files?path=Unstable.map
21:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if i am honest.. for me the 10% top devs are oss devs anyway
21:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> there are good devs working, but having intrensic motivation is simply more OP
21:19 < bridge> <louis> whats this from
21:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> money cannot give you the motivation you need to do crazy things
21:20 < bridge> <learath2> Most if not all yeah
21:20 < bridge> <learath2> Corporate problem solving is very different, you donâ€™t need the crazy solution usually, you need the working solution
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u need the in 1 week solution
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> using ai
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xD
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> no more braincells for working
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dont even know where you get hard work
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> like i applied to random shit for almost 1 year
21:21 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Use claude :troll:
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> all are like microservices
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> windows.design
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> fluent 2 doc page
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> on phone rn
21:26 < bridge> <louis> research roles or domains where u need rly efficient / complex software ig
21:27 < bridge> <louis> idk they exist
21:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> maybe in murica
21:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well i dunno, ofc it has to be in rust too xd
21:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dont even know what everyone here is working on except deen
21:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> do we have any game developer that also does it professionally here
21:29 < bridge> <louis> doubt it lol
21:29 < bridge> <louis> ur only looking for rust specific j*bs?
21:32 < bridge> <melon> why did you censor jabs ._.
21:32 < bridge> <louis> its a slur offensive to the unemployed
21:33 < bridge> <melon> :kek:
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i have a rust job
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's also not easy
21:34 < bridge> <louis> oh nice
21:34 < bridge> <louis> u won then
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but i dunno, i'd say there are more technical challenging jobs out there probs
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> matter of definition ig
21:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I had to move for it
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> deen has remote rust job
21:35 < bridge> <louis> move to murica
21:35 < bridge> <louis> good salaries
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> maybe when trump is dead xd
21:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that's true
21:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i returned to pc ****
21:38 < bridge> <Ewan> https://fluent2.microsoft.design/material
21:39 < bridge> <louis> oh nice
21:39 < bridge> <louis> gnome needs to step up their design im tired of mac and windows looking pretty
21:39 < bridge> <louis> actually i like the layout of everything as it is but its way too flat imo
21:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i feel like gtk pioneered the fat margin layout we have on all the desktop design languages now
21:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** gnome design is perfect
21:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wat u want @louis 
21:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** !!!
21:40 < bridge> <Ewan> yea i am a big fan but it could use some flavor
21:40 < bridge> <louis> idk like its just all grey and rounded rects
21:40 < bridge> <Ewan> and i really dislike how they are trying to make theming impossible
21:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** windows looks ass
21:40 < bridge> <louis> its ok to make theming hard but u gotta have a good default imo xd
21:40 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller if it was all consistent with their new design language it wouldn't
21:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the default is fire
21:41 < bridge> <louis> windows can be pretty imo. they have yet to theme a few more things but i like it
21:41 < bridge> <louis> and all the weekly desktop backgrounds are doing too much but otherwise its nice
21:41 < bridge> <louis> macos by far the prettiest though
21:42 < bridge> <louis> ChillerDragon: idk this just looks ugly. look how much boring grey rounded rects there are
21:42 < bridge> <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1413610340339679242/image.png?ex=68bc8eb8&is=68bb3d38&hm=2877e42252a28dfed3329bea32db8d8e8307521c44ce57b222616a3e15493819&
21:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so hot
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i hate all these shit task bars that enforce grouping
21:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** nice rice u got there
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I directly know that ppl that like that are no coders
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or have too much time in life
21:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @louis clean and simple
21:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and so sexy
21:44 < bridge> <louis> ye it is, i keep vanilla gnome just for ease of use, but idk with some extensions its a lot better (like w/ blurred background)
21:44 < bridge> <louis> havent u used macos ChillerDragon
21:45 < bridge> <louis> basically gnome but better visuals and worse keybinds
21:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** u used loads of macos
21:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i grew up with mac thinking its perfection
21:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but i converted to gnomer
21:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @louis u want this? xd
21:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2025/03/pearos.png
21:46 < bridge> <louis> temu macos
21:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
21:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:48 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
21:54 < bridge> <Assa> wdym loading times?
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> no
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> shit fps
21:58 < bridge> <Assa> fps beeing low? Can not reproduce, I mad graphs and benchmarks
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> there was a time where i had 10kfps on a lan server
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> now it's struggeling on 4k fps on a better cpu
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @essigautomat
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> here
21:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> try that and tell me your fps
21:59 < bridge> <Assa> @jupstar
21:59 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1413614573692649492/481302077-4b307037-6945-447f-8d4b-6b2a07a9b97f.png?ex=68bc92aa&is=68bb412a&hm=9e4127dcbb79effd0b6925f6bd30d2d6eee5d2353b4f0b28d17c50c4eff8a9b4&
22:00 < bridge> <Assa> normal benchmarks no entities vulkan
22:00 < bridge> <Assa> current master is almost at 19.3.nightly in this graph
22:01 < bridge> <Assa> I am not at home, can't compare until monday.
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> dein stats jucken mich net
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> geh auf server und zeig
22:02 < bridge> <Assa> ^
22:12 < bridge> <Assa> So you changed your setup? Go collect benchmarks on 19.1 and show me. "Better" cpu by what metric?
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yeah dunno what changed.. I think linux also got slower.
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But back in the days i had like 10k fps on lan server
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> all the stupid spectre things probs slowed stuff down too
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> just sad that i am further away from 1million fps
22:14 < bridge> <Assa> You could try my PR, but I guess you'd even get minimal less fps with it due to some overhead
22:14 < bridge> <Assa> You could try my quad cluster PR, but I guess you'd even get minimal less fps with it due to some overhead
22:15 < bridge> <Assa> You could try my quad cluster PR, but I guess you'd even get minimal less fps with it due to some overhead on ctf1
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> we skipping to 19.5? lol
22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> nightly is called like that already
22:18 < bridge> <Assa> xD
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> have we like changed some sdl stuff?
22:22 < bridge> <melon> so but we should.
22:22 < bridge> <melon> no but we should.
22:22 < bridge> <melon> no but we should.
22:22 < bridge> <melon> 
22:22 < bridge> <melon> sdl2-compat or sdl3 pls ty
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i benchmarked bit longer now
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1413620377023807630/image.png?ex=68bc9811&is=68bb4691&hm=b38c81a9d0348f53ba27735cc179954276f089ffbe6b4f63b4b52e0b75f497ef&
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> first 19.5 sucks
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then it gets faster
22:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I hate chat gee pee tee, it was making up shit for the last hour and I was believing it -.-
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's the real reality
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ours is simly wrong
22:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ours is simply wrong
22:23 < bridge> <learath2> I expect there is still very difficult work in embedded and kernel stuff
22:23 < bridge> <Assa> It has some setup time yeah
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but after connected?
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> do we AI the FPS now or what
22:24 < bridge> <kebscs> maybe skin loading
22:25 < bridge> <kebscs> not all are loaded at once
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but if i am alone on server too?
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or some cleanup tasks?
22:25 < bridge> <kebscs> then idk
22:25 < bridge> <learath2> Why would we ever want to use the broken ass cousin of sdl2 instead of just sdl2?
22:25 < bridge> <Assa> no then it should be fine
22:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki mr LLVM contributor send help.
22:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I have such a program in LLVM IR:
22:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```llvm
