20:20 <+o_be_two> hello
20:20 <@deen> hi o_be_two 
20:20 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #385: FIRST trim the name and THEN compare it to others ! (master...faking_bugfix) http://git.io/v0M0q
20:21 <+o_be_two> whatsup ?
20:22 <@deen> o_be_two: GER2 kills the serverstatus-client.py script in a weird way every night. it gets stuck in uninterruptible sleep and can't even be killed by kill -9
20:24 <+o_be_two> Oo
20:24 <+o_be_two> you run debian 8 ?
20:25 <@deen> o_be_two: i don't know, i just got access from EastByte and set it up
20:25 <@deen> debian 8.2 it says
20:26 <@EastByte> o_be_two: yes, that's the distribution I asked you to set up
20:27 <@EastByte> and iirc you also have it running on the hostsystem
20:37 <+o_be_two> yes the host is on debian 8 i think, let me check
20:38 <+o_be_two> yes debian 8
20:38 <+o_be_two> with LXC
20:39 <+o_be_two> ive switched all my vps to Debian 7 cause of what you said about systemd and lxc, EastByte 
20:39 <@EastByte> oh you did?
20:39 <+o_be_two> your problem could be linked to systemd no ?
20:40 <+o_be_two> yes i did, i was installing them so i havent got problem to do it again on a known environment
20:45 <@deen> ddnet servers are not connecting to master servers

20:47 <@deen> [5671bec8][register]: refreshing ip addresses
20:47 <@deen> and so on
20:47 <@deen> which is a bit strange, since master4 is running on GER
20:57 <+o_be_two> mhh i havent this issue with my ddnet servers ont same host
20:57 <+o_be_two> can you check connection, like if you can ping master4 ?
20:57 <+o_be_two> and telnet it ?
20:59 <@deen> yes, can ping it
21:00 <@deen> EastByte: might have sth to do with your firewall rules?
21:01 <+o_be_two> can you mtr it deen ?
21:01 <+o_be_two> (MyTraceRoute)
21:01 <@deen> yes
21:01 <+o_be_two> if master4 is your, can you do it from the other side ?
21:02 <@deen> master4 is GER^^
21:02 <@deen> it's the same server
21:02 <@deen> i'm not sure if the same issue appears on other servers, they seem to prefer master2
21:03 <+o_be_two> could be master4 to ger2 the issue :/
21:03 <@deen> no...
21:03 <@EastByte> deen: no firewall rules on it
21:04 <@deen> EastByte: well, the master server is clearly not working
21:04 <@deen> server number is -300 from yesterday
21:04 <@EastByte> oh you are talking about ger
21:04 <@deen> yes
21:05 <@EastByte> maybe it's just ip spoofing
21:05 <@deen> i don't see what ip spoofing can have to do with it
21:05 <@deen> since GER restarted last night the master server has been broken
21:06 <@EastByte> interesting
21:14 <@EastByte> I currently see 240 servers on master4
21:15 <@EastByte> 350*
21:45 <@EastByte> deen: I didn't think about dns, which was blocked
21:45 <@EastByte> so the servers probably couldn't resolve master4
21:46 <@EastByte> oh and another reboot happening at 01:00 CET :p
21:51 <+o_be_two> EastByte: reboot on ger2 ?
21:51 <@EastByte> force reboot on ger by nfoservers
21:52 <@EastByte> the second in 48 hours
21:52 <+o_be_two> oh :(
21:56 <@deen> EastByte: ok, that reboot will fix the problem with master server i assume
21:56 <@deen> "At approximately 01:00 CET, we plan to reboot the machine hosting your VDS, again, to try to fix a problem that started happening yesterday with the network adapter whereby it is dropping certain types of packets. This will lead to approximately 30-60 minutes of downtime again for the VDS."
22:04 <@deen> o_be_two: ddos on GER2
22:08 <+o_be_two> ok but what i can do ? you dont want any firewall ...
22:08 <@deen> well, rather it's using GER2 as a reflection attack
22:08 <@deen> i don't want any firewall?
22:08 <+o_be_two> yes you asked to disable all :/
22:08 < eeeee> ever seen a vps hoster that does live migrations when doing maintenance?
22:08 <@deen> i just told you that the firewall destroys all connections^^
22:08 <+o_be_two> oh ok
22:10 <+o_be_two> ddos has ended no ?
22:10 <@deen> no
22:10 <+o_be_two> 64 bytes from ger2.ddnet.tw (51.254.92.231): icmp_seq=1 ttl=59 time=0.557 ms
22:10 <@deen> they send 100 Mbit/s status packets from spoofed ips
22:10 <@deen> that created 1 Gbit/s outgoing traffic
22:10 <@deen> no one can play right now
22:11 <+o_be_two> 64 bytes from ger2.ddnet.tw (51.254.92.231): icmp_seq=1 ttl=55 time=93.1 ms
22:11 <+o_be_two> do its ddos on your app, not ont the connection
22:11 <@deen> sure, spoofed DoS
22:11 <@deen> but i can't exactly disallow status requests from random ips
22:11 <+o_be_two> ok, how i can help ?
22:12 <@deen> not at all i guess, i didn't ask for help
22:12 <@deen> I think I'll just shut down DDNet
22:12 <@deen> project has grown pretty stupid in many ways
22:14 < eeeee> yeah i was also curious about that, why would you host a master server when there's already more ddos than you are comfortable dealing with?
22:14 <+o_be_two> some players are stupid, but ddnet is good in any ways
22:14 <@deen> i don't think the master server was a big ddos target
22:15 <+o_be_two> yes it is
22:15 <@deen> o_be_two: well, not if you ask the players
22:15 <+o_be_two> 2 or 3 players already chatted : "i'll ddos master if you block me again"
22:15 <+o_be_two> cause they are angry, shut ddnet and you'll see "WHAT THE FUCK ? WHYYY :'("
22:16 <+o_be_two> everywhere you always have 1 to 5 % of stupid people
22:16 <@deen> o_be_two: many people tell me to shut down ddnet or otherwise they'll ddos the servers
22:16 <@deen> because ddnet destroys teeworlds, ddrace, etc
22:16 <+o_be_two> but DDNet is DDRace :/
22:16 <+o_be_two> on how it destroys TW ?
22:16 < eeeee> ddnet is teeworlds :P
22:16 <+o_be_two> oh i know why it destroys TW
22:17 <+o_be_two> cause if you filter by players, DDNet and r0x.fr are the only full servers
22:17 <+o_be_two> all other, normal servers, are empty
22:17 <+o_be_two> so it doesnt destroys TW, its just cause TW has to evolve ...
22:17 <+o_be_two> but TW owners just dont care about TW
22:18 < eeeee> yeah it's not like if you shut down ddnet all those racers and blockers would suddnely start playing dm and ctf
22:18 <+o_be_two> deen: why not doing a separated tw world ?
22:18 <+o_be_two> i mean, TW is opensource, now you're known, you can do it on your side
22:18 <@deen> o_be_two: because i've spent 2 years on this and gotten nothing in return, why should i put in more work?
22:18 <+o_be_two> you dont need TW base servers ..
22:18 <@deen> and we have 0 admins left at ddnet
22:19 <+o_be_two> team managing issue, could be resolved
22:19 <+o_be_two> its just a community problem, it happend every years everywhere
22:19 <@deen> i tried to resolve that for 6 months
22:20 <+o_be_two> what do you think ? Every years r0x.fr knows this too, not with 0 admins, just admins doesnt trust others admins anymore for nothing, just cause they dont understand, cause we dont communicate enough on what we do, just cause we dont understand together
22:20 <+o_be_two> 5 years i do this ... 5 YEARS !
22:21 <+o_be_two> yes i understand, sad to tell you that you havent to go deeper in community problems, do just what you like
22:21 <+o_be_two> btw eeeee knows this with ddwar
22:21 <+o_be_two> 2 days ago someone told me "DDWar was not so popular, it was too agressive" yes, but DDWar community was good afaik, cause the mind was what players wanted
22:31 < eeeee> can't really compare ddwar with ddnet. we only had like 2-3 admins and half a mapper.
22:32 <@deen> well, we had 1 admin and then 0^^
22:32 < eeeee> Tsin was also involved which also made things much harder
22:33 < eeeee> and we shut it down eventually coz didn't have time to manage the servers, coordinate the community and add features to the code all at once
22:35 <+o_be_two> deen: why they left ?
22:35 <@deen> o_be_two: internal struggles, hatred, too much work
22:36 <+o_be_two> well nobody earns money here, so the project has to be "cool", just a stuff we like to dos, "too mutch work" has not his place here, i think. Most admins have fun, most times they'll stay and do they're status
22:39 <+o_be_two> one of my olders admins is admin since 4 years, the next 3 year and 3 since 2 years, sure it's not the same, we don't code, but we configure and do a lot of stuff for the community. Our force is our communication, it's how we explain to players why all is not moving fast and community not growing mutch. Here, with TW ,it's harder cause the game is free, the community is young and there is many angry kids.
22:39 <+o_be_two> we can't really compare, i can't do better, DDNet for me is impressive, and i really think that we can found ways to just keep it funny
22:40 <+o_be_two> i'm not a real ddnet player, i'm a bloker player, and ? i participate to DDNet needs, not to the community, but i'm here. How a project that i don't play could interest someone like me ? That's the DDNet force
22:41 <+o_be_two> the transparent mind, no real secrets, who wants to know knows.
22:41 <+o_be_two> and the colateral help for other servers, like mine, for sure
22:42 <+o_be_two> deen: what your admins must do you think ? what kind of admin are you looking for actually ?
22:44 <@deen> o_be_two: many separate jobs, but we don't have people for any of them
22:44 <@deen> for example: keep in touch with the community, make sure the servers run properly, hold tournaments
22:46 <+o_be_two> instead of status.ddnet.tw, how you monitor DDNet ? You got mail on every problems ?
22:46 <@deen> not instead, but additionally i get emails, yes
22:47 <+o_be_two> keep in touch with community, what kind of touch ? writing news ? answering people ? Is the forum really active ?
22:49 <@deen> no idea how nfoservers does it, but they can block the spoofing attack
22:49 <+o_be_two> and with all these stuff, how your admins have fun ? I mean from my side they play and are able to do what they think is good for community. Errors are possible but its not the end, we are organized with community managers, game masters, project managers, moderators
22:49 <@deen> sorry, i don't understand your questions and their purpose
22:50 <+o_be_two> so if game master do a stupid thing or a thing that community is not happy with, a community manager will talk with players and do public writes for them, so the crisis is easy to handle and down
22:50 <+o_be_two> some admins just like to talk, others like technic ...
22:50 <@deen> yeah well, we have neither
22:51 <+o_be_two> i'm kind of admins that is always available for players, i like community mind
22:51 <+o_be_two> yes sure you have not admin actually :/
22:52 <+o_be_two> you can find the way, i'm pretty sure, to do a cool think with your staff
22:52 <+o_be_two> thing
22:52 <+o_be_two> (i'm thinking faster that i'm writing, it's terrible -_-)
22:53 <@deen> nope, there isn't always a solution
22:53 <@deen> even the admins tell me to shut down ddnet
22:53 <+o_be_two> yeah every years i got "r0x.fr will close :(" ...
22:54 <+o_be_two> and every year i add more things and do more stuff but without being more here, i just show that no, r0x.fr continue to exists and grow, that's all
22:55 <+o_be_two> did you told to the community that you are looking for people to be involved in DDNet ?
22:55 <+o_be_two> remember when you said "ok, we close DDNet, thanks all bye !"
22:56 <+o_be_two> it was terrible for players, but the worst is that you gave the idea of the end of DDNet to players, (instability is one of the worst things for the community :()
22:56 <@deen> o_be_two: yes, for 6 months
22:57 <+o_be_two> from what ive seen as a player (cause my only point of view is the player side) is "oh woaw ? How is it possible i didnt get this information BEFORE it was announced ? Why they dont asked to think together about this before ?)
22:57 <+o_be_two> and what is good in DDNet actually deen ?
22:58 <+o_be_two> do you want more hosts to host more servers and separate more ddos possibility (i do this, 3 hosts for just 10 servers, you know ?)
22:58 <@deen> i don't understand
22:58 <+o_be_two> and DDNet map designers are ok ? they do the job ? What about maps ?
22:59 <+o_be_two> i mean : see the cool side of DDNet, what is good ?
23:00 <+o_be_two> sometime, try to just be a player who's looking to have fun in playing a game, you like TeeWorld's, ok go play TW. Oh, there's ddrace, awesome, lets do a game. Ahah, its funny and fast, i like this, woaw DDnet seems to be really organized :o
23:00 <+o_be_two> that what you'll think as a player
23:00 <+o_be_two> and in the same time, internal mood is "oh DDNet doesnt work well, we will shutdown it soon, i've no admin".
23:01 <+o_be_two> What DDNet really needs ? You dont like to ban but did you know that showing that we have power to block bad players is the best way to get most of them more friendly ?
23:02 <+o_be_two> just need to be strict, to show "ok, you are a player, i do a lot of stuff for that, you can't just come and fuck all"
23:02 <+o_be_two> (its more a blocker problem i know)
23:03 <+o_be_two> (i talk about a lot of stuff at the same time i know :/)
23:06 <@deen> now USA down, Chile down, South Africa down
23:06 <+o_be_two> well i have to leave for now but ill see you tomorrow. There was a fire at my place and i have to answer police questions later :( ...
23:06 <+o_be_two> Broken stopped usa oO ?
23:06 <@deen> no, server problems or ddos attack
23:13 <+o_be_two> oh ... OVH is working on a DC for USA
