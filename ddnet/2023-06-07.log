08:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no nitro required for this one?
08:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> isnt it a ddnet emote?
08:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it is
08:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
08:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so no nitro
08:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> can I get one that requires nitro
08:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so I can try it out in the discord client
08:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> undefined

08:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i cant send

08:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> leak jupsti
08:55 < ws-client> <Jupstar> https://i.imgur.com/oFjzHfI.png

08:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah yes foko spammed some animated emotes
08:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am currently adding them
08:55 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> XDDDDDDD

08:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the exploding cat

08:57 <+bridge> <Ewan> Uh oh
08:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i have the feeling ryo starts to like c and c++
08:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Heinrichs first emote ever 😂
09:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ikr looks so odd to have some pepe in a heinrich message
09:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> daily bash screenshot
09:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1686121201.png
09:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> isnt that hot?
09:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> why u think that
09:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i just have to deal with some cpp at work
09:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> c enjoyer
09:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it wouldnt be a problem if the world was made in rust
09:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> doesnt webhook tell u ids
09:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> just automate it
09:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> be a real coder
09:07 <+bridge> <RustHater9000> it's not my fav
09:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u disapointed
09:07 <+bridge> <RustHater9000> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
09:10 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Poor chillerdragon got roasted
09:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> <a:aPES_RoastedPepe:596259843174563840>
09:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar checkout the pog catexplosion
09:12 <+ChillerDragon> @ryozuki does it? i dont see any ids here
09:12 <+ChillerDragon> also im not a real coder
09:13 <+ChillerDragon> im clearly procastinating on a js bloat which will be worse than weechat instead of working on 0.7 support
09:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can someone send pepeH again i somehow got the wrong id
09:27 < ws-client> <Jupstar> nice
09:32 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> :pepeH:
09:36 <+ChillerDragon> now send  \:pepeH: and send its id pls :)
09:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> :pepeH:
09:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> this is so much harder than it used to be
09:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> getting emoji id
09:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> 462735917006848020
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> thank
09:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh and poggers2 too pls .-.
09:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also do people use undefined ?
09:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> aaaaaaaaaaaa
09:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> poggers
09:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes they do
09:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ryo used poggers 314 times!
09:49 <+bridge> <Ewan> no emote spam 😿
09:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> where did I ghost-ping you?
09:59 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> idk, u asked smth
09:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> in this channel you mean?
09:59 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> i believe
09:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> Jupstar says no such thing happened on the IRC bridge
10:00 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> maybe another channel, idk
10:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so it sounds unlikely (I don't remember pinging you yesterday, but that doesn't rule it out)
10:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> also, I didn't mute you for ghost-pinging, but because I assumed a malicious intention
10:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I removed the mute once you clarified that you had non
10:01 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yes ik, but i swear i saw a ping on my phone
10:01 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> well
10:01 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> whatever, maybe discord was buggy and it was an old ping which i have seen already
10:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I also saw a DM ping from you
10:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> which didn't have a message
10:01 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> dm?
10:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so maybe discord messed up
10:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> direct message
10:01 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> i didnt dm u, i only ghost pinged u here in this channel after i thought u ghost pinged me
10:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
10:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> they have a channel to see deleted messages
10:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> worse than discord itself
10:02 < ws-client> <Jupstar> its like this bug in ddnet, where you get pinged by a completely different name undefined
10:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> imagine u leak smth by mistake
10:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I wonder if that's part of your discord data export
10:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> your deleted messages
10:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> to me its worse a "closer" entity such as ddnet stores the msg than discord itself
10:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> on discord im just one more grain in sand
10:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's used for moderation
10:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if you want the message deleted, ask an admin
10:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yeye security security
10:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> pretending that you can delete messages is maybe even more security by obscurity tbh
10:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar reloading the page should fix the :undefined:
10:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> there are probably third-party clients for discord that highlight the deleted messages
10:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i meant u do it for moderation = security
10:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my point is privacy
10:05 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> :joy:
10:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> often traded for this security
10:06 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hmmm, I'd think security often aligns with privacy, actually
10:06 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> take TLS for example
10:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> goverments remove pricacy in the name of security always
10:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can someone please send the ids for :poggers: and <:poggers2:46273591700684802> ? :)
10:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> poggers and poggers2
10:07 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> just install discord :^)
10:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they dont let me in
10:07 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> pause your VPN
10:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> this chat is turninf boring
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they block vpn tor
10:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its just chiller asking stupid ids
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and even private browser sessions
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki yes thats why we need another bridge
10:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> go to public bib and login there
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for stuff like that
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> to get a fakin emote id!?
10:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no
10:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> just use irc
10:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i want irc with emotes!
10:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> why don't you want to use matrix?
10:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its so bad
10:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> slow
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bugged
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ugly
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> spyware
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> centralized
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> china controlled
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> broken
10:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> a friendly reminder that #6715 still isnt merged, which makes my heart bleed even if i cant play ddnet rn
10:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> there's more than one matrix client
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> applies to all
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gomuks is kinda niceish
10:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> centralized? china controlled?
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but nothing competes with irc
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok china controlled was half meming xd
10:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but its such a bloat and everyone is using matrix.org
10:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> spyware?
10:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> als half meming xd
10:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, the centralization is bad
10:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> does our bridge also go to matrix?
10:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> does our bridge also go to matrix.org?
10:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
10:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm
10:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I thought Zwelf wanted to do away with that at some poin
10:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> t
10:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its so bad its not functional as a chat
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats probably why nothing happens
10:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, because of delay?
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not only delay
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> major bugs 
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> message order is random
10:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> client bugs or server bugs?
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> feels like both
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> element is really bad for sure
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but also on weechat
10:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because client bugs could be worked around by using a different client
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its no fun
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> weechat irc vs weechat matrix is worlds
10:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> one is fun other is literal pain
10:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> matrix is so bloated
10:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i never tried but im sure setting up a irc server can be done in 10s and 100 lines of python while matrix is a whole pain
10:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I mean we could try bridging to XMPP I suppose
10:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats also why irc is so much more federated
10:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and thats probably why zwelf is not touching the shit
10:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and thats why u dont bridge more
10:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and thats why i have to spam a developer channel with offtopc
10:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> irc is not federated
10:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its self hostes
10:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> like teamspeak era
10:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> eh yea
10:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watever
10:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
10:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> or mumble
10:14 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's a bit different from these
10:14 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because it's a network of servers working together
10:14 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but a closed network
10:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is it tho?
10:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is no cross network communication is there?
10:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no
10:15 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes/no
10:15 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> quakenet is a network of interoperating IRC servers
10:15 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> like libera
10:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh
10:15 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but you can't go from one network to another
10:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> netsplit memes
10:15 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsplit
10:15 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> indeed
11:16 <+bridge> <learath2> irc was the peak of human communication, we need to devolve
11:18 <+bridge> <ReiTW> back to monkey
11:54 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> yes there are a lot of those
11:54 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> not allowed though
11:55 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> pretty sure there are also clients that can see hidden channels names
11:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, although that's just discord's fault
11:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> for providing access to these names
12:03 <+bridge> <k0rae> hello, im trying to compile ddnet server on wsl, getting this error: https://pastebin.com/LgH0L4GC
12:03 <+bridge> <k0rae> can someone help me please?
12:04 <+bridge> <k0rae> (i reverted the commits to the point where there was no rust in ddnet)
12:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds like you need to link to some libz
12:05 <+bridge> <Iza> They state that deleted content, will not appear in the data export
12:06 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
12:14 <+bridge> <k0rae> not relevant. fixed the issue
12:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ you can now autocomplete emotes with : and tab
12:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:poggers2:46273591700684802>
12:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah shit nobody sent poggers2 yet so it broken xd
12:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but we have new nice tee emotes like <:bluekitty:34668349791980748>
12:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh wow also broken xd
12:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its cuz
12:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u dont rly have perms to use it
12:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u probs get a timespan
12:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> when someone uses it
12:24 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hm, yesterday it worked
12:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> timespan
12:24 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's also not how it on IRC looked when it worked
12:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :bluekitty:
12:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> try now
12:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im sure they did it that way
12:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> so webhooks can "react" to a message properly
12:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> with emotes
12:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> oh actually
12:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but they cant use them freely
12:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> looks lik you're right
12:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> looking at IRC
12:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd guess it's not a timeout though
12:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but rather "does the discord client already have this loaded?"
12:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but rather "does the discord client already have this cached?"
12:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:bluekitty:34668349791980748>
12:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> doesnt show?
12:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no
12:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omagawd
12:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> at least that's how it works for @ mentions that aren't in the channel
12:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what about <:kek:623709640789852179>
12:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if the discord client has it cached, it shows
12:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> otherwise not
12:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> \:bluekitty:
12:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> did the id change
12:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ws-client │ <ChillerDragon> :bluekitty:
12:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh
12:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> discord changes it xd
12:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> so chiller
12:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it did change
12:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the id of the emote hcanges
12:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> changes
12:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> deal with it xd

12:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> we send bluekitty
12:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> \:bluekitty:
12:28 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> missing 8 at the end
12:28 <+ChillerDragon> ye probably typo
12:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 346683497919807488

12:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because I wanna see if I can write an emoji using the discord client
12:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that I shouldn't be able to write
12:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> \:NekoDrink:

12:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:30 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but only until the server sent it back to me I guess
12:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> top5 discord emote exploits
12:30 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so can't do it from the normal discord client
12:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> well the point is for others to see them

12:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ye sux
12:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can you just bridge me offtopic pleaseß
12:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lets talk about how good C is

12:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am banned
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i cant open it in tor
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i cant open it in incognito
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they banned my old main
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just take 2min and bridge #off-topic plsplspls
12:39 <+bridge> <learath2> What did you do to get banned on discord? There are literal servers full of criminal activity not banned
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i didnt do shit
12:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u used tui discord right
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe that
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or tor
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or incognito idk
12:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they autoban every account that doesnt leak social security number
13:00 <+ChillerDragon> i just found the slowest loading webpage on the internet https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html
13:05 <+bridge> <learath2> @ryozuki do you still have your other libera account?
13:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i pinged u on libera
13:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> idk what other  acc u mean
13:06 <+bridge> <learath2> You used to have one called `Ryozuki`
13:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hmm tbh idk
13:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im using edg-l now xd
13:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think i was op right
13:07 <+bridge> <learath2> Then I'll just remove the old one from ChanServ and op you on this one
13:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ok
13:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> was it me who founded the channel?
13:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i forgor
13:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> Channel created on Wed, 19 May 2021 16:59:39
13:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> time flies
13:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> i also got banned on Discord for violating TOS
13:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> They didn’t elaborate but i was using other clients
13:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> 2016 acc :( if i had it i could have @ewan
13:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 2016 is not that old
13:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im said it says i joined ddnet dc in 2020
13:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cuz bans
13:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but i joined first day
13:09 <+bridge> <learath2> Gave you +o on ChanServ, you can ask ChanServ for op when you need it, or if you prefer auto op, you can ask it for +O
13:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ok thanks
13:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im interested tho
13:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> in knowing if it was me who joined first
13:10 <+bridge> <learath2> It was either you or me, I'm not sure of the order, I can check my irc logs latr
13:11 <+bridge> <learath2> It was you who registered the channel first though, that I know

13:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> am i doing this wrong
13:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> give me founder :p
13:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ah i had to give op via chanserv first
13:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> still cant give +O
13:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:17 <+bridge> <learath2> Try again?
13:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> worked
13:18 <+bridge> <learath2> Can you grant yourself +v?
13:18 <+bridge> <learath2> Just curious how the access control works
13:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> whats f?
13:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i always found it hard to keep up with all the flags
13:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ChanServ (ChanServ@services.libera.chat): You are not authorized to perform this operation.
13:20 <+bridge> <learath2> These are very network specific. +f allows you to set ACL
13:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it worked now
13:21 <+bridge> <learath2> No, I added +v
13:22 <+bridge> <learath2> We should revive irc
13:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> true
13:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> join #edlang
13:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the future language
13:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> @learath2 chillerdragon hasn't been banned
13:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> he's required to provide a phone number to discord
13:49 <+bridge> <learath2> Just get a prepaid sim, what is it, like 5€?
13:50 <+bridge> <learath2> Or just give them your number. Let's not pretend they aready know the color of your underwear at any given time from some ai speech pattern analysis
13:50 <+bridge> <learath2> Or just give them your number. Let's not pretend, they already know the color of your underwear at any given time from some ai speech pattern analysis
13:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i refuse to use a chat app that requires a phone number
13:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oh, good thing I haven't had that yet
13:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I can see that
13:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i also do not understand why you guys put up with that
13:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> BCS I'd refuse that too
13:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I put up with that because it's where all the gaming people are
13:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Phone numbers are bloat 😂
13:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> also, I have this nice phone number service ^^
13:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bridges would also work
13:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt refuse because i had to blend it into society a bit
13:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not worth it
13:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> discord went way too far
13:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> their tos is so fucked up
13:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its worth it cuz i can talk to ppl i know
13:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its a lost battle sadly
13:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> convenience seems to always win
13:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> over whats correct
13:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok but then give the people who want to use irc at least 1 more channel
13:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ppl dont even spam like u in offtopic
13:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
13:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but better in offtopic than here right?
13:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> telling me to get discord is just fucked up
13:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> idk
13:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im no admin
13:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm willing to give you a working discord account, if you want to
13:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks for the offer
13:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> other than that, I'd also like to see a matrix bridge
13:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i really do not want to use discord
13:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I can ask Zwelf how that's going
13:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its 2 step process
13:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you clikc like 1 button
13:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> send 1 message
13:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and done
13:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> irc is more effort you have to write like full 4 lines of config
14:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can we get irc without matrix i do not see how one depends on the other?
14:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so this can become a developer channel again and not a chillerdragon spam channel 
14:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I see more worth in matrix than in IRC for this
14:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> matrix maps better cuz multiple channels
14:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no?
14:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but irc is a better protocol
14:01 <+bridge> <Simon'> so i study business informatics, and im having my break and sitting in one of the conference rooms while some other guys have a lecture about heritage sites. They are literally talking about fucking TREES while im optimizing forecasts with time series analysis on some Database
14:01 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yall still discussing about irc ....
14:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i refuse to use matrix on my desktop
14:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes heinrich refuses to bridge another channel
14:01 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> you refuse to use anything anyways
14:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for whatever reason
14:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> no google no discord no matrix on desktop
14:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> trees are related to programming
14:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> we love  trees
14:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> red black trees
14:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 🌳
14:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon let me guess, you have an iphone?
14:02 <+bridge> <Simon'> yea not that kind of trees
14:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
14:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> predictable
14:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 is it too much effort or whats holding you back?
14:03 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> what kinda bridge do you even need
14:03 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> dont you have enugh
14:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> he wants offtopic to not spam here
14:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have one channel
14:03 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> with 100 bridges tho
14:03 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
14:04 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> but ye i see
14:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can ever only write in this very channel
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh wait no i have two
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the other is #teeworlds
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i rather not spam there
14:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i thin heinrich hesitates cuz only devs rly check this channel (or care?)
14:04 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> what about... getting back to discord
14:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and u will be exposed to normans
14:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> they will be scared
14:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> kek
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut not an option
14:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, effort I'd rather spend on matrix first
14:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki lol then create dev-spam xd
14:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> matrix takes no effort
14:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its the simplest bridging process possible
14:05 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> this is so extra
14:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut yea i also would prefer if we all together move to a better chat platform
14:06 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> you need a channel for reports too?
14:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what reports?
14:06 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ingame reports
14:06 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> when somebody is bloxxing
14:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can use this channel for reports
14:06 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> not really, thats why the reports channel exists
14:06 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> oh, btw, u dont have the bugs channel either, u cant discuss on bugs that are being talked about there
14:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 @learath2 does a "unexposed type" sound familiar to u?
14:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cpp stuff
14:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> haven't heard about that
14:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes thats sad and all but i can not demand to mimic all discord channels on irc. So one additional channel for spamming offtopic would already go a long way
14:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> clang::TypeKind
14:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> Unexposed = 1 // size = 4, align = 0x4
14:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> A type whose specific kind is not exposed via this interface.
14:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> maybe its clang impl specific
14:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ohh
14:30 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> via this interface
14:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its a type clang doesnt recognize itself
14:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my bad
14:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> !jup using blockchain and ai i figured out a high percentage of the webchat user base would like a joy emote

14:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its now here :joy:
14:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar> 😂
14:51 < ws-client> <opsidragon> forgot to deploy :joy:
14:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar> finally
14:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar> now i dont need to use emojis anymore
14:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> ah and :j tab works too
14:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar> 😂
14:54 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> :troll:
14:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> it's funny that this is now, except multilines, an actually well usable chat client xD
14:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> now rewrite in rust
15:37 <+ChillerDragon> oof
15:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> <:rust:920765596289880074>
15:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> <:rust:920765596289880074>
15:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> !c if i press tab and no other completion will fit, it should close the : automatically
15:39 < chillerbot1> ChillerDragon
15:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> yea ik but then tabbing through breaks because it tabs from last : it finds so i gotta put some brain into how the whole autocomplete is done
15:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar> drain_filter. another useful nightly feature 😂
16:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> itertools
16:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ok wait itertools doesnt have it

17:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> imagine flexing ur product has 5000 patents?
17:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> weird flex
17:23 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's indeed weird
17:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 this reminded me of arithmetic coding
17:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and u saying in europe ucannot paten algorithms
17:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but u can patent techniques used to implement algorithms
17:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > Techniques covered by patents may be essential for implementing the algorithms for arithmetic coding that are specified in some formal international standards.
17:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > When this is the case, such patents are generally available for licensing under what is called "reasonable and non-discriminatory" (RAND) licensing terms (at least as a matter of standards-committee policy).
17:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> or idk
17:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i just read the wiki xD
17:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://cohenarthur.github.io/2023/06/05/rust-derives.html
17:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/rust-binary-analysis-feature-by-feature/
17:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sadly it says only for Vec ;~;
17:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but nvm, i did it the oldschool way 😂
17:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
17:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "Hi ppl we want a world that we control, and you are the losers"
17:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the funny thing about apple is, that they never invented anything lmao
17:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they just make existing stuff better and/or marketing
17:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> source?
17:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hmm well i assumed it
17:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> fro mreading the wiki
17:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> about patents in arithmetic coding
17:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_coding#History_and_patents>
17:42 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that seems to talk about US patents
17:42 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ah ye
17:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> this blog post is extremely interesting
17:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > When starting out reverse-engineering C binaries, one will inevitably run across a very similar experience dealing with their first serious struct. The flow of data does not seem to make sense, then after some web searching and deep thought there’s the lightbulb moment. 344 iterations of this later, it’s become second nature: you see mov rcx, [rdx+0x12] and say “oh ok, here we go again”, and go look for the allocation size and reach for t
17:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> apparently rust is harder to reverse engineer than c or c++
17:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah nice ryo is back
17:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> almost overread it
17:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rust has a more pervasive use of the stack, the strings dont end with null, etc
17:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, C is 'closer to the metal' here
17:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> go/rust are more annoying to reverse engineer
17:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 71min read  btw
17:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's why we have gpt
17:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nah
17:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to read it in 2 min
17:51 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds like an interesting article indeed, thanks @ryozuki

19:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 im seeing u in #c
19:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> quoting the holy bible
19:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
19:33 <+bridge> <learath2> :Prayge:
19:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the bot doesnt hotline to the section tho
19:34 <+bridge> <learath2> it used to, I wonder what happened to it
19:50 <+bridge> <Chairn> @learath2 https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/14348po/happy_children/
20:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @deen do u know if haskell is notably harder to reverse engineer? like rust
20:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> that article explains how he find the enum optimizations
20:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> kinda fun
20:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> if a type e.g cant possibly use  the value 4, the compiler will use it as a tag for that variant
20:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> this must be a nigmare to reverse
20:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> haskell is definitely even more annoying
20:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nightmare
20:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it has these thunks everywhere
20:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> all¹ values are lazy
20:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i see xD
20:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ¹there are escape hatches
20:14 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that means all variables you see in the code are rather function pointers that will compute the value one more step
20:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oof
20:14 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> only when you're pattern matching a variable, it needs to be computed one more step
20:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> now i wonder  why malware devs use c and not rust or haskell
20:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> esp if u want ur malware to be hard to reverse
20:15 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm
20:15 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure if that's one of the main goals
20:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hmm maybe the malware has secrets u dont wanna be found out
20:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think its an actual issue
20:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> in military for example
20:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u want the malware to expread
20:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but u dont want other actors to reverse it
20:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and use it themselves
20:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> staying under the radar seems more important for that
20:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i guess, but never say never xd
20:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> once you're found out, it's basically game over
20:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> there's e.g. also other methods to find out what code does
20:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you can try executing it and see what it does
20:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think it may still be rly hard to know exactly
20:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> unless u reverse it
20:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> specially in malware, where obscure things are the norm xd
20:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think it may still be rly hard to know exactly **what it does**
20:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> idk why i put that bold xd

20:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> for chairn <https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/1439oni/qoura_at_its_finest/>
20:29 <+bridge> <Chairn> yeah saw it
20:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06004-9
20:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > lphaDev discovers new, state-of-the-art sorting algorithms from scratch that have been incorporated into the LLVM C++ library, used by millions of developers and applications around the world23,24,25. Both AlphaDev and stochastic search are powerful algorithms. An interesting direction for future research is to investigate combining these algorithms together to realize the complementary advantages of both approaches.
20:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Voxel look
20:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ai coming for devs
20:41 <+bridge> <Voxel> 🗣️
20:42 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
20:42 <+bridge> <ryozuki> just skimmed but looks legit
20:42 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and they use the algo on llvm
20:52 <+bridge> <Voxel> i wonder if it will break ddnet
20:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lol no
20:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but we could use the algo
20:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its for sorting
20:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> sorting is used everywhere
21:09 <+bridge> <Chairn> feels weird, the algo they present are kinda simple, sort on 2,3 and 4 variables
21:10 <+bridge> <Chairn> im doubtful anybody hasn't found anything better, probably because people are more interested in the general case
21:11 <+bridge> <Chairn> would be interesting to see their work applied on array of varying length
21:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> reading the hn comments, they did not find another algorithm
21:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> they optimized the code for small array sizes
