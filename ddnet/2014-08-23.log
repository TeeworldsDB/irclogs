12:42 < Savander> hi
13:23 < _KinG> hi all
13:23 < _KinG> hi deen 
14:04 < EastByte> wasteland is a waste of time
14:04 < EastByte> https://eastbit.net/public/videos/wastelands.webm
14:33 < laxa> EastByte: that's what happens when you let noobs do the parts xD.
14:36 < EastByte> I think all of use was there for the first time
14:36 < EastByte> I couldn't do it better :P
15:01 <@deen> hi
15:02 <@deen> EastByte: haha
15:03 < Savander> EastByte:  Lool haha ;P :D
15:14 < EastByte> hi deen, Savander, laxa 
15:14 < laxa> Hi.
15:15 < EastByte> "def- closed this a day ago"
15:16 < EastByte> so autorecording works?
15:16 < laxa> no
15:16 < laxa> Well
15:16 < laxa> I don't know.
15:16 < EastByte> deen: what happens with the demo if you don't finish the race?
15:16 < laxa> Well
15:16 <@deen> EastByte: it gets deleted!
15:16 < laxa> Autorecord should record everything no matter what.
15:16 <@deen> when you close the client
15:16 <@deen> autorecord?
15:16 < EastByte> laxa: +1
15:16 < laxa> Yeah
15:17 <@deen> you mean the non-ddrace autorecord?
15:17 < laxa> I think so.
15:17 < laxa> Demo record is a ddrace feature
15:17 < laxa> autorecord not ?
15:17 <@deen> yeah
15:17 <@deen> i never used autorecord
15:17 < EastByte> I have race record disabled
15:17 <@deen> no idea what it does or how it works!
15:17 < EastByte> well it records everything
15:18 < laxa> I use both
15:18 < laxa> both are broken afaik
15:18 <@deen> if you use them at the same time
15:18 < EastByte> maybe because of that^ 
15:18 <@deen> they can definitely not work
15:18 <@deen> you can use one or the other
15:18 < laxa> deen: well they should...
15:18 <@deen> i think one is for recording vanilla games
15:18 <@deen> the other for ddrace games
15:19 < EastByte> I don't like the idea of recording from start line to finish
15:20 <@deen> so what does autorecord do?
15:20 < EastByte> I think it records up to the round end and restarts then
15:20 < EastByte> which might be buggy in ddrace ofcourse
15:21 < EastByte> but atleast I have everything recorded
15:21 <@deen> EastByte: so you get 1 big file of everything you play on each map?
15:21 < EastByte> yes
15:21 < EastByte> I have over thousand demo files in my folder
15:21 <@deen> ok
15:21 < EastByte> at some point I will analyse them automaticaly :D
15:22 <@deen> all i record is the chat^^
15:22 < EastByte> lel
15:22 <@deen> logfile
15:22 < EastByte> ya
15:23 <@deen> so what is broken now?
15:23 <@deen> only that you can't do both kinds of records at the same time?
15:23 < laxa> autorecord doesn't always autorecord faik.
15:23 < EastByte> I guess we don't know
15:23 < laxa> deen: it should work
15:23 <@deen> laxa: when does it not autorecord for example?
15:24 < laxa> autorecord save as autorecord while ddrace record save as map_tmp
15:24 < laxa> deen: hehe, I have no clue lol :(.
15:24 <@deen> laxa: when you use both it does not work
15:24 < laxa> I use both, it works sometimes, sometimes not...
15:24 <@deen> laxa: of course...
15:24 <@deen> laxa: so, want to fix it?
15:25 < laxa> Yeah if possible
15:25 <@deen> ok, good luck
15:25 < EastByte> xd
15:25 <@deen> you'll have to make two recorders
15:25 <@deen> right now there is only 1 i think
15:25 < EastByte> ^ was thinking about that
15:27 < EastByte> btw. I'm too lazy to add a save dialog for the demo slicing, so the pullrequest might take a bit :D
15:28 <@deen> EastByte: meh
15:29 < EastByte> deen: I need my time
15:29 < EastByte> on wasteland
15:32 <@deen> good luck!
15:32 < EastByte> :D

15:47 < Savander> how to update repo

16:22 < Savander> :/
17:39 < EastByte> deen: https://eastbit.net/priv/userfriendly.webm
17:40 < EastByte> tw gui dev keeps being hard
17:40 < EastByte> oh I forgot to set the title
17:47 <@deen> EastByte: yeah =/
17:53 < EastByte> sooo how do I do a pullrequest
17:53 < EastByte> github got different again
17:53 < EastByte> do I have to update my 'demoslice' branch to the DDRace64 head?
17:55 <@deen> ehm
17:56 <@deen> i guess?
17:56 <@deen> usually you would fork ddnet
17:56 <@deen> and branch DDRace64
17:56 < EastByte> yep I did
17:56 <@deen> and push your new branch with the changes
17:56 <@deen> and then create a pullrequest in the webinterface
18:00 < EastByte> ahh, updated it, also needed to fix a conflict and now github says "Able to merge."
18:01 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east opened pull request #10: Extended demo player features (DDRace64...demoslice) http://git.io/IAxEwg
18:01 < EastByte> yay
18:15 <@deen> gotta win this ictf game first
18:36 <@deen> seems to work!
18:36 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #10: Extended demo player features (DDRace64...demoslice) http://git.io/IAxEwg
18:36 <@deen> Thanks EastByte 
18:37 < EastByte> I love to support ddnet :)
18:38 <@deen> but sharing demos is still difficult
18:38 <@deen> not sure if many do that
18:38 <@deen> afk
18:39 < EastByte> yep
18:39 < EastByte> if there would be a demo database online we also could add a sharing feature
20:18 < laxa> I already asked deen to make a demo upload feature for ddnet !
20:18 < laxa> But a demo database seems nice too !
20:56 < EastByte> well once I wanted to build a webgl demo player
20:56 < EastByte> that would be the perfect base for a database
21:05 <@deen> indeed
21:10 < EastByte> deen: still need to fix a bug (you can't overwrite the own demo file because that would be read/write at the same time)
21:11 < EastByte> I whish CStorage would have a "write to memory" feature
21:11 < EastByte> to create a virtual file
21:12 <@deen> EastByte: hm, yeah =/
21:13 < laxa> EastByte: I know someone who wanted to make such a thing too.
21:14 < EastByte> yes?
21:14 < laxa> Yes ! :D
21:14 < EastByte> btw. there was a client with such a feature
21:14 < EastByte> forgot the name
