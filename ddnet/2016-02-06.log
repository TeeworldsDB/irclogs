22:32 < derp_> :3
23:02 < Hamid_Jigool> hello my friends
23:02 < Hamid_Jigool> i have a problem
23:02 < Hamid_Jigool> in my DDnet SQL server /points not work and say to me that i have not any points so far
23:03 < Hamid_Jigool> in act i finished 24 maps
23:03 < Hamid_Jigool> but /points say to me that i have not any points
23:04 < Hamid_Jigool> any command or configuration is for that ti fix?
23:04 <@deen> you have to insert maps manually or with a script in the record_maps table
23:04 <@deen> then the points are calculated. i would recommend against using points
23:04 <@deen> it's really just written for the official ddnet servers and not that easy to set up
23:05 < Hamid_Jigool> ow... so i have to create many row in this table
23:05 <@deen> right
23:05 < Hamid_Jigool> any stable sql file in DDnet Script in Github?
23:06 < Hamid_Jigool> or not
23:06 <@deen> sql files are here: http://ddnet.tw/stats/
23:07 <@deen> but it includes all ranks that were ever made on ddnet
23:07 < Hamid_Jigool> its ok
23:07 < Hamid_Jigool> its realy good
23:07 < Hamid_Jigool> thanks for that
23:07 <@deen> that's the script we use: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/update-points.py
23:10 < Hamid_Jigool> all ddnet maps are update per day in github?
23:10 <@deen> yes
23:10 < Hamid_Jigool> this is good... imust check new maps for my intranet server
23:11 <@deen> hm, wait, this is updated daily: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps
23:11 <@deen> ddnet-scripts isn't
23:11 < Hamid_Jigool> i know... thanks
