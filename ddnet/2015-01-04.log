00:26 < eeeee> js client getting OOM errors because some maps have like a dozen layers
00:27 < eeeee> and while each layer is only a few kb when compressed, they are stored uncompressed in memory and take up over 3 mb each
00:28 <@deen> yeah
00:29 <@deen> you could leave out the non-visible layers, entities won't work then
00:29 < eeeee> i'm wondering if it would be hard to just render from compressed data
00:29 <@deen> oh yes, i wanted to do that once
00:30 <@deen> (mostly for the server though)
00:30 <@deen> would be really really nice if you can get that working
00:30 <@deen> the format they're in is not good for that btw
00:31 <@deen> i looked for other compressed data formats with O(1) access
00:31 <@deen> most layers are just 0s everywhere, so something sparse might be good
00:34 < eeeee> yeah rendering would probably be easy to do since it just does sequential access
00:34 < eeeee> but then i'd also have to deal with collision which does random access :/
00:35 < eeeee> oh however for collision i'd only have to consider the game layer i guess
00:35 <@deen> yes
00:35 < eeeee> can just leave that as is
00:35 <@deen> yep
00:35 <@deen> better for performance as well
03:03 < eeeee> okay got sth working
03:03 < eeeee> renders fine and mem usage got down to 27mb from 58mb on Kobra.map
03:07 < eeeee> s/27mb/24mb :>
03:21 <@deen> How?!
03:21 <@deen> (need it for the real client (and maybe server))
03:22 < eeeee> would be useless for server
03:23 < eeeee> i just store the tilemap rle encoded and seek for each row in the stream
03:23 < eeeee> seems to be fast enough
03:24 <@deen> nice
03:24 <@deen> but could be slow on really big maps
03:24 <@deen> Kobra maps are very bad tests for this because you start in the top left corner
03:24 <@deen> game shouldn't slow down once you get to bottom right corner^^
03:25 <@deen> ah, "for each row"
03:26 < eeeee> guess i could add a row index or sth
03:26 < eeeee> just in case
07:14 < RafaelFF> Hi deen. are you there?
10:56 <@EastByte> deen: I did more reverse engineering on the zclient
11:49 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
11:50 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
12:33 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
12:34 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
12:41 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
12:42 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
12:50 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
12:51 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
12:57 <@deen> EastByte: oh? found anything out?
12:57 <@EastByte> yea
12:58 <@EastByte> it allows to execute client cmds via mastersrv
12:58 <@deen> wow...
12:58 <@EastByte> and the sourceport to the mastersrv is the same as ingame
12:59 <@deen> And those are the guys who say they made their client because ddnet has bots inside...
12:59 <@EastByte> the by spoofing their mastersrv ip you can kill all clients :)
12:59 <@deen> not bots, malware*
12:59 <@EastByte> ...
12:59 <@EastByte> I made great progress with IDA :)
13:00 <@EastByte> I compiled ddnet with dbg symbols and made a diff between ddnet and zclient using an IDA plugin
13:00 <@deen> what's IDA?
13:00 <@EastByte> easy to reverse engineer now :)
13:00 <@EastByte> a disasembler
13:00 <@EastByte> reversing tool
13:00 <@deen> should make the clients say funny things instead
13:00 <@deen> or reverse a and d
13:01 <@EastByte> :D
13:01 <@EastByte> well looks like they lost their mastersrv
13:01 <@EastByte> and I think they couldn't keep it up because of ddos attacks
13:01 < Muttley_> xD
13:01 <@EastByte> (the ip is hardcoded btw)
13:01 <@deen> haha
13:02 <@EastByte> afk
13:02 <@deen> nice work
13:07 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
13:08 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
15:48 < Nealson> hiiiiiiiiiii deen
17:05 < Nimda> Website went down!
19:01 < hannibal> hey
19:02 < hannibal> deen: are you here? :)
19:04 < hannibal> guess not then.. :o
19:06 < hannibal> listen, i've built a map and sent it to lady saavik to have it tested. it's finished now and we'd love to see it released. could you get in touch with her or me ? :) ty
19:06 < hannibal> &bb
19:13 <@deen> that's what the forum is for
19:20 < Nimda> Cross by hannibal just released on Moderate at 2015-01-04 19:19
20:58 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
20:59 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
22:15 < Muttley> Hmm well german server is badd atm
22:38 < Learath2> deen: cant seem to get my hand on a linux machine with a screen so can't test it there but i fixed whatever was reported here
22:38 <@deen> ok
22:38 <@deen> Muttley: why?
22:46 <@deen> Just spent multiple days trying to fix Nim's epoll code. Should finally be fixed...
22:58 <@deen> and in the end the fix was totally trivial...
