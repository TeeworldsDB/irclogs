10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut I guess you've seen this issue before? https://old.reddit.com/r/teeworlds/comments/frygdp/how_do_i_leave_spectate_mode/
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stackoverflow got dark mode
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it should be illegal to host a website without dark mode
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:

12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 were can i find an example of a fwcheck packet
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess in masterserver source code xd
12:46 <@Learath2> well it's not a very interesting packet, but yeah either the register code on the server or mastersrv.cpp would make it obvious
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> SERVERBROWSE_FWCHECK
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> found it
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i already got support to register ipv4 and ipv6 and relate them to same sv
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just gotta do the fwcheck
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 the client requests servers from all masterservers or just 1 that sends all?
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my guess is that it requests from all, but wouldnt it be good that 1 can also send all servers?
13:17 <@Learath2> just one
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen the issue is, that vanilla 0.7.4 clients have a commanf system, but the master has am updated one by Learath. DDNet7 and my F-Client are using the new system already, which means vanilla 0.7.4 is bugged at the moment. There is still the old, cl_say chat command system, which can be used with vanilla client. To use it, you have to press ESC before sending the message
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> just downgrade to 0.7.2 and all works fine ðŸ˜„
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> debian ftw
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> just downgrade to 0.6 and all works fine**
