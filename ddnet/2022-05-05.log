00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dr.Funmanteddy> we being ddosed?
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dr.Funmanteddy> why ddos usa
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes, all servers
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Reboot does not help against DoS attacks
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dr.Funmanteddy> doesnt vali like ddrace
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dr.Funmanteddy> why is he trying to kill it
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dr.Funmanteddy> whats up with that
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> he likes to ddos when he's not playing i guess
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <thekid36> Nothing we can do against dos? Not playing a lot recently..but in the past couple of weeks when I join I always had  little lags in ger2 and Fra..I tried like japan and usa, they look fine, except for the usual 300ms lag.
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <thekid36> 
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <thekid36> Wanted to add that tonight (around 11:30/midnight) I couldn't see RUS servers..is that normal?
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <thekid36> 
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <thekid36> Another, maybe uncorrelated, but some gores server doesn't have problems when I experience the lag on ddnet servers in ger2 and fra
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes, normal during DoS
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Gores is hosted by KoG, unrelated to us, no idea what their situation is
00:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > Wanted to add that tonight (around 11:30/midnight) I couldn't see RUS servers..is that normal?
00:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that might have been caused by me fiddling around with the master servers
00:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> after finishing that, the master server list should become more stable
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <thekid36> Alright, so we just pray and hope that one day this will stop xd
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <thekid36> 
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <thekid36> I read some months ago about some of the server has ddos protection...is that a thing? Is it because the dos come from players, and the protection is useless?
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <thekid36> If there is some hope for a solution we should really try it...this is pretty annoying ðŸ˜¢
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dr.Funmanteddy> it is a thing but not practical
07:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> We have to wait till vali finally gets his contract job signed at mcdonalds as a cleaner :pepoBagar:
07:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> As he can't do anything else of his shitty life
08:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bold of u to assume he has to work
08:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> probably his family provides him
08:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hot girl> bold of u to assume he has a family
10:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://copy.sh/v86/
10:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this looks amazing
10:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can use arch linux in the browser
10:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/copy/v86
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Erik451> @thekid36 there is no data in this tables, the server is running
12:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Erik451> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/971720727302668308/20220505_122919.jpg
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you finish the map yet?
12:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's only data if you do some ranks
12:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> please do something about this annoying sounds
12:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 1- jetpack sound so high Compared all sounds
12:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 2-this sound when you stay between weapon and shields it's just like hell
12:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Unemployment probably. The only time you'll find me against the welfare state
12:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <thekid36> wait..why I got tagged? ðŸ˜‚
12:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unemployment benefits are not the correct place to fix this, I think
12:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm obviously just joking :D
12:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Was implying we need a special exception for vali
12:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> All german citizens are entitled to welfare, except vali
12:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 1) /ninjajetpack
12:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 2) maybe the map could be fixed?
12:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (these are just workarounds)
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I also think the gun shooting sound is slightly loader then other sounds. But must be checked in a sound editor
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I also think the gun shooting sound is slightly louder then other sounds. But must be checked in a sound editor
13:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I can fix point 2 there is realy no good reason for this sound. Because you do not even get the gun, you can not shoot... you loos the gun instant. I will remove the sound
13:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I can fix point 2 there is really no good reason for this sound. Because you do not even get the gun, you can not shoot... you loos the gun instant. I will remove the sound
13:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can use the weapon AFAIK
13:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> press the key for the weapon
13:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can shoot, but it doesn't show the weapon
13:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I just tried it, at least it does not work for me. The predict code tries to shot but not the server
13:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> without cl_predict it is rendered correct xD
13:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have a test server I can join?
13:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I can make one... I only tested it lokaly ... one moment
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> trashmap.ddnet.tw:8567
13:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> pw on all: dos
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> lol what is that for a version on trashmap xD there are all dragger really broken
13:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> /info ?
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh no I'm wrong xD I just thought draggers work diffrently
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I thought draggers let you go when another player is closer, I was wrong. Must revise my PR again xD
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> this thing really really very nice 
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> (order by servers have players+ping ) idk who make it but will be great if he can add with them order by maps unfinish too
14:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/971744602803568650/unknown.png
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Hi
14:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i cant join any ddnet server
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i was on ger2 before and when i left i couldnt join any ddnet server anymore
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> with 0.7 i can join
14:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991
14:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> see #bot-cmds, I think
15:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why could people on the server still play without problems?
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like DoS protection working
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (not perfectly, but a little at least. if people on the server are unaffected)
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> where is that ddos protection from?
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i couldnt join CHN, RUS; GER2, etc
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Just a basic iptables limiting serverinfo/new connections when they get spammed so the server doesn't get overloaded

20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> started a series programming not long ago
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> might be interesting for someone
