00:58 <+o_be_two> ifcity is a nice gameplay too :)
01:11 <+WolfAlex> o_be_two: wtf?
01:23 <+o_be_two> WolfAlex, ?
01:23 <+o_be_two> i read idk where that a "Wolf" host it
01:23 <+o_be_two> maybe at the spawn
01:24 <+o_be_two> and that bip made most of the map
01:24 <+o_be_two> its funny to see on how teeworlds wolrd is so small x)
11:12 < laxa> wow
11:13 < laxa> I am reading ddnet forums once in a while
11:13 < laxa> why I have no news of deen wanting to close ddnet again ? :x
11:13 < laxa> Well, why no one is talking about it here ? Or I missed it ?
11:56 < laxa> I have posted my opinion on the official thread
11:56 < laxa> I am donating 50 euros also
11:57 < laxa> You don't need to refund me if you take the decision to shutdown btw
11:57 <@EastByte> you cannot force him not to refund :p
11:58 < laxa> I know deen
11:58 < laxa> I know he'll refund me
11:58 < laxa> if he shutdowns ddnet
11:58 < laxa> but that's not necessary, I don't care about money
13:56 < laxa> !ddnetstatus
13:56 < laxa> !ddnetpeak
13:56 <+Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 295
13:56 <+Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
14:00 < laxa> Is this normal that the forum is awfully slow ?
14:34 < Savander> Hello ;) Merry Christmas :)
14:35 < Savander> @deen, something wrong with mysql on forum
14:40 <@deen> many processes died on ddnet.tw, strange
14:41 <@deen> OOM killed process 14776 (python)
14:41 <@deen> OOM killed process 2140 (mysqld)
14:41 <@deen> oh well, that explains it^^
14:42 < Savander> What's OOM?:D
14:42 <@deen> Out of memory
14:42 < Savander> i type it google and it said
14:42 < Savander> "National Junior Olympics"
14:42 < Savander> xDD
14:59 <@deen> hm, somehow the forum is overloaded, not sure why
14:59 <@deen> 70 users online is also weird
15:02 < Savander> maybe bots
15:02 < Savander> i had forum 2 years ago, only for testing
15:02 < Savander> after 2 months, i had big traffic
15:02 < Savander> abot 2k+ bots
15:02 < Savander> about*
15:03 < Savander> a lot of links, posts etc.
15:04 < Savander> You can chack back-links?
15:04 < Savander> back*
15:10 < Savander> Google Analytics could check it
15:10 <@deen> strange how easy it is to DoS this forum software
15:11 <@deen> they're just accessing the same 404 page from 70 ips or so
15:11 <@deen> a few times per second
15:13 < laxa> deen: fail to ban could help
15:13 < Savander> laxa, right
15:17 <@deen> well, they stopped already
15:17 <@deen> whatever that was
15:23 < laxa> you know the fail2ban package deen ?
15:27 <@deen> i've heard of it. could be a solution if this happens again
15:29 < laxa> fail2ban is a python opensource software that read the logs and apply firewall rules depending on regex
15:29 < laxa> it's pretty easy and quick to make a custom rule to say that if a client get 404 more than 3 times a second they get dropped for x seconds
15:30 < laxa> it's pretty powerfull
15:30 <@deen> only against application level DoS attacks
15:30 < laxa> the rules are based on log files
15:31 <@deen> otherwise i think it gives you a false sense of security, they talk about blocking malicious activity
15:31 < laxa> yes
15:31 < laxa> not sure I understand your last sentence
15:35 <@deen> anyway, i don't think fail2ban would help here, way too many ip addresses
15:35 < laxa> if they reuse the IPs that helps
15:35 < laxa> otherwise not
15:35 < laxa> spoofed IPs ?
15:36 <@deen> they reuse it maybe once every 10 seconds
15:36 <@EastByte> spoofed ips cannot do http requests
15:36 <@deen> we can't ban people from forum for requesting a site every 10 seconds
15:36 < laxa> Oh, I thought same IP is requesting multiple times 404 a second
15:37 < laxa> Well
15:37 <@deen> nope, looks more like someone is trying out a few DDoS tools (HTTP on ddnet.tw, NTP on GER)
15:37 < laxa> The load is coming from the phpbb trying to handle the requests right ?
15:37 <@deen> right
15:37 < laxa> then just disable public access
15:37 < laxa> simple solution :(
15:38 <@deen> disable the forum you mean?
15:38 < laxa> No, can't go to forum with auth
15:38 < laxa> without
15:38 <@deen> without an account you mean?
15:38 < laxa> Yes
15:39 <+o_be_two> laxa, btw deen talks about shutting down DDNet since some weeks already, and yes we talked about this here
15:39 < laxa> Well I missed it, I don't read everyday the channel :(
15:39 < laxa> I posted my opinion on ddnet
15:40 <+o_be_two> not sure if we can do something :/
15:40 < laxa> Well, I would run ddnet without moderators/admins anymore
15:40 < laxa> Just using forums would be enough
15:40 <@deen> laxa: well, please don't tell people to donate to me and that i will refund their money if i ever shut ddnet down...
15:42 < laxa> I edited the post
15:43 < laxa> Anyway, it's not like anyone has finished all DDNEt maps
15:44 < laxa> People will always have fun playing ddnet, even with less active team
15:44 < laxa> DDRace ran almost 3 years without any development
15:44 <@deen> laxa: but without ddnet people could make better servers
15:44 < laxa> DDRacemaX too
15:44 < laxa> deen: I don't think so
15:44 < laxa> your servers are great
15:44 < laxa> I took a look at F34r servers after answering 
15:44 < laxa> less players, german forum, it's a clan
15:45 < laxa> they have basic maps that were never made by them
15:45 < laxa> Yes sure, if ddnet teams becore unactive, some servers will pop I guess, but that doesn't mean ddnet will die like that
15:46 < laxa> How many maps ddracemax had ?
15:46 < laxa> Not a lot
15:46 < laxa> I am not even sure we had one release per month
15:46 <+o_be_two> ddnet is well organized
15:46 <+o_be_two> and answer to all people requests
15:47 < laxa> ddnet doesn't need an organisation to stay alive
15:47 < laxa> just servers running
15:47 < laxa> that's what I am saying
15:47 < laxa> ddnet organization can live only on the forum
15:47 < laxa> moderations was probably a bad thing after all but it was worth a try
15:48 < laxa> But I know you don't like the overall idea of having no one to take care of ddnet community deen :(
15:51 < laxa> And honestly, I don't see anyone having the skill needed to build something than ddnet
15:51 < laxa> *better than
15:52 <+o_be_two> sure but its hard for ddnet to work like an organization, ive often see it working like a company
15:53 < laxa> Just keep sponsored servers
15:53 < laxa> make ddnet costs to 0
15:53 < laxa> I can sponsor ddnet.tw and pay the montly fees if that's needed for example
15:55 <+o_be_two> and for sure i can do the same :)
18:45 < Ryozuki> hello
18:45 < Ryozuki> merry christmas too
19:31 <+o_be_two> tx u 2
20:46 <+Learath2> marry xmas :)
21:13 < Savander> thanks :), you too
22:29 <+o_be_two> +1
