12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is it the developers goal to make the client crash for everyone?
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> No
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You can open a issue on github or post on forum
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> that never brings anything
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It does
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But if u dont it will never get fixed because devs wont know about it
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but i cant say anything about it. only that it crashes now. may be the upsates. may be my new pc
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but i cant say anything about it. only that it crashes now. may be the updates. may be my new pc
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I still havent got a single crash
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You can say what u did before it crashed
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> play
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If its possile to reproduce it
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Etc
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Abd info about ur system
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But i guess u exoect devs to magically know that
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Now go ahead and make the post/issue
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> no
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Then deal with it
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> maybe add a option to download older versions in the cliet
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> That's why i want to make issue template
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> people dont usually know, what dev need, to even start thinking how to solve problem
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> after all, some people are ignorants... so then we can't do much about it al tall

13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> after all, some people are ignorants... so then we can't do much about it at all
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> why i only find 450servers since this week
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> ```float Velspeed = length(vec2(m_pClient->m_Snap.m_pLocalCharacter->m_VelX/256.0f, m_pClient->m_Snap.m_pLocalCharacter->m_VelY/256.0f))*50;```
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> 
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> ```float Ramp = VelocityRamp(Velspeed, m_pClient->m_Tuning[g_Config.m_ClDummy].m_VelrampStart, m_pClient->m_Tuning[g_Config.m_ClDummy].m_VelrampRange, m_pClient->m_Tuning[g_Config.m_ClDummy].m_VelrampCurvature);```
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> 
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> whats a velocityramp?
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> i think, it's used to make velocity less constant.
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I mean, it get faster after time, but i'm not entirely sure
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> gradually capping the player velocity, only kicks in at large values
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when you're going faster and faster horizontally, you'll eventually stop
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> it's possible to gain max speed?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u stop when pressing d on a -> speeder
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and this is used on some maps
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because u are stopped
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but you keep the speed
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when u release the key
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> btw i always wondered if its possible to gain tees with others tees but no hook or fireing invloved just body glitiching. Sometimes (mostly in pvp based mods) i expirience glitching in other teammates and getting a bit stuck iduring fast flying around and then a small boost. I always wondered if its faster than the speed before the tee collision.
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that exlanation sucked but i think u all know the situation

18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @ChillerDragon dat? (thx my pain skillz)
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> huy wait
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> both tees having speed in same direction and its faster than default walking speed and the bodys get stuck together in air
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> ho in air
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/462680418576236544/Screenshot_10.png
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> da heck
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> new stronger hash format
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why we are deploying it without @heinrich5991 around is beyond me
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen that u? ðŸ˜›
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :O
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> What does it change? Stronger hash?
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Some kind of security holes? I'm curious
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can craft a fake map with the same crc
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> And what will it cause?
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> before we release the map you can poison the map download server by hosting the fake map
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> results with us releasing a map and when people join they see the crafted fake map
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> So, what if you just put CRC from generatd file to your own? Server will generate CRC from map you have on computer and check if it's correct? Or i missunderstand concept?
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> server asks for a map name plus CRC
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> attacker crafts a fake map with same name same crc
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> attacker hosts it for a while to bait the map collector we have
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> on release day server asks for map name plus crc, client cant find it asks the map server, map server has the fake map, the client ends up downloading the fake one
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> hmm, okay
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Client get map by name+crc ?
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Wouldn't be  better, to have db with crc generated by client based on map, and then get the map assigned to crc, whatever the name isc?

22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> But maybe, it would break tw compatibility. mech
