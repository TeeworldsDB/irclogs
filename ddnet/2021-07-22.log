02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> For skins.tw, on upload I store the md5_checksum of files now to detect duplicates and tell the user that this skin already exists. I thought I finally had it, because it works 99% of the time. But some completely different image files seem to have the exact same hash value.

02:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Does anyone have an idea, why they have the same hash checksum? I use md5
03:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :ddnet: suggesting:ddnet: 
03:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> add median time  here

03:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> weird thing to add for browser considering there are other useful things not there
03:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> might work better as a server filter
03:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> like for example, there's no points tab
03:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I mean you could see "do I have time for this map", but I agree there are better informations to display
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> median time is a numeric value so i think you could implement it better as a filter
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but sucks you couldnt sort it by media
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but sucks you couldnt sort it by median
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> How responsive is this browser list even
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> on smaller screens
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> probably terrible
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> font size is not scaled
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i learned this the hard way
04:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so best thing to doingüòö 
04:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> add all this things and make it appear or hide and size Optional to players
04:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah that would be the best, but pretty big lift for devs

08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the entire point of a hash is to be unique justb y changing the smallest thing
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and md5 is proven to be bad at that
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt matter if its not for security
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sha256 is ur best bett
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for a fast hash
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh i guess ur query is wrong
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (finding a md5 colision shouldnt be that easy i think)
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> all sha are rly good
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh jk sha1 sucks
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well md5 isn't bad specifically at that. Minor changes cause wildly different md5 just fine
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well yeah
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i dont think there is much perf dif between using sha256 and md5 right
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just not crc thanks

12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Especially in modern hardware they are fairly similar
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway iif you are going to use md5 you have to keep in mind that the user can generate two different files with the same hash. And in this case it doesnt matter that much since you reject duplicates

12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ryan C. Gordon is the main maintainer of sdl2
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > We are no longer talking about people running Linux as their primary desktop to compete here. We are no longer talking about how many people found a machine to install SteamOS on.
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > We‚Äôre now talking about concrete sales numbers for a game console.
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > And maybe someday down the road, if this is wildly successful, we tell people that it‚Äôs a no-brainer to target 18 bazillion Linux users that aren‚Äôt Linux users so much as customers reliably running a Linux-based game console.
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is such an important remark
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this can make linux be popular whithout it being known at all xd
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there are already a lot of linux users, see android
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I guess they don't run desktop linux
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah its not the same
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the comment above still seems like it's mostly trying to get upvotes from linux fans tbh
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ryan C Gordon should stop doing interviews and do my sdl patches smh
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > the Steam Deck and native Linux ports in the light of Valve‚Äôs call for developers not to port games to Linux and instead rely on their Proton fork of WINE and other tools.
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> valve is actually asking ppl not to port games to linux but use proton
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk what to think of this tbh
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2: @murpi identified all the dummy maps that need changing for https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3959
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I agree more with ryan here, what is this guys problem with calling out the windows layer as ruining linux?
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can we get this in? we had a large increase in start line skips recently
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dont see any problems with it and I don't see any code quality issues. So on that front I'm okay with merging it
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But as with other patches like this I'd really prefer if you could set some time aside and deploy it yourself/monitor it a bit
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then it'd have to wait until saturday
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or we could deploy it this evening maybe
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Either works for me, up to you really
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> k üôÇ
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Saturday is a little less than ideal as I'd be very tired from the flight but I guess you can deploy alone
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> vacation? üòÑ
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sort of, going back to turkey to see family. Will still be plenty busy so not sure if it qualifies as vacation :D
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> You'll finally be back home again!
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> thats great news üôÇ
13:26 <+Meskalin> iirc
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @NeXus\: ah ye i wanted to tell you when i saw on github that you search dupes I have some CI for my mapres also using some python lib to detect similar images because sometimes same skins get resaved and have different hash
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I fixed it now, but thanks
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i also check mapres for proper resolution
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I do too
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> also support hd skins now
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah ok nice
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> imagehashing skins is a decent idea, you can then use a large hashmap to see if a skin that looks nearly identical exists
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Yeah it doesnt check for nearly identical skins atm, they have to be the exact same. 
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I also noticed that even opening a skin with an image editing software, changing nothing and saving it again as png results in a "different" image with a different hash. I guess it depends on the algorithm they use to save images?
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Also sending skins via social networks compresses them and change the hash
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's probably a difference in the png metadata rather than the image itself unless you changed settings like more bits per pixel
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So hashing images as is can be a  bit of a hit and miss
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A naive approach to get more correct (with non lossy formats like png or bmp) is to only hash the pixel data
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the mapoptimizer for example does the SHA over the bitmap of ignoring fully transparent pixels
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the mapoptimizer for example does the SHA over the bitmap of the image and ignoring fully transparent pixels
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But imagehashing takes it a bit further. They also hash loosely so similar images land in the same bucket
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Sometimes people upload almost identical skins, they just make corner smoother or fix positioning of eyes [...]. Wouldnt be bad to detect these as duplicates aswell
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> So they have to delete their old version first
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> wouldnt you just allow 1 name 1 skin then?
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Sometimes people upload almost identical skins, they just make corners smoother or fix positioning of eyes [...]. Wouldnt be bad to detect these as duplicates aswell
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I got vaccinated today
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Yeah but they just name it `xx2` `__fix` etc
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> :SeemsGood:
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then look for similar names
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> hm
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> could be false positive no
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> would nouis be false positive to the original skin?
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Depends on how I check for similar names
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean like if you want similar skins to be found by some algorithm
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @NeXus use the power of the hip machine learning
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> :monkalaugh:
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Found an example for someone who uploaded updated versions. Idk this is a problem for future NeXus üòÖ  I like how it is for now
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/867771941662621706/unknown.png
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, do you want to force it btw?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Actually some crazy AI image recognition would be the best solution
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or just some user specfici warning, "delete this first"
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the problem is always the tollerance 
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if i add eyelashes and call it Jake_female, it might be a different skin xd
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I would force to not be able to upload I think (depends on how accurate the algorithm will be)
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I force it now for exact same hashes
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> because im pretty confident its the same skin
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Tested it pretty much now
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, guess thats a good idea üòÑ
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Strip metadata and hash
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> zopflipng --keepcolortype -y -m name.png name.png
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but very expensive calculation üòÑ
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah btw our dilate script also uses the hash of the bitmap
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/scripts/check_dilate.sh
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> exactly to prevent this from happening, zopfli also changes the chunks of the PNG so its not really hashable
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I‚Äôm getting my second dose tomorrow. Hope to hear you on the 5g channel
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Try imagehashing first, runs fast and old enough to have a couple major mature algorithms
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you also feel it, when u lift your arm? xd
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On the first dose it didnt hurt at all for 4-5 hours. Then it started to ache a bit, ached for an entire day, the next day I woke up and it was gone
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> for me i directly felt it
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> after 1-2minutes
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> did you got biontec or moderna btw?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or other stuff
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I rolled biontech
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah me2
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Italy pretty much ran out of everything else and they are only reordering biontech and j&j for now
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in germany they want to get away from astra xD
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs nobody wants it
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and yeah biontec seems to have higher protection against the mutants
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah they only recommend AZ to people that are more allergic here and people older than 60
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But recommend is a strong word there, they wont give you AZ unless you are an allergic person or specifically ask for it
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> moderna
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ooh american spy
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think i felt it some mins after but now nothing
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u have to wait 15 mins there after taking the vaxx

16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i feel a bit tired tho
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> J&J is pretty promising too with it being single dose and all but we got so little of it
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but  sometimes i dont know if its me being overly conscious
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I felt tired after too, then I noticed I walked 3 km back home under the sun
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh yes
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just come here home

16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have most of that xd

16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gattaca
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i remembered this movie
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The film presents a biopunk vision of a future society driven by eugenics where potential children are conceived through genetic selection to ensure they possess the best hereditary traits of their parents.[5] The film centers on Vincent Freeman, played by Hawke, who was conceived outside the eugenics program and struggles to overcome genetic discrimination to realize his dream of going into space.
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> genetics are defs the hardest topic ever
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think the movie focuses on the wrong thing, if u can modify genes u should be able to become ageless right?
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. i dont fear that plants are genetical modified if studys show a real benefit, but e.g. currently in agriculture its mostly used to have a resistence against glyphosate. So if you spray it all plants around it die
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> And its not clear if it can cause cancer
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i'd prefer a mechanical solution for it in the meantime, e.g. machines that cut weeds
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Worth it for what? To your capitalist overlords? Maybe, but the main point would be eradicating genetic disease and maybe even boosting our immunity to things like cancer
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, i mean the classic argument against vancines "it alters my DNA to control me"
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> I just wonder if they think they are worth enough to be controlled xD
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh yeah complete insanity. Tech giants already control you, just check your google maps history
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> google tells me if i wanna know a recap of where i want
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i went*
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The ads you are served absolutely are there to manipulate you, not just to buy, it also manipulates the way you think. Look at how cambridge analytica manipulated an entire country by serving them ads they‚Äôd hate
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, ads are so annoying and they get more and more xD
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/867783443332595762/1Yh4G7H4Q7xXWs86ovP_8oA.png
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Altering your dna to control you is like using a ring -2 exploit to steal your passwords
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can make it work in a very small scale inside a lab, but in the wild it‚Äôs faaaar faaaaar faaaaaaaaar off from feasible. Observing chunks of data without context to find a password there is insanity
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah interesting point
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats also why i wonder so much how chinese ppl think xD
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean chiense ppl vs their leaders
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> cant be the picture we always get
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like we dont know about how they think they probs dont know about us here, they cant compare so they probs thing theirs is right
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You mean ‚Äúand‚Äù their leaders. There is no vs there, they all live in perfect cohesion
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòÑ thats the question üòÑ
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> especially bcs alot of chinese study outside of china
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well if u dont go against the leaders u probs jsut live normally
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> without being able to say x things
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or draw human bones in games
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you are not in cohesion you take a nice long vacation
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but i mean under the hood
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not publicly
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/Low_Violence
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Low Violence is a series of graphical variations used on Perfect World servers. They were made to edit out or obscure blood, gore, skulls and skeletons in order to conform with Chinese censorship.
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I‚Äôve had a couple chats with chinese students here, they are fairly shielded to outsiders. They hang out in their own groups
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i see
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its hilarious
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/867784681910960172/unknown.png
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> china
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> :justatest:
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if their time outside changes their thinking a lot at all
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but in the end there is taiwan and hongkong and they are both economically not bad
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but dunno how much the press hides these facts
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or how ppl think about it, that have a higher intellect
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> why does dev-channel become into polit-channel every time
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its also a way of development
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it doesnt say teeworlds development xd
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ye, make humanb-dev channel :D
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ye, make human-dev channel :D
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Chinese taipei and hong kong autonomous regions are very happy under ccp rule tyvm
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> make a creative room channel
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> creative would
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It‚Äôs a bunch of computer people, sometimes you just want to talk about things with people with similar backgrounds
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i mean
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> this channel is logging out
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and indexing by any search engine
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the good thing about computer scientist is, that they have to accept facts, bcs that's litterally how programming works xd
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> your thoughts here a public
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> your thoughts here are public
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is that a problem xd
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not like we are hiding anything üòõ
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> true
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> as soon as tsfreddie starts the chinese revolution i can say IT ALL STARTED HERE
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I probably can‚Äôt work in the us anymore though
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> China might still take me
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> anyone else having dns issues right now?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i can ping google fine
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://edgedns.status.akamai.com/incidents/n5zl6dythvfv
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> F
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @murpi i recommend u not relying on ur ISP dns
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and just use
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> im using public dns
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use 1.1.1.1
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://twitter.com/campuscodi/status/1418245632922370048
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @murpi
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> yeah üòÖ
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> looks like they fixed it already
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> can someone explain to me why all the rust python-bindings crates exist instead of them being integrated into the crates they create bindings for?
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> example?
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://crates.io/crates/hyperjson
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm cant remember the second one i took a look at
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks like it has different authors
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 let's deploy the PR
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```toml
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> [lib]
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> crate-type = ["rlib", "cdylib"]
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> my understanding is that this will change the crate-type from "lib" to those two. I'm not sure if this has an effect on people that want to add my crate as a dependency or just on people that build it locally
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The startline one?
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should we get rid of CodeQL btw, it keeps failing
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> is seem to need those options if I want to produce python bindings for my library https://pyo3.rs/v0.14.1/building_and_distribution.html#manual-builds, might that be a reason to create a new crate?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 1 last question, do you know if old saves are fine with this?
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> untested, but added with the same backward compatibility as everything else
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it assumes that every tee has hit the start line already
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think this is for making dynamic libraries
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, if you have rlib in there I thought the linkage would be fine for people using your crate too
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ryozuki I also read those docs (maybe skimmed more than read), though I was not able to answer my question
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats your question
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> > I'm not sure if this has an effect on people that want to add my crate as a dependency or just on people that build it locally
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >  why all the rust python-bindings crates exist instead of them being integrated into the crates they create bindings for?
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont get what u mean
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga sometimes I find the best course of action is to just try it, it'll break pretty quick if it's a hard requirement üôÇ
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hyperjson is a python library made in rust i think
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki he is asking why people are splitting off their python bindings into separate crates
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> an example?
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont see hyperjson as multiple crates here
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> fair, in this case though I fear that I wouldn't catch side effects
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ryozuki my question that I quoted here would suffice for me :)
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think if u specify rlib
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it can be statically linked
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think testing it is the best
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > If a static library is being produced, all upstream dependencies are required to be available in rlib formats.
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > If an rlib file is being produced, then there are no restrictions on what format the upstream dependencies are available in
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think(tm) by doing `rlib` you are sort of forcing the compilers hand, so if another rust project includes your project they need to link statically
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > f a dynamic library or an executable that is being dynamically linked is being produced, then the compiler will attempt to reconcile the available dependencies in either the rlib or dylib format to create a final product.
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> so has it an effect on someone who uses my library as a dependency?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> okay that reply is misleading
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I still don't know the answer to my question tho
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Check the linkage
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Info
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ryozuki  the things that you are copying from the docs are lines I already read, if you think that they still answer my question, it would help me if you could formulate it differently
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It tells it there
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hmm
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, thats interesting :)
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If they use ur lib as a dep and compile statically then urs is too
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 if i lift my arm from vaccine i can actually feel some pain :monkalaugh:
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest: :cammostripes: :justatest:
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, so the crate that uses my lib as a dep can overwrite that for my lib, or does that require my lib to include the 'rlib' crate-type
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I dont know if it requires ir
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, it's merged
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> gonna deploy it
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> for me the docs kinda sound like they don't want me to touch it
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seems the only way to find out is ask on some rust channel
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that commit looks like it changes behavior
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> map_backgrounds/abc.png ‚Üí map_backgrounds/abc
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh wow, how did you even catch that üòÑ
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I looked at the commit because it popped up in the chat
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you used the path in two places ^^
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thumbs up
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 btw did you deploy the patch?
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```

19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> still in progress
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> leaks
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> calling the nsa
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm hmm
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> theoretically it should have output for each server
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't see a single one yet
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll restart the script
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, apparently my connection broke?
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> in an ideal world I'd make these scripts parallel with multiprocessing, but I really don't have the energy for it
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so, it takes like 5 minutes to parse the releases file üòÑ
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't understand your last message
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which releases file?
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://ddnet.tw/releases/releases
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A list of all maps, when they were released, who their mappers are, etc
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> turns out the script is already parallel
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and the status output doesn't go to stdout
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but to `$$.log`
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, that makes sense
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well parallel with 2 cores
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its that
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't matter, it's mostly IO
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/tokio-rs/loom
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> TIL you can test concurrent code like this
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> loom is indeed a cool idea
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Loom provides a way to deterministically explore the various possible execution permutations without relying on random executions. This allows you to write tests that verify that your concurrent code is correct under all executions, not just ‚Äúmost of the time‚Äù.
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deployed on ger2:8303
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyone up for quick testing?
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This ofc is not very cheap to test, with there being `n!` permutations
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki no, not hard restart
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> restart when empty
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol, didn't know the bot kept the entire database of finishes aswell
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It will take the rest of my human life to wait for this script to copy it all
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> only once per day
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yay, finally it's all there
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll probably hack in a mysql connection there so it can use the actual record_race table
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> postgres better
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye postgres ftw
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Definitely but ddnet is using mysql for now üòõ
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> unless one of you wants to take the immense task of rewriting sql_score for postgres and taking the risk of migration it'll be like that for a while üòõ
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Can somebody fix/restore build push for #bugs bug
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> finshing also doesnt work
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 um, something broke
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But I specifically asked you be here when we deploy it üò¶
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm here
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (but I was away, I'll give you that)
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ScReeNy can you tell me which map?
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @heinrich5991 flw into my server
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> all Maps but not on all server it seems @heinrich5991
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> but not sure
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 you can roll back to `f23475665f6cff947d1cdafdf73f77c18396892c` I guess
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's probably @Jupstar ‚ú™'s C++ patch, not the startline thing
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> spawning random entities sounds insane for your patch
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think so, too. but can never know in C++
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> what map can i test it in?
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> some servers were running ubsan, this is definitely a ub issue
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ‚ú™ check Nostalgia
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ‚ú™ I highly doubt it happens consistently
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nostalgia is consistent according to Patiga
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah perfect, ok we rollback and we can do asan + ubsan to check it out on nostalgia
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doing rollback rn
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh or maybe 74ca331e
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the gamecontext destructor stuff
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> where is the entity in nostalgia
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> > [9:26 PM] Knuski: it looks like it only appears after a map change
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's probably `74ca331e`
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> near teleto 1
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> why not both
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> map change yeah
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that makes more sense
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `2a74ca331e` sorry
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 is the commit I built bad?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> f23475665f6cff947d1cdafdf73f77c18396892c
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then I'm deployingh
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm definitely adding the commit the game was played on to records and saves
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> all the random tiles that are getting spawned into other maps are from this map
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/867851782112804864/unknown.png
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> watch your time by welf
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> i saw the smiley bottom left on each server
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> and other patterns
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's extremely weird, I hope it was happening when you switch from watch your time and not everywhere
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> i dont know i could go on any server, switch and those things were there
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> so not only servers with watch ur time are affected
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> but it still choses the switch tiles of that map
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 take a note of the time when you finish restarting servers, we'll have to nuke the records between deployment and rollback
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> reload only affected servers :/ could finish voidof* normally
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe if the teehistorian file contains the server commit hash I can try to only remove affected records
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> i guess saves and all will also be needed to be deleted then if they arent already included
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Learath2 ^
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and @heinrich5991 that should fix it
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ‚ú™ have you actually checked that it was that commit though?
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it must be
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it was bcs the user declared contructors initialize values, instead of putting it in oninit and onshutdown and i forgot to check about that
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it also fixed it locally for me
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> delete my "what" save on getspeed
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and record too xd
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 it does
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also saves also contain the gameid
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 okay, with this PR in, next try?
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not sweating enough as is
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, I'm fine with trying it again
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll try to restore the gamecontext.cpp file to something similar as before before trying again
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Jupstar ‚ú™ possibly a draw order bug? (only noticable on tall skins)
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/867865279157370940/unknown.png
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 so you are not confident about jupeyyys pr?
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd prefer not to have this again
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I wasn't really confident with it when deen merged it the first time around either, idk just looked a tad odd to me
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> Do we want to make an announcement on running servers that the ranks and saves will not be saved?
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> might be a good idea
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> can u hint me, i'm blind
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> looks like the next "team stripe" goes over the previous tee's feet a bit
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> scoreboard?
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah in tab
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah the tees are generally rendered too big in the scoreboard
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and I guess on full server so it's the narrow version?
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and yes its probably the order of draw commands
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think you would have to draw all team stripes first before drawing any tees
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> because no matter the individual order you're going to clip the top or bottom of tees
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this method appears to be drawing the team stripe, then the tee, then the next pair below itr
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this method appears to be drawing the team stripe, then the tee, then the next pair below it
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> they shouldnt leave the stripes
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then its fine
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's only noticable on really tall skins which there aren't many so adjusting the order should be good enough
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but then skins can still overlap
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also not really nice
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah but only in rare cases and still looks not as buggy
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> maybe making them even smaller is not worth it
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> just removing the color background entirely?
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i don't see why we can't paint all the backgrounds then all the tees
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> im too lazy
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lol
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 last server dead
