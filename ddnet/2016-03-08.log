15:31 < heehee> Hi all!
15:33 < heehee> Someone can help me pls? I have stupid question, but, how to enable blue and red flags? I uncomment flag.cpp and flag.h in entities folder
15:53 < heehee> Someone?
15:59 < laxadedi> Wait for an answer, spamming won't help getting a faster answer
15:59 < laxadedi> And what do you mean by "enabling red/blue flags ?"
15:59 < heehee> Im not spam
15:59 < Ryozuki> hi
15:59 < laxadedi> 15:53 < heehee> Someone? // this is useless and considered as spam
16:00 < heehee> laxadedi: dont be so serious :3 Just enable flags like in vanilla game. I can pickup and drop flag
16:01 < heehee> You know. Like in ctf...
16:01 < laxadedi> On ddnet ?
16:01 < heehee> Yap, dont ask for what xD
16:01 < laxadedi> Well, only you know what you wanna do
16:01 < heehee> But if it possible, help me to do this...
16:02 < laxadedi> No one can understand what you wanna do, you need to understand the source code
16:02 < laxadedi> I am sorry, but I don't think anyone could really help you on this
16:02 < Ryozuki> useless feature
16:02 < heehee> Look, in ddnet flags are disabled
16:03 < Ryozuki> only in ddnet gamemode
16:03 < Ryozuki> ddrace*
16:03 < Ryozuki> not jsut ddnet
16:03 < Ryozuki> on what would you use the flag? for what?
16:04 < Ryozuki> or you just like the flags? ^^
16:05 < heehee> I have some ideaf for flags...And yes, i love flags, rly looove :3
16:05 < heehee> So, i mast edit gamemode?
16:05 < heehee> u*
16:07 < Ryozuki> i suggest you to post that ideas on forum.ddnet.tw explaining them to see if others like it and other people could give opinion about this
16:08 < heehee> My ideas no so great to post it on forum...i just want to enable flags %)
16:10 <@deen> not sure how the flags were disabled in ddrace and how to enable them
16:10 < heehee> Oh, it disabled in ddrace?
16:10 <@deen> probably
16:11 <@deen> they're only enabled in ctf mod, no?
16:11 < heehee> Yes, only in ctf
16:12 <@deen> in ddrace the flag class is entirely commented out
16:12 < heehee> I entities?
16:12 <@deen> I would search in ddnet or vanilla how CFlag is used
16:12 <@deen> yes, game/server/entities/flag.{h,cpp}
16:12 < heehee> I uncoment it already
16:12 <@deen> ok, then you need to check vanilla 0.6 to see how it's used
16:12 <@deen> because the code that used flags was also removed in ddnet
16:13 <@deen> probably in gam/server/gamemodes/ctf.{h,cpp}
16:13 <@deen> game*
16:14 < heehee> Ok, i want to try find it. :3
16:14 < Ryozuki> :o
16:15 < Ryozuki> good luck then :P
16:24 < heehee> deen: im not codder like you, but looks like i must add #include <game/server/entities/flag.h> in ddrace.cpp?
16:24 < heehee> and in ddrace.h
16:26 < heehee> Now i dont any ideas, wtf i doing xD
16:27 < heehee> dont have*
16:36 <@deen> this will be difficult if you're not a coder
16:37 <@deen> you also need to check what's done with m_apFlags in ctf.cpp
16:38 < heehee> Damn...time to learn c++ 0_o
16:53 < heehee> eeeee: You eeeee from qwe123?

21:03 < kamillentee> @heinrich5991 pack_maps.py should search for the maps in the same directory you run the script imho, I have all my maps located in maps not doenloadedmaps
21:03 < kamillentee> anyway I have a pack for you
21:03 < kamillentee> but not the crc sums, dunno how to send the maps to you
21:37 <@heinrich5991> kamillentee: pack_maps.py should create a tar archive
21:44 < kamillentee> it does wait I just upload the maps for you
21:45 < kamillentee> qshar.com/maps.tar.bz2 without crc, all maps of KoG Gores server
21:45 <@heinrich5991> if it appears to be waiting, it probably compresses the maps for you
21:45 <@heinrich5991> it doesn't have status output
21:46 < kamillentee> http://qshar.com/downloaded.tar.bz2 my local maps
21:47 < kamillentee> second one has o lot of similar maps because if minor things changed while testing --> new map
21:48 < kamillentee> well I got a status output, it was just the map the was compressed currently but still a status
21:48 <@heinrich5991> oh ok
21:48 <@heinrich5991> then I don't remember my script well enough :D
21:51 < kamillentee> Just one question, how it comes I am playing some years teeworlds but I never ever saw you ingame :D
21:51 <@heinrich5991> nowadays I'm rarely playing
21:52 <@heinrich5991> most active time must've been 3-5 years ago
21:53 < kamillentee> kk thanks
22:55 < pixel_> hello!
