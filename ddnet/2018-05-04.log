01:13 < ***> Buffer Playback...
01:13 <+bridge> [01:11:36] [ddnet] <Learath2> is it 300gb?
01:13 <+bridge> [01:12:15] [ddnet] <Learath2> also how fast is your upload speed
01:13 <+bridge> [01:12:19] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wait
01:13 <+bridge> [01:12:24] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just compare sizes
01:13 <+bridge> [01:12:40] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's your `du --apparent-size -sh data`?
01:13 < ***> Playback Complete.
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> $ du -sh --apparent-size data/
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 390G    data/
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 352G
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so 40GB are missing
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how fast is your upload?
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dunno, reliably I'd guess 1/3mb/s
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 33 more hours
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds okayish
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> didn't you just say 300 hours? ðŸ˜„
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. that's what rsync said
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but our own calculation says ~33 hours
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> interesting that rsync is getting it wrong
09:47 <@deen> heinrich5991, Learath2 rsync(1) for --progress: "These statistics can be misleading if rsync's delta-transfer algorithm is
09:47 <@deen>     in use. For example, if the sender's file consists of the basis file followed by additional data, the reported rate will probably drop dramatically when the receiver gets to the literal data, and the transfer will probably take much longer to finish than the receiver estimated as it was finishing the matched part of the file."
09:48 <@deen> I also like the "This gives a bored user something to watch."
13:21 <@heinrich5991> --info=progress2 !
