03:09 <@deen> EastByte: cool, haven't tried it yet but I remember fixing some things in it^^
03:12 < o_be_one> sup'
03:12 < xRoThx> Yo :) 
03:12 < xRoThx> Think that is not a bad thing for the servers
03:12 < xRoThx> I often get the request to allow moderators or so on my servers.. But I hate the idea of abusing people..
03:13 < xRoThx> & you have servers of yourself, I don't expect you to do some crazy things
03:13 < o_be_one> same in my side, i always refuse i trust nobody on TW
03:13 < xRoThx> Haha ^^ Joint the club :)
03:13 < o_be_one> sometime i can trust one tee, but only cause i know him for a while and know how he can be helpful
03:14 < xRoThx> Vinum :)
03:14 < xRoThx> I know him, 
03:14 < o_be_one> Vinum is a really good tee i think
03:14 < xRoThx> I thought about him aswell, but I heard 2x people complaining about him 
03:14 < o_be_one> you will always get complaint about admins ... its the base of a mad tee
03:14 < o_be_one> when they know that you are admin ... its terrible.
03:14 < xRoThx> I think very hard about giving a password because thats the reason why I started
03:15 < xRoThx> yup.. I often play under fake names :) 
03:15 < xRoThx> *other names
03:15 < xRoThx> to avoid that 
03:15 < o_be_one> btw, tees often ask if im admin of V3ROYAL (and some thinks its mine), and i say yes cause im DDNet admin
03:15 < xRoThx> Hm? 
03:15 < xRoThx> You already have the pw? 
03:15 < o_be_one> i just miss V3ROYAL
03:15 < xRoThx> oh ok
03:16 < o_be_one> im DDNet Canada sponsor :/
03:16 < xRoThx> You also race? 
03:16 < o_be_one> but i have all your ddraces pw
03:16 < o_be_one> yes but only on North American servers, with Broken (founder of DDNet USA), on USA DDnet or CAN DDnet (CAN are mine)
03:16 < o_be_one> my ping is so shitty on you servers :(
03:17 < xRoThx> I actually don't care about the races, only about V3Royal actually 
03:17 < o_be_one> ive 40ms more than on mine ! :o
03:17 < o_be_one> its unplayable with ddrace
03:17 < xRoThx> o_be_one:  yours gives me a ping of 8 when I m @ class
03:17 < xRoThx> Must me north fr? 
03:17 < xRoThx> *be
03:18 < o_be_one> ddrace player are more fair than blockers players, i deal with 100 to 150 players everyday, before with V3ROYAL it was 200 players everyday... Blocker community is a bad community with some very good tees, and these never ask something, they just play fairly
03:18 < o_be_one> i live in Canada
03:18 < xRoThx> o_be_one:  thought fr? 
03:18 < o_be_one> on my FR servers i have 100ms, on my CAN servers i have 20ms, on USA servers i have 40ms
03:19 < o_be_one> oO i dont understand what you mean, maybe try in english ?
03:19 < o_be_one> in frenc
03:19 < xRoThx> je croiyais FR? 
03:19 < o_be_one> EU ddrace players are for the most blocker players ive seen, so i think they are not fair as on North America 
03:19 < xRoThx> mon fr n'est pas bien :P 
03:20 < o_be_one> xRoThx, i live in Canada since 1.5 years
03:20 < xRoThx> Belgique :P 
03:20 < o_be_one> je sais
03:20 < xRoThx> oh ok
03:20 < o_be_one> i was from France
03:20 < xRoThx> Why moving? work 
03:20 < xRoThx> Why moving? work ?
03:20 < o_be_one> yes, only for work
03:20 < xRoThx> Oh aight
03:20 < o_be_one> but this country is awesome, Montreal is an awesome town ... Ive all that i love in my town in France here + my work
03:21 < o_be_one> i'll stay in Canada for a while i think
03:21 < xRoThx> Isn't it much colder? 
03:21 < o_be_one> not really, when you live here your corpse is ok with that
03:22 < o_be_one> and wears are made to keep you warm on cold temp
03:22 < xRoThx> ton corps se adapte? 
03:22 < o_be_one> oui
03:22 < o_be_one> exactement
04:38 < Edible> any way to toggle b etween dummies?
04:43 < xRoThx> Edible:  in your options you will find a thing called "toggle dummy" or something
04:43 < xRoThx> & you can set it whatevery you want :)
05:45 < Edible> thx roth:)
13:30 <@EastByte> deen: so, this is plain nim without any bridge

13:31 <@EastByte> android allows complete native activities which is awesome

15:17 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #184: Reduce amount of drawcalls when using triangles instead of quads (DDRace64...pr_gpu_batch) http://git.io/jytZ
15:20 <@deen> EastByte: cool!
15:21 <@EastByte> deen: I'm not sure where to call NimCall(), can I do it inside of nim?
15:21 <@EastByte> NimMain()*
15:21 <@EastByte> I did it now using importc pragma
15:23 <@deen> I don't know how this Android stuff works
15:25 <@deen> NimMain is some nim internal proc, why do you need to call it explicitly?
15:26 <@EastByte> because the native stuff is compiled as shared library
15:27 <@deen> hm, no idea
15:27 <@deen> maybe better ask on #nim :P
15:28 <@EastByte> yea, I should
15:28 <@EastByte> and maybe gradha from this thread http://forum.nim-lang.org/t/61#313 is available
15:29 <@EastByte> nvm, gotta learn some stuff for final exams now
15:39 < BeaR_> sup
15:40 < BeaR_> deen: "Look at the background on Adrenaline 3 for example, it changes color now." - can you send me a screen or sth?
15:44 <@EastByte> hello BeaR_ 
15:44 < BeaR_> hey
15:51 <@deen> BeaR_: 1 moment
15:53 <@deen> BeaR_: i attached screenshots
15:55 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/pull/184
16:04 < BeaR_> hm thanks, looks weird though /:
16:05 < BeaR_> deen: could you also attach a screenshot of the whole background quad in the editor ?
16:07 <@deen> BeaR_: i think you're splitting the triangles wrongly, exactly like AMD gpus :P
16:08 < BeaR_> well, depends on what is 'wrong' ;>
16:08 <@deen> attached
16:10 < BeaR_> ah yeah
16:10 < BeaR_> I assume the lower one is 'correct' ^^?
16:11 < BeaR_> upper*
16:17 <@deen> yes, upper one is good
16:18 <@deen> that's what nvidia and intel do
16:20 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] cinaera opened pull request #185: Change the way quads are split into triangle splits (DDRace64...pr_gpu_batch) http://git.io/jSLV
16:21 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/jSL7
16:21 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 2d32028 BeaR: Change the way quads are split into triangle splits (conform with intel/nvidia drivers)
16:21 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 913d709 Dennis Felsing: Merge pull request #185 from cinaera/pr_gpu_batch...
16:21 <@deen> BeaR_: great, thanks
16:22 < BeaR_> np (:
16:32 <@deen> now, hm
16:32 <@deen> should we just remove quad rendering altogether?
16:32 <@deen> users will never figure out that they have to do gfx_triangles_as_quads 1 otherwise
16:35 < BeaR_> just set gfx_quads_as_triangles to 1 default
16:36 < BeaR_> I'm used to the way, AMD splits their stuff :D
16:37 <@deen> well, then people who already use ddnet will still have it set to 0
16:37 < BeaR_> ah well /:
16:38 <@deen> we can of course rename the setting :P
16:38 < BeaR_> :P
16:38 < BeaR_> gfx_quads_as_triangles to gfx_quad_as_triangle !
16:38 <@deen> haha
16:38 < BeaR_> but you probably also can remove the GL_QUADS stuff
16:39 <@deen> hm, a bit too scared for that =/
16:39 <@deen> I'll do the setting rename
16:39 < BeaR_> ^^
16:40 < BeaR_> I usually also try to avoid touching the engine stuff /:
16:40 <@deen> yeah, no matter what you change, someone will always have a problem with it
16:40 < BeaR_> 100% bug guarantee, yep
16:41 <@deen> And even if you fix bugs people complain
16:41 <@EastByte> ^ two different problems :D
16:41 <@deen> because they used the bug for something useful..รถ
16:42 < BeaR_> yeah like hook trough adjacent tiles :>
16:42 <@deen> or hammerfly
16:42 <@EastByte> and wall hammering
16:42 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/jSCb
16:42 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 3c496c6 def: Rename gfx_quads_as_triangles to gfx_quad_as_triangle and set default to 1
16:42 <@deen> or strong/weak hook
16:42 <@deen> the whole of ddrace is based on bugs :P
16:42 <@EastByte> ^^
16:42 < BeaR_> or hook is stronger when pointing downwards
16:43 < BeaR_> btw how goes your hookrace project ^^?
16:43 <@deen> not doing anything
16:44 < BeaR_> ok :D
16:44 <@deen> got too involved in helping Nim instead and have to write my master thesis
17:37 < o_be_one> hi
17:45 <@EastByte> hello
18:09 < o_be_one> how are you EastByte ?
18:12 <@EastByte> I'm cool, how are you?
