02:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> imagine using C to dev a discord bot
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <le> i used to have a friend that coded one in cpp ive only tried using python and.... javascript...

14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why are there so many libraries with "This is not an official Google product."
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so weird
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/750336662726377522/unknown.png
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So that you know it won't be discontinued randomly ðŸ˜„
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its cuz the author is a google emoployee
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its cuz the author is a google employee
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, I was joking
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Google employees can work on whatever they want in some percentage of their time at work, and then when they publish that it still is owned by Google, but not a Google product
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh i see
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://ddnet.tw/cdn-cgi/trace
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ?
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> an URL that cloudflare responds to
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *a
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CovER> Can you create voice chat?
20:47 <+ChillerDragon> yes add voice chat to ddnet client lmao
20:47 <+ChillerDragon> and also a account system
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @CovER Either use TS or the ones available here
20:48 <+ChillerDragon> @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti can i hire u as my personal map tester?
20:49 <+ChillerDragon> @Soreu mumble*
20:49 <+ChillerDragon> wait has ddnet even a mumble server?
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> ChillerDragon i dont test 0.7 maps :justatest:
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Thanks for the help yesterday. It turned out that problem is not reproducible with 0.7 client, it's just a dummy thing in F-client which appears after a map change.
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I am so glad I don't have to track a serverside problem that is sometimes there and sometimes not.
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> F-client is briliant and the dummy is really helpful for testing. I will just don't use it for awhile.
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> F-client is briliant and the dummy is really helpful for testing. I will just don't use it for awhile with my mod.
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It seems that in usual scenarious without dummy there is no problems and I am happy about it.
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should really stick to vanilla client while testing, it's what you are looking to support after all
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's just nature of a mod that is it starts only when there are two players. And it's hard to switch between two teeworlds clients even when they are windowed because of mouse grab.
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Any way to tell ddnet/teeworlds client not to grab a mouse?
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @fokkonaut are you interested in a bug report? Or is that known? (client freezes after a map change when starting a dummy)
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @fokkonaut are you interested in a bug report on F-client? Or is that known? (client freezes after a map change when starting a dummy)
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Pure_luck try to avoid editing messages in this channel
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> This again.
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I'd better use another channel.
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Please ban me on this channel, its ok. I don't have any means of leaving a channel.
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's just not possible in a discord.
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I don't want to ask third time. Could anyone?
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I don't want to ask third time. Could anyone do it for me?
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Editing messages is a natural habbit for me for 10+ years.
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will not remember it 100+ but don't want to bother anybody with it.
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will not remember it 100% but don't want to bother anybody with it.
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Arii after you finish your level please help me here.
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I don't want to ask a third time. Could anyone do it for me?
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will not remember it 100% but don't want to bother anybody with it anymore.
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> nevermind, I've found a way
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/agp5th/how_to_leave_a_channel_in_a_server/
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Doesn't work for some reason. So I still need your help.
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arii> @Pure_luck How can I help you?
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will PM you
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Pure_luck lmao and still editing your messages:monkaS:
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's a 10 years habbit. It's not something I just turn off in my brains.
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And it is not problem anywhere else. But I have a solution. Please just don't highlight me here because it's not irc, I cannot just /part
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> for some reason discord ignores my settings when I am highlighted here directly
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> any other channel like #off-topic is fine too
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cyberFighter> chillerdragon is like 0.7 and gores
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Even if it is said you edit directly the next message?
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/750452471268376596/IMG_20200901_223001.jpg
