16:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you can't
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> sad noises
16:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> IRC only allows single-line messages, by design
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> and discord doesnt accept blocks of code if its a single message right?
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> only ``those``
16:47 <+bridge> <ReiTW> Can't he pass \n?
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> ```multi\nline xd```
16:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> IRC's protocol is line-based
16:47 <+bridge> <ReiTW> Maybe discord will format it
16:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> each message is separated by a newline
16:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no
16:47 <+bridge> <ReiTW> Ah
16:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> IRC messages look like this:
16:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> JOIN #ddnet
16:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> PRIVMSG #ddnet :hello, world!
16:48 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> QUIT
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> the only good chat protocol
16:48 <+bridge> <ReiTW> Aah
17:06 <+bridge> <Learath2> Truly a great chat protocol
17:37 <+bridge> <Robyt3> @Ravie @Pipou @marmare_314 I updated the screenshots in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6546#issuecomment-1533261655. What about the "Refocus" button? Seems redundant, as is just goes to (0,0) which you can also do with "Goto".
17:40 <+bridge> <Ravie> @Robyt3 it looks like goto 0, 0 is on the tile and not coord 0, 0
17:40 <+bridge> <Robyt3> do mappers use refocus often and is it useful that it's different from goto?
17:41 <+bridge> <Ravie> I use it often for quad stuff, idk about others
17:41 <+bridge> <Ravie> at exactly 0, 0 parallax has no effect
17:49 <+bridge> <Robyt3> What do you think about moving the Anim and Move buttons together with the other buttons that they toggle?

18:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> > I love MLIR. The modularity and friendly abstractions make it incredibly flexible. I've now used it to write _multiple_ domain-specific optimizations and transformations for some of my recent research! It truly bridges the gap between different devices (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, etc.). I pray more people adopt it so it doesn't end up abandoned!
18:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks MLIR on hn yesterday xd
19:02 <+bridge> <Chairn> please, can you stop with spam bot here? It's getting annoying to read all the feed just to see garbage...
19:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i agree a bit xd

19:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks kek
19:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> today is ryo news day
19:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they so expensive
19:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that u probably better bew a new one after a few years xd
19:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
19:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it has upgradable
19:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> graphics
19:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:04 <+bridge> <Iza> quick question, is it possible to implement a mac address detection into the ddnet client?
20:05 <+ChillerDragon> technically yes sure everything is possible
20:05 <+ChillerDragon> or do you mean by is it possible server side? or if it would be merged into official client?
20:05 <+ChillerDragon> then no i would assume
20:05 <+bridge> <Iza> merged into the client
20:05 <+ChillerDragon> doubt
20:06 <+bridge> <Iza> it's not possible?
20:06 <+ChillerDragon> i do not think it would get merged
20:06 <+ChillerDragon> but i do not make that decision so..
20:06 <+bridge> <Iza> @Learath2 is that something open for discussion?
20:07 <+ChillerDragon> if your motivation is ban tracking or something like that itll just cause botters to downgrade client or bot devs to mod the client
20:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> mac can be faked
20:08 <+ChillerDragon> yes that too
20:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MAC_address_spoofing
20:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> arch wiki
20:08 <+ChillerDragon> ye ik
20:08 <+ChillerDragon> but why spoof if you can just change the open src code xd
20:09 <+ChillerDragon> @Iza for that do you need it?
20:09 <+bridge> <Iza> i've come to the conclusion that alot of botters aren't the brightest light bulbs
20:09 <+ChillerDragon> oh so for that
20:10 <+ChillerDragon> but all bot devs will send random macs
20:10 <+ChillerDragon> so the botters can stay stupid
20:10 <+ChillerDragon> and still bypass
20:11 <+ChillerDragon> also i share a physical device with my brother Konsti and he uses a lot of bots
20:12 <+bridge> <Iza> technically bot devs can spoof anything, and if done right then they can keep the bot client undercover, but its not often done right. Mac address would serve as an extra factor on top of alot of other factors to determine botters and ban evaders
20:12 <+ChillerDragon> yea maybe
20:13 <+ChillerDragon> question is do we want to waste network bandwith, dev time, code complexity, privacy on some finger printing war 
20:13 <+bridge> <Iza> depends
20:13 <+ChillerDragon> i could add it to chillerbot-ux if u want :)
20:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ban
20:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no mention bots
20:13 <+ChillerDragon> hrhr
20:14 <+bridge> <Iza> whats chillerbot ux
20:14 <+ChillerDragon> virus
20:14 <+ChillerDragon> https://chillerbot.github.io/
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> download here
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> xd
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> its my fork of ddnet which has like 1 user
20:15 <+bridge> <Iza> that definitely doesnt look sketchy
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> :p
20:16 <+ChillerDragon> i didnt pay the web dev
20:16 <+ChillerDragon> maybe there could be a ddnet ext msg thats only for fingerprinting
20:16 <+ChillerDragon> and the server can send it if wanted
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> to request all kinds of info that could be extended
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> to start a nice fingerprint war with botters
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> good ol cat and mouse 
20:17 <+bridge> <Voxel> i dont trust using this
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> imo stuff like that can be fun. but ddnet is more on the serious side than on the fun side
20:17 <+bridge> <Iza> sounds like a good war
20:18 <+bridge> <Iza> all this wouldnt be needed if we just had an account system xd
20:18 <+ChillerDragon> oh boi
20:18 <+ChillerDragon> botters just make new accs
20:18 <+bridge> <Iza> ye but it takes time and effort for them
20:18 <+bridge> <Iza> more than our current thing we have
20:18 <+ChillerDragon> and the more time and effort it takes to start playing w out account
20:19 <+ChillerDragon> the more annoying it is for casuals and new players
20:19 <+bridge> <Iza> how would it be more annoying? you just register once, login and play
20:19 <+ChillerDragon> how would it be time and effort to bot? you rust bot, register again, login and play
20:19 <+ChillerDragon> rust* xd
20:19 <+ChillerDragon> axaxax
20:20 <+ChillerDragon> freudian typo
20:20 <+bridge> <Iza> if its an email account system, then they would have to create an email everytime
20:20 <+ChillerDragon> i see
20:20 <+ChillerDragon> or u use the + hack xd
20:20 <+bridge> <Iza> or if its linked with steam, they'd be having to make a new steam account on top of that
20:20 <+ChillerDragon> chillerdragon+bot1@gmail.com
20:21 <+bridge> <Iza> i think you can counter that
20:21 <+ChillerDragon> if steam is needed to play on ddnet id quit ddnet xd
20:22 <+bridge> <Iza> then you're not a true ddnet fan
20:22 <+ChillerDragon> i just play the ddnet version w out steam then i mean
20:24 <+bridge> <Iza> anyway account system would be better in general
20:25 <+bridge> <Iza> for me it takes like 5 seconds to ban a botter, while it takes them several minutes to create a new account
20:25 <+bridge> <Mʎɹ シ> Accounts in ddnet :justatest:
20:26 <+ChillerDragon> how do you even know someone is a botter?
20:26 <+bridge> <Iza> several factors which i won't discuss about
20:26 <+ChillerDragon> wow..
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> just transform those factors into code and auto ban
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> then it takes 0 seconds
20:27 <+bridge> <Iza> im not a dev
20:27 <+ChillerDragon> then discuss the factors in this dev channel xd
20:27 <+bridge> <Mʎɹ シ> Checksum I think
20:28 <+ChillerDragon> is it even sent?
20:28 <+bridge> <Iza> that would give bot client devs the opportunity to note it, like this individual @Mʎɹ シ
20:28 <+bridge> <Mʎɹ シ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1055910874566627352.png?quality=lossless&size=48
20:28 <+ChillerDragon> ah u mean in the finger print thingy
20:28 <+ChillerDragon> yea
20:31 <+bridge> <Mʎɹ シ> I think it hard for spoof, I tried, need spoof a lot of stuff, then yea, It can be used for auto ban I think
21:00 <+bridge> <gerdoe> kinda stupid thing to solve in open-source
21:00 <+bridge> <gerdoe> quake had the same problem after making code public
21:01 <+bridge> <Learath2> this sort of protection is pointless for an opensource game, it's just a single line to edit out in the code, trivially bypassed, and old clients won't even support it
21:01 <+bridge> <gerdoe> carmack just said "open-source preventing antibot is useless" and went straight with closed sourced antibot check
21:01 <+bridge> <Learath2> There is not much point to discussing it as it'd be useless no matter how you look at it, malicious people just won't update their clients or use a "cracked" one
21:02 <+bridge> <gerdoe> http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/quake-cheats.html
21:03 <+bridge> <gerdoe> 1999 -> 2023
21:03 <+bridge> <gerdoe> 24 years passed
21:03 <+bridge> <gerdoe> like
21:03 <+bridge> <gerdoe> there is no actual solution
21:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> heyt
21:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> you quoted a good blog
21:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i recommend reading this http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html
21:04 <+bridge> <gerdoe> i remember you sent this like year ago
21:04 <+bridge> <gerdoe> or half year ago
21:05 <+bridge> <gerdoe> alzheimer
21:05 <+bridge> <gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1103396922858934412/image.png
21:05 <+bridge> <Iza> lol
21:06 <+bridge> <Iza> ye i see protecting an open source software from unwanted code like cheats is not something easy fixable
21:07 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> yep
21:07 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its that good
21:07 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it aligns with what i think so hard
21:08 <+bridge> <Learath2> honestly, the only approach that is even worth pursuing imho is the approach noby took, try detect it at the server
21:09 <+bridge> <gerdoe> noby antichots is not perfect either, you should monitor every value and use nobybot to test them :troll:
21:09 <+bridge> <Learath2> Supplement it with accounts so you can make it extra annoying for banned people to evade
21:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> >  To follow the path:
21:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> >     look to the master,
21:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> >     follow the master,
21:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> >     walk with the master,
21:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> >     see through the master,
21:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> >     become the master.
21:10 <+bridge> <gerdoe> yeah master branch
21:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> change master to "ddnet dev"
21:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
21:11 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ddnet server coding is easy until you don't need any external resources xd
21:11 <+bridge> <gerdoe> so you should mess up with client
21:12 <+bridge> <Iza> i see you're pro account
21:12 <+bridge> <Iza> btw are accounts still being discussed or is it settled?
21:13 <+bridge> <Learath2> I'm not only pro account, I'm pro annoying accounts as well, add multiple layers of verification
21:13 <+bridge> <gerdoe> accounts are always discussed xd
21:13 <+bridge> <gerdoe> but never done
21:13 <+bridge> <Iza> yess that would be so good
21:13 <+bridge> <gerdoe> its a move for ddnet 2 (written in rust^tm)
21:13 <+bridge> <gerdoe> !rust
21:13 < chillerbot> @Ryozuki
21:14 <+bridge> <Learath2> I imagine a day where you can set a server +m<n> where n is the level required to chat, 0 only requiring an account, 1 requiring a verified email, 2 requiring linked steam, 3 requiring verified phone
21:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 4 requiring a ddnet code contribution
21:15 <+bridge> <Learath2> But it's all a dream, we are too privacy conscious to ever do phone verification
21:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 5 praying to stallman
21:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 6 using gentoo
21:15 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 7 asserting rust over C
21:16 <+bridge> <Learath2> My true dream is governments letting us do zero-knowledge real person verification. That would be soo, soo good
21:16 <+bridge> <gerdoe> how to store any sensitive personal information tho
21:17 <+bridge> <Learath2> Use a bot client, bye banned forever. If you want to get back in you write a 300 word essay apologizing to all members of the community
21:17 <+bridge> <gerdoe> i mean data leaks every day from different spots of our planet
21:17 <+bridge> <Iza> 👍
21:17 <+bridge> <gerdoe> its so hard it seems
21:18 <+bridge> <gerdoe> happening*
21:18 <+bridge> <Iza> btw how did the last attempt to implement accounts fail?
21:18 <+bridge> <Learath2> but alas, it's all a dream, zero-knowledge real person verifications are not a thing and I'm the only one that thinks they aren't draconian
21:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its possible
21:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> with a goverment backend ofc
21:19 <+bridge> <Learath2> I think deen wanted to make a simple account system with ddnet2 but people wanted too much from ddnet2 in exchange for letting us have accounts
21:20 <+bridge> <Chairn> usually it's the other way around, at least at the hardware level
21:20 <+bridge> <Iza> how about we make implementing an account system, not ddnet2
21:20 <+bridge> <Iza> its just ddnet with accounts, no further discussion needed
21:20 <+bridge> <Chairn> like 0 is machine level, you can do absolutely everything, 1 is os level, 3 is user level
21:20 <+bridge> <Learath2> The old guard wants cake in exchange for their ranks not being moved to their new accounts
21:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thats the rings
21:21 <+bridge> <bencie> couldve just not taken all the advice as features that we want immediately, but just take it slowly, implement a basic account system and the build upon it from the ideas given by the community
21:21 <+bridge> <Chairn> actually, i'd be ok to reset everything as long as old ranks are still accessible somewhere
21:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im also okay with it as long as i can flaunt i was in the old days
21:21 <+bridge> <Iza> i just hit 10k points and i also would be okay with a reset
21:21 <+bridge> <Chairn> or this 😄
21:21 <+bridge> <Learath2> You don't have enough ranks to matter, are you even r1 in an insane? Opinion rejected
21:21 <+bridge> <Chairn> i used to though
21:22 <+bridge> <Chairn> i think i was r1 on Hellcore for some time
21:22 <+bridge> <Learath2> Get it back and we can talk about it
21:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i was r1 on arabic nights
21:22 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> someone stole it
21:23 <+bridge> <Chairn> if you reset ranks first, i can get it back faster \*taps head\*
21:24 <+bridge> <Chairn> how many ranks btw? im not even in top100 points anymore
21:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> reseting might give me motivation to play more actually
21:25 <+bridge> <Chairn> can i get a bonus due to my old ddnet age?
21:25 <+bridge> <Chairn> this year, on 28th of july will mark my 10th anniversary
21:25 <+bridge> <gerdoe> +1, publish demos all declined accepted maps and ranks xd
21:26 <+bridge> <gerdoe> some kind of heinrich's archive
21:26 <+bridge> <Chairn> demos will take huge space
21:26 <+bridge> <Chairn> my folder is already 15+GB
21:26 <+bridge> <Chairn> 11.9GB of demos
21:26 <+bridge> <gerdoe> theyre easily compressed
21:26 <+bridge> <gerdoe> but not in ddnet sizes tho
21:27 <+bridge> <Iza> btw when i think about it, if the bot client would have the line removed, it would just exposed themselves this way
21:27 <+bridge> <gerdoe> like how
21:27 <+bridge> <gerdoe> client-side protection is no gain
21:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> compress
21:27 <+bridge> <Learath2> Idk, you need to ask the current r1 holders if they consider your opinion valid
21:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> with lzma
21:27 <+bridge> <Chairn> ok, zip 9 reduces demos size by 75%
21:27 <+bridge> <gerdoe> server-side protection is too hard to since all inputs are known
21:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> zip bad
21:28 <+bridge> <Chairn> sorry, im on windows only
21:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oof
21:28 <+bridge> <gerdoe> 7z
21:28 <+bridge> <Chairn> zstd probably better
21:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> dont talk to me or my kids
22:41 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> What happens to ger10 stats?
23:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's really pointless, open-source or not
23:32 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the program asks the operating system for the mac address, I'm sure there are plenty of "mac address spoofers" out there that lie to the program on behalf of you
23:38 <+bridge> <Iza> i'm thinking about how many of the botters would actually do that, when half of them dont even change their ingame name when evading
23:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> once you start banning for it, every one of them
23:40 <+bridge> <Iza> they would need to have a good amount of knowledge about what ddnet is sending to the server, and on top of that, how to spoof their mac address
23:40 <+bridge> <Iza> and speaking from my experience, not alot of them have a good amount of knowledge
23:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> which they get from the cheat developer
23:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if they don't know a lot, you can simply IP ban them
23:41 <+bridge> <Iza> most of them know one thing, and its to restart the router for a new ip address tho
23:41 <+bridge> <Iza> i mean, everyone knows that
23:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, and why do they know it?
23:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because they need it to evade a ban
23:42 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if you somehow manage the impossible task of transferring the mac address of the network card to the ddnet server, guess what everyone will learn?
23:42 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the same way people learn how to change their IP address
23:42 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I mean, it might be a good teaching opportunity, I guess 😉
23:43 <+bridge> <Iza> how are they going to be able to pinpoint on what exactly exposed them?
23:43 <+bridge> <Iza> what if they think they're ip range banned
23:43 <+bridge> <Iza> or what if they think, the antibot system detected them again
23:43 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because it just takes a single person to figure that out
23:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> and then distribute that knowledge with the cheat client
23:45 <+bridge> <Iza> there's alot of rather obvious stuff that the bot users and bot devs dont know yet. I'd take the chance to add a new fingerprint factor and see what happens
23:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because we aren't autobanning for it
23:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ok, onto more practical factors
23:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> 1) the mac address thing will just be spoofed by bot clients directly
23:47 <+bridge> <Iza> i didnt suggest autoban for it, just additional server info that can get dumped for the mods
23:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> 2) this has privacy implications that I don't think we should shoulder
23:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> just by discussing it here, people are going to know about it when we add it
23:48 <+bridge> <Iza> maybe with that, they will unknowingly create a pattern which is detectable for us
23:48 <+bridge> <Iza> it could happen
23:48 <+bridge> <Iza> i dont see mac address much of a privacy breach
23:48 <+bridge> <Iza> its a randomized number depending on your hardware
23:48 <+bridge> <Iza> and drivers
23:49 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's constant for a single person
23:49 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not dependent on your drivers, only for your hardware
23:49 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not dependent on your drivers, only on your hardware
23:49 <+bridge> <Iza> the moderators already get much more privacy breaching information besides mac address
23:50 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> we're already in breach of the gdpr, let's make it worse?
23:50 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't get that argument
23:52 <+bridge> <Iza> i dont get why mac address would be a privacy breach, it doesn't correlate to any location, personal info or anything else
23:52 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/what-is-personal-data/can-we-identify-an-individual-indirectly/
23:52 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > If an individual can be identified from that MAC address, or other information in the possession of the network operator (the business, in this example), then the data is personal data. Additionally, even if the business does not know the name of the individual, using a MAC address (or other unique identifier) to track a device with the purpose of singling out that individual or treating them differently means the data is also personal data.
23:54 <+bridge> <Iza> im not an expert on the uk gdpr, i just made a suggestion that would make some things much easier for moderators
23:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> thanks for making that suggestion
