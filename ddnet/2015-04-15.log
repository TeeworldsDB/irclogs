00:39 < fstd> :)
00:39 <@deen> anyone having ideas for a new GER server? =/
00:40 <@deen> in Frankfurt, with DDoS protection and a direct line to Deutsche Telekom
00:40 < fstd> block server!
00:41 <@deen> because the current one has ping 100 for 2 hours every day for 50% of German users
00:41 <@deen> no, i mean a server hoster
00:41 <@deen> we have enough block servers already :P
00:41 < fstd> ah.  can't have enough of those ;)
00:42 < fstd> they probably receive the bulkload of DDoS, right?
00:42 <@deen> i don't know who causes the ddos attacks
00:42 <@deen> haven't had any for some time
00:43 <@deen> but when we switch servers they'll try out the new ddos protection 100%
00:43 < fstd> oh, i thought it was still an ongoing thing
00:43 <@deen> well, maybe it is, but don't even notice small attacks
00:44 <@deen> now the problem is that Deutsche Telekom overloads all their lines in Frankfurt, except exclusive ones
00:44 <@deen> GTT and Cogent are totally overloaded at the same time, and those are the two we can switch between
00:47 < fstd> what about other places where DT has peerings?
00:47 <@deen> other places than Frankfurt?
00:47 <@deen> I prefer Frankfurt because it has great connections to all of Europe
00:47 < fstd> yes.  i realize why ff is preferrable, but it would probably not make /that/ much of a difference
00:48 <@deen> we tried Strasbourg, people complained about +20 ping
00:48 <@deen> and some have +100
00:48 < fstd> amsterdam?
00:48 < fstd> they have AMS-IX, big thing
00:48 <@deen> +20 for most of Germany I think
00:48 <@deen> and that's half our players
00:49 <@deen> but it also depends on the hoster, would have to test it
00:49 <@deen> i just had the best experiences with frankfurt
00:54 <@deen> I guess I'll write some mails to hosters
04:06 < eeeee> hey guys, can you pls test the latest build of js client? http://ddnet.qwe123.info/
04:06 < eeeee> k thx
11:33 <@deen> eeeee: only see chilean servers in internet tab, then switched to ddnet tab and also saw GER
11:33 <@deen> connecting took 30 seconds
11:34 <@deen> graphics are broken, just black boxes for hammer, stars etc
11:47 <@deen> mouse pointer isn't caught
16:01 < o_be_one> hi all
19:17 <@deen> hi o_be_one 
19:47 < o_be_one> hey :) whatsup ?
20:31 <@deen> nothing, tired
22:01 < eeeee> uh you were not supposed to use ddnet tab
22:01 < eeeee> guess i'll just remove it
22:01 <@deen> well, then i only find chilean servers
22:01 < eeeee> you likely have Novice filter on :/
22:01 <@deen> Really need a new server in GER
22:02 <@deen> but with Novice filter on I found the GER servers in ddnet tab
22:02 <@deen> tried again 5 min later and same
22:02 < eeeee> huh
22:02 < eeeee> can you double check that you don't have filters?
22:03 < eeeee> and also tell me number of servers/players that client reports
22:03 <@deen> 133 servers, 148 players
22:03 <@deen> but most report 0 players
22:03 <@deen> that's weird
22:04 < eeeee> oh yea, i see
22:04 < eeeee> that's definitely a bug, thx
22:04 < eeeee> fstd: ^
22:07 < fstd> D:
22:07 < fstd> eh, your endpoint seems rekt
22:07 < eeeee> o noes
22:08 < fstd> can you check what's going on?  also before you kill it, make copies of /tmp/nctun*
22:10 < eeeee> deen: can you help me debug the black boxes thing? if you can go into your browser's developer tools and look into the network tab it would be very useful
22:12 <@deen> eeeee: i reloaded the website and the problem disappeared
22:12 < eeeee> k, would have to make it retry or sth
22:12 < eeeee> does the pointer lock now?
22:13 <@deen> no
22:13 <@deen> i move my mouse and suddenly i press some buttons in other windows
22:18 < eeeee> what is your browser version?
22:18 < eeeee> can you also take a look into the browser console?
22:18 < eeeee> just see if there are any errors
22:18 <@deen> firefox 37 with a clean profile
22:19 <@deen> ah, there is a "hide pointer" popup
22:20 <@deen> maybe I just clicked it away instead of clicking on "hide pointer"
22:20 <@deen> i also have ping 1000 now, weird
22:20 <@deen> but pointer seems locked
22:21 < eeeee> okay, thx
22:23 <@deen> Ah, you can select "always allow pointer hiding", then it's pretty usable
22:24 < eeeee> the serverlist should also be fixed now
22:27 <@deen> nice
22:27 < eeeee> so if you don't click on ddnet tab then connecting to a server should be pretty quick
22:28 <@deen> yes, 3 seconds
22:28 <@deen> connections are still proxied through some other server?
22:29 <@deen> hm no
22:29 <@deen> my ping depends on the size of my window
22:29 <@deen> 190 with 1920x1080
22:29 <@deen> i guess people with real gpus won't have a problem^^
22:30 < eeeee> yeah or after i start doing some webworkers stuff
22:31 < eeeee> currently you can't do rendering from a webworker though. not sure if you can do websockets from webworkers either. but they're supposedly working on it
22:31 < eeeee> making games in browsers really is hard :(
22:37 <@deen> sure sounds like it =/
