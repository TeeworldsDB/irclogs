02:40 < test_> h
02:42 <@deen> i
12:14 < DMTee> hola
12:15 < DMTee> Deen are u here?
12:16 < DMTee> just have a question. since 3 days i dont have the german ddnet servers anymore but i know they are online. Do i have a ban or something like that?
12:16 <@deen> hi DMTee 
12:16 <@deen> no, no one is banned
12:16 < DMTee> hi
12:16 <@deen> can you ping ger.ddnet.tw?
12:16 < DMTee> wait
12:18 <@deen> where do you look for the servers? serverbrowser? ddnet tab?
12:18 <@deen> can you connect directly to ger.ddnet.tw:8303?
12:19 < DMTee> how do i ping? :D
12:19 < DMTee> ti look for the servers in ddnet client
12:20 <@deen> open cmd.exe and type "ping ger.ddnet.tw"
12:20 < DMTee> Zeit√ºberschreitung der anforderung
12:20 <@deen> so somehow you're not reaching our server
12:20 <@deen> that's weird
12:20 <@EastByte> hello DMTee 
12:20 < DMTee> but just the germans
12:21 < DMTee> they east
12:21 <@deen> can you ping this? 95.172.92.149
12:21 < DMTee> no
12:22 <@deen> so you're having no connection to the entire Frankfurt datacenter of nfoservers
12:22 <@deen> tracert ger.ddnet.tw
12:22 < DMTee> so CIA is watching me? ;D
12:22 <@deen> someone is screwing up on the way from your provider to nfoservers
12:23 < DMTee> oh wait i can use the standart client maybe it changes something
12:23 <@deen> you can try, but if you can't even ping, it won't change anything
12:24 < DMTee> u are right
12:24 <@deen> You can inform your provider of the problem. And also nfoservers, DDNet GER's hoster: http://www.nfoservers.com/contactus.php
12:25 < DMTee> haha i cant even load the nserver site :D
12:25 <@deen> ouch
12:25 <@deen> that site is in the USA
12:25 <@deen> so you probably have connection problems to the entire Internap network
12:26 <@deen> http://www.internap.com/
12:26 <@deen> This site working?
12:26 < DMTee> yes
12:26 <@deen> I think the way to go is to write an email to support@nfoservers.com with your own IP address and the description that you can't reach their Frankfurt server and website
12:27 < DMTee> ok thx alot deen :)
12:27 <@EastByte> DMTee: you also might restart your router
12:27 < DMTee> i have a static provider ip i think
12:27 <@EastByte> eh okay
12:27 < DMTee> it doesnt change anything
12:32 < DMTee> i think u have knowledge about it
12:32 < DMTee> do static ips from providers change sometimes like once a day or a week?
12:32 <@EastByte> it doesn't change if it's static
12:32 <@deen> with most providers in Germany you get a new dynamic ip whenever you reconnect and you're forced to reconnect at least every 24 hours
12:33 < DMTee> i try again
12:36 < DMTee> no i reconnect and its still the same 158.181.84.165
19:32 < DMTee> nabend
19:34 < DMTee> just a nother regarding to my Ip problem and the frankfurt servers. have u changed servers in the last time or did anything changed in the last week?
19:35 < DMTee> @ denn
19:35 < DMTee> @ deen
19:41 <@deen> no
19:46 < laxa> DMTee: [19:41:55] <@deen> no
19:46 < DMTee> ok thx
21:42 <@deen> laxa: hey, you have access to ddmax maps?
21:42 < laxa> No
21:42 < laxa> Or maybe
21:42 < laxa> why ?
21:44 <@deen> Plans
21:44 <@heinrich5991> deen: if you have the names, I can give you the maps
21:44 <@deen> heinrich5991: the problem is that ddmax used to change maps sometimes without announcing, so it would be hard to say which is the most recent version
21:45 <@heinrich5991> yea
21:45 <@deen> but basically it's 8 months or more since Tsin promised to bring ddmax back and nothing happened
21:45 <@deen> and we want to rescue the maps into something like "oldschool", but for ddmax
21:45 <@deen> so they're not lost forever
21:45 <@deen> now even the website is gone
21:45 < laxa> deen: yup, still got ftp access
21:46 <@deen> cool
21:46 <@deen> lets wait for saavik to make the proposal on forum
21:47 < laxa> but, better doing anything, I'd better ask noother for his approval
21:47 < laxa> *before
21:47 <@deen> yeah, I was just asking because Saavik thought the maps may already be lost forever
21:48 < laxa> Well, ftp is still running on the same IP, all maps are there
21:49 < laxa> deen: I am currently downloading everything
21:49 < laxa> Hum...
21:50 < laxa> Now that I think of it, I'd better put this on my server...
21:50 < laxa> Well, I'll upload it on my server this night
21:55 <@deen> even if we don't get to host "ddmax" server, would be nice to put them online somewhere, so they're not lost
22:19 < laxa> deen: remember me to upload maps at around 00:30 or something ^^
22:26 <@deen> Lady can do that :P
22:26 < Lady> no
22:26 < Lady> I will be in my bed
22:27 < Lady> I have to wake up early and sleep is important!
23:44 <@deen> There you go: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1253&p=12261
23:45 < Learath2> deen: that should be a poll i guess ?
23:48 <@deen> yeah yeah, ok
23:48 <@deen> I don't like polls, but ok
23:48 <@deen> people already make videos to call others to vote in polls
23:50 <@deen> there you go, poll
