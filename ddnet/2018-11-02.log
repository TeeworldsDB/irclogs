04:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlushA_Go> @TcTc ddnet emotes haven't sound
04:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlushA_Go> you can add sound for emotes in gamecontext.cpp
07:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> emote sound? xYr
07:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> emote sound? xD
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlushA_Go> Yes
07:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ??? Xd
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Chairn yeah, that's intentional to get the bottom 5
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Need some help here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1371
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://discourse.libsdl.org/t/sdl-2-0-9-released/25228 2.0.9 doesnt fix anything audio related
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen 2.0.8 added this for audio on windows
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Implemented WASAPI support on Windows UWP and removed the deprecated XAudio2 implementation
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     Added resampling support on WASAPI on Windows 7 and above
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i think it has no relation
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @deen but it's not coherent with top5 behaviour where last time is down
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so you always start looking at the wrong time when doing -1
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hehe
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found the fix!
12:48 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Ryozuki opened pull request #1372: Fix windows sound (master...pr_fix_windows_sound) https://git.io/fxx1a
13:19 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to master: https://git.io/fxxDV
13:19 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master d9d3ed7 Ryozuki: fix windows sound
13:19 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 5ad48da Dennis Felsing: Merge pull request #1372 from Ryozuki/pr_fix_windows_sound...
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 4.5.1?
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ?
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 11.4.5.1?
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no sound is rly annoying
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so a new version should come
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe I should upgrade SDL2 as well while at it
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i can test it then
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> actually maybe we should check library versions more often
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well sdl doesnt update that frequently
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe others do
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i think there are no perfomance improvements, they add new things
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> curl was updated too
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which we dont use
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (on sdl)
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but also bug fixes?
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i'm mostly interested in security and bug fixes
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2.0.9 has a bugfix
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on macos
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Fixed black screen at start on Mac OS X Mojave
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2.0.6 mainly adds vulkan support and the new audio driver for windows
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which doesnt work for us and we have to use directsound
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, why isn't it working though?
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i don't know
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=__open__&content=audio&no_redirect=1&order=Importance&product=SDL&query_format=specific
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see a big red bug report there
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if its related
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4066
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this one fits ur descriptiong of wine right
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "WASAPI: No sound on Windows 10, glitchy playback under Wine 1.6.2 (Windows 7), and a choppy playback when processing powerful music codecs."
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my fix is there
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/507895594073980938/unknown.png
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its a sdl bug
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not ours
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ™‚
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> meh
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but thanks
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pickle Rick> Are there any things that should be done on the kode? ðŸ¤”
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pickle Rick> Are there any things that should be done on the kode? :tee_thinking:
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> kode?
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pickle Rick> Code

14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pickle Rick bugs and suggestions are here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pickle Rick> O all right, why is def- pushing every commit on its own though O_o?
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pickle Rick> That kills the purpose of Git
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> how so?
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The purpose of git is to have a version history and decentralized development
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pickle Rick> Yes, it's version control after all, but what makes git different than others is that you can have version control offline(decentralised, as you said). As such version control, you are supposed to commit changes on your local machine until everything works properly and you achieve what you wanted and then push it to the server either to
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pickle Rick> 1) Make it public
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pickle Rick> 2) Have a copy of your data
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, every change on its own works
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pickle Rick> Well well, from my own experience I know that's not true :^)
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's not like I pushed a half-finished feature
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pickle Rick> If their first commit was finished work, they wouldn't be pushing anymore, wouldn't they?
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pickle Rick> I did the same before, if I had 5 files, I'd edit one, commit and push O_o
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pickle Rick> I did the same before, if I had 5 files, I'd edit one, commit and push and repeat for all of them O_o

15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont spam
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont know if its a bug or intended, but my ddnet-info json file updates on the second launch of tw. (i started tw, no update available, closed it, opened again, update available) i had this also with the ddnet info tab which is also from that file. does the client only overwrite the content of info page and update available if the client starts with an "updated" json file and n <message clipped>
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It should overwrite if it just downloaded it
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Pickle Rick He does only push when it works, we all just push when it works. Each commit doesn't really have to be "Working" only each push does
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 doesnt... noticed it the second time now
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Close the client, delete ddnet-info.json and the tmp one
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Start again, what's the behaviour?
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there is no tmp
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i deleted the json file and then the client just downloaded a new one
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (info is written, etc)
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes but did it immediately use it?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> now if you quit the client, start it again it doesn't update the news?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont know
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i guess its fixed
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will write again if i have any issues during the next weeks
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> @FlushA_Go how can I do that. Would u be able give me the c++ code for it
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TcTc doubt he has any. You'd prolly need to code it up yourself
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> @Learath2 I think I saw this feature in an unofficial serverðŸ¤”
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you can ask whoever made it ðŸ˜ƒ
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlushA_Go> @TcTc ddnet persian ?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> @FlushA_Go umm I'm not sure mate
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlushA_Go> Ok, forget my question
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlushA_Go> @TcTc 
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlushA_Go> find 
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlushA_Go> ```switch(pMsg->m_Emoticon)```
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlushA_Go> In game/server/gamecontext.cpp 
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlushA_Go> You can write your playsound in any case you want
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> @FlushA_Go what's the function in order to play that emote sound in client?
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlushA_Go> I don't remember what was function's name but search in character.cpp for soundplay or playsound you can find some examples
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> @FlushA_Go ok thanks for you help
