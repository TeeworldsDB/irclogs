02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen is it normal that on the funding page sponsored servers appear as if not completely covered?

09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this doesnt look right
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :tee_thinking:
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wdym
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Ryozuki
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao see the second rank
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it compares it to a min 7 rank
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but previous is 5:42
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because they beat their own rank
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> only 1 teamrank per team is saved
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt see it, cuz their names are in different order for some reason
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ¥´
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 yeah, some people didn't pay the full amount to sponsor a server
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> mostly they just pay the difference that is still shown as unpaid, but this leads to rebalancing the funding to other servers
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 teamstate in ddnetplayer when
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, I thought we showed directed donations specifically
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When heinrich or I have time to figure out the upgradable netobjs
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/rui314/mold
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> good pfp
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyone know where the modauth.html page went?
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah found it
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 here?
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 well, these donations were directed at the specific server. Basically "Hey, here's 40 â‚¬ to fully cover the rest of GER1"
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 here!
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 `(void)Uninitialized; // We need a reference for the next line.` why is this needed?
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because compare_exchange_strong takes a reference
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it was causing an unused variable error
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's concerning, if that dbg_assert is getting optimized/compiled out the code isn't correct, is it?
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> uhm, is dbg_assert optimized out?
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It shouldn't be, so it shouldn't ever trigger the unused variable error
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I assumed it wouldn't get optimized out
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we atleast talked about making it no-op in release mode
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/908646eea54c3a551263dbb192f9118dd938092d/src/base/system.h#L49-L53
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're right
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ouch
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how much wrong code have I pushed to the repo? ^^
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/a6e144ea72be5892490ecfe7b6137888f04b39dc
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think this is a good ideaÂ ðŸ˜¦
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Me neither
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> asserts are there because things are in an inconsistent state
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you continue, bad stuff will happen
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it's common enough to disable asserts that I wonder what the counterargument is
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "speed" "less crashes"
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd guess
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I think I'm okay with your mysql PR if you fix the asserts
