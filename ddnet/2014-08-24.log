01:41 < Maple> teeworlds source is so confusing
01:43 < Maple> theres a guy who did an interesting mod

01:48 <@deen> no idea
01:48 <@deen> i've never been on there
01:53 <@deen> Maple: Good luck with computer science!
01:58 < Maple> thanks
02:02 < Maple> no one on teamspeak really
02:02 < Maple> except one afk guy
02:02 < Maple> other channels are passworded
02:29 <@deen> Now DDNet has moderators: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=348

06:08 < _KinG> hi
06:08 < _KinG> deen: u there?
06:50 < _KinG> deen: contact me when u are here
09:29 < KinG_> deen: u there?
12:14 <@deen> hi
12:14 <@deen> bor: Do you know what KinG wanted?
13:23 <@deen> ok, talked to him (and evil saeid)
13:39 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/R6N2Vw
13:39 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 3edd1bb def: Fix client crash when holding space and adding a group in editor
14:16 < bor> deen: sry i was afk
14:16 <@deen> no problem
14:17 < bor> he had some questions about whether or not 512MB would work
14:17 <@deen> yes, should work
14:17 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/status
14:17 <@deen> Look RUS server, it has 256 MB
14:17 < bor> i noticed in package list you gave me , you specified mariaDB , which is a SQL server , can we use another sql server (on another vps) ?
14:18 <@deen> no, needs to mariaDB
14:18 <@deen> why another vps?
14:18 <@deen> I have a rather complex setup to keep the databases synchronized
14:18 <@deen> worldwide
14:18 < bor> i already have mysql installed and have some 10GB ram vps on germany 
14:18 <@deen> Yeah, but Germany is too far away
14:18 <@deen> stuff like /top5 would be slow
14:19 <@deen> and when there is no connection from Iran to Germany, then ranks are not saved at all
14:19 <@deen> that's why i always want database running on localhost
14:19 <@deen> but initially i would actually use the GER database
14:19 < bor> the ping is about 150-200ms max , i wouldn't mind if it takes 1/5sec to show /top5 if it would mean more free ram where we need it most
14:19 <@deen> only after the server runs fine for 1 week or 2 i set up a database
14:20 <@deen> bor: i tried that a lot in the last year, and it's very very sad when suddenly ranks are not working
14:20 <@deen> players play, finish maps, and all for nothing
14:20 < evil_saeid> hi
14:20 <@deen> hi
14:20 <@deen> also, it will be no problem, as it also works on RUS
14:20 < evil_saeid> which version of linux you wanna for vps ?!
14:21 <@deen> evil_saeid: as i said, I'm already getting a Linux server
14:21 <@deen> but generally Debian is preferred, then Centos
14:21 < evil_saeid> i know , i just wanna know to later 
14:22 < evil_saeid> what about cloud ?! cloud 6 , 5 ?
14:22 <@deen> no idea what that is
14:22 < bor> i would probably get an ubuntu server , because i'm most familiar with that.
14:23 <@deen> hmmm
14:23 < evil_saeid> cloud linux 6 !! vps service offer me it !
14:23 <@deen> but ubuntu needs a lot of RAM i think
14:23 <@deen> never heard of "cloud linux"
14:23 < evil_saeid> :D OK
14:24 < bor> why do you think ubuntu needs a lot of ram ? i have one installed in vmware now (my own pc) , its working fine with 512mb ram
14:24 <@deen> bor: i had a few ubuntu servers and they needed more ram from what i remember
14:25 < bor> i have programs required for my website + webmin + firewall set up and it is using only 117MB ram right now
14:25 <@deen> yeah, but minimal debian is like 5-10 MB RAM^^
14:26 <@deen> anyway, ubuntu is probably fine
14:26 < bor> worst case scenario is that we ask the vps provider to format it and install debian , 
14:27 < bor> how much ram does mariaDB use ?
14:30 <@deen> bor: depends on how performant i want it to be
14:30 <@deen> 30 MB is enough
14:31 < bor> Hmm , than it should be fine on the localhost , i thought it would use a lot more , mysql is using 500MB+ram on my germany vps
14:31 < bor> although i did set it on high performance 
16:11 < evil_saeid> hello deen you here ?
16:15 < EastByte> deen: huffman.nim finaly seem to work
18:59 < EastByte> ah didn't notice there are mods now
19:00 < EastByte> let's see how this works
20:13 <@deen> EastByte: yeah, we will see
20:19 < EastByte> I'm getting a ddrace pro :D
20:19 < EastByte> at some time everyone will call me "east the legend" :)
20:23 <@deen> DDRace is awesome =)
20:23 <@deen> so much fun and playing together
20:23 < EastByte> deen: I think it would be a good idea to add a self kill protection for players which are currently long racing
20:23 < EastByte> deen: you are just spectating xd
20:23 <@deen> EastByte: Hey, I used to race
20:24 < EastByte> so you are a legend
20:24 <@deen> I'm still rank 11 on ddracemax global rankings :P
20:24 < EastByte> xd
20:24 <@deen> when i race for long i always unbind kill
20:24 < EastByte> same here
20:24 <@deen> but if you have a good idea for a protection, would be nice
20:25 <@deen> something server side
20:25 <@deen> so when you time is > 30 min and you kill it prints one of the yellow messages
20:25 <@deen> "If you really want to kill, press kill again"
20:25 < EastByte> ^
21:43 < Savander> or
21:44 < Savander> when you time is > 30
21:45 < Savander> "If you want to kill, say /kill on chat"
21:53 <@deen> EastByte and his self-killing friend want to solve this
21:57 < EastByte> deen: duno whether he can code :P
22:09 < Savander> deen: 
22:10 < Savander> You got a minute?
22:12 <@deen> hi
22:12 <@deen> Savander: what's wrong?
22:54 < Savander> deen:  ;]
23:26 < EastByte> hm I could've used the 3 hours for coding
23:27 < Savander> btw
23:27 < Savander> i don't think so
23:27 < Savander> someone had a bind
23:27 < Savander> say /kill
23:27 <@deen> EastByte: hahaha
23:27 < Savander> s
23:27 <@deen> 22:50 <Savander> How i can send you code? i make kill protection
23:27 <@deen> 22:50 <Savander> simple, if you want see come to me 
23:27 <@deen> 22:50 <Savander> ;p
23:27 <@deen> 23:23 <deen> back
23:27 <@deen> 23:25 <Savander> https://github.com/savander/ddnet/commit/1577201364bfbf90765f9d48143cb72511cb3395
23:27 <@deen> 23:25 <Savander> don't know
23:27 <@deen> 23:25 <Savander> how to pull
23:27 <@deen> 23:26 <deen> Aren't there people who have a bind for /kill?
23:28 < EastByte> ehh
23:29 < EastByte> that's not a chat command?
23:30 < EastByte> why do you want to add kill as a chat command
23:30 <@deen> yeah, i don't like it much either
23:31 <@deen> i think hitting kill twice would be good enough?
23:34 < EastByte> but the warning should be clearly to see
23:34 < Savander> don't know,It's your decision
23:34 < EastByte> the problem is, noone is going to bind to /kill
23:34 < EastByte> because of other mods
23:35 < Savander> and its good, i guess. If you play more than 30 minutes~~
23:35 < Savander> it's not too hard say /kill if you really want to kill
23:36 < EastByte> ah I failed to understand the patch
23:36 < Savander> ?
23:37 < EastByte> didn't see the OnMessage thingie
23:37 < Savander> lol
23:37 < Savander> east
23:37 < Savander> join to mee
23:37 < Savander> it's not too hard say /kill if you really want to kill
23:37 < Savander> what
23:41 < EastByte> okay it crashes on /kill
23:41 < Savander> Wow
23:41 < Savander> wants wrong
23:41 < Savander> xD
23:41 < EastByte> you failed to implement a kill command, well done :3
23:41 < Savander> previously there were no problems
23:41 < Savander> tested xD, weird
23:41 < EastByte> welcome
23:42 < Savander> btw
23:42 < Savander> what you do?
23:42 < Savander> just ./kill
23:42 < Savander> ?
23:43 < EastByte> I think so
23:43 < EastByte> u told me
23:43 < Savander> ah
23:43 < Savander> I KNOW
23:43 < Savander> i guess
23:43 < Savander> xd
23:43 < EastByte> that sounds promising
23:48 < Savander> ye
23:48 < Savander> i know.. why
23:48 < Savander> 1 minute
23:56 < EastByte> 8 minutes now >:D
23:56 <@deen> haha
