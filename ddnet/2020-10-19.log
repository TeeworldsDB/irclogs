12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The asan/ubsan on real servers is a great success already. I want to expand it to run more servers with it. I'm wondering if we can also do something like that for client.
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe I should start by running asan client myself all the time
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt slow down server?
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats great
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it does
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but GER2 is strong enough, doesn't matter much
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> on others I wouldn't do it
12:36 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> How do I run DDNet-Server with asan? I'm trying to get the same reports to check if I fix them.
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```

12:40 < ultimatum> need help with the client
12:40 <@deen> ultimatum: what's wrong?
12:41 <+ultimatum> when i open the client, the loading screen pops up then suddenly in crashes
12:41 <+ultimatum> this is only happening right now
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ @Learath2 want to help with debugging ^?
12:42 <@deen> Since you write on IRC, can you compile your own Debug client and run it in gdb? OS?
12:43 <+ultimatum> I need help it wont open to the interface just the loading screen then it crash without any crash message
12:43 <+ultimatum> windows 10
12:43 <+ultimatum> gdb?
12:43 <@deen> ah, you're not a developer, too bad :D
12:43 <@deen> Visual Studio Debugger would also work
12:43 <@deen> Try writing gfx_major_version 1 in your settings_ddnet.cfg (in config_dir.bat) and then starting client
12:44 <+ultimatum> ok ill do the gfx
12:45 <+ultimatum> its still doesnt open until the interface
12:46 <+ultimatum> i can put the application error of windows event if you like that?
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, we don't have symbols to read the windows error report
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ultimatum if you have some free time, it would be great if we could build it on your computer and see why it crashes
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It doesn't happen on any of our machines so we can't debug it on ours
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you don't have time, just leave the windows report, maybe I can reverse engineer a bit to figure out the addresses
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ultimate: 
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> can you try a clean version:
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-nightly-win64.zip
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and maybe press Windows + r -> %APPDATA%/Teeworlds and rename the config
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ultimatum: also, are you using the auto update(the updater in the client) or steam version
13:11 <+ultimatum> i tried everything XD cant seem to complete the opening process of the client...
13:17 <+ultimatum> is there an application that visualizes all the content data? maybe that file is corrupted because i can open teeworld client just fine..
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well just try a complete clean client
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> extract the whole zip, rename the Teeworlds folder in APPDATA to Teeworlds_
13:23 <+ultimatum> that works
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the rename or the clean client?
13:24 <+ultimatum> but how hmmmm something is wrong with my teeworld file :(
13:24 <+ultimatum> yeah
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah = 1 or 2?
13:24 <+ultimatum> yeah 1
13:24 <+ultimatum> rename
13:24 <+ultimatum> it works
13:25 <+ultimatum> i rename the file teeworlds to teeworlds_
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok, if you want, zip the whole directory  and upload it somewhere if it doesnt contain personal data, or try to find out what causes it üòÑ
13:25 <+ultimatum> roger that XD
13:25 <+ultimatum> thx Jupstar
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen that was the 2nd report that the config directory was broken btw
13:28 <+ultimatum> ok it seems i narrowed it down 
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> now im curious üòÑ
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't understand why it breaks tbh
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> neither
13:31 <+ultimatum> ok the reason might be the two cfg files masters or settings_ddnet
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so deleting one of them works?
13:32 <+ultimatum> putting my old setting_ddnet or masters seems to crash the client
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if its settings_ddnet.cfg, it might be a specific setting
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can upload it if u want
13:33 <+ultimatum> where should i upload?
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno github
13:33 <+ultimatum> ok
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or just a PM to us
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> hes not discord
13:33 <@deen> but i'm on irc
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok üòÑ
13:33 <+ultimatum> I am also on discord btw
13:33 <+ultimatum> name is mike_
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can reproduce a crash with @mike_ 's config
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @mike_ you can remove the cl_text_entities_size 0 from your config to fix it
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mike_> thx @deen
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so thats the problem @deen ?
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then tag bannzay, its his config
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just make the lower limit to 1
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not 0
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the json parser is really strange, it now crashed at client close bcs it deleted m_pDDNetInfo
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ any more info about the json parser  crash?
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should we look into a new maybe better tested json library?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If there is one and it's easy enough to replace ours, sure
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well a drop-in replacement is unlikely, but there is cJSON which looks like its a small header like ours and still seems to be getting updated
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we don't mind a new dependency rapidjson and nlohmann/json look like modern c++ gotos for json
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ideally there's one that won't change interfaces in the next 10 years and we don't have to touch anything
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well idk anyone that can make such a promise but the standards commitee and I don't see json being part of stl for a while
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno @deen already closed, but the name "nameless tee" makes alot of trouble appearently
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess anyone could make the promise, but I'd only trust such a promise from them :P
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> trouble?
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because the info.json comes slowly?
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no, bcs this null pointer i showed yesterday
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and now it appearntly tried to free something invalidly
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess we are just missing a null check somewhere where we use `m_pDDNetInfo`
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Imagine teaching a computer networks course in 2020 but your first 4 lectures are all about obsolete stuff like ATM ISDN BISDN. Referring to ITU-T as CCITT. It‚Äôs like this guy is stuck in the 70s still pissed that virtual channels never took off
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it was up to him we‚Äôd have dialup netflix
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 who doesnt love being capped at 64kb/s
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could probably have higher network speeds, it‚Äôd be very funny to only be able to receive as many services as there are phone lines at your house
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Operator, connect line 4 at my house to netflix, and start playing narcos
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh or maybe electomagnetic switching, like you call the station, press 4 for 4th line, 3 for netflix followed by the showid
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> You can't call and switch simultaneously
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You accidentally switch your last telephone line to netflix and they have to manually switch it back
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 the prof could just rename the course to "computer networks history" and keep his curriculum
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh, that‚Äôd indeed be more accurate
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> His magnum opus is the slide titled ‚ÄúMore Formally‚Äù which proceeds to write the throughput of the sliding window protocol in variables that he doesn‚Äôt define
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know it‚Äôs `T_tx/(T_tx + 2t_p)` yet I have no idea what T or t or p are
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Making ddnet SAFE again
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> üá∫üá∏
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Lets build a wall to contain the leaks
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And make them pay it with memory
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is there any way to use custom x_ninja skins thru assets folder thingie

21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> add rcon command `switch [ind] [state]`
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> or idk
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Can u save switches with /r maybe
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It gives me immense pleasure that we are finally tackling the UB and the memory leaks
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> HMM see tee in /spec but were in solo :O showothers is off

22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti that sounds expect. when you're in pause/spec you see all tees
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> im not in pause as u can see
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> ok u dont see much in The screen but there is the outline of a tee xd
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> can reproduce
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, no, actually can't reproduce
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> code looks correct too
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe you have dummy connected too?
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti latest client right
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it is determined by server whether you see speced tees, not client I htink

23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i have a suggestion: add "Show downloaded skins" in Tee menu
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @gerdoe why?
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> why should i manually replace whole folder to get skins from db? üòÑ
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> just copy and paste
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if we load them all into memory it's not so great for loading time and memory usage
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so i'd prefer not to
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it's joke, nvm, it would be pretty cool to see skins ingame instead of manual checking
