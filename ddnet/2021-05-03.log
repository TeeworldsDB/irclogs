00:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but community votes will be abused
00:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if i'd like that
00:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> I have a distaste for things like a "testing team" :P
00:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> you still have people who oversee things, it wouldn't be total control
00:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the biggest problem is, that the testing team would require novice, moderate, hard and insane players all in their "league/category" to be more precise
00:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> I think you only need one person around to veto "meme votes" but otherwise they do nothing
00:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> normally things just get voted on difficulty
00:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you could also just analyze the gameplay
00:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how long do teams require and how much finishes are made etc.
00:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yes that's true
00:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> another thing we should do is make testing maps more mainstream, esp if we want average players to have some stake in how maps are rated / approved
00:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> this is ofc something I have always talked about but no one agrees with, so whatever lol
00:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> if you're worried about noobs having misinformed opinions about things we can add a points requirement, but then the accounts issue comes up again
00:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> or something like "x number of y maps completed in order to rate a map in y difficulty"
00:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> though I'm not really a fan of this because it would mean difficulty-limited players will cause maps to be under-rated
00:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> mm I just thought of a better system but it's hard to explain
00:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dynamic rating? 😉
00:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> you would check clears around a voted difficulty and weight them based on closeness (to vote a map as brutal 1*, you would either need a few mod 5* clears or 1 brutal clear (some sort of quadratic score weighted towards the target difficulty)
00:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yes exactly
00:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> you would check clears around a voted difficulty and weight them based on closeness (to vote a map as brutal 1\*, you would either need a few mod 5\* clears or 1 brutal clear (some sort of quadratic score weighted towards the target difficulty)
00:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, I meant a different kind of dynamic rating
00:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> assign a score like 50 for exact rank and then decrease that score per map cleared away from the target
00:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and make the req 50
00:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> huh, what's your idea
00:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> something similar to 1/number of finishes
00:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> oh weird
00:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> I think that would inflate unpopular maps and hurt the rank of popular ones
00:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but maybe there's some compensation
00:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> my points system idea is the best anyway ;D
00:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> weight points based on difficulty + race time
00:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> total points would be weighed by your best ranks and farming would be much less effective
00:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> bad
00:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> separate points and rank points is better
00:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> farming is boring
00:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> I would rather spend my time improving
00:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> playing the same map 500x can be boring for some
00:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> doesn't necessarily mean that
00:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> remember that beating a map still awards base points
00:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> just clear more difficult maps
00:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> if your number one score is a moderate, beat a brutal
00:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> thats like osu pp system
00:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yes
00:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> which isnt good
00:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> wrong
00:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> for ddrace
00:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> xd
00:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> I think it's better
00:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> top players are already really close together
00:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> points = played longer
00:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> having ur points get less and less large over time isnt too good i think
00:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> btw it wouldn't be exactly like osi
00:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> osu
00:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> just make some overall ranking system that combines points and times but leave it separate from points
00:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> all maps have value
00:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> just less value if it's novice
00:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah I mean there can be the existing system that's fine
00:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> just another system for new rank
00:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but I don't really think it's important to distinguish them. just means your novice scores are worth less than brutals, which is already how it is, just more accurate in terms of your skill
00:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> but points doesnt rly measure skill it measures progress
00:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> idk
00:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yes but we should have something that actually tracks skill, no?
00:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> I have very little interest in tracking my "progress"
00:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> just track skill based on what maps u can beat
00:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> plus for that to work u need huge map rerates anyways since a lot of things are too highly or lowly rated
00:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> think that's independent of that
00:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> plus I don't think it will happen anyway
00:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> same with accounts, been talked about too long and no progress
00:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> maybe someones "skill" rating would be like an avg of the hardest maps theyve done
00:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> plus their best times idk
00:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> I mean accounts is maybe going to change, idk
00:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> still talked about on GitHub
00:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> that's just the osu system u realize lol
00:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but it doesn't have to be weighted as heavy as osu
00:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> osu is sooo heavy. you do noob maps and it doesn't do anything to your pp. I'm suggesting that all maps always continue to raise your score, just less the more difficult maps you have beaten.
00:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> since it should be as you say, an average of your best times/clears
00:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> I mean, rank is already like this (with times) but it doesn't do anything to incentivize clearing harder maps, just easy to optimize maps
00:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i guess that would be a good way but its basically impossible since theres no standardized rating for ddnet
00:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> that's also fixable
00:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> and i wouldnt say that since harder maps have less ranks so its easy to get rpts
00:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> and its alr broken in osu where maps only have 3 elements, gl fixing it in ddrace
00:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> that's true but you can still do more moderate maps faster and see the same results
00:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it doesn't really matter where you get rank 1, just depends on how easy it was to take, until someone beats it
00:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it's also bad because it's based on absolute positioning, 1-10
00:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> when it should not be this way, especially for solo where there are many close times
00:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> yeah the absolute position sucks
00:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> but what  im saying is calculating someone's ddnet skill without seeing them play is very difficult
00:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> osu has the same issues
00:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> not possible to do it perfectly
00:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> not suggesting thag
00:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> that
00:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> just suggesting am improvement
00:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> sry I'm on mobile and ordering food so probably typos
00:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaaw> someone can help me, i am working on a mod. i edited 2 files who give lovely effect (heart that fly above tee) then im trying to transform health to armor, the command work but he give health instead armor. the image is a part of code you can see "m_Type = POWERUP_ARMOR;" but that give heatlh
00:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaaw> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838544335120629780/unknown.png
00:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> have u checked client side, if the client also gets it as armor
00:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaaw> i think
00:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaaw> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838545970458263592/2021-05-03_00-41-35.mp4
00:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is atleast a plan that more than one person agreed to in place now, so it's just finding someone to implement it
00:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ok cool
00:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I guess the safety of it kinda depends on @heinrich5991 getting QUIC in, so maybe it will take some time 😛
00:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> how would migration work? everyone would have to apply to convert a name to an account or would all accounts created from scratch stay that way?
00:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my view on it: that discussion is so far away that it's not worth spending energy on
00:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you do want to spend energy on it, please head to github
00:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> your thoughts here will be forgotten
00:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3411
00:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah just getting an implementation made would be nice for now
00:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd say check if that code is really called in the server
00:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont see why the client should bug around for no reason
00:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaaw> if you want see by yourself, i dont see any errors
00:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaaw> https://github.com/Nouaaaa/Block
00:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> people who advocate for accounts have nothing to contribute on GitHub. just that they would prefer accounts. asking a bunch of people to just say "I like the idea" in a github comment is imo just noise and pointless
00:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's why we don't ask for that, we asked for technical feedback
00:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> talking about it on discord is important because if there's no pressure to implement it, who would even take the time?
00:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> the more it's not talked about the more no one will care to code it :P
00:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And ideas on contentious points like migration
00:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaaw> how can i check that?
00:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> set breakpoint inside that function
00:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in the screenshot
00:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> we talked about it for months or maybe years before that issue was created, no one did it 😛
00:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's just that none of us seem to have time to implement it for now
00:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm still working on https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3772
00:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I still have some problems with the client
00:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can just do #3772 btw
00:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3772
00:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> currently, the client probes all four master server in a random order and takes the one with the smallest latency
00:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe I should start a bounty for accounts ;D
00:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the one with the smallest latency that also works
00:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the problem I have with this is: what happens if one of them doesn't respond?
00:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @lynn I wouldn't, this is one feature that is extremely contentious, with dozens of opinions around. You might not like the implementation we decide on, then you don't pay out the bounty then the guy gets mad.
00:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I need some kind of timeout. but if I set it too strict, it will time out on legitimate connections, if I set it too coarse, it'll have a bad user experience if the first master that is probed times out
00:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 500ms max should be good enough for like everywhere no?
00:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> there would be very clear goals on the bounty, and it wouldn't cover all of the expectations after implementing the base of it
00:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> I get what you're saying
00:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it can happen that the DNS response takes even longer tbh
00:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 Have we considered getting rid of this master1 master2 master3 master4 stuff and moving into the future? 😄
00:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I want some redundnacy tbh
00:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you have a better solution for redundancy, go ahead
00:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaaw> ok its fixed, i forgot to change "LoveEvent" to "ArmorEvent" lmao
00:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaaw> <a:pogfish:782976886292611086>
00:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was going to suggest one load balancing node where we could do things like geo-ip to give the best mirror
00:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't even need to do it with dns, we could do a 301
00:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd like to avoid a single point of failure, one thing that can go down if cloudflare goes down, kicks us out, etc.
00:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's the thing that will make it impossible for players to play at all
00:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I noticed that too, the master%d scheme is more robust
00:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well if the dns response is taking more than 500ms the old system wouldn't have worked either
00:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh really? interesting
00:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it'd have to wait for the dns server to respond, if I remember the relevant part of the code
00:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, it seems to simply wait DNS resolution out
01:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway, interesting question about the UX though, maybe we can add a prettier loading indicator to fool the user 😛
01:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyway, that's good news, I don't need to think of something complicated
01:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's mostly a first launch issue anyway, the user won't be in the serverbrowser before I select the master I guess
01:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 well that's assuming they don't have an awful connection, if you assume that your initial issue isn't an issue at all :/
01:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I was thinking that I could choose a longer timeout on the basis that this is only bad UX on the first launch, and probably not even there, because the user will take a little time to get to the serverbrowser
01:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. 10s timeout
06:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> pro
06:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but ugly
06:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs i suck at designing buttons xd

06:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> copy one or something
06:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they also ugly all xD
06:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
06:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> except the transparency effect
06:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but too lazy too add that xd
06:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we don't have transparency in skins tho
06:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but in UI
06:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ic
06:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838629753053380618/3aac188b4eb8871db63b9cda06d3768b.png
06:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats also the only one with it
06:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> circles in tw
06:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats impossible xd
06:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> make a rounded rect one then
06:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
06:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> should probs do that xd
06:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but you need to make the bar thinner for a button that sticks out. don't know if that looks good in teeworlds
06:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> AnTee-Aliasing

06:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest: emm, i guess you should try making the bar thinner and get rid of the border
06:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> teeish or not it would probably be better than a border
06:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Also why does Sat and lht has a dot but hue doesn't
06:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not my fault xd
06:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ikik, just saying.
06:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> teeworlds logics xxd
06:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> at least is it better than not having them aligned

06:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> cool
06:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> k i'll push it and if somebody asks, ur fault xd
06:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:

07:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> chinese semicolon
07:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah xXD
07:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i keep forget to turn my IME off
07:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why are there even two versions xD
07:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i guess our is blocky
07:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838645060148527154/unknown.png
07:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> there are no spaces in both
07:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah
07:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> border is better, easier to see
07:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> when the position is 0 or 100% its incredibly hard to see
07:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> when the position is 0 or 100% without a border its incredibly hard to see
07:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
07:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <T tee> That's pretty good
08:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> bugged team state gives you white ninja

08:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so you prefer like dis @lynn ?
08:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838660181171634196/unknown.png
08:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> that's a bit better but why so thin? it should at least stand out in the UI (make the border color something other than black)
08:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it blocks other colors then
08:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> transparent border
08:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
08:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> what? the border already blocks the colors
08:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> if you mean the base, then yeah just transparent
08:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you wanted border xd
08:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> do we really need bar's border tho
08:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> I don't think blocking the other colors will be an issue, if you want a neighboring color the border/slide size will always block it by some amount
08:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so no border for the bar
08:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but for the whole color bar?
08:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or what is bar
08:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bar = picker?
08:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> bar = the thicc horizontal colorful rect.
08:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> that is under the button. which is what i've been calling it.
08:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> the slide line should be at least 32px imo, transparent with a lighter border (probably white)
08:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> then you could see it
08:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> white is evil
08:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think teeworlds uses transparent black all over
08:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also depends on ur background color anyway
08:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> all backgrounds are darkened
08:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> no matter what color you pick
08:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838661936173285396/unknown.png
08:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
08:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe just make it wider and fill with the active color if it has to be black
08:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> that would still have more contrast with white btw, that screenshot
08:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so u want border for the bar
08:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or just for the picker
08:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838662545907646474/unknown.png
08:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> awesome
08:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thicker picker?
08:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> much better
08:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> sry just I get in trouble at work if things are not contrast appropriate xD
08:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> can't border be transparent tho?
08:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> been doin this shit for a year straight
08:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what border
08:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> that would be ugly af
08:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> actually you know what
08:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> can't the pure black be a little bit transparent
08:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
08:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> give me a number between 0.0 and 1.0
08:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u only have 1 try xd
08:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
08:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> 0.7 opacity
08:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838663374782201896/unknown.png
08:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 0.7
08:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> the entire bar should have a border bte
08:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i had a border
08:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> because on the left there is a border
08:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but teeworlds has transparent in 0.25 steps all over
08:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bar should have no border said freddie
08:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> Freddie is insane
08:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 0.75 looks pretty much same
08:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 0.5 looks bad xd
08:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest: rq
08:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> consistent design standards. if the left color has border, so do the bars.
08:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> idk just makes sense to me
08:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838663835430813766/unknown.png
08:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> border
08:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> looks good, but maybe the border of the slide lines should be inset in the outer border?
08:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> not sure how that would look but this looks good
08:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :feelsbadman:
08:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ts freddie is sad tho
08:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> sorry I hurt your feelings
08:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> can I checkout the branch and try something
08:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> if you want to use that border width though I could recommend thinning the selected color border on the left to match.
08:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> overlapping borders
08:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838664335718481930/unknown.png
08:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and if there are other border controls elsewhere those should also match
08:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what other
08:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie sure u can
08:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> want me to push the current change?
08:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> is the outside less rounded than the inside? it's hard to tell but it sorta looks like that
08:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> I think this tho
08:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the picker should be same
08:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the color range has no border
08:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> round
08:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but the color range border has a round border xd
08:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so thicker border needs more rounding ok
08:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> try ~5000
08:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838665016726650950/unknown.png
08:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it looks like in that screenshot that the outside of the slide line is less round than the inside
08:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> better I think?
08:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs the outer needs a bigger rounding radius to match
08:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ahhh
08:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> what toolkit does this?
08:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> teeworlds 2007 toolkit
08:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ahh
08:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> that makes sense rhoy
08:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> teeworlds does think brokenly
08:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> tho
08:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> things*
08:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> I g2g for now but ye the weird px difference is the only thing
08:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> looks p good tho
08:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838665489424056350/unknown.png
08:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> now radius should match xd
08:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie
08:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> emm
08:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> sure i guess?
08:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
08:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> done
08:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i already checked out the branch and see if i can make it a little bit less blacky
08:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ok i'm dumb
08:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> teeworlds never uses 0,0,0 it was always 1,1,1.
08:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> everything is white yeah
08:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> evil
08:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd
08:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> nope, listbox's background is black
08:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
09:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> There is a bug with "/ Swap" that when you change with someone all the switches are reset, all the doors are closed and because of this we are left with fewer chances to survive and we die ... I don't think you can give a reward because We lost 180 minutes of racing for this bug but I will still ask, is there a possibility of rewarding this?
09:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> was it duo?
09:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> not duo
09:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> have u tried /save /load
09:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe its not buggy for all
09:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> no, cuz we still have chances for go to other way but harder
09:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> so we try it
09:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> and fail
09:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is indeed buggy
09:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen why isnt swap just actually implemented like timeout
09:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then these things wouldnt happen i guess
09:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen ^
09:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why isnt swap just actually implemented like timeout
09:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then it also wouldnt swap weak with the player
09:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> ./r reset switches too, in some cases you can fail cuz this
09:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> good to know, but /r isnt as relevant probably
09:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> swap happens during actual runs
09:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> yeah
09:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> but i hope can fix too
09:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> cuz already happens to me and lost hours of playing
09:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ i don't know
10:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I can't
10:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838686844949364756/unknown.png
10:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what did you do, set more transparency? 😄
10:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i tried to slice the slider border into three parts where top and bottom matches the rail border and a middle part that does `ColorRGBA{pColorInner->r * 0.5f, pColorInner->g * 0.5f, pColorInner->b * 0.5f, 1.0f}`
10:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> also copied alphas from other parts of teeworlds like listbox and buttons but that didn't matter too much.
10:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :nouis: why do i even care tho. pure black works i guess.
10:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Do we have luminance calculation lying around somewhere?
10:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for what isntance?
10:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> transparent border has way too much contrast around blue and a little bit less contrast around yellow
10:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'm doing this currently ```
10:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie>         float Lumen = mix(0.5f, 0.8f, 1.0f - (0.2126f * pColorInner->r + 0.7152f * pColorInner->g + 0.0722f * pColorInner->b));
10:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie>         float Alpha = clamp((pColorInner->a - 0.5f) / 0.5f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
10:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie>         RenderTools()->DrawUIRect(&Slider, ColorRGBA{pColorInner->r * Lumen, pColorInner->g * Lumen, pColorInner->b * Lumen, Alpha}, 0, 0);
10:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ```
10:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dropped a comment on your pr, but I'll say it here too. I don't think reintroducing the sliders is the best idea
10:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i answered already
10:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie i dunno, but isnt that happening on the GPu anyway
10:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> are you thinking about gamma or something
10:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'm not submitting anything either, i'm just having fun
10:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah its ok
10:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ it sure looks pretty but there will be dozens of them in settings
10:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just dont understand what you hope to get with that calculation 😄
10:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nono, i am for 2 color pickers
10:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this one has a special use case
10:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> clamped HSL
10:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the others are easier to use
10:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh 😄
10:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u cannot clamp light in these easy to use color pickers
10:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> see all implementations of gimp, the triangle and the default are best
10:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and both wouldnt work with clamped light
10:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well as long as you have one grid and one slider you can access any hsl value. Leave the L to the slider and you can clamp it however you want
10:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> HSL is just a double hexcone, we can slice it however we want
10:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> don't know if the difference is obvious
10:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838696200605663232/unknown.png
10:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so you'd prefer to add all colors + saturation into the picker?
10:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> iirc photoshop puts H on the slider, even then you can clamp the L
10:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well just show me an example, i cannot even imagine it tbh
10:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> blows my mind to have so many colors on the grid xd
10:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i see a difference yeah, you only wanted it for the picker?
10:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> H and S on the picker (a circle would work well) L on the slider is what I'd do
10:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so i asked if we had that already
10:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but the current one has S and V on the grid (square) and H on the slider. Why do you think we can't clamp the L like this?
10:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i saw a HSL circle but doesnt look as good as the triangle circle thing or the default in gimp
10:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs saturation depends on the light inside the grid?
10:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> uh? I mean there is two axes to the grid, one is L one is S. Each point has a unique S and L value
10:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mh ok
10:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually gimp seems to have exactly what I said
10:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thought 0.5 light or smth is the default so wasnt sure, thought HSL just uses other notation
10:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, you can change what kind of picker gimp uses
10:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
10:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> On the grid one, I think the one with an H slider looks the nicest, which is what we have right now (though V instead of L, which I don't remember why the russian lad did)
10:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well probs im wrong then
10:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i thought hsv just "fixes" the brightness stuff with HSl
10:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> L on the slider has this issue, yeah looks ugly
10:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay my color theory isn't great, what was the issue with brightness in HSL?
10:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not an issue by math
10:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> more for representation
10:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs L = 1 is white
10:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I might have used HSL for too long for that to feel wrong to me 😛
10:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i never did a color picker before xd
10:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It makes perfect sense that a color with full "lighting" is white
10:48 < bridge_> [freenode] <timakro[m]> Can anyone recommend a computer algebra system with a unixy feel? I want to write programs in ASCII and run it on the cmdline, would be a plus if I could copy paste matrices  from python with minimal adjustments
10:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well or like HSV does it just full color?
10:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
10:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like shrinking the colors to black
10:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cant descripe better xD
10:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> both make sense, else they wouldnt work
10:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just cannot imagine HSL in a real grid
10:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but as said
10:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> They represent the exact same color space, the only difference as far as I'm aware is that HSV puts white on the same plane as CMYRGB so you don't get a band of white up top
10:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'm noob with color pickers
10:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> timakro: computer algebra system?
10:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just wondering why there isnt a good HSL picker, except maybe a circle
10:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> http://www.workwithcolor.com/hsl-color-picker-01.htm
10:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this is basically the best i found
10:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats also how i imagine HSL
10:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ well there isn't really a pretty color picker for RGB either
10:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
10:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> personally i think the gimp triangle one is best
10:52 < bridge_> [freenode] <timakro[m]> @Learath2: Simplify equations, solve systems of linear equations etc
10:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838699609437634561/unknown.png
10:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u directly see all combinations
10:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> HS(L/V) due to it's mathematical nature is a dual hexcone/hexcone. Makes sense to put it into a wheel
10:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but clamping the light would result in a cut triangle, wouldnt it? xD
10:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just cannot imagine it for HSL directly tbh
10:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats my only problem
10:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe it works
10:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i wouldnt have a starting point
10:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> A triangle wouldn't work for HSL indeed, you'd get a diamond
10:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 so u wanna give the pr a try?, then i'll close it
10:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838700584545943562/unknown.png
10:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> NOOOO don't 😄
10:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really don't think I'll ever get to it
10:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ you won't get a cut triangle if you clamp the V btw
10:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah i thought about it
10:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but its clamping V isnt it
10:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is that the same as clamping L
10:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is there no side effect?
10:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my brain cant handle this tbh xD
10:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The black corner of the triangle will be lighter is all, but that is in HSV
10:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> in HSL you can't use this kind of picker as it just will look odd to put the L on the height of the triangle, since it goes from black to full color to white
10:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but does the example of freddie have the exact same color range as HSL with clamped light?
10:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if yes, then fine, isnt it 😄
10:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well @TsFreddie's example looks full range but you can easily clamp it
11:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 🤔 wdym full range
11:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> isnt it more than full range somehow? xd
11:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its darker than tw skins
11:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tw skins are only "full" color to white
11:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the dark part missing
11:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm actually I'm not completely sure what kind of picker this is, where is the black?
11:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I clamped it
11:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its just halfed
11:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye
11:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but its hsv
11:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838701831056130048/unknown.png
11:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, yeah then it's correct
11:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but tw color wouldnt allow such dark greens
11:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would it?
11:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> no looks like HSL, the top is white the bottom is black the middle is grey
11:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno xd
11:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> looks more like 1 = full color, 0 = black
11:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> which is V
11:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway mapping between color spaces can really fry your brain, especially before breakfast, so we should let the guy tell us what it is 😄
11:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway, this discussion is useless for me, i really dont understand it. my brain says its not directly compatible, else there would be better HSL pickers
11:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the middle looks full color to me in that example
11:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thought on the right are full colors
11:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and then top right would be
11:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (on the right slider)
11:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ I don't quite get what you mean by there would be better pickers. Think of it more abstractly at the end of the day we just have 3 axes all between 0 and 1 and we want to pick a 3-tuple, a point
11:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> With the wheel and the triangle, the H goes around the wheel, the V is the height of the triangle, the S is the base
11:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i understand that
11:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but that doesnt mean HSL works like that does it
11:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> With this kind of square grid and slider you have S and L on the grid and H on the slider. Now from what value to what value the grids axes go is all up to you
11:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it has smth like a mid achsis
11:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that breaks everything
11:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it doesn't break everything, it just makes the grid look less pretty with full color being in the middle
11:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well if somebody wants to implement it, i'd be glad
11:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
11:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> true
11:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the slider would just be the light
11:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would probably work
11:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, my point is with any kind of picker you can reach all possible 3-tuples so you can get any HSV, HSL, RGB, CMY, LCh
11:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think it would just look worse, true
11:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Slider being light looks ugly, I checked in gimp just now
11:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "more" useless
11:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 😄
11:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Slider has to be H IMO, like in tsfreddies example and it seems to be the default in both photoshop and gimp
11:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would have thought slider should be L, bcs then we dont have the troublke with middle achsis
11:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wouldnt look so confusion
11:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wouldnt look so confusing
11:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like drawing a circle as a plane
11:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀
11:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (well technically the circle is a lie too :D, it's supposed to be a hexcone not a cone, so completely accurately represented it'd be a hexagon)
11:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah true
11:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lets just implement it 3d
11:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 😄
11:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> solves everything
11:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/HSL_color_solid_dblcone_chroma_gray.png
11:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> While at it let's not bother with the whole orienting and stretching and just let the users pick a color in the rgb cube directly
11:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> pick ur color
11:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder who actually uses LCh
11:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> isnt that basically hsl xd
11:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Close but Chroma is like the weird cousin of Saturation
11:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah ok
11:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/HSL_color_solid_cylinder_saturation_gray.png/1024px-HSL_color_solid_cylinder_saturation_gray.png
11:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> almost looks like Hcl is more optimized xD
11:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it wastes less 3d space xxD
11:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> apparently luma and chroma are supposed to be more akin to how humans perceive colors
11:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so you can do things like discard colors with low luma high chroma in compression and lose less perceived color
11:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so anyway, u'd you go with HSL picker completly or what?
11:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Y'CbCr picker when?
11:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in a grid we'd have one achsis only grey, and the other the full color range, if we want it easy xd
11:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or put L into the grid, but thats too confusing for me
11:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean i can imagine it
11:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but the colors are in the mid then
11:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for non clamped
11:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> really? did you just draw it to check it out? it doesn't look very confusing it's still point and click you know
11:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's just that full color is the middle line
11:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
11:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but HSV is litteraly just move ur cursor top right
11:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess that's why the russian lad used HSV in his grid
11:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway, if you do HSV and want to clamp the L then it gets weird 😄
11:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
11:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually you know what, luckily enough we only clamp the dark side
11:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can actually clamp without it looking weird
11:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just need to map the L value we clamp to to the V value and start the dark part from that
11:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we were clamping the top side we'd be in a world of trouble
11:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool
11:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this is what it would be
11:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just clamp the down half then
11:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think this would be fine too but it might be easier for the users to just click top right for full color and that's what they would be used to from photo editing software
11:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
11:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ok, no
11:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so if somebody wants todo that, i'm fine with that, but i cant imagine it as HSL
11:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as HSV*
11:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay how about this, I'll try to take a quick look tonight and clamp the selector we currently have. I think it should be fairly simple to clamp the minimum of the V
11:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> can we talk about clamping?
11:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure we can, but I'll start preparing breakfast so slower responses 😛
11:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> if you technically "clamp" every points on a "grid"/"plane", there should be a block of colors that is the same right. so we were talking about mapping right?
11:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, we are indeed stretching the space, not clamping per se
11:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so the picker we had has V in the Y axis.
11:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @Jupstar ✪ was right
11:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> you can't stretch a HSV picker
11:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838708489928310804/unknown.png
11:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just because you can't doesn't mean it can't be done 😛
11:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 🤔 i guess i mean stretch it vertically
11:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i bet in the end we have smth like this, bcs the color ranges are just translated like this xd
11:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838708817357307904/unknown.png
11:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not sure why you think it's not possible, just take a picture of the grid, cut it off at the darkest V you want to allow, then restretch it until it fits in the same shape
11:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (I mean if you want to just convince yourself)
11:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀 btw the picker we have just has a black gradient on top of a saturation gradient.
11:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> now how our picker currently works idk, I didn't really review it iirc
11:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nobody did
11:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it was just there xd
11:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just know mathematically it atleast makes enough sense to stretch it that my brain hasn't raised any red flags yet
11:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it was a saturation gradient, overlayed by a black to transparent gradient that simulates 1-V
11:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i agree that it is somehow possible
11:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (though it is before breakfast so it is possible my brain just doesn't feel like flags yet)
11:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i assume we end up having saturation against the light at the end in HSV, bcs that would make sense if we take both extreme points of S=0 and L=1
11:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The part I'd probably have trouble with is rendering the continuous grid. Does opengl have something for this?
11:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah S=0 is some mid lighted grey and L=1 is ofc white
11:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so more of a triangle
11:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd
11:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i forgot to have lunch
11:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> nice
11:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Here is what the gimp one looks like at constant H
11:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838710884905254952/Screenshot_2021-05-03_at_11.37.16.png
11:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> V is the y axis, S is the x axis
11:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish I could have HSL in gimp...
11:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway, if I could the top would be white like the bottom being black
11:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean u strech L = 0, so that L = 0 is the color, but then u want normal S, so it defs is just some streching, but at the end what do you get? a half HSL picker probably xD
11:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838711409113301002/unknown.png
11:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> this one?
11:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs only that makes sense doesnt it
11:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that is pure HSL isnt it?
11:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that plus a slider for sautration
11:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye.
11:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> look at my triangle
11:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and look at this
11:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool
11:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> half clamped
11:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its like a streched triangle xd
11:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay I actually took out a notebook and it doesn't work out, yeah so we can't have a HSV grid and clamp L without getting a misshapen abomination
11:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so you can have S=1 and L=1 ofc
11:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :feelsbadman:
11:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so yeah
11:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we go 3d
11:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> teeworlds 3d engine
11:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for color picking
11:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> still better than 2 color pickers XD
11:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or an ugly one
11:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or we go 4d and add alpha too
11:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> not even a triangle, technically you get an exponential curve
11:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> stretched triangle, probably not it.
11:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838713994000859166/unknown.png
11:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> scratch that, i rotated it wrong
11:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay actually now that I drew it it feels possible again
11:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The remaining part of the grid is still atleast a trapezoid
11:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just need to stretch it by a non constant factor and it'll hopefully work 😛
11:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> triangle
11:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838715176521170954/unknown.png
11:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> lol
11:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> where are you testing this stuff?
11:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> editor
11:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'm just changing the editor's color picker
11:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Here is what constant l looks like on the HSV plane
11:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838715758849687592/Screenshot_2021-05-03_at_11.56.38.png
11:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ok. why don't we just get a shader that does hsl to rgb conversion in fragment
11:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm slowly starving to death trying to figure this out 😛
11:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it's 5:57pm i still haven't had lunch
11:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never have lunch anymore, 2 meals work just fine for me
11:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh i don't have breakfast
11:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest: that's the problem
11:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah 😄
11:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> that I can't skip or the turkish police will take my passport
11:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ama> i eat 5 times a day
12:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but like if we just get two shaders (one hsv, one clamped hsl), we then have the pixel coordinate which is basically the axis S and L/V, and we just calculate the fragment color, and do it the same in CPU for the actual value, and stop trying to figure out a gradient or a texture that stretches to fit both pickers.
12:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just turned by bread into charcoal....
12:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀
12:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'm ordering delivery
12:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> god that smells awful, the shader stuff you'll have to ask @Jupstar ✪ I'm not very good with the gfx part
12:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah lets finally ban gl 1.x
12:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and do crazy math on the GPU
12:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> +1 from me
12:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, I'd have guessed that too 😛
12:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but yeah in theory everything that is math can be done on the GPu ofc
12:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can't do non crazy math on all our target machines, I guess that's very much out of the question
12:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u even have conditions on GPUs, even at core language
12:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so realtivly powerful
12:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u just dont have any memory state
12:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else it would be as good as  a CPU
12:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just very slow
12:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> no more shaders for you until you figure out how we can render a 15 year old 2d game on all machines
12:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u need jump, a memory, and a if condition
12:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then u can do everything 😄
12:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀 well filling a small texture and stretch it to have an approximation might be OK for normies
12:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> scratch that, let's "scale" it, i hate the word "stretching" now
12:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I have the math down now (at the cost of equivalent exchange from bread to charcoal). I'll try it tonight 😛
12:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> what are you gonna do 👀
12:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Jupstar ✪ you were right, the issue is in all the tools that resave maps ^^
12:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> As I said just need to stretch the degenerate trapezoid back into a square
12:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀 but how would you do it in teeworlds tho
12:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well just need to solve for S
12:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
12:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think (tm) again I'm starving here
12:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i thought about that too
12:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think that could work
12:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but isnt that basically a new color picker xd
12:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> atleast from look
12:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Same color picker but the grid would be non linear
12:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean the user doesn't give a shit that I preserve the linearity of the grid, they just want full color top right and point and click for the rest, no?
12:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/RGB_Cube_Show_lowgamma_cutout_a.png/1024px-RGB_Cube_Show_lowgamma_cutout_a.png
12:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but we are not using a grid or texture or anything that has pixel values for color picker currently tho
12:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 8 bit per color, so 256 of these small blocks
12:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rendered 3d
12:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 😄
12:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its like a minigame
12:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 256^3 ofc
12:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie let me take a look
12:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but would be funny probably
12:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀
12:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie when RGB color game
12:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Picross 3D
12:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its like building tower games
12:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just with colors
12:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> dig your colors out
12:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838720717146685490/812BALi2Bjs1L.png
12:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> EZ
12:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, okay idk how I'd render this
12:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> translating the mouse click location is trivial, but as I said before I despise rendering stuff to begin with
12:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I thought rendering is the only difficult part.
12:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I just need a lot of extra vertices?
12:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> split it into like idk 10 quads
12:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay how about this, what is the darkest L we allow?
12:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 50 iirc. in percent.
12:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye 50
12:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I approximate the ugly curve with just a single line?
12:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838722036221870110/Screenshot_2021-05-03_at_12.21.25.png
12:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> a triangle with more than 180°
12:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i like that
12:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The part between the purple and the black wouldn't really work though :/
12:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it'd look close enough but it'd be wrong
12:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> mhhh
12:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, I guess 3 sliders is the best we can do without some cancerous splitting a square into 10 quads
12:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀 texture time
12:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd have to defer to @Jupstar ✪ but I don't think we can do it at runtime with gl1 so I guess you mean a static texture?
12:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> you can change texture at runtime in gl1. but i think you can rotate hue pretty easily.
12:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I meant actually generating the texture at runtime so we don't have to scale it
12:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we can do that ye
12:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> text is doing that already
12:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like render to a texture or what
12:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or do it on the CPU
12:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah render to a texture was what I was thinking
12:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but we can do it on the cpu too now that you've mentioned text
12:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah i doubt framebuffer support was added in gl 1.x
12:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> except u take ur "main" framebuffer
12:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> can you do hue shift in gl1?
12:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you can render to ur framebuffer and read the pixels
12:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> shift = interpolate?
12:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or add an offset?
12:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> No literally shift go from blue to yellow e.g.
12:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye
12:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but directly?
12:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> since gl works with rgb I highly doubt it has any support for hue
12:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like from RGBA(1,0,0,1) to RGBA(1,1,0,1)?
12:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or just go there interpoalted
12:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> how are we coloring the skins
12:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> interpolated ofc
12:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why should that not work
12:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie we do a `color_cast<ColorRGBA>`
12:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> no i mean how are  we calling GL to color the skin
12:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah
12:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u mean texture coloring?
12:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> probably
12:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the static pipeline just supports it
12:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with multiplying
12:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> AH I see
12:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh multiply
12:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probs also other stuff
12:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah that just works
12:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> multiply won't work i guess.
12:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they are normalized values
12:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> no i mean won't work for having a single texture for color picker
12:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> are u allowed to call multiple GL calls?
12:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or does it require it in on call
12:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u still have framebuffer and stencil left to manipulate stuff xD
12:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> btw why not three sliders again?
12:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why dont want 2 color pickers
12:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but we'll have to use HSL color picker
12:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and noboy likes them
12:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so learath builds a coordinate transformer geometrically
12:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
12:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> also where do you put the color picker tho.
12:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> popup
12:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ?
12:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i've no idea
12:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i guess that is what deen wants
12:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or the other way around
12:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> all current popups get sliders again
12:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> which i also dislike
12:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the average user wont care anyway
12:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think the borders should be more grayshing and with a bit of transparency, it will make it look more modern and less childish
12:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838725812882243594/116847587-2026a580-abeb-11eb-8f79-888d1df7febe.png
12:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they see color, they click color
12:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think the borders should be more grayish and with a bit of transparency, it will make it look more modern and less childish
12:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838725812882243594/116847587-2026a580-abeb-11eb-8f79-888d1df7febe.png
12:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> isn't the only color picker is in editor?
12:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> currently?
12:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
12:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> HUD and so have it
12:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i see
12:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> basically everything has it now
12:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lynn wanted fortnite
12:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh, found it
12:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i gave him fortnite
12:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wat xd
12:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well i have this
12:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838726142788894730/unknown.png
12:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think less transparent
12:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dunno just reminds me of some low color game xd
12:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno tbh i'd remove transparency
12:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it rarely looks very good, bcs of overlapping
12:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just use a good grey
12:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> without transparency
12:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> y
12:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> if the slider is bigger
12:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> or the rail is thinner
12:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i can remove overlapping
12:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the picker
12:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838726769812570172/unknown.png
12:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not bad
12:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but maybe make the pic without a dark bg
12:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838727109819760650/unknown.png
12:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that looks better
12:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i also like it more
12:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but ok
12:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in the end its taste
12:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i still don't like pure black ~~uwu~~
12:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think black is ok too, sometimes too aggressive
12:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i still find it sad that the teeworlds menus are not styled to the teeworlds theme, for example in factorio the menus look very factorioish
12:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838727484441886770/unknown.png
12:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just like discord dark theme is not really black
12:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
12:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> factario is windows 2000, but teeworlds is win95
12:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but factorio looks rly gud :feelsbadman:
12:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah in its style yes
12:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tw is just some old rect drawing
12:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> my main issue about black border is that teeworlds's current UI overall isn't solid black anywhere
12:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i like the sliders
12:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look at the render thread slider
12:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> generally colors instead of just putting transparent white
12:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it snaps to integers
12:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> very good xd
12:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that can be useful
12:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> that slider looks like a smooth zipper
12:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Клокн.А.> who go play with me, i'm have 300 points 🙂
12:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ask in #general in #developer nobody plays tw
12:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we only talk about it
12:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and be mad about it
12:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tru
12:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ if we could render anyway we could do tips and tricks like these
12:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838728185351897108/unknown.png
12:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (its animated)
12:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u can move it around
12:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> I like freddies version, just the sliding thingy itself needs to pop more
12:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyway -> anywhere
12:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i dont really like overlapping transparency
12:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else freedies looks better than what is currently on git
12:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> as I said, i can get rid of the overlapping if the rail is thinner
12:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://streamable.com/xz1z6v
12:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
12:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> the transparent outline is very teeworlds style
12:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so its ugly
12:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> u
12:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> teeworlds is beautiful
12:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm
12:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> imagine getting rid of transparent outline and change it to solid drop shadow with no blurring
12:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 0.7?
12:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
12:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 0.7 looks horrible
12:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it looks so fluid
12:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :feelsamazingman:
12:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would be amazing to use this in tw
12:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to show techniques
12:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and basic stuff
12:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> guy i did the burn
12:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> guys*
12:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ddnet without bg maps also looks ugly
12:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> these strange chess boxes in background
12:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so random ugly xD
12:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i remember opening tw for the first time
12:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with that bg
12:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the MUSIC
12:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> REEPATING 24/7
12:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got pstd
12:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i have it on
12:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> madman
12:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> checkerboard is nice and simple, hate ugly clouds and stuff in menu
12:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i like jungle dark
12:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or DVD logo 😄
12:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the checkerboard make perfect sense for racing game.
12:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🚙
12:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> teeworlds the racing game
12:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> confirmed
12:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we have race in our title
12:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> make sense
12:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> lol
12:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but teeworlds
12:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 2007
12:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> teewars
12:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> don't mind the detail
12:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> @TsFreddie can you try just the slidy part with opaque outline?
12:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> sure
12:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838730439056818196/unknown.png
12:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> sorry, forgot to change it to static grey
12:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> I meant black ^^
12:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> pure black?
12:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> maybe something like really dark gray
12:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> so it's visible on most bg but not pure black because pure black sucks
12:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie u want my color codes xD
12:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dark grey opaque xDD
12:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> what was it
12:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i used 15%
12:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 10 is too less and 20% too bright again
12:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838730976452018187/unknown.png
12:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 0.25
12:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
12:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but u also have a very dark bg
12:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> this is why i was doing lumen stuff
12:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838731078922403850/unknown.png

12:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> blue on grey is so bad.
12:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838731345487593492/unknown.png

13:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my eyes
13:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> lol
13:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 🔥
13:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> just use something slightly darker than the darkest possible color
13:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838727109819760650/unknown.png
13:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> whats bad about this then
13:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its not too dark
13:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not too bright
13:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> the other outlines are too dark
13:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> I'd keep the "unimportant" ones faded
13:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~Ravie cares about teeish transparents~~
13:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838732700709421096/unknown.png
13:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> btw why isn't the cool pop out color picker used here?
13:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunon i think light grey should be less than dark grey to look good
13:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh i know what's wrong. my lumen were inverted
13:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838732956771024916/unknown.png

13:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the value is probably still a bit off to keep the contrast consistent
13:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean... we only have to top this
13:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838733739395121172/unknown.png
13:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats not a challenge xD
13:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> btw, who made the old slider
13:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> gandalf the white?
13:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> he made the slider not overlap with transparent slider.
13:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/878ede3080ab2cfb627aca505c397d9765052996
13:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probably 
13:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Magnus Auvinen or some of these very oldschool guys
13:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> were sliders always look like that?
13:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i thought they were changed in ddnet
13:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> were they?
13:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> only vertical probs
13:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ic
13:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but dunno
13:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> didnt play vanilla 0.6 in alot of years
13:12 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> anyway, if the rails are thinner we can do the same thing to make it not overlap with transparency. currently we don't have much room at the top or bottom for drawing only the top or the bottom cap.
13:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah you mean bcs of that
13:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he just split the picker
13:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> yes
13:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> he just didn't draw the border in the middle at all 👀
13:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> this one
13:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838737960459173888/unknown.png
13:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because skin colors are not all colors and it's hard to restrict this to only skin colors
13:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> I don't see what problem this has that sliders don't
13:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's basically 2 sliders mapped to 2 axis on a square
13:27 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> this doesn't has problem.
13:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the slider does👀
13:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> because this isn't the two axis we were using for skins.
13:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ^^ the colors above the purple line would be the only allowed ones, making it a very ugly shape
13:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> but you're limiting the lightness slider in the same way
13:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But V doesnt map to L linearly
13:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye, the color picker isn't using lightness
13:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> hm ok
13:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> So we need the full color in the middle if we want to clamp a picker like this
13:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Else we need to stretch that curved line back into a straight one
13:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which is annoying with shaders, extremely annoying without
13:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> but still aren't you doing the same on a slider?
13:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> No because the sliders would be HSL not HSV
13:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But yeah they still have the "problem" inherent to HSL. The full color is somewhere in the middle. Not at an edge
13:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ actually the slider doesn't really solve the problem of getting good UX for full colour does it?
13:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> which slider we are talking about rn? 😄
13:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean the 3 sliders you proposed
13:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it works because we only allow L > 0.5
13:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah
13:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so left-most is full colour
13:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the description is bad
13:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but it works as that
13:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> left is full color
13:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, wouldn't work in 0.7 I guess since they allow darker colors
13:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah but that isnt a problem per se
13:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i used the constant
13:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so if we allow higher range we change the constant anyway probably?
13:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well we can but if we move the constant then full colour isn't leftmost anymore
13:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah thats true, yeah
13:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then its the same game again
13:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> doesnt 0.7 even have a color picker
13:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I think I can be okay with the slider since I can't really be assed to split this into 10 quads or do hue magic on a static texture
13:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> they do actually, but I don't remember how they handled the issue
13:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they use HSL picker
13:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like the one from the mozilla website
13:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah
13:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838741809110712370/unknown.png
13:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they have a really strange ui imo, so much roundings in roundings
13:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> looks confusing af
13:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay I have one last idea, idk if it's any better, but we can just render the purple line and dim out the part people can't use
13:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah nice you can pet ur tee, nice feature @TsFreddie xD
13:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> OH I have a perfect solution
13:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We just let tees use all colours. Preventing darker tees is just racism
13:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i suggested that on deens color picker pr xD
13:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> may I suggest a skin color system rework that doesn't flatten out luminosity?
13:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but eyes are black xD
13:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> great minds think alike
13:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> So allow all colours?
13:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> or you mean instead use HSV so we can stretch it nicely?
13:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> I mean the client does something weird to colors to make them "flat" but naturally different hues have different luminosity
13:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> so sometimes with colored tees you get nasty artifacts like on the old Aoe skin
13:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Soooo Y'CbCr skins?
13:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> HDR skins
13:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838743303268466688/2021-05-03_19-45-41.mp4
13:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/HSL_color_solid_dblcone_chroma_gray.png/1280px-HSL_color_solid_dblcone_chroma_gray.png
13:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so this basically
13:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the whiter the less chroma range is important
13:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and same for black
13:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or is there anything that acutally favours single hues?
13:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so you wrote a color picker bot or what
13:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> found a color picker and javascript
13:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so ye, a bot
13:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah
13:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> S stays
13:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> funny curve
13:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838744002081456138/unknown.png

13:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> no, that's HSL's S, there is a HSV at the bottom
13:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> in some skins with weird gradients etc this can cause nasty side effects, it's been bothering me for years
13:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but map that coordinate transformation gemeometrically
13:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would be insane with such a curve
13:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye
13:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i ye'd the wrong messge
13:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but ye
13:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> ye
13:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> whats the problem
13:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont get it
13:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think keeping the gradient would probably require us ditching GL1 "again" in favor of some color science shader.
13:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah
13:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u want to keep it
13:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah it greyscales it and then just uses the average
13:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> this is the problem
13:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838744698767933480/unknown.png
13:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> u shouldn't mess with natural brightness of colors in this way
13:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but thats not directly a color picker problem
13:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~anything can be solved with shaders~~
13:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u could just greyscale the texture
13:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> without averaging it
13:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah but reworking the coloring system would let u use hsv and solve *all the problems* !
13:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't think so tbh
13:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how could it solve very dark colors tho
13:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> without clamping
13:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can also now just allow HSV if u want
13:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie look, graph 😛
13:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838745123419979816/Screenshot_2021-05-03_at_13.53.21.png
13:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> graph gang
13:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> dunno but if you already changed the coloring system completely then you have freedom to solve this in some other way
13:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's constant S changing L
13:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i defenitely agree that if we change it we can fix it in a much better way
13:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The problem is that at the end of the day teeworlds uses HSL
13:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I made a VERY small change in how colours were rounded and people wanted to kill me 😛
13:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀 fix 0.7's skin and port it over
13:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Going from HSL colours in the configs to HSV colours we'll get some very angry people
13:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> first we'd have to define what we dont like
13:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i bet most ppl hate the eyes bcs too slim and wide in width
13:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 0.6 eyes also move
13:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just removing that already confuses ur brain so much
13:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> wdym move
13:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and tbh i cannot even say if it looks bad, bcs if the tee looks left or right eye seperation doesnt look to bad
13:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @TsFreddie just spin ur cursor slowly in 0.6
13:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and look at the eyes
13:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the distance between them
13:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if we port the 0.7 skin system we should call it something different, like "cool new skin system" some people just hate 0.7 anything
13:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also
13:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> wtf
13:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> jank
13:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> eye separation is really annoying if you make a skin with a face, either you get a gap or overlap
13:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> feets. i've long thought about why it looks so weird in 0.7, even tho it's perfectly centerd... and i guess it just doesnt look natural.. Most animals including us humans dont have feets that do not go into one side
13:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> 0.7 feet are centered... but the body isn't xD
13:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> (make a skin system that can move feet)
13:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> (then you get extra nouis)
13:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i guess if we want both system at once, 0.7's might not need fixing since it technically should be the same as 0.7.
13:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i agree from a stand of determinism, just like for the Bub Bob skins, but i also dunno how i'd fix it in a good way
13:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually we are drifting very far from the issue
13:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i really don't have major problems with either 0.6 or 0.7 positioning wise tbh.
14:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno when i open 0.7 i directly hate skins
14:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they just dont look cute anymore
14:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway, I gtg, if you all come up with anything you can put it on the github issue and I'll try to think of some way to turn an ugly non euclidean triangle into a square 😛
14:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bb
14:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :gg:
14:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://colorpicker.me/
14:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the color picker btw
14:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we just make a unique random color that can never be changed again
14:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> problem solved
14:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> have you clicked on the top tee.
14:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
14:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ouch
14:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> aaa
14:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> uhh
14:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i really like it
14:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> fits teeworlds kiddy style xD
14:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i sneaked that in while doing the menu merge
14:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ez xD
14:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i have to say I did put it in the PR description before heinrich yells at me tho.
14:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838750140944220200/unknown.png
14:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> smth like this? badly gimp'd, but u get the idea
14:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838751148785532928/unknown.png
14:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i was thinking this, so skip the red part vertically
14:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838752083485130762/unknown.png
14:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and transparent
15:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> thoughts on this?
15:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838764765659529226/unknown.png
15:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> isn't that has more overlapping transparency
15:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> and what's wrong with that?
15:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
15:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> same style as text
15:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> its just a color picker
15:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> shouldnt the hue sat lht also be aligned
15:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838767467543003186/unknown.png
15:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> like its like that in 0.7 which looks better
15:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
15:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838773225231351850/unknown.png
15:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> are skipped tiles the only difference between 0.7 and 0.6 maps?
15:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> isn't that because 0.7 grass_doodads has a slightly different layout?
15:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> not i mean in terms of data. i don't care about mapres yet.
15:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> no i mean*
15:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ah, envelops are different too.
15:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we didn't want L on the grid because the full color being in the middle is apparently confusing
15:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not really to me but I can see it being not obvious for people not familiar with HSL
15:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> for that screenshot i only meant like the alignment of the text above the pickers looked better
15:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> idk about the grid
15:58 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, hm I kinda like it better on the left
16:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> the numbers should at least be aligned across translations :justatest:
17:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Naist> Can add a command for de skip the fucking warnings?
17:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Naist> Can add a command for skip the fucking warnings?
17:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> click ok 5 times :justatest:
17:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Naist> Is more than 5 times
17:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Naist> XD
17:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> idk it worked for me
17:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Naist> Ooh fuckings hd and others innecesary shits
17:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, I missed some interesting color theory
17:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you mostly missed q very mehly informed understanding of color theory :P
17:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> How about you remove however many broken skins you have in your skins directory? xD
17:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Naist> They aren't broken and i use some
17:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> So the computer is lying?
17:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Naist> But I find this restriction unnecessary if the quality / resolution of any skin in the game was never a problem
17:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> On some computers like yours they are just mis-scaled. On others they will appear completely black, on others they will cause other graphical artifacts
17:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can "fix" the skin by rescaling it yourself
17:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it would be best if you could find the original image that has the correct resolution
17:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The game only supports properly sized skins, we only have properly sized skins in the db, our default skins are all properly sized
17:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Naist> This is a fallacy because the quality of lying only applies to humans, computers follow patterns that in this case are more defined
17:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Naist> This is a fallacy because the quality of lying only applies to humans, computers follow patterns that in this case are bad defined
17:49 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Exactly what I was getting at. Since the computer can't lie, I can deduce with very high certainty that your skins are what's broken
17:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Naist> Hahah
17:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, it's likely that we have properly sized versions of whatever skins you have that are broken. You can check the skindb or ask around
17:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Naist> I know how to resize the skins, I have also made and edited my own skins.
17:55 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Naist> I'm just saying that the warning is annoying and just as there is a command to skip the start menu, there could also be one for warnings
17:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the problem this warning is meant to solve is that people don't distribute broken skins
17:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if there was a way to skip the warning, people would do that instead of fixing the skins, creating problems further down the line
17:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hence the warning cannot be disabled
18:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Naist> Yes, but he is little aware that when the skins are resized in a better quality and resolution, they stop working in previous versions of the client. Bugged, i play in 12.6 bcs all of 15.x version have freeze problems
18:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Naist> I dont have ss in this moment of bugg on the HD skins in old client
18:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i wish u could automap in-game entities somehow
18:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @louis I don't understand. do you mean things like "put collision everywhere where this layer has a tile"?
18:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> no i meant like use a custom tileset instead of entities_clear.png (the entities you use while playing, not entities in the map editor)
18:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> so like connected hookables in a map would be automapped to some tileset, same with unhookable + other tiles
18:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> support for automappable entities would be sick
18:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah 🙂
18:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think the gamer client had that
18:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> :o
18:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> something we could easily merge?
18:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> idk if it would get merged xd but maybe into a custom client
18:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not something we can easily merge, but it could be something to take inspiration from
18:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> hmm, I know we can't post custom links here, but could you dm me if you know of a link?
18:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> hmm, I know we can't post custom clients here, but could you dm me if you know of a link?
18:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> u can post custom clients as long as they arent bots
18:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> idk if it's a bot
18:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> is the thing
18:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i dont think it is, just client mods
18:50 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ah
18:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12622 maybe this might be it
18:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> idk if its the correct version
18:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> nouis when will you have time to make map with me :nouis:
18:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> o
18:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> 2050
18:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> :(
18:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> you don't want to make te-esports???
18:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> after school year maybe
18:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> pog
18:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> wait wth are you still in hs
18:53 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there are young people and old people around 😉
18:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I started with tw when I was well below 18
19:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i wonder if tw will still be around when im older lol
19:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://events.ccc.de/2021/05/03/aktueller-stand-zur-jahresendveranstaltung/
19:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe a CCC this year. let's see if it works out. oO
20:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> gamer client is good client
20:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> because 0.7
20:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> sweat = yes
20:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> take it as a compliment but I thought u were old af
21:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> yeah some people think that lol
21:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> All mods are 21+ right?
21:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> no lol i was 15 when i was mod
21:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> not sure if i'm the youngest, theres been a lot of new mods
21:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> They worked before, but they were less accurate
21:25 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Also about the freeze problem just type gfx_opengl_major 2;gfx_opengl_minor 0 and restart. Normally the client should already do that
21:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or if u dont own the product for 2 years refund it as manifacture broken
21:59 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there is also a new envelop curve
22:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i like it, probs looks too modern compared to the rest of the UI tho xd
22:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ✅
22:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> do you know if I can add one type of mapitem using CDataFile::AddItem in  separate chunks like images then tiles then images? Or do I need to add one type of maptiles all in one go?
22:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think that should work
