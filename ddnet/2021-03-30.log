00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look this
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> massive patch
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 @heinrich5991 
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe you remember my question on how to make the emotes look smooth, like on fng2+, well, I found the cause, its sv_high_bandwidth which sends the m_CurrentGameTick so the animation looks smoother. I tried to send a SNAPEMTPY to update the current tick for the client between each snapshot, because with my 128p support i will definitely not go on snapshots every tick, lol :D already tested it, thats too much.
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but i did not get anything good or smooth with the SNAPEMPTY contatining the current tick, maybe you have another solution?
02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Jupstar ✪ only windows borderless and windowed dont cause any issues here
02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but i play in fullscreen so ill probably just downgrade drivers and deal with freezebug anyways
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Still really strange
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> btw while on that driver i noticed some behavior like that green glitchy thing some ppl had before
07:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but not ingame, only for a small second when booting up
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> That might be OK. Can just be uninitialized memory
09:15 <+bridge> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> <twbridge "[ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> When does dd"> What makes you mention that now when those issues are known for years already :/ ?
09:17 <+bridge> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> What is all behind that?
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Sorry what?
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Ah about kog? I mentioned that few times. I also requested to fix since stuff to qshar about 2-3 years ago or go open source to fix it myself.. Nothing happened
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Fix few*
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Anyway I won't discuss it further as I was requested not to here
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "What is all behind that?"
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I'd also put the rest of the closed source servers in the ddnet tab out, like noby fng, into a "community" tab or smth, bcs it doesnt fit ddnet's openness/trancparency

10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> #2977
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2977
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I've nothing against pvp mods on ddnet tab, aslong as ddnet maintaince them
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and fit the ddnet ecosystem
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> What do you wanna fix?
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> /emote was it back then, but i can also look it up in the discord chat
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ iirc noby was open to the idea of opening up fngs source
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby if you still feel like it I could help you abstract out the antibot like we did for ddnet
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> agree
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Closed source mods are quite unfortunate, they get lost and recreated all the time.
16:44 <+bridge> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> Who knows, maybe that happened to the KoG Modification years ago))) Thatswhy no updates.
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> Hihi @Jupstar ✪  @deen such open ecosystem much fortune :D https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/pull/29#issuecomment-810131881
17:53 <+ChillerDragon> yea sorry deen for being a jerk xD just thought its funny cuz i red that commit on gh then i hop to irc and see this. I had to mention it :D I mean i get it its a bloated thing and its already in place. Convience wins.
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think the problem here is really, that its effort you dont want todo rn xD
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But i also cannot judge how important your pr is xD
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> its not important
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> and as i said its effort and i understand
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> but still its sad to feel so excluded from the most interesting repo of ddnet :/
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xDDD
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ddnet-scripts doesn't feel that important. It's just a bunch of quickly thrown together shell and python scripts, thrown together with duct ta pe
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and it's not just about convenience. with how bad the networks are we would often get inconsistent states on the individual servers by having multiple repositories to sync
