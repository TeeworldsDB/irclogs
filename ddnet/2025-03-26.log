00:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> open source antibot module just dropped
00:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> bleeding edge detections
00:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
00:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```C++
00:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> bool CAntibob::OnSayNetMessage(const CNetMsg_Cl_Say *pMsg, int ClientId, const CUnpacker *pUnpacker)
00:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> {
00:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon>     if(str_find_nocase(pMsg->m_pMessage, "i am using a cheat client"))
00:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon>         Kick(ClientId, "self report");
00:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon>     return false;
00:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> }
00:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```
00:21 < furo> Finally a stop to the cheating problem with this antibot!
00:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> indeed i solved botting
00:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you are welcome
00:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> furo thanks for ddnet bomb btw i looked at your code :) 
00:24 < furo> Ah nice!
00:28 < bridge> <ramirok_> !
00:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you did not consider liers
00:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> "i am not using a cheat client" doesnt kick them if they are using a cheat client
00:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Lie detector is next item on todo list
00:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But so far my cheating player base was surprisingly honest
00:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i see
00:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that suprises me
00:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Me too
00:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> are you sure that there isnt actually a majority in the players who are lying to you
00:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which you dont know about cuz theyre lying to you
00:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Fair point
00:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But if the majority was lying about cheating. That would mathematically result in over 100% cheaters
00:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 50% of all peoplea are cheating and not lying about it?
00:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea
00:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s bad
00:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats alot of cheaters
00:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
00:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i hope that >100% of people are cheating lying or not
00:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i hope that >100% of people are *not* cheating lying or not
00:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There for sure have been rounds with 100% cheaters I have seen it
00:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> D:
00:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> At that point I stopped kicking
00:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Because it was fair game
00:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> [ban](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/633552031591956480.webp?size=48&name=ban) [ban](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/633552031591956480.webp?size=48&name=ban) ?
00:57 < bridge> <Sans> npm/ddnet https://ddnet.js.org written for typescript mainly
00:58 < bridge> <Sans> yes
00:58 < bridge> <Sans> sorry I was eating D:
00:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do not apologise for being a skeleton
00:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> everyone needs food to keep there skeleton fresh
00:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lol
00:59 < bridge> <Sans> chiller what do you think of javascript on the server
00:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Epic
00:59 < bridge> <Sans> my man :owo:
01:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> OG meskalin who was involved in ath once was working on a new project
01:00 < bridge> <teero777> chiller is devving 100% accurate lie detector just from text input without context let's goo
01:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> With js bindings instead of lua bindings
01:00 < bridge> <Sans> npm/ddnet https://ddnet.js.org written for typescript/node mainly
01:00 < bridge> <teero777> meskalin is goated xd
01:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> js is the best scripting language change my mind
01:00 < bridge> <teero777> crazy giy
01:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Indeed
01:00 < bridge> <Sans> typescript.
01:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (and a pretty good language in general)
01:00 < bridge> <teero777> *guy
01:00 < bridge> <Sans> giy
01:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> typescript is barely a different language 👀
01:01 < bridge> <Sans> but it makes all the difference
01:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @teero777: self hosting llama is pretty smooth. Can just send the chat to llm and ask if it should kick or not. Half of these Russians discuss cheat settings in game anyways. Seems doable
01:01 < bridge> <teero777> ngl that's not even stupid
01:02 < bridge> <Sans> I tried that with chat geepeetee at some point, it decided that everyone should be kicked :sad:
01:02 < bridge> <teero777> correct
01:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is this why u need translate?
01:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It for sure would ban me then tho -.- I chat sus
01:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> xd
01:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
01:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the russian translate is pretty bad with the netspeak though ):
01:02 < bridge> <teero777> if char >=256 kick()
01:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sadge
01:03 < bridge> <Sans> doesnt cover enough cases
01:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its... usable if you are trying to have a conversation
01:03 < bridge> <Sans> just to be sure:
01:03 < bridge> <Sans> 
01:03 < bridge> <Sans> if true kick()
01:03 < bridge> <Sans> redundant if because we all like loosing braincells from time to time
01:04 < bridge> <teero777> tbh I want to make a watcher server someday. Where it's just 64 automated tees doing things and you can watch them do things
01:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> sus
01:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i do this on the ctf bot server
01:04 < bridge> <Sans> that'd be an interesting experiment, just have random ai tees do stuff and see where they end up
01:04 < bridge> <Sans> istg they're gonna form a racist group against twinbops
01:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes @teero777 pls write me a bot that revives ctf
01:04 < bridge> <teero777> wdym sus I love rule 7 and have never broken it
01:05 < bridge> <Sans> :Doubt:
01:05 < bridge> <teero777> nooo
01:05 < bridge> <teero777> not the ddracism
01:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Insert souly quote
01:06 < bridge> <soulyvevo> hi
01:06 < bridge> <teero777> what algorithms would you even use to make interesting emergent behavior in tee land
01:06 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i got a notification from matrix when u typed my name
01:06 < bridge> <Sans> just toss an llm somewhere in there
01:06 < bridge> <teero777> smth like ant simulation stuff? Where they follow trails and maybe build groups
01:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i would say "throw an ai at it" but thats not going to be very fast
01:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is this for vanilla or ddrace or gores or block?
01:07 < bridge> <Sans> that's lame, how about starting with that but actually giving them a goal?
01:07 < bridge> <Sans> or random goals
01:07 < bridge> <Sans> or even a goal where they have to choose their own goals and acomplish them
01:07 < bridge> <teero777> pfff
01:07 < bridge> <teero777> Soon with my beautiful c99 it's atleast not going to be CPU bottlenecked anymorre
01:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont think the language is what dictates ais being slow compared to human algorithms
01:08 < bridge> <teero777> man your sarcasm sector is really low
01:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Souly send twinbop bind
01:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sector?
01:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> bind q player_skin twinbop
01:09 < bridge> <Sans> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/342454474117218334/979686303492890654/11.gif
01:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> wow souly and solly together in one room
01:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> woaw thes is hot
01:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is the ctf bot open source?
01:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1354246116245377186/image.png?ex=67e4977a&is=67e345fa&hm=c4bfe537722a28aa21bb695ca8338d055e5d3fb888d3c5eac0b2d971d36f6955&
01:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this isnt it
01:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon how easy it to make serverside bots in ddnet-insta or ddnet in general
01:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Well there is debug dummies but they are debug only
01:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> they are probably a good base
01:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> dont they have some input added to them
01:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
01:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s on my todo but I don’t like the amount of times it requires to remove the debug if statement
01:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
01:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also idk how to code proper inputs that’s what I need Teero for
01:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont think open sourcing the kinda things teero does is a good idea
01:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i just want something dumb and funny
01:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Me too
01:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There are some open source ctf bots
01:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> they are quite old
01:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i cant go into spectate in this one and the bots leave when you do
01:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There is something odd about banning humans that use bots to then fill the empty server with bots controlled by the server
01:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because the bots i want to write wont have an unfair advantage
01:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> they will suck ass
01:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am waiting for a irl robot that sucks ass
01:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ._______.
01:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But ye I get your point. Botting is okay if it is still fun to play against and winnable. But I would argue that even applies to the Voldemort playerbase on my fng server. You can still easily farm them somehow
01:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> nnnnnnnoooo
01:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> mmmmmm
01:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> your logic is flawless, yet i cannot agree with you
01:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the vibes are off if humans hack
01:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its like how tassing official records is boo, go die of a cliff
01:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but making tas tools and tassing unofficial records is yipee, go glide of a gliff
01:26 < bridge> <teero777> chiller too much nsfw
01:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> chiller cant be timedout
01:26 < bridge> <teero777> oof
01:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> rule 69 or what?
01:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I thought \#developer is 18+
01:27 < bridge> <teero777> I would like to inquire more about your irl ass sucking robot
01:27 < bridge> <teero777> I don't think it is
01:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Then I can’t comment more
01:27 < bridge> <teero777> ~~I would like to inquire more about your irl ass sucking robot~~
01:27 < bridge> <teero777> okay
01:27 < bridge> <teero777> It's gine
01:28 < bridge> <teero777> fine
01:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But I built a prototype
01:28 < bridge> <teero777> Are you home yet?
01:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Streamed the process on of
01:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am home
01:28 < bridge> <teero777> nice
01:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Are you meeting me in Munich?
01:28 < bridge> <teero777> btw what's the best cpu you've got
01:29 < bridge> <teero777> nope, not het
01:29 < bridge> <teero777> yet
01:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Raspberry pi 4
01:29 < bridge> <teero777> oh that's strong
01:29 < bridge> <teero777> prob better than my Intel Xeon 1240-e5
01:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> When I bought my new pc I went for the strongest single core power at the time
01:30 < bridge> <teero777> optimizing is so fun ngl
01:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I forgot the name I posted it in developer just grep ChillerDragon.\*i9 or something like that
01:30 < bridge> <teero777> You just keep staring and thinking and then smth goes into your head, you apply it and you get a -20ms on the benchmark
01:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That’s so nice
01:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Don’t forget to upstream all of it
01:31 < bridge> <teero777> to ddnet repo? hell nH
01:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I need 1024 player hammer hit action on ddnet servers
01:31 < bridge> <teero777> nah
01:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why not
01:32 < bridge> <teero777> because it's a complete rewrite
01:32 < bridge> <teero777> also I'm not translating this back to c++11
01:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You make a clean c99 lib right?
01:32 < bridge> <teero777> ye
01:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just send a pr to delete all code in ddnet and add yours as external dependency
01:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Modularized ddnet finally
01:33 < bridge> <teero777> unifying prediction and server code would be so good xd
01:33 < bridge> <teero777> well this would be very stupid too xd
01:33 < bridge> <teero777> give the botters even more performance
01:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You are the botters
01:34 < bridge> <teero777> mhh kinda ig
01:34 < bridge> <teero777> but giving Voldemort client a free boost iseh
01:34 < bridge> <teero777> *meh
01:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @sollybunny: botter detected
01:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Teero just admitted it
01:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Chat based antibot is effective!
01:35 < bridge> <teero777> I am the friendly neighborhood robot
01:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Like wall-e?
01:35 < bridge> <teero777> yea I pickup your trash code and compress/optimize it
01:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nice
01:36 < bridge> <teero777> jupstar is cooking too on ddnetrs
01:37 < bridge> <teero777> but there seems to be a bug somewhere tho xd
01:38 < bridge> <teero777> chiller have you never thought about making a ddnet rewrite like ddnetrs where you make everything like you like it?
01:54 < bridge> <soulyvevo> they gonna ban me
02:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ban ban
02:18 < bridge> <kebscs> maybe should change the error message
02:18 < bridge> <kebscs> this gets asked 10 times a day
02:18 < bridge> <kebscs> noone knows what "udp filtered" means
02:45 < bridge> <Property of Souly> i think laser and shotgun sharing a  head is alright
02:45 < bridge> <Property of Souly> grabber Could be changed but idk what to
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> case IClient::CONNECTIVITY_UNREACHABLE:
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     pConnectivityLabel = Localize("UDP seems to be filtered.");
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     break;
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah thats a horrible error message
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> bool HaveTriedALittle = m_NumUnsuccessfulTries >= 5 && (m_LastResponse == -1 || Now - m_LastResponse >= 30 * Freq);
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if(m_LastResponse == -1 && !HaveTriedALittle)
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> {
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     return CONNECTIVITY::CHECKING;
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> }
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> else if(HaveTriedALittle)
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> {
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     return CONNECTIVITY::UNREACHABLE;
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> }
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> unreachable means
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> m_NumUnsuccessfulTries >= 5 (5 packets were sent with no response) (not reset it seems, so this is just used at startup) and no packet has been recieved
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Now - m_LastResponse >= 30 * Freq (the last recieved packet was more than 30 seconds ago)
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> "Server is not responding" is better, you can have more details though
03:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> "Server is not responding, UDP may be filtered, or the server may be overloaded"
03:10 < bridge> <kebscs> Exactly
03:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we should add whether a server is overloaded in mastersrv
03:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think just changing the msg for now is fine
03:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> morning tater
03:39 < bridge> <totar> I think the reasoning behind this error message is that the master server is able to connect to the server so it's most likely not unreachable unless it went down in the few seconds between the master server updating and you clicking join
03:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i see
03:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but obviously that isnt the case most of the time
03:40 < bridge> <totar> but that wouldn't be accurate if you join directly
03:40 < bridge> <totar> what is the reason most of the time?
03:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> server is getting ddosed
03:40 < bridge> <totar> hmm yeah
03:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the ddosed server seems to get dissapeared from the master quite quickly
03:41 < bridge> <totar> it's not a very good error message regardless
03:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think changing it is a good idea
03:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also sometimes you get it if the server just refuses to respond
03:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> eg if your ip is not verified
03:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> on ger3 or something
03:42 < bridge> <totar> I don't think you get this message when that happens
03:42 < bridge> <totar> do you?
03:42 < bridge> <totar> I thought it just stays on connecting or some other step
03:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well when i was trying to connect to awb
03:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> with my different udp ip
03:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it was stuck on udp may be filtered
03:42 < bridge> <totar> ah awb is different than ger3
03:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> le code
03:42 < bridge> <totar> it should definitley say unreachable
03:43 < bridge> <totar> it should definitely say unreachable
03:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `Server is not responding. The server may be overloaded, or UDP might be filtered.`
03:43 < bridge> <totar> yeah
03:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk what unreachable is meant to mean
03:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cuz you throw packets into the eather, they might be reaching... the server
03:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> not responding is better i think
03:44 < bridge> <totar> I suppose
03:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> das is whats being measured
03:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> what happened to ger3.ddnet.org
03:44 < bridge> <totar> it was replaced
03:44 < bridge> <totar> with a different method
03:44 < bridge> <totar> it only verifys you through the client now
03:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont remember was ger3 still ddosed?
03:45 < bridge> <totar> is ger3 the protected server?
03:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> was yeah
03:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the one with the tclient feature
03:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which was disapeared
03:45 < bridge> <totar> it definitely gets ddosed but I don't think it ever went down because of it
03:45 < bridge> <totar> that's the point
03:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> most servers dont go down when theyre ddosed
03:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> just... unplayable
03:45 < bridge> <totar> the service did not get denied
03:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ?
03:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> dedicated denail of service
03:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well service being playing
03:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> very much denied
03:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats a bit of a bad name
03:46 < bridge> <totar> it's distributed denial of service
03:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oops yeah
03:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> lots of words begin with d
03:47 < bridge> <totar> although idk if there's a different name for when you do denial of service with a network volume attack like how ddos happens. there's other attacks that also get called denial of service
03:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> slow loris
03:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but its not denying service thats what the goal most probably is
03:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its just overloading the server
03:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
03:49 < bridge> <totar> that's the same thing
03:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i cant think of a better name
03:49 < bridge> <totar> if the server won't serve you then the service was denied
03:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> denied
03:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i guess
03:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im very tired
03:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i just got carried thru a "1 star brutal" it was not 1 star
03:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i got lied too
03:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Denial of service is any attack that makes the service unable to respond to legitimate requests

04:52 < bridge> <Ewan> Easier to take a kid at their word when they say that’s how they read something than it is to have them read it again
04:52 < bridge> <Ewan> do that enough and then the kid doesn’t have to try much of the time
04:53 < bridge> <Ewan> also it’s hereditary
04:53 < bridge> <Ewan> enough broader diagnoses based on the above

08:28 < bridge> <teero777> hi hi gm
08:43 < bridge> <zerolacqua> gm
08:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> hi
08:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> finally full black mode in discord
09:03 < bridge> <meloƞ> The discord update sucks, let's go back to teamspeak
09:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I kinda like it, but it needs more polishment.. some things have too high contrast or look out of place
09:09 < bridge> <soulyvevo> really odd contrast and overall color choices
09:09 < bridge> <soulyvevo> not a fan
09:09 < bridge> <soulyvevo> and those darker themes are even worse
09:15 < bridge> <Sans> Fun fact: if you go to experiments and find the desktop visual refresh one, you can say no to discord's bs and go back to old UI
09:15 < bridge> <Sans> until they remove the experiment at least
09:48 < bridge> <Assa> I have an idea, maybe just the square rotating, similar to "pulley", and you might be able to indicate strength with the rotation speed 🤔 will test this
10:37 < bridge> <fushi_gg> this is revolutionary
12:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Everything in ddnet is how I like it. I couldn’t do it any better. Idk how to code a working game
12:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat BIG NEWS
12:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://v8.dev/blog/leaving-the-sea-of-nodes
12:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> sea of nodes i no longer a trend
12:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> at first I wanted to make sea of nodes ir
13:26 < bridge> <Assa> is that so? Then take a look at maplayers and tell me it's absolutely how you like it
14:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `This is the message when neither the server responds nor the STUN server does. Since the STUN server is independent of the game server, it doesn't indicate that the game server is overloaded.`
14:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is the "stun server" (still not really sure what that is) a seperate executable or on the master server side?
14:37 < bridge> <Assa> @kebscs We are getting there 💪

15:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki how bad of an idea would it be to do something like this? https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2024&gist=06ae773ffcf6b5edcb6b91f9299b90ea 😬
15:07 < bridge> <kebscs> Nice
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u gonna use rc refcell just use the arena crate i sent u
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> it gives u typed ids
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://docs.rs/typed-generational-arena/latest/typed_generational_arena/
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u dont need removal u can use the StandardSlab arena it has

15:13 < bridge> <Property of Souly> are the square heads reverted now or smth
15:13 < bridge> <Assa> they are still in review
15:13 < bridge> <Assa> but I can still work on this in parallel 😎
15:14 < bridge> <Assa> even without touching each others code
15:15 < bridge> <Property of Souly> nice
15:18 < bridge> <fushi_gg> what if I put my laserdoor right next to yours 👉 👈
15:19 < bridge> <Assa> you can even put your laserdoor over the border 😉
15:21 < bridge> <Assa> I just found a bug
15:21 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1354460338417959223/screenshot_2025-03-26_15-21-28.png?ex=67e55efd&is=67e40d7d&hm=d7104cfd20c24cb0d724aab30d6b92a501e9bc2907543b3866144ce3c5f3cb5f&
15:23 < bridge> <Assa> also I think I don't get laser doors, why is the star on the left "on" when the middle door part has number 16?
15:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i don't really get how it would help me, i use `Rc<RefCell<>>` to be able to insert data in the vec
15:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> for me its more type safe, probs also more perfomant but idk, i generally dislike going for rc refcell xD
15:26 < bridge> <kebscs> Just copy rendering code from the existing function in game
15:26 < bridge> <kebscs> Thats what i did for weapon entities
15:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i also could just pass mutable reference to the vector, but it's stupid, it should be obvious where the new item should be added
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki i assume you use gentoo with march=native? also mtune=native?
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ever did tests if they are worth it?
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes, no
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and the 3rd answer? XD
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes to the first 2
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> no to last
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDD
15:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> testing for the weak
15:28 < bridge> <Assa> no, I just use it directly. Also doors abuse a CLaserObject over network, I don't know how the server calculates the positions
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I see, gotta say in rust cpu-target=native seems really worth it on the x3d
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dunno why xd
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In c apps not really
15:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust strict aliasing best
15:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> the more never llvm the better
15:34 < bridge> <Assa> The server creates a CDoor object, which also does a lot of other stuff. To say I simplified this a lot would be an understatement
15:34 < bridge> <Assa> The server creates a CDoor object, which also does a lot of other stuff. To say I simplified this a lot would be an understatement, since I really only render a laser in color
15:36 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly always looked like a bad idea to me, but that's because I'm just not very good with graphs, very mathematically complex
16:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it is suprisingly easy to make server side bots
16:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> wtf, my browser crashed and when I restarted I have the new discord design
16:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> unfortunate
16:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Hater
16:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yes

16:24 < bridge> <Property of Souly> did you like the previous design before this new one
16:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it didnt have a title bar or make the user thing a modal when its very much not
16:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I got used to the previous one, and the new one feels worse 😬
16:26 < bridge> <Property of Souly> you'll get used to this new one too
16:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> facts
16:27 < bridge> <Property of Souly> tbh i dont even mind it
16:27 < bridge> <Property of Souly> darkest mode + compact feels a lot better on desktop
16:45 < bridge> <zerolacqua> Github cards become dark too? I think they were white in dark mode.

16:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> tower
16:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki I came up with a pretty cool solution, instead of storing the reference to the vector in all instances of `BasicBlock` I can make a `BuilderOrSmth` which will borrow mutably parts of `Function` and drop them when it's done https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2024&gist=5ff8f636f9e5088959589759c5754070

17:47 < bridge> <kebscs> x, y wont be lower than 0 bcs of the for loop
17:47 < bridge> <kebscs> so you dont have to use getindex here
17:53 < bridge> <Assa> yes but why should I not use GetIndex here?
17:58 < bridge> <kebscs> bcs getindex has 4 if checks
18:01 < bridge> <Assa> technically it has only 1 if check, but I know what you mean

22:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> Accounts.
22:36 < bridge> <kebscs> ./report can just ping mods on a private channel with server ip and have a cooldown per server 👍
22:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> Afair archimede is/was maintainer, hope he's doing well haven't seen him in a long time
22:36 < bridge> <kebscs> ./report could just ping mods on a private channel with server ip and have a cooldown per server 👍

22:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> :monkalaugh:
22:39 < bridge> <property of fingers> uhm i dont have to deal with it so i think its a good idea
22:39 < bridge> <kebscs> same
22:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> would be nice if reports were grouped (the bot would edit the msg)
22:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> 2 years little one
22:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so 1 ping per report
22:39 < bridge> <kebscs> if you applied for a mod its your problem now deal with my reports 😄
22:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> :KEKW:
22:40 < bridge> <property of fingers> how about no pings
22:40 < bridge> <property of fingers> and its like a forms channel
22:40 < bridge> <property of fingers> and it creates a new form for every report
22:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i hate the forms channel
22:40 < bridge> <property of fingers> forms are the best wdym??
22:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> specially if i have to access many forumn posts
22:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> Ah yes I do love me some tickets

22:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i complain about moderation alot, but i never *ping* anyone (im better than everyone else)
22:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> I love when they ping Chinese moderators in a ticket written in russian
22:41 < bridge> <kebscs> tickets are a bad design
22:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> The hell they supposed to do :kekw:
22:42 < bridge> <kebscs> ./report with idk 15min cooldown per server, and it just sends a msg on a private channel
22:42 < bridge> <kebscs> nameless tee reported on 127.0.0.1 ddnet ger novice, with message: blocker :)
22:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> what stops the blocker from sending a fake report, creating an internal cool down so he can't be reported ingame anymore?
22:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ^ thats a problem with vote kicks
22:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ^ thats a problem with vote kicks aswell
22:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> It all comes down to accounts
22:43 < bridge> <kebscs> hmm
22:43 < bridge> <kebscs> good point
22:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> along with the everlasting desire for humans to expand, account with solve reports
22:43 < bridge> <kebscs> so no cooldown pers server just per player
22:43 < bridge> <kebscs> so no cooldown per server just per player
22:43 < bridge> <kebscs> or ip
22:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> People discovering {insert IP changing method here} spamming a report every 10 seconds
22:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why havent accounts been added yet?
22:46 < bridge> <meloƞ> They still cooking
22:46 < bridge> <kebscs> ok so you need to be on server for at least 5/10min to use /report
22:46 < bridge> <kebscs> so now its spammed every 10min not 10s
22:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it would be poggers to have it hooked up like other communities have
22:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> before implementing it in ui
22:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> People joining 50 servers via {insert method to do that here}, sending 50 reports at once every 10 minutes
22:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> :justatest:
22:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> I don't see a way how this cannot be abused
22:47 < bridge> <kebscs> ignore false reports 👍
22:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> Without accounts and a verification method like 2FA, Discord or steam
22:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> A good discussion can be found within the Accounts issue on GitHub
22:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> It's a disgusting discussion but that topic has been running in there as well
22:49 < bridge> <kebscs> :/
22:51 < bridge> <kebscs> accounts code started in rust and now the dev does smth diff
22:51 < bridge> <kebscs> ddnet rewrite
22:51 < bridge> <kebscs> and noone wants to touch the rust code..
22:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> Eh the accounts code is done and fully functional, afair it's on hold until Heinrich finished QUIC to write the client implementation
22:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (why quic?)
22:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> Eh the accounts code is done and fully functional, afair it's on hold until Heinrich finishes QUIC to write the client implementation
22:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> :dTeuPeposhrug:  sorry no idea
22:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> It's just what I picked up
22:54 < bridge> <robyt3> It gives us encryption among other things, which is required for accounts
22:54 < bridge> <kebscs> couldnt it be not rust
22:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> I think especially for that usecase rust was a great choice
22:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why do we need encryption?
22:55 < bridge> <teero777> I think so too
22:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> how does rcon stuff work
22:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> Well doesn't ddnet send all data in plaintext?
22:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> It's rather unsafe innit
22:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> Well doesn't ddnet send almost all data in plaintext?
22:56 < bridge> <kebscs> maybe, but not for a project where no other dev does rust
22:56 < bridge> <teero777> are you really asking why account network stuff needs encryption? xd
22:56 < bridge> <kebscs> so we just indefinetly wait for heinrich
22:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> authentication can be doen without the protocol its on supporting encryption
22:56 < bridge> <teero777> Like half of the DDNet dev team knows rust xd
22:57 < bridge> <Ewan> if we are to add accounts then the entire point would be to have a handle on each user uniquely and individually, without encryption you are begging to have compromised account details in things like third party clients
22:57 < bridge> <Ewan> already shady and widespread clients
22:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it would be nice if everything authentication and rcon was encrypted but its not required
22:57 < bridge> <kebscs> cant tell with how fast its progressing
22:58 < bridge> <Ewan> it is 2025, yes it is
22:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it just means playing on public networks means they can sniff rcon data but not auth
22:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i hope that rcon auth isnt just sent in plaintext
22:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> Me make client
22:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> Me send u client
22:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> U start client
22:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> I see your config dir
22:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> I sniff
22:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> I steal
22:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> I win
22:59 < bridge> <meloƞ> Given it's.. all plaintext
22:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> same with accounts
22:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> same with everything encrypted
22:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> just steal the auth token
22:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or when i type in password/username
23:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> - and is pubkey encrypted
23:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> \- and is pubkey encrypted
23:00 < bridge> <property of fingers> why would it be
23:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because your making it seem like a sniffer could steal an rcon password
23:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> 95% of registered kog enjoyers have their login token bound to l
23:01 < bridge> <meloƞ> Which is saved in plaintext
23:02 < bridge> <property of fingers> yep
23:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> same thing with rcon logins
23:02 < bridge> <property of fingers> i have it in my bindwheel actually
23:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it is just in plain text
23:02 < bridge> <robyt3> They can. You shouldn't auth on an insecure network without a VPN at the moment
23:02 < bridge> <robyt3> See https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/tree/master/wireshark-dissector
23:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that should be changed
23:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but just the authentication *can* be pubkey encrypted
23:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> :nouis:
23:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also a malicious client has much more things to do than steal your kog credentials :)
23:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 🤑
23:03 < bridge> <property of fingers> kog credentials is just 1 of the credentials its gonna steal
23:04 < bridge> <robyt3> That's probably not a scenario that the account system would be robust against, if an attacker compromised your machine you have bigger problems
23:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> That's why you don't run untrusted binaries of anything
23:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:04 < bridge> <meloƞ> But we can only protect our user base *that much*
23:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk why people do that, so easy to fat finger on a server which echos the message back
23:04 < bridge> <teero777> XDDDD
23:04 < bridge> <teero777> devhub moment
23:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> about to say
23:05 < bridge> <meloƞ> :Aware:  oh god what have you done
23:05 < bridge> <teero777> I stole your rcon!!!
23:05 < bridge> <teero777> You wouldn't ever know
23:05 < bridge> <property of fingers> like voldermourt client
23:06 < bridge> <teero777> I have it on f5
23:06 < bridge> <teero777> hard to far finger
23:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i use f5 for +hookcoll

23:06 < bridge> <teero777> ??????
23:06 < bridge> <teero777> wtf
23:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont use it that much
23:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i have hook lines turned on permantnly, its just for other people
23:07 < bridge> <kebscs> hack client
23:07 < bridge> <kebscs> self report
23:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its not turing complete sadly so no
23:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> recently ive got no cursor either, i found that i didnt need it

23:09 < bridge> <teero777> psssshhh
23:10 < bridge> <teero777> It's like 2x faster now tho
23:10 < bridge> <teero777> 9.8m tps on jupstar cpu single core
23:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> Mother of god, I peaked at 6m tps and thought it's decent
23:11 < bridge> <teero777> on ctf1 too
23:11 < bridge> <teero777> so many pickups
23:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> Or did you improve it even harder
23:11 < bridge> <teero777> Well I optimized multiple rhings
23:11 < bridge> <teero777> Yes ofc xd
23:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> c99 masterrace
23:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> :KEKW:
23:11 < bridge> <teero777> I'm still reading that manual tater sent me
23:11 < bridge> <teero777> There is a lot of cool stuff in it
23:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> link it to me in {secret gigachad DC}
23:13 < bridge> <teero777> It's fine here. It's a good resource
23:13 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1354578993780625849/optimizing_cpp.pdf?ex=67e5cd7e&is=67e47bfe&hm=6f69779837c17eee615e482c39298694ec5c8669031bb09094015ca20d2eafb5&
23:13 < bridge> <property of fingers> nice pdf file
23:13 < bridge> <teero777> The website is linked inside
23:13 < bridge> <property of fingers> is this gonna steal my rcon?
23:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> defo a virus
23:13 < bridge> <teero777> It's one manual of a series
23:13 < bridge> <teero777> sure
23:14 < bridge> <teero777> If not for the 50 pickups on ctf1 jupstar can prob do 12m xd
23:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> :Aware:
23:15 < bridge> <teero777> I haven't done pickup chunking yet and there is some stuff you can precalculate
23:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> btw @teero777 have you made it so it only calculates hook collision only when the hook starts
23:19 < bridge> <teero777> no.
23:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do that
23:20 < bridge> <teero777> that would help a lot. Doesn't it change physics?
23:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you hook destination cant change
23:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> your hook can be detacthed by a tp or dead player but that should be fine
23:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (you do have to take into account hook travel time)
23:20 < bridge> <teero777> another player could also run into your hook
23:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh that is true
23:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> darn ):<
23:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well you can definatley cut down alot of the hook calculations still
23:21 < bridge> <teero777> Also calculating one big intersectline isn't much more perf than doing multiple small ones
23:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well you are doing 1 every frame vs 1 every hook
23:21 < bridge> <teero777> Intersect line is pretty optimized already in my code
23:21 < bridge> <teero777> no? xd
23:22 < bridge> <teero777> Only when the hook flys
23:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh well yeah
23:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> do you want to send ur password "mymomlovesme" over plain text?
23:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> see the rest of the conversation
23:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> tldr: you can pubkey encrypt passwords/authentication without the whole thing being encrypted
23:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> we all do rust
23:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> heinrich quic poc is really nice, its transparent to the protocol
23:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> is this on the server that hates ddnet devs? xd
23:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> mde of only ddnet devs
23:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> 🤷  rule nr. 1 of bookclub
23:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> You don't talk about bookclub
23:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i broke rule nr. 1
23:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not there so
23:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> False, we have enjoyers of other communities aswell
23:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i heard u hate us
23:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> jupstar is in it
23:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> interesting

23:26 < bridge> <teero777> XDDDD
23:26 < bridge> <teero777>  moment
23:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> is it ppl without merge rights complaining about ppl with merge rights + jupstar? xd
23:26 < bridge> <meloƞ> not at all, ddnet is rarely a topic actually
23:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> It's just needs living life
23:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
23:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> It's just nerds living life
23:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> this chat is also rarely on topic
23:27 < bridge> <teero777> *very rarely*
23:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> yeah true, we're ddnet-rs simps

23:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgor
23:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> It's bound to development :cammo:
23:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> I know one... :cat_cracked_hehe:
23:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> But to be fair, I'm literally everywhere
23:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> I like to get involved, not even sure why
23:29 < bridge> <teero777> you are not on the sigma discord.... And you don't want to be
23:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
23:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> meanwhile here i am oblivious to the back rooms
23:29 < bridge> <teero777> entry level there is 2 discord warnings
23:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> 💀
23:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have been banned from ddnet twice
23:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
23:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> It was jao wasn't it
23:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> heinrich
23:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
23:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> Xd
23:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> also i had a vendetta against gdin
23:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
23:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> Dinner my beloved
23:30 < bridge> <teero777> haha what about meskalin
23:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> and onionme
23:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> HE WAS ONLINE FOR THE NAUFRAGE EVENT
23:30 < bridge> <teero777> He hates you with passion
23:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh yeah
23:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> I was so happy
23:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> did meskalin have other names
23:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> was he vali
23:30 < bridge> <teero777> no
23:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> teemo
23:30 < bridge> <teero777> no
23:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> Vali is someone lese
23:31 < bridge> <teero777> Meskalin O.o
23:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> how do u know that tho
23:31 < bridge> <teero777> goated guy
23:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there are at least 3 ddnet members in that dc 😄
23:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
23:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyone seen soreu?
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and you know all 3 in rl
23:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> hi_leute_gll
23:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> :o
23:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> Been a while, last seen 2015
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no, he rq'd and also said he does not plan to come back
23:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> why im not invited then
23:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> :d
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dunno xd
23:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> reminds me of voxel.. but soreu had other problems
23:33 < bridge> <teero777> We need to keep the rust <-> everything else balance xd
23:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> he worked as security iirc
23:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> looking at cameras
23:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh u dont want rust preachers i see
23:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
23:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you can have my slot on that server
23:33 < bridge> <teero777> we already have like 5
23:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> ????
23:33 < bridge> <teero777> ???
23:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> but from my pov ddnet tech advancements are all rust
23:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> You isn't leaving boy
23:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> You is staying
23:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> thanks to zwelf and patiga

23:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> do you have interesting coding convos or its just memes
23:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> it's 2 nerds talking about algorithms, a lot of cars and memes
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> riozaki
23:35 < bridge> <teero777> Dunno, I'm about to sleep and no one here can help me with coding soooo
23:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> ryuzaki
23:36 < bridge> <teero777> Dunno, I'm about to sleep and no one here is able help me with coding soooo
23:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would help u but u use C kek
23:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's mostly about everyone talks about their projects
23:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> Wake learath
23:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and other ppl sometimes give feedback
23:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats nice
23:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> That ddnet playground thing you did
23:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i do that, but here xd
23:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> Hate it, should've written it in haskell
23:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> :cat_cracked_hehe:
23:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr learn ocaml
23:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> ocaml is pog it just has bad tooling
23:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> I rather learn MilkeeyCats lang
23:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> should have written in javascript and have 30k fps
23:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
23:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then learath would hate me for live
23:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> :KEKW:
23:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> u mean 30 fps
23:37 < bridge> <teero777> well c is much easier xd
23:38 < bridge> <teero777> also there is so much cool obscure stuff in c that can gain your performance
23:38 < bridge> <teero777> also there is so much cool obscure stuff in c that can gain you performance
23:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
23:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> have u heard of the noalias keyword
23:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
23:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i guess its a extension
23:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk the c spec but c likes to alias everything and lose info on everything at function calls
23:39 < bridge> <teero777> restrict? xd
23:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah why u like c99 so much bro
23:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when did that love evolve
23:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> i get it, the "simple" has a superficial feeling that makes u like it initially
23:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> until u go to the mines
23:40 < bridge> <teero777> back in grade school when I first saw her
23:41 < bridge> <teero777> There is a lot of inconvenient stuff too
23:41 < bridge> <teero777> but it's a tradeoff
23:41 < bridge> <teero777> I'd like generics
23:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but you can also write such code in rust and still have all other advantages
23:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> 5 minute build times for example
23:42 < bridge> <teero777> XDDD
23:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what do you think why rust is liked so much in embedded world
23:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> generics are generally slower yeah
23:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i want to present u a nice thread from a C researcher (they have C proposals) https://x.com/__phantomderp/status/1904259043025207312
23:42 < bridge> <teero777> safety? xd
23:42 < bridge> <teero777> Can't have your coffee machine segfault on you
23:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
23:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> Lmao
23:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's bcs no_std feels well abstracted from what is a std similar to cpp std
23:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> Getting Core dumped while making a latte
23:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> while still giving enough high level features to make your life easy
23:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > I'd also like to add that Fortran's model for function arguments and arrays are also not dogshit-ass. In C, passing an array -- a very fundamental data structure -- nukes it into a pointer, which loses size information immediately.
23:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Fortran has full support for not only passing that information along at either compile-time or run-time, but does not drop that information on the ground. In doing so, you can do whole-array and whole-object reasoning without a single pointer.
23:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
23:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > That means no escape analysis.
23:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Most C/C-family-language people don't understand just how fucked their base models are by treating everything by an aliases-everything, points-anywhere, always-maybe-invalid address whose information is constantly stripped off and removed by most function calls performed on it.
23:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > tl;dr Fortran doesn't have delirious pointer dementia and it means the compiler can reason succinctly and thoroughly about your program without the Latest and Greatest and Most Expensive Optimization And Analysis Underfunded Ph.D. Candidates Can Produce.
23:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Being less saucy about it: stronger models are how you beat C and C++ code. And not frontend models that are all fluff but compile down to the same stuff like with gc langs, I mean actual, tangible, "this means something and you can't just ignore it" base model improvements.
23:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> > C and C++ people have been hemming and hawing over `restrict`. It takes insane discipline to apply it codebase-wide, but once you do it and add a bunch of other annotations you start scratching optimized Fortran-kernel performance levels.
23:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> > You see this play out in Zig in real-time: arguments alias by default, and so in an experiment someone sat down and spent a long time just annotating every argument in their code with "noalias" and suddenly got back nearly double-digit performance percentages.
23:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
23:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Weak models suck.
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and high level does not always mean slow
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> A stack string is also a high level struct
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how do u always copy this so fast
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xD
23:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> used this https://twitter-thread.com/t/1904259043025207312
23:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
23:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> That's why I like c++
23:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> Everything is high level if you squish enough shit into it
23:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> Wanted to react to this gg
23:45 < bridge> <teero777> okay I'ma slap noalias on some things tmrw let's see ig
23:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDDDD
23:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> good luck, its inherently hard to do specially on C without getting UB
23:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> u rly need expert level C there
23:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> im sure even lea get it wrong
23:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the problem is, you always fuck up
23:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> u get that for free in rust
23:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no matter the language.. it's just that on c u have a hard time debugging and finding it xdx
23:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no matter the language.. it's just that on c u have a hard time debugging and finding it xd
23:46 < bridge> <teero777> noalias means to put restrict on every param right?
23:47 < bridge> <teero777> What can cause ub here if the pointers are never the same xd
23:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/restrict
23:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> During each execution of a block in which a restricted pointer P is declared (typically each execution of a function body in which P is a function parameter), if some object that is accessible through P (directly or indirectly) is modified, by any means, then all accesses to that object (both reads and writes) in that block must occur through P (directly or indirectly), otherwise the behavior is undefined:

23:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> void f(int n, int * restrict p, int * restrict q)
23:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> {
23:48 < bridge> <ryozuki>     while (n-- > 0)
23:48 < bridge> <ryozuki>         *p++ = *q++; // none of the objects modified through *p is the same
23:48 < bridge> <ryozuki>                      // as any of the objects read through *q
23:48 < bridge> <ryozuki>                      // compiler free to optimize, vectorize, page map, etc.
23:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
23:48 < bridge> <ryozuki>  
23:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> void g(void)
23:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> {
23:48 < bridge> <ryozuki>     extern int d[100];
23:48 < bridge> <ryozuki>     f(50, d + 50, d); // OK
23:48 < bridge> <ryozuki>     f(50, d + 1, d);  // Undefined behavior: d[1] is accessed through both p and q in f
23:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
23:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
23:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> Languages like c++ just go boom and flips everything
23:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
23:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> C gives you splinters if you're not careful, hurts a bit if you step on it and is really painful to get out again
23:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> I go sleep, gn!
23:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> Green button hype tomorrow
23:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Assignment from one restricted pointer to another is undefined behavior, except when assigning from a pointer to an object in some outer block to a pointer in some inner block (including using a restricted pointer argument when calling a function with a restricted pointer parameter) or when returning from a function (and otherwise when the block of the from-pointer ended):
23:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont even understand what u mean with flip xD
23:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> LEZ GO, makes the night even more enjoyable
23:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> you take program, Flip and shake it until it breaks
23:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> Yeah totally ..
23:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> > To avoid undefined behavior, the programmer must ensure that the aliasing assertions made by the restrict-qualified pointers are not violated.
23:49 < bridge> <teero777> yea I know how restrict works xd
23:50 < bridge> <teero777> this is fine tho
23:50 < bridge> <teero777> also asan detects this right?
23:50 < bridge> <teero777> also ubsan detects this right?
23:50 < bridge> <kebscs> :cammostripes:
23:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just learn it and then do the emoji
23:51 < bridge> <kebscs> no
23:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not seeing it
23:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe -Werror=strict-aliasing
23:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont think its the same so no
23:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> since we dont want aliasing at all xd
23:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway good night
