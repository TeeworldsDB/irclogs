08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @redix I'm sure there will be that one odd guy who thinks that change is the end of the world, and another odd mapper who used that as a feature
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> True =/
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Learath2 as long as nobody knows about it, you can change it. I dunno what changes and if even record/ranks are impossible because of this.
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that u don’t know if it changes something is the problem lol
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if you‘d know what map are affected by it you could maybe work around it
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but u can’t make such blind changes that possibly invalid ranks
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if you‘d know what maps are affected by it you could maybe work around it
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I literally dunno what changed and if it does even affect the gameplay
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so why are u commenting on it then
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if u have literally no idea what’s it about
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I literally dunno what changes and if it does even affect the gameplay
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Jokes aside this is so specific that I dont think anything breaks by this
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> are you talking about the stopper thing?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> with the center calculation
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or wahtever
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No the end begin tile radius
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah, what will be changed?
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> End begin tile radius that applies if and only if you were touching some other ddrace tile
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is that like is currently?
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you are touching another ddrace tile end and begin tiles are wider
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Currently
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its useless bloat imho
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah yea i remember that shit code
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What will be the solution to this?
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just remove the special case imho
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/50b16e7821c953f1ef8f132727f6f6b2acfdf279
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what greyfox fixed with that
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh we cant change this, it'll change all ranks by a couple ticks
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually our timer isnt sensitive enough probably
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, this fixed startline skipping i guess
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so that mappers dont have to care about 2 wide start tiles
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> we should probably handle start and end tiles in `HandleSkippableTiles()`
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> greyfox is still alive we could ask him
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> omg i hate windows
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ``make`` always says no target and ``cmake --build .`` is just a infinite loop running ``cmake ..`` wtf?
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats why we shouldnt have dropped bam support :/
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon have you tried understanding the error before blaming it on the tool?
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut how would you startline skip?
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> downwards speedfly xd
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have some issues with my server, its 0.7 tho. When I start it, its all correct - it searches for a master, chooses one and sends heartbeats. after about 4 minutes it says master not responding, switching master now. From then on, it spams warnings that it cant find any masters. Any ideas why? I havent touched that part of the code in the slightest
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 the only thing i could imagine causing this is your protocol extension/ teehistorian
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont know tho
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try without and with then
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and check whether there's a difference
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't see how it could affect that though
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, on vanilla master its fine i guess
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i am just running a ddnet7 server to try it
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ddnet7 doesnt throw errors yet too
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have started a F-DDrace server without automatic connecting serverside dummies, and this time there are no errors?!
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this doesnt seem to be it too xdd started another one with dummies, but this time i just didnt connect myself, aw man i am getting confused
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps it's just network issues?
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but why only on my main server?
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because network issues? ^^
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> now it works
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so weird
