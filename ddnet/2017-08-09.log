17:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> good stramer, with haxclient ond ddnet servers
17:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> lul
18:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> Ok nice nice
20:24 <+eeeee> deen: do you have a good way of measuring that "1 frame of delay"?
20:25 <+eeeee> i'm getting a couple too much frames of delay in teewebs, trying to figure out how to quantify it
21:58 <@deen> eeeee: nope, just move my mouse and it feels delayed
21:59 <@deen> ah, actually I did make measurements of delay a few weeks ago
21:59 <@deen> but I couldn't get it working for ddnet client unfortunately, needs some adjustments. there's a tool to measure editor delay

22:00 <@deen> basically record screen and simulate input, measure time from input to display
22:01 <@deen> (but the 20 ms delay of urxvt never disturbed me, so I guess I'm not that sensitive)
22:54 <@Learath2> it starts bothering me around 100ms
