00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <teenoodle> i made a **map**
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen why did we need special support for libs again?
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for what libs?
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> will the auto updater ship the steam lib?
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the steam lib stub more specifically
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it does nothing
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah ok
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen like when updating .so's why cant we update them like any file?
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because we have a different file for x86-64 than for x86
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and if the file is being executed you can't just overwrite it, you have to move it away first
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Didn't you write the new autoupdater? ðŸ˜„
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On linux you can swap executed files np
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On windows yeah you need to move first
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, I had trouble with that
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Really? Odd
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> mv wil fail, cp works
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, that autoupdater really isnt sth I'm proud off anymore
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, or was it different?
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Many bad decisions
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but we have the same problem on official servers when we update server executable
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I remove the original one first, then copy the new one over
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and since we do the same handling for DDNet and DDNet-Server executables in autoupdater, I think we should handle shared libs the same
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 about the missing rpath yesterday, forgot the line, works now, verified with otool -l
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> \\â—‹/
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I was to rewrite the updater. Idn't do the swap trick again...
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Separate executable to do the updating
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> would be cleaner the steam way, have an external updater
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was young and naive, impressed by a self swap party trick
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 want to review my 2 changes so I can release?
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just a minute and I'll be done with breakfast
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Can you merge
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2647
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or can i already?
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It's not good style to merge your own changes @Jupstar âœª
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xd
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> lmao
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen #2648 looks fine, but how will we get the update working?
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2648
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Without 2648 it can't download the new lib properly to begin with
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> @Learath2  is it normal when you use printscreen to take a screenshot that it doesnt show chat at all
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> tried holding U and pressing T to show chat but both dont show text when you paste the printscreen
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª That's a head scratcher for you ^^
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 I have fixed it with an nginx hack:
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> map $http_user_agent $libsteam_api {
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>   default "libsteam_api-linux-x86_64.so";
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>   "~*ia32" "libsteam_api-linux-x86.so";
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> }
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ...
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>   location = /libsteam_api.so {
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>     alias /var/www-update5/$libsteam_api;
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen>   }
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> #2644 works well when cross compiling but it's not correct when building natively
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2644
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Verified with: ```
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> $ curl -H "User-Agent: DDNet 14.4 (linux; ia32)" https://update5.ddnet.tw/libsteam_api.so --output a && file a

11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though we are not building natively so we can go ahead and release it and I'll fix the native packaging later
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ok, thanks
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> wanted to know how his name is different?
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/748113806772797520/Untitled.png
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No idea, possibly two unicode characters that look very similar
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @TearlessAbyss46 sound almost impossible xD
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> how does that program know what is chat in the client, bcs if it just reads the framebuffer it will show chat
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but you can also just take an ingame screenshot with F10
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Margineanu65 14.5 should also fix your problem:
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-14.5-win32.zip
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> hopefully you can finally enjoy the new client
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and also thanks for helping
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 for things like my .so nginx hack I'm always scared of Cloudflare deciding to suddenly start caching the file
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Needed quite a few fixes already, my eternal time.gif stopped working, the server statistics pages were not updating etc
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And if you want more than 5 special rules you need a paid account
13:18 <+ChillerDragon> there are free cloudflare accs? o.O
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <QuiX> @Jupstar âœª its something wrong with the entities with the update? i just logged in and all is black from the update xD it was fine yesterday
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <QuiX> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/748142974625644624/screenshot_2020-08-26_12-27-43.png
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tar .v> :pepoThink:
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can you give me your console output
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @QuiX and maybe tell me the name of your gpu
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen can the auto updater block resources in windows?
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> appeartnly the bug above only happened after using the auto update, after a clean restart everything worked fine ðŸ˜„
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen can the auto updater block resources in windows?
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> appeartnly the bug above only happened after using the auto update, after a clean client restart everything worked fine ðŸ˜„
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª which files are missing, the shaders?
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'd guess no permissions to overwrite them
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno if something is missing
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> after restarting the client it appearently worked
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, weird
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he also has a more modern GPu
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I tested update on 4 platforms, worked fine for me on all
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wait i look in the windows steam files
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they look fine
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> people still trolling?
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> that was my goto key combination to close tw .-.
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can bind it again by hand
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though it won't be as robust
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> oh, whats the bind though?
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> didnt know this can be bound
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `bind ctrl+lshift+q quit` I guess
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> or is it just quit
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ah
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> hm, + isn't a thing we can use
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @murpi what's wrong with alt+f4?
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> For me closing windows is something every window manager has a shortcut for, so not sure the client needs to implement it again
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen he means the dots in the freeze ðŸ˜„
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I think I never used alt+f4 cuz it didnt save my settings that way
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> but I could be wrong
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the dots we can fix easily by making them smaller, and I'm doing so right now
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i have no problem with changing the default entities.png
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @murpi please try it, it should save them
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª nope, he just confirmed (after I asked 10 times) that he means the text
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mr.mac_unknown_yet> help?
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the text uses the old renderer @deen
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @mr.mac_unknown_yet do you need an ambulance?
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> fixed function pipeline
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i cannot change it xD
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mr.mac_unknown_yet> no thxs look at #general
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ahh
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen he might mean from the speedup arrows?
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well its now a tileset instead of streamed text
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> which makes it alot faster
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he'll get used to it, he can also resize with that command you had the bug in xD
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª but shouldn't the image be a bit higher resolution?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it actually looks upscaled a bit
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Ah, alt f4 does save settings. Guess I need to get used to alt+f4 now
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i can use 2048 pixels if you want
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dunno if all driver support that huge textures
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and currently it's 1024?
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh well, if it's the same as the normal way tiles are rendered, that's fine
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen yeah its like a normal tileset at 1024 pixels rn
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When did we even change that and why?
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 when i first added opengl 3.3 i wanted faster speedup arrows and text for entities
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> these are "buffered" and are able to use the buffered vertices
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so even a map like Mystic river will perform very good
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> while on old renderer it will die xD
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see, makes sense
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen btw most ppl probs use custom entities anyway
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the guy in the text issue has custom ones atleast ðŸ˜„
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Soreu its your entities.png, what is your opinion, now that your tileset is rendered correctly? XD
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Jupstar âœª uh huh?
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> how much should I scroll up? xd
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu the small corners in freeze are now bigger because Jupstar fixed the rendering
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/748175842227781692/unknown5.png
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu do you want to make them smaller so it looks similar to before
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen 
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe like this?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/748176575492653096/unknown.png
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that looks nicer, what did you change?
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is that only opengl3 stuff youre discussing about? i dont play with it because it crashes for me from time to time
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> also i found out that ddnet client was the program that caused my pc to start every night at 2am
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no this is the default now
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i fixed rendering for opengl 2.0+
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> for tilesets and such?
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen just generate the text more properly to the space it has
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> How can DDNet Client cause your PC to start? ðŸ˜„
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª sounds good
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen i'll pr when my current pr is merged, bcs forgot to create new branch for it, and also maybe conflicts
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> idk but i never closed my client and it always went on in the night (from energy saving mode) but the last 2 night i closed my client and the pc was off at the morning
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> my client would always be crashed in the morning anyway
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Im 'corneum the new client has a strong fallback, you should be able to set it to OpenGL 4.6 and it should still not crash and open the right version
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it says opengl 3.3 tho
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> oh hold up i didnt have the update button
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @BannZay i think you were the one that added text entity size?
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno if my pr breaks your stuff a bit, but i want to good default rn
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen Yea, I could adjust them.
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> 
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Jupstar âœª They now render everything correctly, for both default & OpenGL 3.3? Like no shitty cuts-tricks needed to display i.e. entities-off sign as properly as possible?
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Btw, since you're fixing entities text size/space related stuff, maybe somehow also fix the bug that changing entities text size makes those tiles plan black until client restart? ^^' Or did I miss that it's fixed already aswell)
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes no more graphic tools required xd
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i havent implemented the text size thing and also dunno what breaks it rn
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/748184282148765796/32.png
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ravie time for tests and to cool champagne bottle
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the dilate tool might still be usefull, bcs gimp and other programs still interpolate between transparent and opaque
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Jupstar âœª Right now I have so weird bug, that I can't open some of TW graphics (shipped with client) in Photoshop until I dilate them. One of the examples was entities_clear, so I guess specific compressing during uploading to repo also messes them a bit
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Would be strange PNG is lossless
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Anyway off for now. I guess you're better in such detail things than me anyway xd
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and yet...
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Oh, btw, that change in displaying is only affecting entities, or regular tilesets in maps too?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Everything except the editor
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Only ingame rn
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pls fix freeze, before it was nearly unnoticable and i loved it xD
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> looks like I made a good call to design all my newer maps with 3.3 in mind :brownbear:
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª oh ur pr also fixed the weirdness i saw on multimap
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/748186932735115264/unknown.png
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it looked rly weird before
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> specially moving
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Yes xd
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats nice :D
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> is this the new update or nightly?
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> new update
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 14.5
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Well even now sampling will always be 100% actuate.  Floating point precision and screen resolution is still a limit for the math in the gpu
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Will not
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> *
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> There are still interpolation for sub pixels etc
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> everything looks a bit blurrier than 3.3 used to tho
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Yes
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> > looks like I made a good call to design all my newer maps with 3.3 in mind :brownbear:
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ravie as always >.> you little fairy
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> That's because MIP mapping is now in the hand if the driver again.. Before it was me calculating it based on opengl spec
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is that a good thing?
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always see u complaining about drivers :D
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Well nvidia cheated with it in the past to get better performance.. But it might be better for performance and sampling
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> is there still gonna be an option to get the older effect?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/748188988421963836/unknown.png
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> U mean the old 3.3?
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah, it's sharper
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> You can replace texture in the shader with textureLod and as second parameter 0 then it will always load MIP map zero the highest resolution
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> As third parameter*
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Just Google glsl textureLod xd replace in tile.frag
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think that should be an option, but I have to agree, the old one looks a bit nicer
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Would be nice if we can get it a bit sharper without huge performance loss
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I'm still really thankful that my maps won't appear buggy to people without 3.3 enabled, especially the new players
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Well that's the nice thing about shader.. You can do it as  you want
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @deen 0.7 looks nice and sharp, it does run slightly worse than ddnet though but that might be due to any other optimizations in ddnet
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> So it's still different solution than the one used in 0.7?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Yes because they have MIP mapping disabled
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Bcs 3D textures don't support it
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Not for tw at least
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Texture Atlas
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> We have it too as a fallback for older GPUs that don't have texture arrays xd
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But shouldn't it be the default if it looks sharper?
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Normally MIP mapping is nice because its interpolated correctly.. E.g. zooming out looks insanely nice with texture arrays while it looks really bad with just linear interpolation of the original image
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Also for smaller resolution etc
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª zooming out seems laggier now
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No way to have your cake and eat it too?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it was rly smooth before
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> E.g. when creating 2k tilesets
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> before i could zoom out a lot and had decent fps xd
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> when i change cl text entities size with opengl3 it still makes the affected blocks black for me
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki enable 3.3
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it was disabled
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for some rason
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> The older has no border tile buffering
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I renamed the config
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum yes, requires a restart atm
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok it works nicely now

17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> @Jupstar âœª what about adding an option to use `GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR` for mipmap filtering?
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @redix yeah good idea. U could actually also just make it default.. Added most sampler settings from the very old code
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> True. These defaults are for hardware from another decade :D
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I believe I am not the first who complains, but I will not use 14.5 because my freeze is so scuffed, plus not possible to downgrade steam version. so sad
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> no idea why this happened, but please consider about players who use custom entities_clear
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Dunno. I think u the first one xd
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @BannZay @Soreu is working on a fix I think, I will release 14.5.1 when it's available
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> would be better use textbox to change major opengl version instead of opengl 3.3 toggle button
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I dunno.  The big difference is still 3.3
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Since that's the new api
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> freeze is scuffed?
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What does it even mean for a tile to be "scuffed"?
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 i guess it's not so easy to write the http messages to f1 since they run in a thread, right?
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, I forgot about that
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> This is how game looks like if you use OpenGL 3.3 with disabled "Multiple texture units" on windows. Is this expected an expected behaviour? (v14.5)
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/748213493664055386/unknown.png

18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh boy, this last GL change didn't go so great with some configurations
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @BannZay can you show the console output from `cl_show_console 1`?
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @Learath2 this one?
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/748214314472833074/console.txt
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @BannZay yep
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is absolutely no way to get cmake to link to the sdl provided by pkg-config on osx
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tried changing every single setting there, it just won't link to that one. It always finds the bundled one and links to that instead
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Every time I test a PR, I need to go in and delete the bundled framework so it'll link to my copy of sdl
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> isnt there some way to test builds without releasing it for everyone on steam first
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Problem isn't that we don't test, it worked on any system we had access to
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could maybe do beta tests on steam and ask more people to try it on there as it's easier
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> steam allows beta clients
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I also wrote an announcement to beta test in this discord
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> @Jupstar âœª ye I always used f10 for screenshots but was lazy to go to folder so I wanted to use printscreen but then I saw chat didnt want to show up for some weird reason xD
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bash Crandicoot> Hello
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bash Crandicoot> I need some help with a problem
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bash Crandicoot> Today steam ran an update on dd
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bash Crandicoot> And after that I couldnt see any map
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bash Crandicoot> Just the background
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bash Crandicoot> I already tried re installing and verifying integrity of the files
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @QuiX What fixed your issue with black... everything? just reinstall of client from Steam, or anything else had to be done?
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª @Bash Crandicoot is another one with gl problems ^
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> deen can you add the total map count to ddnet.tw/mappers? im bad at maths
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe that's a sign of having too many maps when you can't count your own maps ðŸ˜„
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> wow even deen hates corneum maps:feelsbadman: :feelsbadman: :feelsbadman:
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> done
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> king
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 52 maps LOL
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> silex is #1 with 66 maps
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <legser4> new bug
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <legser4> If you start the game and close it REALLY fast
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <legser4> The game closes
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <legser4> But the process is still running
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <legser4> And you can hear the music
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> @deen maybe you should distribute nightly automated builds under betas, so everyone can easily test latest git source. if anything goes wrong, they can just switch branch and report it
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but the problem is no one actually tests my nightlies
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you mean in steam?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> yes
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's a good idea
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i have to see if it can be automated
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> at least most mods, admins can use that branch
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 you seem to have broken rpath handling somehow
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well $ORIGIN is there, but the build dir is there too, I guess that should be somehow removed when "installing" the server
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <legser4> wait
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <legser4> no
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <legser4> It happens if you launch the game in different res with fullscren
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <legser4> Then everything just bugs out
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <legser4> Then everything bugs
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <legser4> My second monitor freaks out
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <legser4> and closing the game fast wont actually end the process
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @Learath2 something is wrong with ranks rn
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://ddnet.tw/ranks/
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> last finishes
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sadge
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, I'm trying to update the database but it's not going well
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> does this explain the missing finishes on player profiles?
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> e.g https://ddnet.tw/players/chiliking/
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> just finished Leftovers 1
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> but the player profile is not being updated
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, I guess
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What I tried to do was to `update record_race set Server = "GER1" where Server = "GER"`, and it just hung for hours, meh
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, I guess there was no index on Server
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Would be a stupid index anyway, we hardly ever select by server I guess
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bash Crandicoot> For anyone who cares steam gave another update and now it works
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bash Crandicoot> Thank you c:
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> great to hear, thanks for reporting!
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> is whitespace unicode name issue fixed? some1 in game has that rn
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> servers need to restart, might take a day or 2
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they only restart when empty
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @deen  so it takes a week on the rus multimal server:kek:
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @deen  so it takes a week on the rus multimap server:kek:

21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jim-panse> 14.5.1 tried to join any ddnet servers, same pic. No OS Changes or Graphics changes done. Mapres folder contains 50 elements, so i guess that folder's fine too
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jim-panse> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/748267089399250964/unknown.png

21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jim-panse> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/748267089399250964/unknown.png
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jim-panse try fresh download from ddnet.tw
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ouf these permission issues are really biting us, how did this even happen
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do people lose permissions to folders they themselves create
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don't know...
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <maggi323> lost permissions once when i put a new ssd in the pc with windows on it, and just connected the old hdd with also windows on it. had no permissions on the hdd files from ssd
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <maggi323> Wasn't smart
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> @Jim-panse real jim panse from youtube? :kek:
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen dunno, the only reports i see are custom entities are broken, and the background load
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> give me screanshots of any other problem
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, is it all from custom entities?
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I keep getting fooled by the sampling bias... Maybe we didn't have to roll this back after all
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean they always say "my entites are broken"
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not "my game is broken"
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have an idea. Maybe we should resize on the fly but warn the user on launch that his entities are mis-sized and they will break in the future
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (or any other asset that is mis-sized for that matter, not just entities)
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the only problems wiht that are:
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - entities are loaded first when used
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - how is the warning displayed
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm thinking a messagebox when first loaded
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The graphics thread already has a safe way to send messages to the client, so that shouldn't be too much of a trouble
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or I guess we could just break, there are not enough people having weird custom entities that are broken
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah probably
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As I said, sampling bias got me there, I saw broken screenshots, I couldn't identify the cause and just sort of panic'd
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean the resize i implemented isnt complete trash, still better than linear interpolation
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its just not comparable to gimp or photoshop
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe just a dbg_msg on loading a bad asset so it's easier to debug in the future?
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah that ofc
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What did you go with, bicubic interpolation?
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> my custom entities are ok
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> my custom entities were ok
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its only if they are not deviadable by 16, bcs a tileset is 16x16
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> huh
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh well it wasnt 1024x1024 it was like 1600x1600 or something
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'll just see if its devidable by 16 and if its not, i can use the next power of two probably, easiest and safest on all GPUs
