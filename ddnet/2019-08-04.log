00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> How does the ddnet debian stable package gets updated?
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> manually?
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you mean "get updated"?
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the package itself or how you update it to the newest version that debian provides?
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess update to the newest version is "apt upgrade" but as far as i can see it is kinda outdated
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> also shown in the readme.me of the repo
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so how does the latest debian version gets updated
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> apt dist-upgrade
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> 😂
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon the answer is probably "it won't" but I'm not sure about the details tbh
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> meh testing was fun but since stable is brand new ima stay there for now i guess @FluffiexD
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I suggest using an OS that doesn't lag a decade behind for your desktop os
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 2 years, but I agree
