00:00 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> But yeah, zed is the way - the first editor that handled DDNet-rs without issues :kek:
00:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> chillerdragon: wow actually based and not insane
00:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> arrow keys are the right way
00:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> first time building it froze my laptop
00:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> ran out of ram
00:02 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Yeah that's rust for you
00:02 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> At least the binaries are smol :justatest:
00:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> are you sure about that
00:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> hello world is 10x larger than c
00:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> i think im wrong, it was 40x
00:04 < bridge> <kollpotato> depends on c compiler optimizations and other smart stuff
00:04 < bridge> <Assa> > You get a compiler warning and a failing CI already. Thats why switch is so op. But could also add an assert. Do you think it is needed?
00:04 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon why do you get a compiler warning? At least the two maintainers agree with me here 😄
00:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> wgpu apps are at least 15 mb
00:05 < bridge> <Assa> if the compiler warning is about unreachable code, try to use switch default here
00:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you switch on an enum and don’t cover all the compiler throws a warning.
00:05 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Rust optimizes for speed and adds a ton of symbols and whatnot
00:05 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
00:05 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Use strip and build in release
00:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The CI runs with warnings as errors
00:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes and i like it
00:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So in ddnet this change would be caught in the pr that adds a new enum value
00:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The assert would be redundant
00:06 < bridge> <Assa> ping robyt or lerath then
00:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes but what do you say?
00:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s your comment
00:06 < bridge> <Assa> I'd add an assert, so you get an error while testing locally already
00:06 < bridge> <Assa> not everyone build with -Wall and fail-on-warning
00:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am okay with CI driven development but sure I can add an assert if you still need it knowing the CI already catches it
00:13 < bridge> <Assa> I am not so okay with ci driven development, it's really slow and also expensive in terms of resources used
00:13 < bridge> <Assa> I try to do as much locally as I can, but clang-tidy is still my enemy
00:15 < bridge> <Assa> also I am not a maintainer, I am just trying to help. If they disagree with me they'll tell us 😄
00:17 < bridge> <Ewan> GitHub neutered all free actions runners lately
00:17 < bridge> <kollpotato> does ddnet not pay for github actions at all?
00:17 < bridge> <Assa> nope
00:17 < bridge> <Assa> also from what money?
00:17 < chillerbot1> You can see donors and how to donate here https://ddnet.org/funding/
00:18 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
00:18 < bridge> <Assa> good bot 😄
00:18 < bridge> <DDNet> :3
00:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> i think there was a limit on the free plan
00:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> OUR money
00:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> we can take some money from all the ddnet mod salaries
00:19 < bridge> <Ewan> that all goes to actual servers
00:19 < bridge> <Assa> you can't take from zero
00:19 < bridge> <Ewan> any free infrastructure is a must for a donation-driven project like ddnet
00:20 < bridge> <Ewan> servers come and go all the time due to unstable and sometimes inadequate funding
00:20 < bridge> <totar> I think its more like regional sanctions
00:21 < bridge> <totar> deen is literally unable to pay for the servers
00:21 < bridge> <Assa> it's both, it's a free to play game guys
00:21 < bridge> <Assa> and this only works because people including deen but also a lot of others are spending money and free time on it
00:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Still the free runners do not have enough ram to build ddnet++ .\_. So annoying
00:21 < bridge> <reitw> @blaiszephyr sux
00:21 < bridge> <totar> If we wanted more donations we can just put the donation progress bar on the main menu until its filled
00:22 < bridge> <Assa> wikipedia style
00:22 < bridge> <totar> I dont think we need a beg banner
00:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> i dont think it will help
00:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> its on the home page already
00:24 < bridge> <totar> Im pretty sure it would help
00:25 < bridge> <totar> I think most people aren't aware theres a donation goal in the first place
00:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> are there random server messages that say something about funding?
00:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> We need to bring the fun into funding
00:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Skins!
00:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> add accounts
00:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> so it will work properly
00:27 < bridge> <Assa> Personally I'd also handle things a bit different
00:27 < bridge> <Assa> like give donators a role in the discord and a donator emoji
00:28 < bridge> <chairn> oh it is, but when you got billions of them, then it's billions times free which accounts to 100 watts
00:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Every donated euro should be 1 point!
00:28 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
00:28 < bridge> <Ewan> pay to win ddnet
00:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> 1 ddcoin
00:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why finish Kobra when you can donate for points instead
00:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes pay2win
00:28 < bridge> <Assa> no
00:29 < bridge> <Assa> skin2win > pay2win
00:29 < bridge> <Ewan> alternate map parts that are blocked by a donation wall
00:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lmao
00:29 < bridge> <Assa> I'd open a skin shop before even considering pay2win
00:29 < bridge> <Ewan> must donate at least $50 for this skip
00:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> charge 20€ to get unbanned
00:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @kollpotato: Genius
00:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Especially with the random ip range vpn bans
00:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> many small russian minecraft servers run from those donations
00:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> so it works
00:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Unban donations?
00:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s a thing? Xd
00:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes, but they charge much less
00:30 < bridge> <chairn> nah, they use noise and production process variation to create a stream of random bits which is then decimated
00:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nice
00:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Can I buy a deen?
00:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> where a deen
00:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> xd
01:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you could have a donation progress bar as a channel
06:26 < bridge> <niceebro.> I can't run what I want to run by typing !multeasymap in my Discord bot. It will list the players but I don't know if the site is the wrong API.
06:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://blog.nginx.org/blog/native-support-for-acme-protocol
07:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> im moving my main linux partition from a 500gb nvme to a 2tb nvme
07:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> and in doing so ill migrate from ext4 to xfs
07:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> wish me luck
07:42 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
07:42 < bridge> <Ewan> did u get one of those gen 5 ssds? and ur on the latest ryzen right? it's gonna be so fast
07:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i'm partial to btrfs because it's really rounded itself out over the past few years. it has pretty much every feature, usually with the better implementation, it's COW, somewhat fast
07:43 < bridge> <Ewan> and best of all, the WinBTRFS driver is very very good, has a more extensive config menu than even NTFS itself gives on Windows and is officially signed & easy to install
07:44 < bridge> <Ewan> whereas accessing ext4 on Windows without the use of WSL2 is very difficult. ext2fsd is really terrible
07:44 < bridge> <Ewan> it's very nice for dualbooters
08:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ask the master server
08:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> <https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json>
08:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think u can ask the server directly aswell but idk how
08:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not using btrfs, im using xfs, which is the new recommended modern fs and really well tested
08:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> gentoo recommends it on the install book now before ext4
08:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> it has cow too and reflinks
08:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/XFS
08:17 < bridge> <Ewan> i can read, im partial to btrfs for the reasons listed
08:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think the new nvme is faster yeah, from 3500 of the old to 5000 or 7000 i forgot
08:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> the old one i bought when nvme where new in market
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> ah not gen 5

08:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> + new boot partitions
09:03 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Sounds great, lmk how it works!
09:03 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
09:03 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> I want to get a bigger drive for my stuff as well, I also need a better PSU
09:03 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
09:03 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Any recommendations? My GPU sucks my current one dry
09:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> im gooing full new
09:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> im using limine instead of grub
09:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> fck grub from now on!
09:09 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :KEKW:
09:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Limine
09:09 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> New month new ryo
09:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also plan to add limine for my kernel
09:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> they have a modern boot protocol
09:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> grub uses ancient multiboot
09:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> (limine supports multiboot too)
09:10 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> You really making me look into Gentoo again
09:10 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
09:10 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> I just don't quite understand the gain in it in relation to arch based or Debian based distros
09:10 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> I gave up on the installation after I think 2 hours xd
09:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> full customization
09:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> fir example limine supports bios, eufi64, uefi32, uefirv64
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> on arch if u install limine
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> u get all enabled
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can configure it just for uefi64
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is my needs
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> and this with all packages
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> also gentoo has imho more packages than arch
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> gentoo repos are a better system
09:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> arch aur is gentoo guru, but not only that, u can add more repos or making ur repos
09:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have my own gentoo repo
09:12 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :poggers2:
09:12 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Can you link it, I wanna see how Gentoo handles that
09:13 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> I like nix because I can just grep for a package in the nixpkgs repo, if it doesn't exist it's not packaged
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Ebuild_repository
09:15 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :EssexWow:
09:15 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ryo we share similar specs iirc?
09:15 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Can you share you PSU? I don't know why I saved money on that
09:15 < chillerbot1> You can see donors and how to donate here https://ddnet.org/funding/
09:15 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Chilleeeer :angy:

10:21 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Already did
10:21 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Hot!
10:21 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Now leak your psu
10:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon do it i dare you (lmao which one am i replying too, youll never know)
10:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> how can i know
10:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its not smth i can know from linux
10:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> its been years so the cpu isnt new
10:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i think its gold standard
10:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> for psu, i think gold is better over more W
10:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz failure in psu can be bad

10:54 < bridge> <pioooooo> umm what does tthat mean
10:54 < bridge> <Assa> you can place doors and lasers with the game and front layer

10:55 < bridge> <pioooooo> so what does that do with switch 0
10:56 < bridge> <pioooooo> i mean switch 0 is a dummy that has no use isn't it?
10:56 < bridge> <Assa> oh I wouldn't trust in that, but honestly I don't know

11:30 < bridge> <pioooooo> the penalty tile counts in the switch id
11:39 < bridge> <Assa> I hate so much that it's `CQuad *m_pQuads` and not `CQuad* m_pQuads`, one is the name the other is a type, get your shit together C++
11:43 < bridge> <kebscs> It's clang tidy style
11:43 < bridge> <kebscs> Not c++
11:43 < bridge> <kebscs> You can set either
11:55 < bridge> <Assa> here a puzzle for you:
11:55 < bridge> <Assa> `int *a, *b, c;`
11:55 < bridge> <Assa> 
11:55 < bridge> <Assa> What type do b and c have?
11:56 < bridge> <kebscs> Pointer and no pointer
11:56 < bridge> <kebscs> I have a rule, that if I don't immediately understand something it's probably bad code
11:57 < bridge> <Assa> that is bad code, yes 😄
11:58 < bridge> <Assa> `int x = x++ + ++x -1;` I had to do cursed stuff like this at uni. And always thought, why don't you just write good code instead?
12:01 < bridge> <kebscs> What was even the point of this code
12:02 < bridge> <Assa> this was just an example for understanding pre and post increase operator
12:02 < bridge> <Assa> like the guy who buys 217 water melons
12:33 < bridge> <learath2> Who even made you write this in uni? This is clearly UB
12:34 < bridge> <learath2> Left one is the sane one, as you pointed out in your follow up with the declaration puzzle
12:35 < bridge> <Assa> I know, but for me the declaration puzzle is also wrong 😄 but even big programming languages struggle from backwards compat.
12:36 < bridge> <learath2> Declaration follows use, it's just how declarations are in C++. It's not kept as a weird quirk, it's just how it's designed
12:37 < bridge> <Assa> like `<type> <name1>, <name2>, <name3>` and no pointers, because that would be illegal syntax would be cleaner imo
12:37 < bridge> <learath2> You might find the way go does it more palatable I guess
12:37 < bridge> <Assa> yes, coming from other programming languages
12:51 < bridge> <pilonpl> `*` is a part of the type so why would it be grouped with the name?
12:59 < bridge> <learath2> C and C++ declarations explicitly are defined to follow how you'd use the identifier (6.7.6p2 in C++20), the * is technically part of the declarator
12:59 < bridge> <learath2> C and C++ declarations explicitly are defined to follow how you'd use the identifier (6.7.6p2 in C20), the * is technically part of the declarator
13:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @ryozuki oof you also stepped down as a contributor? ._.
13:05 < bridge> <learath2> Where the confusion comes from is contexts where you need a `type-name`, the * will appear as part of the type, but in a declaration expression there is no `type-name`
13:08 < bridge> <learath2> (e.g. a `sizeof` expression, that's where you'll find a `type-name`)
13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> not fully as contrib but im not interested right now

15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1405537533940731945/mutex.rs?ex=689f3055&is=689dded5&hm=f3a24dd3ca8e01a7135cbdfafdeacfb1499fc9fce82db9d3bc9a32d2a6fe6896&
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wish i could share big snippet and it should be scrollable
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> skill issue discord
15:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> the most interesting part is implementing the future manually in AsyncMutexLockFuture
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> basically an async mutex must keep a queue of wakers:
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> - wakers are used to tell the executor, hey this future is ready, poll me please" and it basically adds the related future it to the ready queue of the executor.
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> atomic to actually do the lock yada yada and drop is the important bit too:
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> impl<'a, T: ?Sized> Drop for AsyncMutexGuard<'a, T> {
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki>     fn drop(&mut self) {
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki>         let next_waker = self.queue.pop();
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki>         self.lock.store(false, Ordering::Release);
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki>         if let Some(next) = next_waker {
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki>             next.wake();
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki>         }
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki>     }
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> which wakes the next waker in the queue, important bit is to get the next waker before unlocking or u have a race
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> well not a real race but u would not get the real next waker
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot if this is would be a race condition or data race
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess race condition which i think is not a memory safety issue
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> thanks for coming to my ted talk
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder how a channel would look
15:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @kollpotato: i missed part of it because i went for dinner xd but i know ryo stepped down as maintainer i just expected him to finish his pr still .\_.
15:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @aoetw: I think it is pretty cool that you are active on GitHub btw. Much appreciated!
15:39 < bridge> <chairn> but you can get tricked if you declare multiple variable like this with comma because the * applies only to the first variable
15:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> chillerdragon: yeah but looks like edos is more important now
15:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> why is there `#[inline(always)]` everywhere
15:59 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> performance
16:00 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> it basically forces the compiler to inline the fn
16:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> i dont think its clearly defined
16:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> i have read somewhere that the compiler can just ignore it
16:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> and do what it wants
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> it can ignore #inline
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> but inline always is almost always inlined
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> the edge cases are for example if u take the ptr of the function and call it
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess
16:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> alright im gonna go spam inline always everywhere
16:01 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> cant wait for your 5gb binary
16:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> instructions are small af
16:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> unless my function is bazillion lines of code
16:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> generics can increase binary size too
16:03 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> wait i'll ask AI
16:04 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ```
16:04 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Ryozuki was correct that #[inline(always)] is much more forceful than #[inline], though even always can be ignored in extreme cases.
16:04 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> So while Koll Potato isn't wrong about instruction size, their plan to "spam inline always everywhere" would likely hurt performance more than help it. The 5GB binary joke from melonFC isn't that far-fetched for a large codebase.
16:04 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ```
16:04 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
16:04 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 💥
16:04 < bridge> <kollpotato> wow it expects than my codebase is huge
16:04 < bridge> <kollpotato> wow it expects that my codebase is huge
16:05 < bridge> <cauldron1> Change the asset mapres or whatever it’s called to a transparent image? Like how it’s done in this video with skins: https://youtu.be/e4l1lZ5uw6M
16:05 < bridge> <jimpanse16> 14.5.1 tried to join any ddnet servers, same pic. No OS Changes or Graphics changes done. Mapres folder contains 50 elements, so i guess that folder's fine too. You guys got any idea what changed?
16:05 < bridge> <jimpanse16> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/748267089399250964/unknown.png?ex=689ee5c8&is=689d9448&hm=2a64ab33d0f80e4e8bc32a98a9ab173df440f676f613612a97e25ae950dafe1e&
16:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> im not ddnet or rust compiler
16:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> i have to learn how to not quit a project after 500 lines of code
16:06 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> just never exceed 500 loc
16:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh right i can use semicolons and have multiple statements per line
16:09 < bridge> <dazzling_fox_61443> I don’t understand which block I should place in the editor for the spawn in tournament, and how to change the 1v1 arena position (X, Y) in DDNetPP?
16:09 < bridge> <dazzling_fox_61443> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1380166894471872522/ZUV0koZ.png?ex=689f2d15&is=689ddb95&hm=2c2129d16ef9585e199b2778627dd78545ae7d92c2a56cca8c7c33e9d8f07797&
16:14 < bridge> <Assa> here is a tipp: only do one project at a time and finish it before starting anything new, it helped me a lot
16:15 < bridge> <Assa> yes, I have like 5 open PRs simultaniously, yes I don't follow my own advice and I am a hypocrite, doesn't mean what I say is not valid 😠
16:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah that might actually work
16:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> i can start up to 5 projects per day
16:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> and in the end have no progress at all
16:22 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Only useful on certain situations, as where basic atomic calculations do not benefit from it in a real environment.
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> my kernel has 5800 lines
16:23 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And yeah, #[inline] only hints to the compiler, that it should be inlined, but the compiler could decide not to inline it to X amount of reasons
16:24 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Atomic calculations and even memory allocations do not need inlining. It might give an overhead instead
16:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> So, easier to debug and benchmark ye?
16:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I recommend using Criterion, as in that measures the overall performance of your functions by continuously iterating it for, 5 seconds as default.
16:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> This way, you essentially stress test the function, where #[inline] or #[inline(always)] would make a difference, if there is any.
17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Atomic calculations and even memory allocations do not need inlining.
17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> those concepts are not related
17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> inlining allows other optimizations to take place
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> atomic are synchornization primitives, used in threading
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> memory allocations are that just memory allocations
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> in lining what would matter is how the values are "moved" between functions, aka the ptr u hold from a allocation, or the argument u pass (either in register or stack), when inlining, u simply dont pass arguments, because the function to be called body is inserted where the function is called directly
17:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> and calls inherently have a small overhead
17:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> plus if ur function is small but takes a giant sized parameter, inlining saves a lot
17:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust abuses inlining heavily
17:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> iterators are only perfomant thanks to inlining
17:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is why rust is so slow in debug mode
17:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> because the iterator api has a lot of calls inside
17:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> and in debug no inlining is done
17:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> after inlining the compiler can also do const folding and easier bounds checks
17:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> (both help optimizing the iterators fort example)
18:05 < bridge> <teero777> fun fact You can compress make most c/c++ codebases to only a few lines
18:40 < bridge> <Aoe> I figured the devs would be annoyed, by me spamming issues all the time lmao xD
18:41 < bridge> <Aoe> I wish I was able to help out, and not just report…
18:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Learn C++ and send PRs :greenthing:
18:53 < bridge> <bomab> Forget C++ and hope that other developers will fix your issues

19:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @aoetw: you can do surprisingly much without being a fluent C++ developer. Even testing the proposed code changes by running client and server is quite valuable. I would be happy to show you some stuff if you are curious.
19:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But yes even spamming issues is good. I mean we want to reduce the amount of open issues of course. But every valid bug report is very valuable.
19:18 < bridge> <Assa> you can open as much issues as you want, as long as this are mistakes/bugs you want to have fixed and this isn't a duplicate of an existing issue
19:18 < bridge> <Aoe> Yes that would be really cool, I always download the latest nighty anyways!.
19:18 < bridge> <Aoe> Btw, when are you downloading Discord, so we can privately message each other?
19:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @aoetw: you can browse the other open issues. And can try to reproduce existing bug reports in the latest version. Comment your opinion on feature requests. And also download the client and server from pull requests and run them. See if you like the new changes and if they are bug free
19:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> :p
19:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> devs appreciate bug reports, specially if its not just "it doesnt work"
19:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
19:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u tell how to reproduce the issue its even better
19:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> easy to test and iterate on the issue to fix it
19:19 < bridge> <Assa> there wer bugreports where I thought as a dev "this person is full of shit" but they made a guide to reproduce and they were right
19:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @aoetw: nightly is the already merged stuff. You can test ahead of nightly as githubber. You can shape nightly!
19:20 < bridge> <Assa> sometimes it's really hard to reproduce, like the editor history issues ...
19:20 < bridge> <Aoe> I see, I am very new to Github!
19:20 < bridge> <Aoe> Need a proper guide xD
19:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No need for DMs we can spam this channel @aoetw
19:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There is a green check mark in the pr where you can download the build
19:20 < bridge> <Aoe> Took me forever to figure out how to even download the nightly build.
19:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Development
19:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sadly on phone right now can’t give you good guide
19:21 < bridge> <Assa> you can do this directly from the homepage or activate BETA in steam, both is fairly simple
19:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> !reminder show aoe how to download pr binaries
19:21 < chillerbot1> Helo chillerdragon I will remind you in 86400000 time units about your matter again.
19:21 < bridge> <Assa> if I was on ubuntu, I'd have a nightly crontab :3
19:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah just go on steam right lcick ddnet and betas
19:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> then put nightly
19:21 < bridge> <Aoe> Ye I've used Steam in the past, but I've reasontly switched to Tclient because of the Fast input
19:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> what is fast input
19:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe we should merge it
19:22 < bridge> <Assa> remind @chillerdragon to improve remind function
19:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @ryozuki: lives under a rock
19:22 < bridge> <Aoe> [Fast input](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9845)
19:22 < bridge> <Aoe> 
19:22 < bridge> <Aoe> With “fast inputs” enabled, the client predicts your movement instantly one tick ahead of time, even before the server confirms it.
19:22 < bridge> <Aoe> Fast inputs essentially removes the 20 millisecond delay and prevents you from over-shooting your movements. It makes the game feel more responsive and you'll be able to control your tee a lot better.
19:23 < bridge> <Aoe> Is how I understood it at least, I could be wrong!
19:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Look at this aoe guy explaining ryo the game
19:24 < bridge> <Assa> why is this not accepted yet?
19:24 < bridge> <Aoe> I don't know.. 🙁
19:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s ddnet
19:24 < bridge> <Aoe> I prefer not to use any third party client. But this is too OP to not use xD
19:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> One does not simply accept
19:24 < bridge> <Assa> now I actually want the maintainer row, just to label one issue 😄
19:25 < bridge> <Assa> now I actually want the maintainer role, just to label one issue 😄
19:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You have my vote
19:25 < bridge> <Assa> "row" too many matrices today
19:25 < bridge> <Assa> are this a lot of quads? `Counted 33254249 quads`
19:25 < bridge> <Assa> twmap crashes at approximately 4times this value :/
19:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Rust L
19:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @patiga: when rebrand to twcrash
19:26 < bridge> <Assa> btw I can make maps with this many quads running all with 5K fps, but the editor just refuses to ... editor
19:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> does it run out of memory?
19:35 < bridge> <Assa> no it says I put invalid values into one group at one quad somewhere randomly
19:35 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1405605768442417223/screenshot_2025-08-14_19-34-58.png?ex=689f6fe2&is=689e1e62&hm=f3edce20173d32dffa940dda09679f08c95b6cf21f9f7a3d377a4887b6559072&
19:39 < bridge> <Assa> this is finished, but uses 4x4 quads and I could get it to full scale if twmap wouldn't crash 🙁
19:39 < bridge> <Assa> also this map needs envelopes fixed otherwise it's impossible to sync anything
19:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> this already looks good
19:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> but why do u use quads instead of images?
19:51 < bridge> <Assa> because I can! 😠
19:51 < bridge> <Assa> honestly would you like a map with 30 * 60 * 3,40 images?
19:52 < bridge> <kollpotato> understandable
19:52 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes
19:52 < bridge> <Assa> I am actually not sure if it would go over or under the 200 MB the map currently has xD
20:01 < bridge> <Assa> that's very discussable
20:01 < bridge> <Assa> that's very discussable :justatest:
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> CHILLERDRAGON?
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> YOU ARE MEMBER? 😄
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice, didnt have that on my bingo card for 2025
20:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> good luck, u have to beat the boss, heinrich
20:13 < bridge> <Aoe> Worth a shot at least 🙂
20:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then Ryo has to make a 75% vote before closing random PRs 😬
20:15 < bridge> <Aoe> Noo, only be the few topics that requires discussion.
20:15 < bridge> <Aoe> Unless all Ryozukis PRs are debateable? xD
20:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's a dev internal joke
20:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Bcs boss ryo closed stale PRs and boss heinrich bossed ryo away
20:16 < bridge> <Aoe> I see..
20:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> xd yeah it was sa fun day...
20:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> until Ryo dipped, i cried after that
20:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> until Ryo dipped from the org, i cried after that
20:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> xd yeah it was a fun day...
20:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> @Jupss
20:17 < bridge> <Assa> he didn't dip, just lost interest for now 🙁
20:17 < bridge> <Assa> I still have hope
20:17 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> @jupeyy_keks how much ddcoins for you to pick up the QUIC impl? :owo:
20:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I will not code sry
20:18 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :pepe_cry:
20:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was also the dev who made the most community votes about features, for example the feature heinrich has a pr open to revert wich was accepted by community
20:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I had motivation the last whole year, but Learath & heinrich are clearly not interested in this acc impl
20:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is what aoe wants to do, votes
20:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Just do some shit /login and be happy
20:19 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i have 9 different ways of handling accounts
20:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> its sad cuz when ur motivated u make crazy stuff like ddnet-rs
20:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> im motivated too, just with my own kernel
20:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
20:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> got a ATA driver done with async support
20:20 < bridge> <Assa> we also have the townhall where people suggest features and vote for them btw
20:20 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i have one that uses curl and a rustpi
20:20 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> one that uses mariadb
20:20 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> one that uses ddnet's impl
20:20 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> one that uses sqlite
20:20 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
20:20 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i have a lot of db stuff xd
20:20 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> that is so sick! love the progresss
20:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think devs should still have a say about technical stuff even if a feature is accepted, and we also need clear rules. E.g. don't make the game much easier just bcs the community wants it
20:20 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> that reminds me i wanted to test it on bare metal
20:20 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> but i cant motivate myself to dust off my old pc
20:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But generally community votes would be cool
20:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can write and read disk sectors, now i can implement a filesystem
20:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill make fat32 and ryofs
20:20 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> which fs are you going for
20:20 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ryofs :kekw:
20:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
20:21 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> do fat64
20:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice, I feel like you did smth like that already once
20:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> qemu reports the cpu has 4.4ghz
20:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Is RyoOS finally happening
20:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess its cuz KVM

20:25 < bridge> <Assa> not really, often enough there are reasons feature x/y can't work or is not implemented. Other things (like accounts) are in the making but are stuck at some point
20:26 < bridge> <Assa> it's not like devs are not listening to the community, but we try to align different objectives (stable game, backwards compat, maintainable code ...)
20:27 < bridge> <Assa> a full mod support, while probably wished by the community, is probably unmaintainable for us
20:27 < bridge> <Assa> for example a full mod support, while probably wished by the community, is probably unmaintainable for us
20:28 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> not unmaintainable, chiller offered to maintain that for example - one of the main issues would be that it has no use for DDNet at all
20:28 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> and some other things, can give #7777 a read if interested
20:28 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7777
20:28 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly, community votes are a bad approximation of what is needed. Most people don't care about things, these votes will turn into popularity contests
20:30 < bridge> <learath2> And even if a vote passes, you really have no way to force a free developer working for free to do things they disagree with
20:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i take 80€/hour
20:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/rip-bozo-gif-22294771
20:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> last time it was 40
20:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> estimate on QUIC
20:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i might consider.
20:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> uh no idea, its also heinrich pr
20:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> <a:pepesweating:439923738159480844>
20:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> was it? xD
20:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i'm pretty much useless for all things networking
20:32 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i'm pretty much useless for all things networking, otherwise i'd pick it up
20:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> honestly u probs better of hiring robyt or assa or kebs time
20:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
20:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was half joking
20:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> but if u want someone to make a kernel or a compiler call me
20:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah but for mentorship i think
20:32 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> nono we need roby to stick with ddnet, otherwise game goes teeworlds™ <a:pepesweating:439923738159480844>
20:32 < bridge> <learath2> Also feel free to just ignore me. Everyone does anyway, it's okay
20:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I already said just do /login
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> d o u need mentorship
20:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I literally think it's better than no accounts
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u ask any question here im sure it gets answered
20:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In all seriousness
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> if its about rust u get my attention
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah tbh just do it
20:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> im a kid i dont have a job yet to pay for that
20:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> 90% of apps dont get shipped to prod cuz they wait for the "perfection"
20:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> was cheaper

20:34 < bridge> <Aoe> Ye, that's true. 
20:34 < bridge> <Aoe> I just don't like how there is nothing anyone can do, once the admins makes up their mind about something. And how peoples votes are being disregarded because of what you think of them.
20:34 < bridge> <Aoe> I don't see much of a point of making a town-hall thread for the Old team colors, because it won't make a difference anyway.
20:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye my salary increased and my skills too xd
20:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> make a patreon with rust kernel development videos xD
20:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have adonate button https://edgl.dev/ xd
20:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> How much is it now?
20:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> ugh i dont like videos i prefer blogging
20:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 50€ without taxes.. I am in
20:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1405620979689852948/image.png?ex=689f7e0c&is=689e2c8c&hm=5146a12b60534a205a88e51733b9a24f598de2ac1e790677768b3d3b09708f57&
20:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> oh that reminds me, @ryozuki if i want to get into the world of gentoo, should i just turn brain off and follow website or do reasearch beforehand
20:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes but where blog
20:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1405621128340312287/image.png?ex=689f7e30&is=689e2cb0&hm=83596d728213b4f3572cd2f47916892db52b62708092084387314bbbd09c80b5&
20:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> your approach from earlier today with limine and xfs
20:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> i read everything about rust and ddnet
20:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> just follow the install book https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Full/Installation/en
20:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> you think arch has the best wiki, but thats because u only know the world of arch, gentoo wiki is better
20:36 < bridge> <Assa> See this more positively, there are cases where the town hall post spread awareness and the feature got implemented. Also I skipped through them and looked what could be done as well
20:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> your approach from earlier today with limine and xfs sounds interesting
20:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> also fuck grub
20:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can tell u how to do it, simply stop at the mkfs and bootloader step and ask me
20:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> but the xfs is just using mkfs,xfs
20:37 < bridge> <learath2> I appreciate your dedication
20:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> and enabling kernel modules for xfs
20:37 < bridge> <Aoe> Alright, I will open a thread then.
20:37 < bridge> <learath2> I like mixing both, archwiki + gentoo wiki when installing either
20:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> you know im a good preacher
20:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> :nouis:
20:38 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> okay, will do
20:38 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
20:38 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> give me like 2 hours
20:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr oh btw i would also use LVM if i didnt have a isntalled system already
20:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i recommend u use lvm it makes life easier later
20:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> only 2 hours?
20:38 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i'm a fast copy paster
20:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/LVM
20:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> first time installing arch linux took me 4 hours
20:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> and i destroyed my windows partition
20:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> but on purpose
20:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```bash
20:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> #!/usr/bin/env bash
20:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
20:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> # Process is emerge new kernel sources, copy old config into new sources,
20:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> # eselect new kernel, make oldconfig, make, make install, make modules_install
20:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
20:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> set -e

20:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> echo "sudo eclean-kernel -n 2 -L std --ask"
20:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
20:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> my script to update kernel
20:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> llvm mentioned
20:40 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> is there native dark mode on gentoo wiki
20:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> use firefox dark reader
20:40 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> my eyes hurt from chlorine water
20:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://darkreader.org/
20:40 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> my eyes hurt from Chlorinated water
20:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr u need to understand portage, use flags and unmasking packages
20:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage
20:41 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Portage was that emerge stuff right?
20:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
20:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> chromeos uses portage
20:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> they like the tool a lot
20:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
20:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> its what makes gentoo gentoo
20:41 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i heard good things about it
20:42 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> with flags do you mean USE-flags?, looks op
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont have windows partition so no problem
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
20:42 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> compile-time options, profiling for packages
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> global use flags too
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> for example X global flag
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> to use X11
20:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> does gentoo require compiling the os by urself
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> and packages compile with x11 support
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> or wayland for wayland
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> etc
20:42 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :POGGIES:
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> remember to install alsa and pipewire
20:43 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> okay Ryo i'll install gentoo
20:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont do it at night
20:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> uwill stay all night
20:43 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> but i'll better play ddnet on ryOS in 2026
20:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> do it morning like me
20:43 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> but i'll better play ddnet on ryOS in 2027
20:43 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i have all night, noone's home xd
20:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> im more a morning person xd
20:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wake up at 6
20:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> i read that someone broke their cpu fan because of compiling each installed package from scratch on gentoo xd
20:44 < bridge> <learath2> I really enjoyed btrfs on my new laptop install
20:44 < bridge> <learath2> Btrfs on luks to be exact
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> im using xfs
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> gentoo recommends it
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> over ext4
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanted to try bcachefs
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> on the small drive i dont use now
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> but im lazy
20:45 < bridge> <learath2> Huh, really? Xfs is quite old
20:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> its old but it gets updated a lot
20:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> xfs v5 has cow and reflinks
20:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/XFS
20:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> > The XFS filesystem is a high-performance journaling filesystem. It is ACL (POSIX) compliant for use with Linux.
20:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
20:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> > XFS has a reputation for reliability and led to the creation of the venerable xfstests Linux kernel test suite which now tests regressions in various filesystems.
20:46 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> okay, checklist:
20:46 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
20:46 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> - [] limine and xfs (stop at the mkfs and bootloader step of the gentoo installation and spamping Ryo at 3am)
20:46 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> - [] xfs/btrfs
20:46 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> - [] understand Portage, use-flags and unmasking unsafe packages
20:46 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> - [] cry (not optional)
20:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> > XFS is a high-performance 64-bit journaling file system created by Silicon Graphics, Inc (SGI) in 1993.[7] It was the default file system in SGI's IRIX operating system starting with its version 5.3. XFS was ported to the Linux kernel in 2001; as of June 2014, XFS is supported by most Linux distributions; Red Hat Enterprise Linux uses it as its default file system.
20:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
20:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> > XFS excels in the execution of parallel input/output (I/O) operations due to its design, which is based on allocation groups (a type of subdivision of the physical volumes in which XFS is used- also shortened to AGs). Because of this, XFS enables extreme scalability of I/O threads, file system bandwidth, and size of files and of the file system itself when spanning multiple physical storage devices. XFS ensures the consistency of data by employin
20:46 < bridge> <learath2> I was between zfs and btrfs. Then I decided to give btrfs a go
20:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> add 7 stages of grief
20:47 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Ryo does installing it get much easier after the first time?
20:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Linux kernel 5.10, released in December 2020, included the new on-disk format XFS v5. This was a hard break, since the deprecated XFS v4 can not be converted to XFS v5. Data on partitions formatted with XFS v4 has to be backed up to another partition or media in order to restore it after formatting the old partition with XFS v5, which completely wipes all data on it. The support for XFS v4 will be removed from the Linux kernel in September 2030.[
20:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
20:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> > XFS v5 introduced "bigtime", to store inode timestamps as a 64-bit nanosecond counter instead of the traditional 32-bit seconds counter. This postpones the previous Year 2038 problem until the year 2486.[5] It also introduced metadata checksums.
20:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
20:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> > The Gentoo Handbook, Gentoo Linux's official installation manual, has recommended XFS as the "all-purpose all-platform filesystem" since 28 Jun 2023, succeeding Ext4.[24]
20:47 < bridge> <learath2> For bootloader, I would highly recommend refind. Honestly such a seemless experience that I haven't looked back at anything else even for a second
20:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use limine

20:48 < bridge> <learath2> For bootloader, I would highly recommend refind. Honestly such a saemless experience that I haven't looked back at anything else even for a second
20:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
20:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can install gentoo almost without looking at book
20:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> the only thing i would need is getting the urls
20:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> for stage
20:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> also there is a txt with the install book
20:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> in the liveusb
20:49 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :POGGIES:
20:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u know how to use fdisk and such its ez
20:49 < bridge> <learath2> Most of the problem of first install is honestly just picking out the set of software you want to use
20:50 < bridge> <learath2> It shouldn't be too hard for you coming from nix
20:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
20:50 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> kek²
20:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> does nix have a graphic install
20:50 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> nix has a graphical installer xd
20:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> xddd
20:50 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ryo why are you so GODDAMN FAST
20:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> im writing while raiding in ffxiv
20:50 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> the only difficult thing form nix is the declarative side of it's csonfiguration
20:50 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> the only difficult thing from nix is the declarative side of it's csonfiguration
20:50 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> espacially when you hold multiple host systems
20:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont use nix cuz i cant be bothered to learn a unused language
20:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i did AOC in nix
20:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> worked like a charm
20:51 < bridge> <learath2> One more thing, I would suggest you try openrc.  But if you really are addicted, systemd is available too
20:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
20:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> go openrc
20:51 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i'm a systemd hater
20:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> no systemd bullshit
20:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> also a true gento user doesnt install -bin packages
20:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur warned
20:51 < bridge> <learath2> Perfect, the only thing you'll miss from systemd is socket activation
20:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> gentoo teaches u the way of minimalism
20:53 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> how does openrc handle that, user-activated and stays active 24/7 ?

21:17 < bridge> <Assa> next on my list is doom
21:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah doom is on my list for kernel too
21:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually i prbos already can do doom
21:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> since framebuffer is rly simple
21:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> igot mosue and keyboard too
21:21 < bridge> <pilonpl> software rendering is probably easy
21:22 < bridge> <pilonpl> i wonder how GPU stuff is gonna work lol
21:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> software rendering with a linear framebuffer yes
21:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> a full blown gpu driver no xd
21:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> for reference the biggest drivers in linux kernel are amd in tree drivers lol
21:23 < bridge> <Assa> proposal: implement a kernel in a ddnet map 😄 i am sure there is a turing complete setup
21:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:31 < bridge> <pilonpl> The automapper is probably the best option
21:31 < bridge> <Assa> that one is too easy, we can already do conveys game of life in it
21:32 < bridge> <pilonpl> Yeah it's kinda dumb because it's not in game
21:32 < bridge> <pilonpl> But you probably can't do anything serious in game
21:33 < bridge> <Assa> I can seriously probably render the shrek movie in a map.
21:34 < bridge> <pilonpl> I think the most fun idea is a map that's entirely RNG
21:34 < bridge> <pilonpl> 1 in a million chance of finishing lol
