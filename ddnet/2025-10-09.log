00:01 < bridge_> <totar> I like the kernel posts
03:31 < bridge_> <Teero> why exactly does it make building very difficult? xd
03:32 < bridge_> <Teero> @totar
03:32 < bridge_> <totar> how am I supposed to know which library version to use
03:32 < bridge_> <Teero> oh, did you have issues with library versions?
03:32 < bridge_> <Teero> I never had any
03:33 < bridge_> <totar> you can't build an old client with the new libraries
03:33 < bridge_> <totar> you need to version match them
03:33 < bridge_> <Teero> really?
03:33 < bridge_> <totar> wdym really?
03:33 < bridge_> <totar> ofc
03:33 < bridge_> <totar> it might work but there's no gaurentee
03:34 < bridge_> <Teero> I have built pretty old clients with the newest libs on linux
03:34 < bridge_> <Teero> never had an issue, but I guess it would make sense to ship the release source with the correct libraries. But they are like 100mb no? xd
03:35 < bridge_> <totar> what is the point of releasing the source if not to document the exact build that created it
03:35 < bridge_> <totar> what is the point of releasing the source with each release if not to document the exact build that created it
03:36 < bridge_> <totar> otherwise you can't reproduce that version
03:36 < bridge_> <totar> I wanted to test a patch on an specific version of the client, including the same libraries
03:36 < bridge_> <totar> I wanted to test a patch on a specific version of the client, including the same libraries
03:37 < bridge_> <totar> also some libraries might get added or removed to swapped for different ones
03:37 < bridge_> <totar> even if the newest version is compatable
03:38 < bridge_> <totar> also some libraries might get added or removed or swapped for different ones
03:39 < bridge_> <Teero> Honestly I'm not even sure the releases are even built with the bundled libs
03:39 < bridge_> <totar> I'm pretty sure that this is just a mistake
03:39 < bridge_> <totar> probably no one checked
03:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> funny coming from the same guy that doesn't understand the appeal of nix
03:44 < bridge_> <totar> did I say that? the appeal is pretty obvious
03:45 < bridge_> <totar> that doesnt mean I agree with it, but it's not hard to understand
03:49 < bridge_> <totar> I don't even remember talking about nix in here before
06:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> hi devs and others
06:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> I think I'm others now
07:15 < bridge_> <totar> is it possible to request a review from someone without permissions?
07:17 < bridge_> <totar> nvm it's not
07:36 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> You can only ping them :/
11:09 < bridge_> <learath2> I’ll review it, the updater is mostly my code anyway
11:16 < bridge_> <totar> it is?
11:16 < bridge_> <totar> I guess I should have checked, I thought it was 90% deen
11:16 < bridge_> <totar> I would have expected better from you 😄
11:17 < bridge_> <learath2> He moved all of it at a later date
11:17 < bridge_> <totar> ah
11:17 < bridge_> <learath2> Cut me some slack, I made that 12 years ago
11:17 < bridge_> <totar> do you run the update server as well?
11:17 < bridge_> <totar> and wrote the diff script?
11:17 < bridge_> <totar> I thought that was also deen tbh
11:18 < bridge_> <learath2> This part was deen iirc
11:18 < bridge_> <totar> ok
11:18 < bridge_> <learath2> The update server stuff he handles because he puts out the updates
11:18 < bridge_> <totar> yeah idk, it made so much sense that he was the one who wrote everything to me because the diff script defines the schema
11:20 < bridge_> <totar> I suffered a lot setting it up myself
11:20 < bridge_> <learath2> It’s been a decade so I don’t remember what happened there. Perhaps I defined the schema and disappeared? I remember deen being angry at me for not fixing something I broke 😛
11:20 < bridge_> <totar> oh lol
11:21 < bridge_> <learath2> irclogs probably have it all if you are curious enough to dig
11:24 < bridge_> <totar> It wasn't that far off from working. I have a much greater appreciation for its existence because I was looking into alternative update manager libraries and they're all more annoying to use. I reported a velopack bug in the discord and the lead dev basically said "good luck making your own cross platform updater, it will surely be easier to use a workaround instead" (it wasn't)
11:24 < bridge_> <learath2> I am kinda working on a refresh of it, I posted the new manifest format a month or so ago
11:24 < bridge_> <totar> really?
11:25 < bridge_> <totar> wdym manifest?
11:25 < bridge_> <totar> on github?
11:25 < bridge_> <learath2> ^
11:25 < bridge_> <totar> yes that's what I would have done
11:26 < bridge_> <totar> hash every file and make the client do the diff
11:26 < bridge_> <totar> oh you signed it too?
11:27 < bridge_> <learath2> It’s going to change a tiny bit though, I want to add the ability to end updates on certain os/versions. e.g. we can have a version that last supported windows 7
11:27 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah, that was one of the main things, 2 out of N signatures for any release
11:27 < bridge_> <totar> just don't compile the last client with the update code in it?
11:28 < bridge_> <totar> well
11:28 < bridge_> <totar> I guess we use the same binary for win 10 and 11
11:28 < bridge_> <totar> so that doesn't work
11:28 < bridge_> <learath2> Another thing is that I’m moving the updater out of ddnet itself. Self replacing binaries was a bad bad idea
11:29 < bridge_> <learath2> Especially on windows
11:29 < bridge_> <totar> dunno
11:29 < bridge_> <totar> whys that
11:29 < bridge_> <totar> it works for me
11:29 < bridge_> <learath2> It’s UB, sometimes on some machines it works great, sometimes it doesn’t. And it also angers a lot of AVs
11:30 < bridge_> <Ewan> the AV thing probably cant be worked around but having a separate updater executable is almost definitely the solution to the UB
11:30 < bridge_> <totar> velopack doesn't use self replacing exe and they have even worse AV problems, the entire feedback is "this is unusable, windows deletes the download file" and their response is "lol not our problem use signing" <https://docs.velopack.io/packaging/signing>
11:31 < bridge_> <totar> ddnet doesn't have this issue for some reason
11:31 < bridge_> <learath2> The external binary is replacing itself the same way rustup does it, downloads the new copy to temp, launches that, kills itself, new binary copies itself to old location, relaunches
11:32 < bridge_> <totar> idk
11:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
11:32 < bridge_> <totar> Im skeptical based on velopack discord
11:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> any qemu user here
11:32 < bridge_> <totar> whatever they're doing we should not do
11:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> is it normal for input to feel slow in a terminal if u dont use kvm?
11:33 < bridge_> <totar> I don't wanna pay for signing
11:33 < bridge_> <learath2> What is the issue with velopack? Are you hypothesizing that their issue is that they have an external updater binary?
11:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> with kvm i have 5ms or less delay, but witout kvm i have lik 30-50
11:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> with kvm i have 5ms or less delay, but witout kvm i have like 30-50
11:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> on my kernel
11:33 < bridge_> <totar> I have no clue, it could be anything. All I know is that they claim it's impossible to make an updater that won't have these issues but I never get any complaints about the ddnet one
11:34 < bridge_> <totar> they say you NEED signing to use it
11:34 < bridge_> <learath2> We do get bonked once every couple months, but idk if it’s the updater or something else getting flagged. Thankfully AV vendors aren’t all that bad with removing false detections
11:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> btw, i think when u hold a key press the repetition is software emulated, but qemu receives the repeated input cuz host kernel repeats it, so if i want to make the keyboard repetition myself idk how i would test it without real hardware
11:35 < bridge_> <learath2> Disable repetition in the host?
11:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u can? xd
11:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i guess maybe its a terminal thing that does it like alacritty
11:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or is it lower level
11:35 < bridge_> <learath2> Libinput allows it iirc, and that’s how x11 interacts with it
11:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ic
11:36 < bridge_> <totar> I removed the "tools" from my releases and the AV bonks went down a lot, I don't remember the last time I got a report.
11:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i shoulkd make my own libinput
11:36 < bridge_> <totar> if you upload it to virus total it tells you the files
11:36 < bridge_> <totar> but sometimes it lies, it says it's the exe and then you remove some other stuff from the zip and it's happy
11:37 < bridge_> <learath2> Wait no, it’s not libinput, X11 apparently handles this on its own. Anyway, it’s not the kernel emulating the repetition afaict
11:37 < bridge_> <Ewan> i think it depends because you can adjust repetition interval in software but i have seen keyboards misbehave if you press two keys at exactly the same time
11:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 but the tty driver does it?
11:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u def have repetition in tty
11:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i also need a way to detect when a program wants to render over the tty
11:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so many things
11:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xD
11:39 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah, I guess in tty that’s where it is. But x11/wayland use the raw input device
11:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> >  The recommended profile for keyboards that are not in boot mode in this specification limits keyboards to 6KRO and causes them to respond to an interrupt with a status report at least every half second (again, even if there is no state change) in order to implement typematic (repeating the scancode when the key is pressed long enough) unless the USB controller is programmed to tell the keyboard to reply with negative acknowledgments whenever there
11:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's a USB HID thing
11:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> and it does depend
11:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_human_interface_device_class>
11:40 < bridge_> <learath2> Huh, I’m fairly sure at least my keyboard does the NAK
11:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> from what i read afaik its better to do it software
11:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its more predictable
11:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah
11:41 < bridge_> <learath2> Or there is some further magic sauce in the kernel that undoes the keyboard itself repeating
11:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> afaik the keyboard only tells u key down key up
11:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so i have to keep track fo that
11:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> iirc
11:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> The final step of processing is to combine all relevant information into some sort of "keypress packet" structure, and send it to whomever (e.g. GUI). The entire "keypress packet" might include the following:
11:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
11:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     Unicode code point (if applicable)
11:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     Key code
11:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     Pressed/released flag
11:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     Various other key states (shift, alt, control, etc)
11:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     Various "toggle" states (CapsLock, ScrollLock, NumberLock, etc)
11:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> osdev
11:42 < bridge_> <learath2> Apparently not from what Ewan sent, anyway, lots more reading needed 😄
11:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh
11:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well im doing only ps/2 rn
11:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh
11:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i guess usb is different
11:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> ye
11:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> couldnt say
11:43 < bridge_> <learath2> Oh, on ps/2 yeah, likely much simpler
11:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> btw i think there is no ps/2 scancode set for spanish
11:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or maybe i just gotta translate myself lol
11:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> eh?
11:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://aeb.win.tue.nl/linux/kbd/scancodes.html
11:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> i think it should not be spanish specific, as far as i know that is a software thing
11:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's whether the keyboard is built to send out certain scan codes like accented letters
11:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> but idk
11:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ig ur right
11:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> i sleep but good luck w ur drivers
11:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> with any luck i can see beach tomorrow without getting hurricaned
11:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> am i the only one that always forgets tmux keybinds
11:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ig i dont use it enough
11:47 < bridge_> <learath2> I can never remember them either
11:47 < bridge_> <learath2> Should have never used screen
11:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> c-b % split vert
11:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> c-b " split hor
11:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so intuitive
11:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i prefer tmux splits to macos iterm2 splits
11:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it feels like they use less space
11:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also just 1 ssh connection in this case

12:25 < bridge_> <Teero> If I had infinite time I would make an mmo rpg solo. I would love to actually. But it takes too long.
13:02 < bridge_> <robyt3> I think most false positives were for `DDNet.exe` specifically. We also had some in Steam, so that would rule out the updater code itself, because the Steam version doesn't have it.
13:28 < bridge_> <learath2> Today I almost lost my mind trying to debug something, but apparently I just had a completely wrong idea of what unwinders/DWARF considers to be the start of a frame
13:29 < bridge_> <learath2> It does not line up with what `$rbp` would be in unoptimized code. So whether you have `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` or not changes the positions of stuff relative to what gdb shows as the frame base in `info fram`

13:38 < bridge_> <learath2> Delete this
14:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> do u know what eh_frame is or smth like that
14:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah its gor exceptions
14:15 < bridge_> <learath2> Now I know a lot more about these things 😄
14:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> In the GNU/Linux environment, eh_frame refers to an ELF section containing Call Frame Information (CFI) that enables stack unwinding for exception handling, primarily for C++ exceptions and asynchronous events. This information is stored using a DWARF-based format and consists of Common Information Entries (CIEs) and Frame Description Entries (FDEs). The .eh_frame_hdr section provides additional metadata, such as a pointer to the start of the .eh_
14:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> Purpose
14:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
14:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     Stack Unwinding:
14:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     The primary purpose of .eh_frame is to allow runtime systems to determine the state of registers at various points in the call stack, which is crucial for restoring the program's state during an exception. 
14:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
14:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> Exception Handling:
14:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> This section is essential for C++ exception handling and for unwinding the stack from signals, allowing for graceful handling of runtime errors.

18:37 < bridge_> <stormaxd> sorry
18:48 < bridge_> <404.username.not.found> Pls no six seven
18:50 < bridge_> <stormaxd> ;c
18:51 < bridge_> <404.username.not.found> That's a regular number and there is nothing funny about it
18:51 < bridge_> <Teero> tbh i missed everything xd
18:51 < bridge_> <Teero> what is this about
18:53 < bridge_> <Teero> ah its a song
18:57 < bridge_> <stormaxd> i mean
18:57 < bridge_> <stormaxd> 69 is a funny number
18:58 < bridge_> <404.username.not.found> No
18:58 < bridge_> <stormaxd> why can't 67 be funny
18:58 < bridge_> <stormaxd> A gg
18:59 < bridge_> <404.username.not.found> I mean a number can make you laugh _once or twice_, but wth is up with this whole thing of constantly repeating it?
18:59 < bridge_> <stormaxd> indeed
18:59 < bridge_> <stormaxd> but 67 is forced that too much?
18:59 < bridge_> <stormaxd> sorry then
19:00 < bridge_> <404.username.not.found> Since it has become popular, I haven't survived a single day w/o hearing it or reading it on the internet
19:00 < bridge_> <stormaxd> ngl i hear it like
19:00 < bridge_> <stormaxd> twice
19:01 < bridge_> <stormaxd> for my entire life
19:01 < bridge_> <stormaxd> well ig i'm just to old for all this
19:01 < bridge_> <stormaxd> ngl i've heard it like
19:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> we dont force 69, it just appears and we go nice
19:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> people just say 67 and then people go ah 67, its a bad copy
19:02 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> this is my one boomer thing
19:02 < bridge_> <Teero> same
19:02 < bridge_> <404.username.not.found> Both 69 and 67 are terrible, but 69 is better, it is not repeated that often
19:03 < bridge_> <404.username.not.found> Also is this channel usually used as the second offtopic?
19:03 < bridge_> <Teero> 256 is my personal favourite, if you're talking about numbers
19:03 < bridge_> <404.username.not.found> 2⁸ :feelsamazingman: :feelsamazingman:
19:04 < bridge_> <Teero> my bank pin is 2^256
19:05 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> why does

19:05 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> * deleting the file after
19:05 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> when save_replay
19:05 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> cause save fialures ):
19:05 < bridge_> <Teero> :(
19:06 < bridge_> <stormaxd> why does fontSize can be float, but text resizes according to int numbers anyway
19:07 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> what context
19:07 < bridge_> <cyberfrighter> thank you for the free money
19:07 < bridge_> <stormaxd> just curious, i've been cracking my head for week from now on, when i tried to make smooth dynamic text resize
19:08 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> sizing text by changing the font size given to the text engine is a bad idea
19:08 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> it means you ahve to redraw every frame
19:08 < bridge_> <404.username.not.found> It's 258, because xor ☝️  🤓
19:08 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> a better solution is drawing a high res version to a texture then scaling that
19:08 < bridge_> <404.username.not.found> It's 258, because xor ☝️ 🤓
19:09 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> [cat_uwu](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1230626195649990696.webp?size=48&name=cat_uwu)
19:09 < bridge_> <stormaxd> so convert text to quad?
19:09 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> you should be able to use floats for font sizes tho
19:09 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> in ddnet you cant use scale unfortunatley or draw to textures
19:09 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> you woul dhave to directly interact with sdl which is... a bit eeeeh
19:09 < bridge_> <stormaxd> yyyeee
19:10 < bridge_> <Teero> i did mean to the power of but im too lazy to search for the symbols
19:10 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> drawing to textures  should be the only thing you need to do
19:10 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> you can then use the normal api to draw text at your desired size
19:10 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> then the normal api to draw a texture
19:10 < bridge_> <stormaxd> 🥝
19:10 < bridge_> <Teero> why is sdl so horrible
19:10 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> WAIT NO
19:10 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> U CAN
19:10 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> yes u can scale
19:10 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i keep forgetting
19:11 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> scrap that
19:11 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> just make a text container then scale that when rednering
19:11 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> but why cant u give floats?
19:12 < bridge_> <stormaxd> i can
19:12 < bridge_> <stormaxd> the thing is
19:13 < bridge_> <stormaxd> it resizes only on whole number, not fractions
19:13 < bridge_> <stormaxd> finally remembered the word
19:14 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> 14.5 = 15?
19:14 < bridge_> <stormaxd> ye
19:14 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> im looking at fontsize referneces now
19:14 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> and sometimes its int
19:14 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> u could try fixing that
19:14 < bridge_> <stormaxd> ig it something with glyps
19:14 < bridge_> <stormaxd> ig it something with glyph's
19:37 < bridge_> <zhn> @chillerdragon can you lock the ctf server we are currently play on?
19:38 < bridge_> <zhn> some retard joins with voldemort clients and spams all over with name changes
19:38 < bridge_> <zhn> and now bypassing every ban with proxies
19:38 < bridge_> <zhn> you have no dnsbl database enable right?
19:38 < bridge_> <zhn> enabled*
19:51 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> is there a way to create an uninitialized variable of reference type without triggering miri? 😬
19:51 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> is there a way to create an uninitialized variable of reference type without triggering miri? 😬 (rust btw)
19:53 < bridge_> <Ewan> i don't think that's even possible with unsafe
19:54 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> to create an uninitialized variable or not trigger miri?
20:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> is it the rampantly popular library with 30 years of history and a shitload of active development or is it the relatively new dev 🤔
20:21 < bridge_> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks can you review #10732 ?
20:21 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10732
20:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> lerato get on zcatch?
20:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> the dream is dead
21:09 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @zhn yea i have no dnsbl because i dont like it. But if you guys suffer that sucks. As long as you are online you are fine right? And its just chat spam nothing gameplay relevant?
21:09 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** I already opened an issue to silence name changes of muted specs but did not get to implementing it yet
21:10 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** weird to see players outside of the scene caring about a ctf server. Never saw that before
21:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i fcking fcked up fckingly hard.
21:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i bought new ssd and wanted to install a fcking new os, so i pressed install and it auto selected my fcking new ssd and i was like.. nice.. and it fcking failed bcs my fcking ram disk size was to small, so i increased the cow size and it fcking worked, but the new ssd was already formatted so it fcking selected my fcking main disk and i fcking retard didnt recheck, now i am fcked as hell
21:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i hope i can restore anything
21:21 < bridge_> <louis> damn whatd u lose
21:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> did it get through the install phase or did it only rewrite the partition table?
21:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's bad either way but testdisk should help you
21:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> <https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk>
21:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the first one died after writing some files, then after cow size it easily worked 😄
21:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> im wishing you good luck
21:29 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's good to identify what exactly you want back because i doubt a full recovery is possible once you've installed an OS the existing data
21:29 < bridge_> <Ewan> bcs the more you tamper with it the less likely you are to succeed
21:30 < bridge_> <learath2> Noooooooooo
21:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's good to identify what exactly you want back because i doubt a full recovery is possible once you've installed an OS over the existing data
21:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> true, but since i had like 10000 packages installed i might be lucky on they got destroyed over private data.
21:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or some rust target dir that is 300gb 😬
21:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah lol
21:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> testdisk is probably the least intrusive with the best results assuming it works
21:33 < bridge_> <Teero> XDDD
21:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> photorec has been very powerful for me in the past, but it just brings back portions of data based on its own recognition patterns
21:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> lots of strange garbage data interpreted as WAV, fragmented image files, small portions of c++ code interpreted as java
21:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> not really helpful unless it's simple stuff like jpegs and pdfs
21:42 < ChillerDragon> @zhn u ok? :/
21:43 < ChillerDragon> f jupsti btw
21:51 < bridge_> <zhn> nah, im out
21:51 < bridge_> <Ewan> i enjoy some competitive TW but not on 150 ping
21:52 < bridge_> <Ewan> geography debuff
22:06 < bridge_> <aegisub> I once installed a linux install parallel to an existing windows one. When installing grub it complained about some mbr sector being occupied by something else, I think it was some adobe acrobat document signing thing that for whatever reason had to write itself to the *bootloader*. I googled the error and found the recommendation to just wipe that sector with a simple `dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda seek=<whatever offset it was> bs=512 count=1`. Whi
22:06 < bridge_> <aegisub> I forgot the count=1
22:07 < bridge_> <aegisub> and took about a second to realize my mistake and hit ctrl+C
22:07 < bridge_> <aegisub> which was luckily enough to prevent *serious* damage, the windows bootloader partition came before C: so I knocked out that and had to reinstall the windows bootloader but C: was unharmed
22:07 < bridge_> <Ewan> too late
22:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh that's miraculous actually
22:08 < bridge_> <aegisub> yeah I had crazy luck
22:08 < bridge_> <aegisub> same with my other massive data fuckup actually
22:09 < bridge_> <aegisub> where I moved a massive partition backwards
22:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i am mostly mad if i loose all my ddnet demos :lol:
22:09 < bridge_> <aegisub> and got pretty far during the day but still needed to let it run overnight
22:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> rest is kinda OSS shit or steam games only anyway on that drive
22:10 < bridge_> <aegisub> except that before going to bed I wanted to switch of the wifi repeater in my room and instead switched off the entire socket array
22:10 < bridge_> <aegisub> except that before going to bed I wanted to switch of the wifi repeater in my room and instead switched off the entire power socket array
22:10 < bridge_> <aegisub> including my computer
22:10 < bridge_> <aegisub> I didn't really sleep well that night...

22:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dont use arch btw
22:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> idea looks fine to me, cannot spot any bug with bare eyes, as long as assa doesnt rq in the next months when this patch releases i'm ok with trying out xd
22:15 < bridge_> <Teero> ez
22:15 < bridge_> <Teero> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1425939710190288956/image.png?ex=68e96957&is=68e817d7&hm=ad12f240c42cb464dc43935785664ae57c3f482089188c766596d91c5db99887&
22:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i wish there'd be smth debian based with the idea of cashey to have zen4 optimized packages
22:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i really like the idea
22:16 < bridge_> <Teero> make it XD
22:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dont like arch tho.. too few binary packages
22:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1425941721534959696/image.png?ex=68e96b37&is=68e819b7&hm=63d175757cd4a31e22dddcbbc6b3c5b8340f239132892050d58b6d49d2b33a69&
22:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> i use arch btw
23:12 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @zhn being out is still okay. Sometimes i get scared if someone times out and does not return. Happy to hear you are alive :D 
23:13 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ arch has many binary packages
23:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> are u talking about drone stuffs
23:14 < bridge_> <learath2> I convinced him not to rq
23:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> I saw zhn in-game today
23:15 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Ewan ye some things that cause timeouts in teeworlds can also be unhealthy for the human controlling the pc
23:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> definitely
23:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> I'm missing some context tho
23:15 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** there is none
23:15 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** we had epic game of ctf3
23:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> :brownbear:
23:15 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** zhn had timeout
23:15 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i got sad
23:15 < bridge_> <Ewan> logical
23:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> quad clusters would have been my first graphics optimization wtf
23:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> GPUs are very good at repeating textures
23:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> just saw
23:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> soon we will reach infinite fps
23:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It's getting better. At least they have codium now
23:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Compiling electron is dark evil magic
23:28 < bridge_> <Teero> if i had amd epyc 9995WX i would run gentoo for sure lol
23:38 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yo @zhn you now also have access to `sv_tournament_join_msgs` which silences join/leave messages of spectators
23:44 < bridge_> <melon> :justatest:  bruuuuder whyyy
23:47 < bridge_> <Teero> why not? xD
23:47 < bridge_> <Teero> annual reinstally
23:47 < bridge_> <Teero> annual reinstall
23:54 < bridge_> <learath2> When gentoo? Reject binary
