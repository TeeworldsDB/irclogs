18:08 < switcher_> dumb question,(how) can I compile the tw src code on windows so it becomes executeable for linux ? 
18:09 < EastByte> cross platform compilation
18:09 < EastByte> possible but hard to set up
18:10 < EastByte> I recommend to use a linux vm instead
18:10 < switcher_> Ahw okay thanks for the info, I'll do the vm >_>
18:24 <@deen> yeah, much more reasonable
18:24 <@deen> actually on linux it's easy to build for windows
18:49 <@heinrich5991> "easy"
18:51 < EastByte>  you can always go the easy way and run mingw or the vs compiler chain under wine :p
18:52 <@heinrich5991> still "easy"
18:53 <@EastByte> nah, that's atleast 'easy'
19:05 <@deen> it's easier than building a binary for linux on linux
19:05 <@deen> (that works on all distributions)
19:07 <@deen> on linux you need to care about the glibc version, and installing old glibc versions is hacky, so in the end people use VMs or chroots with the oldest distribution they want to support
20:40 <@heinrich5991> that actually sounds like a good use case for docker :)
20:48 <@deen> well, that's the purpose of docker, but it adds another layer instead of fixing the original problem
20:49 <@deen> (one of the purposes of docker)
20:53 <@heinrich5991> huh
20:53 <@heinrich5991> I mean it allows you to compile with an old glibc
20:53 <@heinrich5991> no layer added at runtime
20:55 <@deen> 1. good luck updating your glibc when a vulnerability comes out the next time
20:55 <@deen> 2. I mean additional layer of abstraction over the raw hardware
20:57 <@heinrich5991> you just upgrade it with the rest of your distribution. you don't link glibc statically
21:13 <@deen> yeah, but you have a different glibc file in each container, right?
21:22 <@heinrich5991> the plan is to: make a docker container with an old glibc. compile teeworlds there. distribute only the executables obtained by the compilation within the docker container, which only need a very old glibc version
21:23 <@deen> aah
21:23 <@deen> ok, i thought the plan was "distribute the teeworlds as a docker image"
