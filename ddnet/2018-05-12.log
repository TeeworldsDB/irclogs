17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Thanks😁
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @n000b please don't discourage people to report bugs
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> That is true, but this also doesn't motivate the developers.
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> normal that people are mad if something doesnt gets fixed for a long time
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @n000b @Learath2 is my little girl, she does all what i want
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+mouse
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see no issue about mouse sense, make an issue if you want it fixed
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't cry if we don't read the billion line backlog here after you people spam
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Besides after opengl3 support my client doesn't work. And did you hear me complain. They can just download ddnet 10.8.
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @n000b does it not work if you disable opengl3? the old renderer is still there
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I did try some stuff, but after last update 80% of all characters are gone. And before I could disable opengl3 and the client would work until I launched it again and it crashed.
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you create an issue about it so @Jupstar ✪ can take a look?
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Not really, because I saw someone who had send a screenshot with the same problem.

17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> is this with opengl enabled or not?
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Not the best photo but the discord app lagged
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Ah with opengl3 the client looks normal
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Ah with opengl3 activated the client looks normal
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Or not lol
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> @n000b  I had the same desk some years ago
