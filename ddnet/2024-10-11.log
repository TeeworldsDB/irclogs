01:13 < bridge> <zhn> hm, maybe only if their manufacturers that provide all the stuff will become public too
01:56 < bridge> <totar> The issue is that all their trade secrets become out dated every 24 months. The reason they are valuable companies is not because they have a bunch of secrets it's because they have lots of money and lots of smart employees to effectively use that money
01:58 < bridge> <totar> If you can summon 2000 very good engineers and 500 billion dollars you can copy any of their businesses without their trade secrets
09:12 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> @edrub this you?
09:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I actually knew specious üòÆ
10:44 < bridge> <exosphere___endosphere> I installed the client on visual studio from [here](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet.git), and when I enter the game, my fps is low, from 40 to 120, when the average is 400-700~, what could this be connected with?
10:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> most likely that you're building the game in "debug" mode
10:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1294219476157464607/image.png?ex=670a3750&is=6708e5d0&hm=92e921822429eb617be46e2e0f9dc40464dfb692db4642a48c3e94d27982cd5f&
10:46 < bridge> <exosphere___endosphere> and which one do you need?
10:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> to properly play a selfbuild version, use a release build
10:47 < bridge> <exosphere___endosphere> thanks
10:48 < bridge> <melo∆û> live testing on a friday eh üáπüá©
10:48 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1294220125397844039/image.png?ex=670a37eb&is=6708e66b&hm=75bf2700f31d1ee45b40170d58859eedc35b71fc45118441e23ca628cfc039c3&
10:52 < bridge> <exosphere___endosphere> @blaiszephyrhow to install files from github correctly? for example on [keys](https://github.com/ThoNohT/NohBoard)
10:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> a repository with a committed `.exe` file ._.
10:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
10:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> he doesn't ahve a binary release (e.g you can't just download the .exe from the Releases) - so you have to clone the repository using git
10:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
10:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> `git clone https://github.com/ThoNohT/NohBoard`
11:02 < bridge> <totar> Pretty sure the binary releases and in the zip folder
11:02 < bridge> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1294223637079003166/image0.jpg?ex=670a3b30&is=6708e9b0&hm=319d227a515570cdf0dfbda9af75c4c57caaf10101f42d22ee55d5babe5cc60f&
11:05 < bridge> <edrub> Hi
11:05 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> hi
11:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> :harold:  ah didn't see that
11:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can also download single files, click the download button here: https://github.com/ThoNohT/NohBoard/blob/6d3a2a445e7527073bba48833333b19174b14373/NohBoard/gotri.exe
11:28 < bridge> <melo∆û> oh - TiL, thanks!
17:12 < bridge> <learath2> English word of the day: `intransigent` = `stubborn`
17:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> @learath2 can i have the pronounciation please
17:14 < bridge> <learath2> mh, `in-tran-suh-gent` where `gent` as in `aGENT`
17:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> ah, i first thought you'd pronunce it like inTRANsigent
17:17 < bridge> <learath2> that's hard to decode üòÑ
17:18 < bridge> <learath2> `/a/` and `/…ëÀê/` are both fine for the a depending on whether you are acting british or american
17:18 < bridge> <melo∆û> in¬∑tran¬∑suh¬∑gENT
17:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> bri'ish
17:19 < bridge> <learath2> `gent` as in `GENTleman`?
17:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> ye
17:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> bottom right
17:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1294318670000033792/image.png?ex=670a93b2&is=67094232&hm=6c2e4e93e6f1a37114a168703dfcb2bad4f3d0bebf02f1d3ab25c8666a2addf9&
17:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> why they screaming
17:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kekw:
17:21 < bridge> <learath2> Actually I should do an actually useful one too: `obviate` = `sidestep`
18:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> gwentlemen
19:55 < bridge> <teero777> uwu
19:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> and uwus
19:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> and gwentleuwus
20:13 < bridge> <montikboom> Help I'm getting error that I need to allow my firewall through ports 8303 even I port forward them and add it in firewall outbound and inbound tcp and udp
20:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then your internet provider doesn't allow it, nothing you can do
20:28 < bridge> <montikboom> Can I ask him to allow port?
20:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You can call them and ask, but that is unrelated to ddnet
20:30 < bridge> <montikboom> Can It be because of double Nat?
20:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe
20:31 < bridge> <syrinok> Is there a downside to allowing both to work?
20:32 < bridge> <syrinok> Thought it was bugged, was used to pressing ctrl+f to cancel it at this point
20:32 < bridge> <klak_sly.> Can you please send me the download link ddnet?
20:32 < bridge> <syrinok> https://ddnet.org/downloads/
20:32 < bridge> <klak_sly.> Thanks
21:33 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> whar
21:33 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> how do you find the discord before the download
22:58 < bridge> <montikboom> Xd
