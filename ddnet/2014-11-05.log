10:30 < hannibal> hey
10:43 <@EastByte> good morning
10:44 <@EastByte> deen: I got ssdp traffic from china yesterday
11:20 < Nimda> 42 by RosenVerkäufer just released on Moderate at 2014-11-05 11:17
15:04 < laxadedi_> Hey everyone.
15:05 < laxadedi_> deen: you there ? I have an idea for Nimda/#ddnet chan
16:08 < o_be_one> hi all
16:08 <@EastByte> hi
16:09 < o_be_one> hey deen, i've a ddrace server in fra whos sleeping
16:10 < o_be_one> sometime its used by 3 or 4 players, no more
16:11 < o_be_one> i'm thinking about switching it on ddnet bin, but maybe it could be integrate ddnet network without having ssh access ?
16:11 < o_be_one> has you like :)
16:11 <@EastByte> deen's current ddnetsrv environment doesn't allow that
16:12 < o_be_one> ok no problem
16:12 <@EastByte> also the german nfoserver vps seems to be the only server we'll need in the future
16:13 < o_be_one> ok
16:14 <@EastByte> nvm, sure you should switch to the ddnet binary :P
16:14 < o_be_one> yes i'll dot that if it works great with old ddrace maps
16:15 <@EastByte> iirc there aren't any compatibility problems
16:15 < o_be_one> ok good to know
16:16 < o_be_one> but you know the map climb ?
16:16 <@EastByte> not sure
16:16 < o_be_one> you have a room with super, endless, etc. It will not work with ddnet
16:16 < o_be_one> if you finish the race you are allowed to go in and have fun with rainbow and other features
16:16 < o_be_one> lets-climb the map name i think
16:17 <@EastByte> if you can call it "features" ^^
16:17 < o_be_one> its in the original map ...
16:18 <@EastByte> yea the map is dependent from the mod then
16:18 < o_be_one> sure
16:18 <@EastByte> but ddrace doesn't have these "features" aswell
16:18 < o_be_one> yeah i know :(
16:21 < xRoThx> got kicked
16:25 <@EastByte> looks more like a timeout
16:37 < xRoThx> ovh isn't really safe is it? 
16:37 < xRoThx> I just read they need 15-120 seconds to start mitigating the ddos attacks
16:37 <@EastByte> depends on the ddos protection you have
16:38 < xRoThx> But I thought o_be_one  had more downtime
16:38 < xRoThx> normal ddos protection
16:38 < xRoThx> not the PRO
16:38 <@EastByte> can you go into the manager?
16:38 <@EastByte> https://www.ovh.com/manager/web/login/
16:38 < xRoThx> yes I do
16:38 <@EastByte> under ips
16:39 <@EastByte> are you able to configure/create a firewall?
16:40 < xRoThx> http://prntscr.com/53ag6g
16:40 <@EastByte> when you click on the wheel on the right side
16:40 < o_be_one> the firewall setting he asked ^^
16:40 < o_be_one> ive only antiddos pro
16:40 <@EastByte> oh you are german
16:41 < xRoThx> http://prntscr.com/53aguz
16:41 < xRoThx> Nah I m not german
16:41 < o_be_one> and no i havent more downtime than you, i was just online when vali was attaking, you was just not ddosed by him.
16:41 < xRoThx> Belgian
16:41 <@EastByte> okay
16:42 <@EastByte> yee
16:42 <@EastByte> you can enable permanent modus there
16:42 < xRoThx> o_be_one:  No offence. 
16:42 <@EastByte> and create a firewall to block all kind of amplification attacks
16:42 < o_be_one> so dont tell bullshit ;)
16:42 < xRoThx> o_be_one:  No offence. I just asked, not broke you down saying you were less online then I do
16:43 <@EastByte> that basicly is what only anti ddos pro should have
16:43 < xRoThx> When I was on your server I have often lags etc. Thats why I asked. Don't feel offended
16:43 < xRoThx> EastByte:  thx I will try
16:43 < xRoThx> I won't stay with OVN 
16:43 < xRoThx> I won't stay with OVNH
16:43 <@EastByte> OVH
16:43 < xRoThx> I won't stay with OVH. I will switch?. But at this moment I needed really fast one. To be able to setup the webinterface
16:44 < o_be_one> i was ddosed every time ...
16:44 < o_be_one> + some issues on xxlddrace
16:44 <@EastByte> non ddnet mods are easy to take down
16:44 < xRoThx> o_be_one:  Thats what I saw.. So I bought myself a couple servers to provide a safe & stable way to play 
16:44 < o_be_one> EastByte, sure, many issues :(
16:44 < xRoThx> now that your back there is no problem anymore
16:45 < o_be_one> but ddnet miss many features ... thats why i dont switch
16:45 < xRoThx> EastByte:  Thats why I didn't took another one. Pikotee told me ddnet is the best without bugs
16:45 < xRoThx> So I came here & found you ^^ <3
16:46 < o_be_one> xRoThx, and XXLTomate was able to fix any issue i had, but now hes very bussy in his real life, thats why it takes longer to fix issues ...
16:46 <@EastByte> besides I'm working on a teeworlds gateway like thingie
16:46 < o_be_one> ddnet has issues too, but dev team is really fast with that so it doesnt stay more than a couple of hours
16:47 < o_be_one> EastByte, it's to do what ?
16:47 <@EastByte> it's like a firewall on top of a teeworlds server
16:47 <@EastByte> I can analyse/block attacks using it
16:47 <@EastByte> even on older mods then
16:47 < o_be_one> oh good !
16:47 <@EastByte> well that is what it should be in the end^^
16:47 < o_be_one> and will it use more bandwith for players ?
16:47 <@EastByte> nope
16:48 < o_be_one> and no morep ing too ?
16:48 <@EastByte> it's server internal
16:48 <@EastByte> there shouldn't be delay at all
16:48 < o_be_one> ok
16:48 < xRoThx> Nice
16:49 < o_be_one> when it will be released ? 
16:49 < xRoThx> Do a ddos protection wouldn't be nececary anymore
16:49 < o_be_one> Do you'll need some servers t otest ?
16:49 < o_be_one> i think he talks about exploits too ...
16:49 < o_be_one> crash and other kiddys scripts
16:49 <@EastByte> xRoThx: my software doesn't prevent server down due to ddos attacks :P
16:49 < xRoThx> Too bad :P
16:49 < o_be_one> xRoThx, i dont understand why vali never ddosed you ...
16:49 < xRoThx> o_be_one:  I do
16:50 <@EastByte> but it can be used to distribute one tw server over multiple hosts
16:50 < o_be_one> no, i'm not sure.
16:50 < o_be_one> EastByte, Oo like IRC link ???
16:50 <@EastByte> yea
16:50 < xRoThx> o_be_one:  I never accepted ANY admin on my server. More then 20 players asked me. One of them could be him
16:50 <@EastByte> so ddos is impossible then
16:50 < o_be_one> awesome
16:50 < xRoThx> And on your server cyril was fucking anoying with his admin
16:50 < o_be_one> it will be more like BungeeCord ?
16:50 < xRoThx> EastByte:  great!
16:51 < xRoThx> EastByte:  In order to create a teeworld cloud-hosted server
16:51 < xRoThx> *?
16:51 <@EastByte> yea like that
16:51 <@EastByte> it's hard to implement though
16:51 <@EastByte> not sure whether I get it finished at all
16:51 < o_be_one> very hard yeah
16:52 <@EastByte> xRoThx: also you know in the tw serverlist one server can only have one ip :P
16:52 < o_be_one> so the player will see an ip, but it will be the proxy ip, not the server ip
16:52 <@EastByte> so you need to do hacks
16:52 < o_be_one> you can put like 10 proxy for only 1 server
16:52 <@EastByte> right
16:52 < o_be_one> and all proxy will shown number of players on this server
16:52 <@EastByte> but there will be delays of cours
16:52 < o_be_one> thats just awesome !
16:52 <@EastByte> e
16:52 < xRoThx> delays will be problems
16:53 < xRoThx> Then I think hosting on ddos protected dedicated servers should be better
16:53 < xRoThx> isn't it? 
16:53 <@EastByte> not if all the servers are hosted in thee same datacenter :P
16:53 <@EastByte> I would rather stick to multiple cheap vps instead of expensive dedicated servers
16:53 < o_be_one> xRoThx, you really need more experience ...
16:53 < xRoThx> o_be_one:  I know. Thats why I ask stuff
16:54 < o_be_one> EastByte, yeah thats how i work, ddosers thinks they can down all r0x.fr by ddosing one or two servers ... its funny. Ive like 30 differents hosts ... 
16:54 < o_be_one> + 4 hypervisors ...
16:55 <@EastByte> yuo have way to much money
16:55 < xRoThx> lol
16:55 < o_be_one> 40€/month.
16:55 < xRoThx> for 30 servers? 
16:55 < xRoThx> Nice
16:55 < o_be_one> ive just many good relationship and one sponsor
16:55 <@EastByte> well that
16:55 <@EastByte> 's diffeerent
16:55 < xRoThx> Tu l a trouvé ou? :P
16:55 < o_be_one> im hosted at ovh, online.net and netissime
16:56 < o_be_one> xRoThx, i keep always my sources away from guys that i dont trust.
16:58 < xRoThx> D'accord
16:59 < o_be_one> my best dedi run with 2 Xeon E5 sockets and 128gb DD3 <3
17:00 < o_be_one> and i have 2 cheaps dedis with ddr2 and celeron or atom x)
17:00 < o_be_one> they are just used has proxy for my minecraft servers
17:02 < xRoThx> o_be_one:  Does r0x has their own Webinterface? 
17:02 < xRoThx> You should concider using the open source one (uptee)
17:02 < o_be_one> what you mean by webinterface ?
17:03 < xRoThx> an easy part of your website where users can create/manage their server
17:03 <@EastByte> o_be_one: you have way too much resources
17:04 < o_be_one> EastByte, definitely !
17:04 < o_be_one> xRoThx, i dont need that, i manage teeworlds by myself
17:04 < xRoThx> Alright
17:04 < o_be_one> it takesl ike 1 min to up a new server
17:04 < xRoThx> You could be thinking of managing it through it, and/or adding minecraft aswell
17:05 < xRoThx> o_be_one:  I like the fact that r0x is that big! :D
17:05 < o_be_one> ive already Minecraft admin panel for my gamemasters, they are not linux friendly like me
17:05 < o_be_one> r0x.fr is 5 years old ...
17:05 < o_be_one> its easyer to get that
17:05 < xRoThx> How did you came on teeworlds? 
17:05 < o_be_one> was before r0x.fr, maybe was 6 or 7 years
17:06 < xRoThx> You were on minecraft and thought, lets go yolo? 
17:06 < o_be_one> i was playing, ive hosted AIP official servers
17:06 < xRoThx> Oh alright
17:06 < o_be_one> ive known zarnexx with his aip bin
17:06 < o_be_one> was very funny ^^
17:06 < xRoThx> don't know AIP, but thats a nice one. Thats where I am atm
17:06 < xRoThx> Hosting a couple servers
17:06 < o_be_one> but admins was very too kiddy ...
17:06 < xRoThx> trying to make it grow a bit. I hope getting out of the costs
17:07 < o_be_one> so ive stopped that, not useful for me. After ive upped a minecraft servers, non french players again ... They was admin on it but do shits, ive stoped it and started again but with french players
17:08 < o_be_one> and these one was 30 years old so ... it was easyer to start a good community
17:08 < o_be_one> and one of my admin his java engineer at Total -_-
17:08 < xRoThx> Alright. Yes.. With kids there is notting to do about it.. They will abuse/rage one time or another
17:08 < o_be_one> so it was VERY EASY to do something powerful, we was TOP5 french about Minecraft, and ive hosted again TeeWorlds for me cause i love this shitty game
17:09 < o_be_one> and when ive tryed blocker map ... felt in love.
17:09 < o_be_one> i was already in love of ddrace gameplay, but blocker was more funny and weird at the same time
17:09 < o_be_one> you need to manage friendship, ennemys, etc.
17:10 < o_be_one> i host Farming Simulator, StarBound, StarMade ...
17:10 < o_be_one> i just play StarBound and TeeWorlds ...
17:10 < o_be_one> all other i'm bored ...
17:10 <@EastByte> starbound is a good game
17:10 <@EastByte> didn't have time to start it though
17:11 < xRoThx> o_be_one:  What do you think about starting an upgrade mod? 
17:11 < xRoThx> I got the source from 2years ago
17:12 < xRoThx> Need quite some updates
17:12 <@EastByte> don't do that
17:12 < xRoThx> But for a blocker map it will be great!
17:12 < xRoThx> I had 2400 players 2years ago
17:12 < xRoThx> :D
17:12 < xRoThx> *more, but that was in about 75% of the lifetime
17:12 < xRoThx> didn't checked it again later 
17:13 < o_be_one> what is upgrade mod ?
17:13 < o_be_one> i want to host a city.
17:13 <@EastByte> gaawdd guys
17:13 < xRoThx> o_be_one:  People want to block better. They can block better if they have full upgrades. An upgrade is for example 5% more rockets speed
17:13 < xRoThx> or 5% shotgun etc 
17:14 < xRoThx> But on a map like royal it created (2y ago) such a great place to be
17:14 < xRoThx> were like 2-3 servers full 
17:14 < xRoThx> ^^
17:14 < o_be_one> oh ok, could be funny
17:14 <@EastByte> you guys are going to attract more of the kids o_be_one has been bugged of
17:15 < xRoThx> The kids love it! 
17:15 < xRoThx> loved*
17:15 < xRoThx> don't know about now
17:15 < o_be_one> lol now my kids are on v3R xRoThx servers /// !D
17:15 < xRoThx> :P
17:15 < xRoThx> haha
17:15 < o_be_one> ive only pros now
17:15 < xRoThx> lmao
17:15 < o_be_one> idk how and why, but ive always like only 10 to 20 players but all pro and more mature ...
17:16 < xRoThx> nice
17:16 < xRoThx> I don't really care about it :P
17:16 < xRoThx> they have fun
17:16 < o_be_one> and i dont know them
17:16 < o_be_one> never seen them before
17:16 < xRoThx> and I see that I don't pay for notting
17:16 < o_be_one> its really weird.
17:16 < xRoThx> maybe a clan? 
17:16 < xRoThx> or group friends
17:16 < o_be_one> nop
17:17 < o_be_one> sure, its easier to attract players with ddnet network ;)
17:17 < xRoThx> Yes, that mod is getting so popular
17:18 < xRoThx> for hosters (pretty safe) and for players (pretty stable)
17:18 <@EastByte> also ddnet is serious and not some kiddy shit
17:18 < xRoThx> EastByte:  indeed. But you should make a 16p version
17:18 <@EastByte> a what?
17:18 < xRoThx> 16player version
17:18 < xRoThx> like xxlddrace
17:18 < xRoThx> they have 16-64 players
17:19 < xRoThx> So the hosters can choose to only allow 16players
17:19 < xRoThx> :)
17:19 <@EastByte> well sv_max_clients 16
17:19 < xRoThx> Command.. 
17:19 < xRoThx> Then the admin come in types 64 and its done
17:20 < xRoThx> should be something that the hoster can lockµ
17:20 < xRoThx> should be something that the hoster can lock
17:20 < xRoThx> I got the source of +ddrace with all extra's lol
17:20 <@EastByte> oh you got?
17:20 < xRoThx> +ddrace64 with upgrades & dummys.. 
17:20 <@EastByte> is there is masterpw in?
17:20 < xRoThx> yes
17:20 < xRoThx> No, its took you
17:20 < xRoThx> No, its took out
17:20 <@EastByte> hmkay
17:20 < xRoThx> He deleted it 
17:20 < xRoThx> but on the public it is
17:20 <@EastByte> couldn't crack it yet
17:21 < xRoThx> its not possible
17:21 < xRoThx> he its not like an admin pw
17:21 <@EastByte> it's a hashed pw
17:21 < xRoThx> he explained & its pretty funny, lol. you should contact him
17:21 <@EastByte> I already analysed the binary
17:21 < xRoThx> Yes, but exept that
17:21 < xRoThx> you should ask him how he secured. You will laugh a lot :P
17:22 <@EastByte> it's md5
17:22 < xRoThx> I know
17:22 < xRoThx> but beside that
17:23 < xRoThx> Normally a command is like Command i 
17:23 < o_be_one> ive always wanted to join ddnet, but some of ddnet bin are not what i'm searchning
17:23 < xRoThx> he came on the idea to change it
17:24 < xRoThx> command i i i i i i in chat
17:24 < o_be_one> the no rescue philosophy, and the no help too, it's not as i see coop
17:24 < xRoThx> amount of i's is not known neither
17:25 <@EastByte> I didn't find something like this iirc
17:25 < xRoThx> EastByte:  He started that project, implemented a lot of nice features for kids. So they would host it. He just wanted a couple servers to own :)
17:26 < xRoThx> But at a certain moment he had over 100 :P
17:26 < xRoThx>  So it had to be secure, if somebody would be able to hack it that mod would die
17:26 <@EastByte> o_be_one: I don't understand the philosophy you are speaking of
17:26 < xRoThx> But it has been 2years since I spoke him
17:26 <@EastByte> players with more skill are able to help/rescue others
17:26 <@EastByte> so you just need to train
17:27 <@EastByte> upgrades and stuff always have bad consequences
17:28 < o_be_one> EastByte, maybe im too "open" to help people, i dont know, i love when a community is always together for all, its the r0x.fr mind
17:28 < o_be_one> the game can be easy, not a problem if the time we play together is funny

20:28 <@deen> hi. seems like you had a long discussion today
20:30 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
20:30 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 406
20:30 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 612 users online at 2014-10-26 20:15:01
20:30 <@deen> teamspeak server pretty full as well, nice
20:44 < laxaa> deen: you don't consider me as a sponsor cause of teamspeak ? :D
20:45 <@deen> see, xRoThx, that's why i didn't want to write you as sponsor!!! now everyone wants^^
20:45 < laxaa> Nah it's ok, I just wanted the forum rank 
20:45 < laxaa> I don't care about motd
20:46 <@deen> there you go, added you and east
20:46 < laxaa> <3
20:47 < laxaa> ok
20:47 < laxaa> I have an idea
20:47 < laxaa> thanks to east
20:47 < laxaa> he wants that nimda announce tournament on IRC
20:47 < xRoThx> deen: I think they should all be named in the motd. From the moment they really make a sponsorship/hosting or something that costs more then 25€/month
20:47 < laxaa> and I have a better idea : make all broadcast go in ddnet.tw/broadcasts.txt
20:47 < laxaa> with timestamp
20:47 < laxaa> and nimda will announce every broadcast on server
20:47 <@EastByte> yea I like it
20:48 < laxaa> xRoThx: I don't like the "if you pay more than 25euros/month"
20:48 < laxaa> you are sponsoring ddnet or not
20:48 < laxaa> it's that simple
20:48 < laxaa> right now there is : you / broken / china guy / east / me
20:48 < laxaa> and that's think it's all
20:50 <@deen> but some broadcasts i send to all servers, some just to a few
20:50 <@deen> which to log?
20:50 < laxaa> hum
20:50 < laxaa> the generals one
20:50 <@deen> sometimes i really spam the broadcasts, like during the tournament^^
20:51 < laxaa> these aren't generals right ?
20:51 < laxaa> only on tournament servers ?
20:51 <@deen> they are only on tournament servers
20:51 <@EastByte> I like all the broadcasts during tournament^^
20:51 < laxaa> yeah, but you are playing then, no need to have them on IRC
20:51 <@deen> when the tournament starts i switch from "> *.fifo" to "> 830[3456].fifo"
20:52 <@deen> even the general broadcasts are really often
20:52 < laxaa> well then I guess only the broadcast to all fifos, like the tournament countdowns
20:52 <@deen> irc would be totally spammed
20:52 < laxaa> well, it's up to you
20:52 < laxaa> but I like the idea, and EastByte too I think
20:52 <@deen> right now i spam every 2 hours, then 1 day before the tournament every hour, 2 hours before every 20 min, 1 hour before every 10 min, 10 min before every min
20:53 < xRoThx> You are right laxaa  You have as much rights on credits as me ;)
20:53 <@deen> that sounds like too much for irc
20:53 < xRoThx> I was just messing with you, since I knew 25 is less then what I pay & more then a teamspeak server :D
20:53 <@deen> maybe someone should just set the channel's title line and announce the tournament there
20:55 < laxaa> with irssi, I think you can do that : /topic blablabla
20:55 <@deen> yes, but i don't want to, since i already have to announce in ddnet-forum, website, teeworlds forum, tw-friends forum and so on
20:55 < laxaa> EastByte will do it :p
20:56 < laxaa> set something general, maybe rules for chan like don't privmsg ops
20:56 <@EastByte> everything has to be automatic
20:56 < laxaa> nimda would need op to set topic to begin with
20:56 <@deen> I change the texts a bit every time, sometimes ruels change and stuff like that, so can't automate that
20:56 < laxaa> not sure you want that
20:56 < laxaa> I mean rules for IRC channel, not for tournament
20:56 < laxaa> EastByte just wanted automatic announcement for tournaments
21:12 < xRoThx> laxaa:  you host TeamSpeak servers? 
21:12 < laxaa> 1 server yes
21:21 < o_be_one> is same message every time ?
21:30 <@deen> i don't understand the question, what message, o_be_one ?
21:33 < o_be_one> about broadcast
21:33 < o_be_one> do you spam same message every time 10 min when its 1h before event ?
21:33 <@deen> until 24 hours before tournament it's the same, then it announces the time until tournament as well, and some messages
21:34 <@deen> but i change it every time, what it announces
21:34 < o_be_one> maybe the bot can take an other file to tell on irc ..
21:34 < o_be_one> or maybe he can use it in an other way
21:35 <@deen> or maybe we just don't spam irc at all^^
21:57 < o_be_one> a large part of ddnet community is not on irc so it will be not a problem i think
