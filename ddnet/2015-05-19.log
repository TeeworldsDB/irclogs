00:51 < laxa> deen: still there ?
00:55 <@deen> hi
01:00 < laxa> can't find where and when the client send the input for the server
01:01 < laxa> only the dummy one
01:01 < laxa> any idea ? :)
01:06 < laxa> CCLient::DirectInput seems to be it, but can't find any place where it is being called...
01:07 <@deen> engine/client/client.cpp
01:08 <@deen> SendInput
01:08 <@deen> line 478
01:08 <@deen> and lots of dummy chaos code following
01:09 < laxa> Any idea where this part is done in the CClient::Run ?
01:10 < laxa> But, if my thinking is right, unless the client is not sending input every client Tick, then, increasing fps will increase input sent to server, and you could win in best case scenario 1 tick
01:22 <@deen> no idea, too tired, sorry
01:22 < laxa> finally found it
01:22 < laxa> I am tired too ^^
03:03 < Nazar> What fucking kid gaves "Yellow" admin rights @ V3Royal?  he Bans People Without a fucking reasoN!?
03:07 < Nazar> DEEN MAN
03:07 < Nazar> -.-'
03:08 < eeeee> sounds like a typical blocker server
03:12 < Nazar> Yeah,  Bans with no Reason, than he ban my RANGE for no reason ? Whats a kid!?
03:12  * Nazar slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
03:12  * Nazar slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
03:12  * Nazar slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
09:43 < Learath2> morning
10:14 < eeeee> sup
10:32 < Learath2> so who gave Yellow admin rigth s ?
10:49 < _Reborn_> :D
10:50 < Learath2> :D
11:13 < _Reborn_> xD
11:22 < _Reborn_> Hi all :D
11:25 <@deen> Good morning
11:26 <@deen> I don't run the block server, so xrothx should know. but his idea was "no admins", so it's weird that Yellow has admin
11:28 <@deen> I see lots of bans on the server indeed. I guess I'll change the rcon pws for now
11:28 < _Reborn_> Create Raidcall Group :D
11:29 < _Reborn_> ?
11:36 <@EastByte> deen: sry, wasn't reachable due to final exams
11:36 <@deen> EastByte: sure, no problem
11:36 <@deen> I don't even know if I'll have internet for that week yet
11:37 <@deen> and it's still a bit bad when I only check if DDNet is dead once a day^^
11:37 <@EastByte> ^^
11:37 <@EastByte> well, in that case you need to explain me what to do :D
11:37 <@EastByte> is releasing maps hard?
11:37 <@deen> sure, will do that a few days before
11:38 <@EastByte> okay
11:38 <@deen> not really, you have to take a screenshot in a specific resolution, run 2 scripts locally, copy the files on the server, update the maps list on the server, git add the new files and synchronize to all the servers
11:39 <@EastByte> if this is all^^
11:45 <@deen> and sometimes the servers go down or ranks disappear and I have no idea why^^
11:45 <@deen> and then you have to look for the reason, lots of fun
11:45 <@deen> afk
11:45 <@EastByte> I see...
12:00 < savander> hi
12:03 < _Reborn_> Hi :D
12:04 <@EastByte> hello savander 
12:05 < Learath2> \o/
12:05 <@EastByte> o/
12:08 < savander> \o/
12:09 <@deen> I'm not happy with the livestreamers we have
12:10 <@deen> Hopefully someone else will stream at the next tournament
12:10 <@deen> (they uploaded their recording to YT and I watched it for the first time)
12:14 < savander> bad quality?
12:14 <@deen> They insult people, talk shit and burp around. Now I finally understand why I get complaints about the stream every time I put it on ddnet.tw
12:16 < savander> hallowed?
12:16 <@deen> no
12:16 < savander> or now ones?
12:16 <@deen> Forris & maggi323
12:16 < savander> ah
12:16 <@deen> I wish we had Hallowed back =/
12:16 < savander> what with hallowed?
12:16 <@deen> He doesn't want to spend so much time for DDNet on Sundays
12:17 < Shiki> Hi guys
12:17 <@deen> Hi Shiki 
12:17 < Shiki> during watching demos of vanilla I see some strange numbers instead of score, like 00:19, 01:20 and such
12:17 < Shiki> is there a way to get old plain vanilla score back?
12:17 <@deen> Shiki: yes, that's expected with DDNet client. It's because we can't tell if a demo is a (dd)race or vanilla demo
12:18 <@deen> you can just open F1 and set cl_demo_assume_race 0
12:18 < Shiki> oh, cool
12:18 < Shiki> thanks!
12:18 < savander> if i could know english better.
12:18 <@deen> savander: well, their stream always was in German^^
12:18 < savander> hah
12:18 < Shiki> btw, what those numbers mean anyway in case of vanilla?
12:18 < savander> my streams will be always in polsih..
12:18 <@deen> but yeah, an english stream would be perfect
12:18 < savander> Shiki: 
12:18 <@deen> Shiki: number of kills?
12:18 < savander> tseconds
12:19 < savander> 1 kill (-1)
12:19 < savander> means 1 second
12:19 < Shiki> nope, not kills
12:19 < Shiki> ah sorry yes
12:20 < Shiki> it just confused me that I have 01:16 while in plain old vanilla score table it's 76
12:20 < Shiki> now I see
12:20 < Shiki> thanks!
12:20 < savander> np
12:20 < savander> :P
12:21 < Shiki> also a question
12:21 < Shiki> are there any plans on introducing some enrichments to PO vanilla score table? :)
12:21 < Shiki> like kills per minute, longest kill streak, kills by weapon
12:21 <@deen> not really, but I guess I would accept a nice looking pull request
12:22 < savander> it's in 
12:22 < savander> sushi client
12:22 < savander> i guess?
12:22 < Shiki> yep it's there
12:22 < Shiki> hm, I will try to port it from sushi client there
12:22 < Shiki> I'm really missing this feature
12:22 <@deen> Great, thanks
12:23 <@deen> I've heard this requested a few times before
12:23 < Shiki> any ideas on how it should be implemented in case of ddnet client?
12:23 < savander> Don't forget to add enable/disable button! (or command)
12:23 <@deen> Shiki: the same way? just disable it when a server is identified as a race server
12:23 < Shiki> maybe just like it was in sushi's -- you bind a key to this special table?
12:24 < savander> btw, sushi's doing really good job
12:25 < savander> he's he contribute to make race mod?
12:25 < savander> wtf
12:25 < savander> he's he = fail
12:25 < Shiki> > It's because we can't tell if a demo is a (dd)race or vanilla demo
12:26 < Shiki> can't you check game type and/or map?
12:26 < Shiki> it's ctf2 with gametype ctf
12:26 < Shiki> should be easy to tell, given those come oob in vanilla teeworlds
12:26 <@deen> game type is not saved in the demo
12:27 <@deen> that's the entire problem :P
12:27 < savander> so color of skins in ctf
12:27 < savander> are just saved in demo?
12:27 < Shiki> are ddnet demos backwards compatible with vanilla?
12:27 <@deen> Shiki: i hope so
12:27 <@deen> but haven't tested
12:27 <@deen> ah, recently we had a change
12:27 <@deen> so probabaly not anymore
12:27 <@deen> the other way around it should be compatible
12:28 < Shiki> so why can't we introduce saving gametype in demo file? :)
12:28 <@deen> you can, go ahead please
12:28 <@deen> =)
12:28 < Shiki> nice!
12:28 <@deen> but old demos should keep working
12:28 <@deen> people have hundreds of their ranks recorded
12:28 < Shiki> do you somehow differentiate now, between vanilla and ddnet demos?
12:29 < Shiki> I saw few commits from BeaR who touched that matter
12:29 <@deen> there must be a new bit to differentiate, yes
12:29 < Shiki> ok
12:29 < savander> just check if demos have
12:29 < savander> additional variable
12:29 < savander> i guess?
12:30 < Shiki> I'm not familiar with demo record-replay codebase, so you better tell me ;)
12:30 < savander> me too, just a question :D
12:32 < Nimda> Sunny Land by Themix just released on Novice at 2015-05-19 12:31
12:38 < savander> fifo =  infinite loop with getting data from file?
12:38 <@deen> sort of
12:38 <@deen> but the file is no real file
12:38 <@deen> when you write into it it goes directly to the DDNet server reading from it
12:39 < savander> echo "broadcast something" > fifo.file ?
12:39 <@deen> yes
12:39 <@deen> that's how i broadcast on all servers at the same time
12:39 < savander> oh
12:39 < savander> one fifo file?
12:39 <@deen> no
12:39 <@deen> echo "broadcast something" > *.fifo
12:39 < savander> ah.
12:39 <@deen> i think bash can't do that, but zsh can
12:39 < savander> hmm
12:39 < savander> i used *
12:39 < savander> to delete files
12:40 <@deen> (maybe i'm wrong)
12:40 < savander> 8305.cfg
12:40 < savander> rm 83*
12:40 < savander> deleted all files which starts with 83
12:40 < savander> maybe im wrong, and im not using bash ;P :D
12:40 < savander> don't really know
12:40 <@deen> nono, deleting works
12:40 < Shiki> work on zsh
12:41 <@deen> but with the pipe it doesn't work i think
12:41 <@deen> >
12:41 <@deen> with fifo*
12:41 < Shiki> ~: mkdir test ~: touch 1.fifo 2.fifo ~: echo 'blabla' > *.fifo ~: cat *.fifo blabla blabla
12:41 < Shiki> in short -- it worked
12:42 < savander> yup
12:42 < savander> doesn't work on bash
12:43 < savander> bash: *.fifo: ambiguous redirect-
12:43 < savander> :P.
12:43 <@deen> for i in *.fifo; do echo blabla > $i; done
12:44 < savander> yes
12:44 < savander> xD.
12:46 < Shiki> btw why doesn't $ make clean remove DDNet binary?
12:48 < savander> btw. life bans works?
12:49 < savander> i remember, a year ago it doesn't
12:49 < savander> and second question, someone know what "save_ban" doing?
12:49 < savander> or "ban_save"
12:54 <@deen> Shiki: make clean? we have makefiles?
12:54 <@deen> savander: i made sure life bans work, i guess you know why. but I use iptables for lifebans now
12:54 < Shiki> yep, and it just redirects to bam
12:55 <@deen> weird
12:55 <@deen> never seen that^^
12:55 < savander> iptables are better for a lot of servers
12:55 <@deen> savander: indeed
13:35 < savander> deen:  you know maybe how big delay is to respawn weapon?
13:35 < savander> on vanilla
13:49 <@deen> no idea
13:50 < Shiki> about 10-20 seconds I suppose
13:56 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] nzyuzin opened pull request #207: Remove code duplication (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/vTnhA

14:17 < savander> woah
14:21 < Shiki> deen: could you please assign #208 on me?
14:21 < Shiki> deen: I'm nzyuzin on github
14:23 <@deen> why assign?
14:24 <@deen> I can only assign myself
14:25 < Shiki> hm, assign so I won't forget that this issue should be implemented ;)
14:26 < Shiki> strange, I wonder how issues assigning works on github then
14:26 <@deen> I guess you need to be part of some DDNet team
14:26 < laxadedi> cause ddnet is for deen only
14:26 <@deen> and I would need to add commit rights to you
14:26 < laxadedi> and ddnet isn't an organization on github
14:27 < Shiki> ah ok
14:27 < Shiki> thanks
14:27 < laxadedi> crontab : sendmail every 24 hours to remind you :p
14:27 <@deen> or just add it to your todo
14:27 < Shiki> My todo list is quite long already :P
14:27 <@deen> which is not very useful when your todo list has 300 entries like mine^^
14:27 < Shiki> yep!
14:28 <@deen> i always add new entries at the top
14:28 <@deen> maybe i should clean out some old points from 8 years ago
14:28 < Shiki> ^^
14:48 < MatzeEe> hey deen, can you kick a blocker at one of your servers? getting really annoying and every vote fails because noone votes
14:52 <@deen> Anyone have a diff tool for maps? Would be really useful. I heard a rumor that a cheat was added when a map was fixed
15:32 < savander> eastbyte map viewer
15:32 < savander> load two maps 
15:32 < savander> in transparent
15:32 < savander> xD
15:45 <@deen> not good enough, i don't
15:45 <@deen> know
15:45 < laxadedi> wasnt someone developping a map versioning ?
15:45 <@deen> just an online tool where you upload two maps and it would show you a red marking of where the diffs are
15:45 <@EastByte> laxadedi: I was mentioning it as an idea
15:45 <@deen> it could be based on EastByte's map viewer
15:46 <@deen> but should be for entities instead
15:46 <@deen> because it's mostly about preventing people adding cheats
15:46 <@EastByte> should be easy
15:46 <@deen> then we could more easily accept map fixes from random people
15:46 <@deen> right now I only accept map fixes from people I trust
16:14 <@heinrich5991> deen: have you considered adding this:? https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11385
16:14 <@heinrich5991> (unrelated)
16:14 <@heinrich5991> (to the previous conversation)
16:15 <@deen> i don't know how it works
16:15 <@deen> if mappers like it and unsigned char* (or anyone else) wants to adapt it to ddnet, sure
16:18 <@heinrich5991> deen: would a simplistic diff suffice?
16:18 <@deen> no idea
16:18 <@heinrich5991> i.e. assume that no layers were added/removed, no layer sizes changed, etc.
16:18 <@deen> we have more layers in ddnet
16:18 <@deen> ah, diff for the other problem^^
16:18 <@deen> i thought for the android thing
16:19 <@heinrich5991> no, this was back to the other discussion :D
16:19 <@deen> hm, they actually do change layer sizes often
16:19 <@deen> and remove layers
16:20 <@heinrich5991> meh
16:20 <@deen> Never post your email address below an article...
16:21 <@deen> I did it once and people are still writing me mails asking for help installing Nim etc
16:34 <@heinrich5991> deen: why do they delete layers for fixing stuff? :(
16:35 <@heinrich5991> do they keep the game layer size intact?
16:36 <@deen> nope, not even that
16:36 <@deen> they delete layers and make them smaller to reduce server memory load
16:36 <@deen> I told them to do that :P
16:36 <@deen> also client memory of course
16:37 <@heinrich5991> so how am I supposed to find the original game layer in the smaller/bigger new game layer? :/
16:37 <@heinrich5991> (theoretically speaking)
16:37 <@heinrich5991> (not a programming question, an algorithm question)
16:37 <@deen> like diff does!
16:37 <@heinrich5991> but diff only has one dimension to care about :/
16:37 <@heinrich5991> maps are two-dimensional
16:38 <@heinrich5991> I could make it one-dimensional by just writing it line by line
16:38 <@heinrich5991> which could work
16:54 < savander> grrr
16:55 < Reborn> o_O
16:55 < savander> mrau
16:55 < savander> gerere
17:07 <@deen> Teeworlds is still visible when you install ubuntu
17:19 <@deen> that's pretty nice
17:20 <@deen> I'm wondering: should we investigate getting DDNet into a few databases for games?
17:22 <@deen> Android store, Ubuntu thingy, Greenlight stuff
17:26 < seymour> Steam :P
17:26 < fstd> http://penenen.de/yes.jpg
17:36 < laxadedi> deen: it could be a good idea if you think you can manage the things that would come with more players
17:36 < laxadedi> best store to be is steam imo
17:36 < laxadedi> but we already had a discution about it
17:36 < Learath2> dont think steam would like our update schedule and autoupdater :D
17:37 < laxadedi> Learath2: why not ?
17:37 < laxadedi> They don't have schedule for their own game so...
17:37 < laxadedi> I am playing dota 2 right now
17:37 < laxadedi> they patch the game whenever they need/want to
17:37 < Learath2> it feels like we are doing more rolling releases then any other game on steam
17:37 < laxadedi> not true
17:38 < laxadedi> valve is the editor of cs:go and dota2
17:38 < laxadedi> 2 of the most played games atm
17:38 < laxadedi> and because they keep them updated as much as they can
17:39 < laxadedi> Well, that question might be somewhere already
17:40 < laxadedi> I forgot all the cons deen said about steam, and why he said no.
17:40 < Learath2> and im not sure if we can get open source steam integration 
17:40 < laxadedi> you can get whatever you want on steam
17:40 < laxadedi> there is a FAQ for that
17:40 < laxadedi> Learath2: search for : "Steam Greenlight FAQ"
17:41 < laxadedi> !google Steam GreenLight FAQ
17:41 < Nimda> http://www.google.com/search?q=Steam+GreenLight+FAQ&hl=en&safe=off (Results: 12.100.000)
17:41 < laxadedi> http://steamcommunity.com/greenlight/faq/
17:42 <@deen> name and skin changer, wtf
17:42 <@deen> changes name and skin 10 times per second
17:42 <@deen> i don't get how
17:42 < laxadedi> And, if you publish opensource game to steam, you won't have to deal with royalty issues !
17:43 < laxadedi> deen: dosn't ddnet have a flood protection against those things ?
17:44 <@deen> yes
17:45 <@deen> and he circumvents it
17:46 <@deen> sigh, i see how
17:46 <@deen> you can just send the STARTINFO packet again...
17:46 <@deen> instead of CHANGEINFO
17:47 < Prime> hey deen 
17:47 <@deen> hi
17:47 < Prime> look at this : https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L1594
17:47 < Prime> there is no protection 
17:47 <@deen> yep, fixing^^
17:48 <@deen> thanks
17:48 < Prime> and every one can send start messages to change name and skin and color ;)
17:48 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 3 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/vTC9O

17:48 < Prime> your welcome
17:48 <@deen> Let's hope no one notices
17:49 <@deen> takes some time to restart all servers
17:49 < Learath2> deen: we should maybe get a way to restart servers while people are on it
17:49 < Prime> I dont tell anyone about this, sure.
17:49 <@deen> Learath2: nah, too much complication
17:49 <@deen> would have to save state etc
17:51 <@deen> Prime: you're from Iran?
17:51 <@deen> I hope we'll get an Iranian server again soon
17:51 < Prime> y
17:52 < Prime> we have some servers ;) on the Intranet
17:53 <@deen> yes, i heard
17:53 <@deen> but I want DDNet servers, with our rules and no cheats ;)
17:54 <@deen> and worldwide ranks, tournaments etc
18:04 < Prime> who banned me :D
18:08 <@deen> I did of course because you spammed the server with your renames :P
18:29 < Prime> deen: Don't waste your money for iranian players, servers in iran are expensive (p/p) and bad quality (bad performance). after all , do you think why we running servers on Intranet insted of internet? because of DDos. 
18:33 < Prime> I hope you read this carefully.
18:35 < Learath2> oh a greenlight application is 100$ 
18:42 <@heinrich5991> I can submit games to the greenlight store, so if you want to submit something (and don't have an issue with me being listed as one of the creators), I can do that
18:46 <@deen> That sounds like a threat
18:46 <@deen> or am I misreading?
18:48 < Learath2> hmm dont quite see a threat there
18:48 <@heinrich5991> if you're referring to Prime's message (I really can't see a threat in my line), yes, I also saw that
18:48 <@deen> heinrich5991: ok, thanks
18:48 <@heinrich5991> but only between the lines
18:48 <@heinrich5991> it's not something you can ban someone for
18:48 < Learath2> its just not enuff english
18:49 <@deen> Yes, but they're well known to ddos other servers
18:49 <@deen> and they make money with their servers
18:49 <@deen> so we'd be a real threat
18:49 < Learath2> oic
18:49 <@heinrich5991> you should stop hosting server, because we're already hosting them
18:49 < Learath2> yeah that was a threat then
18:57 <@EastByte> lol I always was suspicious about having STARTINFO and CHANGEINFO but I never actually looked at it
18:59 <@EastByte> if(pPlayer->m_IsReadyToEnter) << why was this removed in ddnet?
19:00 <@deen> i don't know, git blame?
19:00 <@EastByte> ddrace*
19:00 <@EastByte> why would git be the fault?
19:00 <@deen> use "git blame" to find the culprit
19:00 <@EastByte> oh lol
19:01 <@EastByte> brb
19:05 < Learath2> deen: git blame says you added that whole block
19:06 <@deen> and probably moved it from somewhere else?
19:06 <@deen> in that same commit
19:10 < Learath2> you moved it from some line below and commented that out in the process
19:24 <@EastByte> deen is the culprit!
19:25 <@heinrich5991> git blame deen
19:38 <@deen> oh well^^
19:38 <@deen> i don't remember why!
19:39 <@deen> what commit was it?
19:43 <@EastByte> I guess this one https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/4af57565
19:44 <@EastByte> you added dbg couts there
19:44 <@EastByte> also the reformat looks strange
19:45 <@EastByte> gawd that diff looks strange
19:52 <@deen> i was obviously debugging something and fixed some whitespacing
19:52 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/4af57565?w=1
19:55 <@EastByte> well
19:56 <@EastByte> oh my dummy on xrothx block got kicked
19:56 <@EastByte> disconnected : ' Kicked (please dont fake the afk system.)'
19:56 <@EastByte> since when is there an afk system?
20:01 <@EastByte> the dummy was connected about a month and collected 715318 chat messages
20:04 < savander> LOL?
20:04 < savander> stalker
20:04 <@EastByte> I wanted to make a word cloud out of block :)
20:17 < savander> o.O?
20:24 <@deen> EastByte: no one logged into rcon since i changed the pw
20:24 <@deen> that must have happened earlier
20:24 <@deen> and i changed the pw
20:24 <@deen> o_be_one must have passed it to other people =/
20:25 <@deen> 10 people were permabanned
20:32 < Nimda> Genericore 4 by Åmol just released on Brutal at 2015-05-19 20:28
20:32 <@deen> i unbanned them of course
20:41 <@EastByte> the kick happened Mon May 18 07:16:29 2015
20:43 <@EastByte> so it might have been some random guy who does not know about ddnet not kicking afk players
20:44 <@deen> ok
20:44 <@deen> well, only 1-2 wrong people had rcon
20:44 <@deen> shouldbe solved now
20:46 < laxadedi> deen: can't compile ddnet on my macos 10.9.5 even though I tried changing bam.lua, I had conflict with X11/opengltypes.h or something
20:46 <@deen> huh
20:46 <@deen> is that a new or old version?
20:47 <@deen> i don't remember how i set it up on mac
20:47 <@deen> but i know it was difficult
21:01 < o_be_one> hey whatsup ?
21:01 < o_be_one> just seen highlight
21:02 < o_be_one> no, i never give rcon
21:02 < o_be_one> so its not possible that its me.
21:02 < o_be_one> EastByte, oh, you are "meme" ?
21:02 < o_be_one> this kick reason is from me !
21:04 < o_be_one> some players asked to kick "meme" cause he afk always and doesnt play and use a slot for no reason ... Ive remembered about a idle kick but maybe im wrong, so i was thinking "meme" use an autoclic/key system
21:04 < o_be_one> now i know its you, its ok EastByte i'll dont do it again, your project is interesting ^^
21:05 < o_be_one> and ok about idle, its allowed 
21:09 <@EastByte> o_be_one: okay, well I actually have enough chat messages
21:09 <@deen> o_be_one: you're "Yellow"?
21:09 <@deen> and permabanned multiple ips and ranges?
21:11 < o_be_one> deen, yes it's me
21:11 < o_be_one> about range ban reason are wrote on them
21:11 <@deen> anyway, talk to xrothx about it. i don't mind anything that's going on on the block servers
21:12 <@deen> I'm just happy that they pay the regular DDNet servers :P
21:12 < o_be_one> who pays regular ddnet ? you have donations ?
21:13 < o_be_one> yes xrothx gave me rcon to admin this block server cause he havent the time so i do my best for that :).
21:14 <@deen> o_be_one: xrothx pays GER
21:14 < o_be_one> but i dont want to take the right to give rcon to anyone, so dont worry about that. There is a ddnet staff, and its a ddnet server so i keep in mind DDNet system
21:14 < o_be_one> oh ok, but if it wasnt him, it could be me ;) you will always have someone to pay for EU DDNet blocker, dont worry about that too
21:15 < o_be_one> for remind, i host all popular blocker on TW ... just V3ROYAL is took by DDNet.
21:15 < o_be_one> oh and i miss chile servers too, thats true :p
21:26 <@deen> Today our new Novice map is fuller than the blocker servers ;)
21:26 <@deen> o_be_one: brazil sometimes has pretty popular blocker servers as well
21:26 <@deen> i think i've seen 30 players on there
21:34 < o_be_one> woaw nice !
21:34 < o_be_one> i must try the new novice map, i dont play ddrace EU cause with a ping of more than 100 its just unplayable, so i go with Broken and other new friends ^^
21:35 < o_be_one> US/CAN players and staff are very friendly :)
21:36 < o_be_one> deen, wanted to ask you, there is a V3ROYAL2 but it seems to be an other rcon that i dont know
21:47 <@deen> they are friendly? I had the opposite experience^^
21:47 <@deen> o_be_one: i think all servers have an rcon you don't know now :P
21:48 < laxadedi> deen: 10.9.5 is the before last release of macos. The last release is called "Yosemite", but apparently, it broke a lot of things. But I don't have it. I am not really aware of what's specific to apple OS anyway.
21:49 <@deen> =/
21:49 <@deen> HMH could probably help, he helped me get it running on mac
21:54 < o_be_one> deen, oh ok, for blockers i can understand ... But many tees knows that i can admin many servers so sometime they ask my help ^^. So ive no problem to get more access in my side if it could help DDNet. Well about CAN/US, some tees plays like if they was alone, but when you see them more than one time it's ok. Broken seems to work to do a better american community
23:40 < savander> nimrod looks good, first time with that kind of code syntax
23:42 <@deen> It's called Nim know
23:42 <@deen> What old document are you reading where it's still called Nimrod?^^
23:43 < savander> i turned off my vm, can't tell you xD...
23:46 < savander> or maybe just my mistake
23:47 < savander> i think, i read "nimrod" when i searched for plugin to SublimeText
23:47 <@deen> ok^^
23:48 < savander> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod
23:48 < savander> lul
23:51 < savander> I hosts 3 servers on AWS, everyday have players on servers (clan people's, from other clans and random people) and i use 448.75 mb/s out data transfer per day.
23:53 < savander> 15gbs / 30 days == 500mbs out data transfer allowed to use per day if i don't want to pay anything.. for clan.. ideal.
23:53 < savander> (15gbs out data transfer per month in free tier)
23:54 <@deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim_(programming_language)
23:54 <@deen> cool
23:55 < savander> (space at end)

23:57 < savander> you said something like that i gues
