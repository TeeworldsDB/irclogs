03:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I updated my laser color thing so that hopefully it's compatible for linux now. Just had to remove an unused variable and configure DoLaserPreview to react to the enum
05:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Also, how do you test other pull requests?
05:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Oh wait, nevermind
05:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @Essigautomat I'm testing your all_materials_experimental  branch right now
06:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> There seems to be two `Add Material Layer` buttons, which do the same thing.
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> @Voxel I made a small test map if you need help. I currently have local changes which are not committed yet. They'll allow to gain your jump back consistently on bouncy tiles
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> Unfortunately I didn't have any time the last weeks
08:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ooh, interesting!
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> what do you think so far? I am still missing (a lot of) visuals and design things. Also only show gametiles is currently not working for a lot people and there is a bug
09:47 <+ChillerDragon> sounds good @Learath2
09:48 <+ChillerDragon> you can close this issue then:) https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5527
10:37 <+ChillerDragon> @Robyt3 any plans on porting the teeworlds listbox code to ddnet?
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> yeah, I'd like to port CScrollRegion and CListBox eventually
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> poggies
12:30 <+ChillerDragon> does someone know what changes are in ddnet vs teeworlds texture rendering? I just copied the skin rendering code from vanilla into ddnet and the textures seem to not get rendered correctly
12:30 <+ChillerDragon> do i miss some new render flag? a new way of loading textures? dilate?
12:33 <+ChillerDragon> i probably messed up cutting out the right dimensions when loading the image
13:33 <+ChillerDragon> got it!
13:34 <+ChillerDragon> was loading sprites from `g_pData->m_aSprites` instead of `client_data7::g_pData->m_aSprites`
13:34 <+ChillerDragon> btw @Learath2 ur protocol7 stuff is so cool and helpful! appreciate it
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> can this wait a bit? I wanna see if people hate the improved look any less
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure
14:24 <+ChillerDragon> "hate less" nice goals :D
14:24 <+ChillerDragon> no front! the new snow flakes look really cool!
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not seeing that much hate fwiw
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the vocal majority that hated it just stuck to 16.1
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Majority of the local minority* :P
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Vocal*
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> God I have brain damage
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 2 hours of sleep, not enough
15:05 <+ChillerDragon> meanwhile konsti uses ddnet 9.0.2 because it still has SDL1 :D 
15:05 <+ChillerDragon> axaxax pink rat
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Petyr> After minimalization and open i have like this in Manjaro
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Petyr> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1001122188985905232/unknown.png
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I don't think portrait aspect ratios are supported
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Very few parts of the ui will work properly in portrait :/
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The main menu scales fine iirc
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Petyr> sorry i do screen badly, I use vertical, with option full screen is like this but, in window full screen work great. sorry for my English
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Petyr> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1001140595483492442/unknown.png
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> try tilt your phone :p
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I think it's very nice so far! It's interesting to see what all the materials do and the potential for emersion could be! Tho idk if its just me but ice particles are also broken
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> huh why are they broken?
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> when you halt, instead of snowflakes, half are black boxes with red text (broken/unregistered textures)
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i can provide a screenshot if you need it
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> this totally sounds like a broken texture, but I never heard of that issue
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> you have material_particles.png?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> under data
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> it happened with me when i tried to add more emote options
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1001144252463587509/20220522_121900.jpg
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> let me check
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah, i do
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> weird, then I must have a bug somewhere
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1001145527456510072/unknown.png
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> there are the right ice particles in between?!
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> never seen this before üòÆ
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> what file are the ice particles rendered under?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> game.png particles?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> they are rendered like all other effects
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> https://github.com/AssassinTee/ddnet/blob/c66d247ae5ed4c1b0164a96af3c49d7ac5212547/src/game/client/components/effects.cpp#L131

17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> also, i wonder- why is MAX_PARTICLES in particles.h 1024 * 8? why not set it to just 8192? this is in the base game too
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1001149823598198865/unknown.png
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i can only assume this is for readability
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> this might be a good client variable, tbh. I am pretty sure a lot of people could without problems render a few (million) more particles
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @Essigautomat I found the issue: It turns out that `SPRITE_PART_SNOWFLAKE03` under `p.m_Spr =` is the unloaded texture
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @Essigautomat I found the issue: It turns out that `SPRITE_PART_SNOWFLAKE01` under `p.m_Spr =` is the unloaded texture
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @Essigautomat I found the issue: It turns out that `SPRITE_PART_SNOWFLAKE01` under `p.m_Spr` is the unloaded texture
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its a constant so this will be precomputed and have will not affect perf
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ohh
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Will have no*
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Compilere are rly smart
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Compilers
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Stupid smartphone
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @Essigautomat I found the issue: It turns out that `SPRITE_PART_SNOWFLAKE01` under `p.m_Spr` is the unloaded texture.
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I've conducted multiple tests with this segment of code (removing the rand function and testing them individually, changing the rand function to exclude the first), it's safe to say it has something to do with the first snowflake
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I'm trying to look in `CGameClient::LoadMaterialSkin` to see if something is messed up with the loading of that texture. Everything checks out, i *think*.
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Steinchen> Hey. who has the most finishes on any map? Is it possible to see a top10 of that
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> update sdl2
18:46 <+ChillerDragon> yes there is a way @Steinchen you can run any sql query on the whole ddnet database
18:46 <+ChillerDragon> https://ddnet.tw/stats/sql.js/
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Steinchen> I dont understand what I have to do on that site
18:47 <+ChillerDragon> do you know sql?
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Steinchen> Nope
18:47 <+ChillerDragon> then ask someone for the query its probably a simple one but i would also have to look it up
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Steinchen> Could somebody help me with that? I have no idea how that works D:

20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a bit sad that making some work public domain is such a hard thing to do legal-wise
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://chrismorgan.info/blog/unlicense/
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The Unlicense is intended as a public domain dedication. I don‚Äôt think you should use it, but should prefer CC0 or possibly 0BSD instead. Here‚Äôs why.
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Part of the background story is that on patents, we've fought the scenario that a patent holder could offer some FOSS library implementing their patented method, and then come chase you for patent infringement. What are the boundaries for me, FOSS user, to not be ensnared by a submarine license?
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> patents are such a nefarious thing
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> luckily, we don't have software patents in europe AFAIK
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also i think, imagine you implemented x stuff this way and put it in public domain, can they patent that and fuck u?
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you mean by 'public domain'
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> stuff has a copyright owner in germany, you can't disclaim that
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can just give everyone all the rights to it
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> except by being dead for 70 years
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what i dont understand
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why can something not be copyrighted at all
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in germany
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you mean by 'not copyrighted'?
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can say that anyone can use it for any purpose
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that 'not copyrighted' enough?
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its still like bound to u
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> brb food
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the idea is that just like you can't sign away your human rights, you can't sign away your creations* (*except if you were hired to create it, then it's not you who will be the copyright owner)
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think we do have "method" patents, or like algorithm one
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think so, in europe
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i remember being coinventor in such a patent in France
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> now, i don't know what it can legally cover and what it can't
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Screw the rules, I have money
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what :what:
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> companies always saying they so innovative and then chillin on their 50 years old patents xd
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I just hope the humans in 200 years laugh at us, anything else would disappoint me
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> patents are 20 years, and can be extended but not indefinetely
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 50 years are most likely outdated anyway
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably not
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you can patent something as fundamental as arithmetic encoding
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arithmetic_coding&oldid=1097400373#History_and_patents
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> looks like its mostly US who uses software patents
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its even worse
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can patent numbers
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what kind of numbers?
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_number
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> these
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> those aren't patents, are they?
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i guess
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> itsp robably worse than that
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > An illegal prime is an illegal number which is also prime. One of the earliest illegal prime numbers was generated in March 2001 by Phil Carmody. Its binary representation corresponds to a compressed version of the C source code of a computer program implementing the DeCSS decryption algorithm, which can be used by a computer to circumvent a DVD's copy protection
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine making primes ilegal
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> humanity best
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, as soon as you have any kind of information that is illegal to posess or to share, you can easily turn it into a prime number
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats cool
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so if you support making it illegal to share certain kinds of information, you should be fine with banning really large prime numbers
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so if you support making it illegal to share certain kinds of information, you should be fine with "banning" really large prime numbers, i.e. making it illegal to share them
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean, you can treat disney's frozen as just a really large number
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Communal information when?
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you think that this work should be covered by copyright, then the corresponding really large number also is
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oof
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> all the corresponding large numbers could be, depending only on the compression used, so that makes a lot of them üòÑ
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not a lot of them in relative terms
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> arent primes infinite?
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :p
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there are a lot more numbers than illegal ones
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> of similar size

23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ie. crazy energy consumption
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> one of these ways is called PoS and is already implemented

23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> hopefully geez
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> how would "minting" an NFT work under PoS? isn't PoS just about the collective ownership of the thing? isn't that kinda like the artist? or am i overthinking it
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the problem is that ppl are always going to trade between PoS and PoW and it's going to overall make the point of PoS less effective and there's no mitigating it unless other currencies suck
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> another problem is that ppl are always going to trade between PoS and PoW and it's going to overall make the point of PoS less effective and there's no mitigating it unless other currencies suck
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I want to mention first that nfts look like a useless scam
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there's no way you could bind a cryptocurrency to stay within network, it's a free market
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "minting" nfts would work the same as in PoW
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im not saying i support NFTs or anything they run parallel to
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I guess i don't care if they work well
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you just have to pay transaction fees, just like in the other case
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> huh
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i must not be understanding PoS correctly but then again i never understood PoW correctly either
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> they're not useless, they're used in money laundering
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so i will just wait until sometime i look up a video and I'm not lazy xd
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how to fix nfts: delete
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> minting nfts is just some transaction on some blockchain AFAIK @lynn
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it has nothing to do with PoW or PoS AFAIK
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> NFTs always have the most uninspired art too. it's like, very clear that people have only ever cared about the money and there's barely artistic expression behind them
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> speaking in terms of art here
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> nothing else
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> some are cool
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> art wise
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> not the monkes tho
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ohhh maybe i thought "minting" a process was something complicated
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i say we ban meekrioz for being an nft bro
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ohhh maybe i thought "minting" an NFT, that process was something complicated
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> xd
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i asked him about it
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i don't think he is especially egregious in that area n will probably stop at some point
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> my boy still has morals
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> Nope.
