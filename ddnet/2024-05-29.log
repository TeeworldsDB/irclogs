10:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> eww
11:26 < bridge> <nouaa> is there a web map editor somewhere?
11:27 < bridge> <cellegenrih> map viewer only :v
11:27 < bridge> <nouaa> good enuf I guess, where is it
11:28 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://ddnet.org/releases/ click on one of the maps
11:28 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://ddnet.org/releases/ click on one of the maps (picture)
11:28 < bridge> <ar1gin> happy bday üéÇ ü•≥ , you are now 1 year closer to your expiration date üòà
11:28 < bridge> <nouaa> edge crashed, nice
11:28 < bridge> <cellegenrih> happy birthday, beers on me :owo: üçª
11:28 < bridge> <nouaa> :kek:
11:28 < bridge> <cellegenrih> oof :kek:
11:30 < bridge> <screeeny> i mean this exists but idk more https://github.com/k2d222/twwe
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I am currently checking @patiga s Top 5 maps which have extremly many quads, for duplicates which might be removed. Here are my findings:
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> 
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Mud: 0 duplicates
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> 
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Gummy: 1 duplicates 
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> 
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Atomic: 0 duplicates
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> 
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Victory 2: 
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> ```
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Most in single layer: 8812
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Total quads: 9997
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Total duplicates: 4665
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> ```
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> - Most seem to be duplicated lights in order to make the light effect stronger, so this is by design, questionable design
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> - Effect layer: seems to be an actual bug
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> 
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> run_world_war_zero: 0 duplicates
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> 
11:30 < bridge> <AssassinTee> It might make sense to add duplicate detection as a check for map submission
11:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> omg whoever maintains it still is a legend
11:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> dragging groups ain't a thing, all property values need to be manually assigned on the right...
11:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Other than that, it's a fully functional editor
11:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Oh, now I see chillerdragon is a contributer
11:34 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ... wait wtf, is this actually an online interactive editor? meaning other users can edit it in real time??
11:34 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yes
11:35 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :pepeW: holy fuck, why don't we have that in the client
11:35 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yet another tool building on patigas bindings üòÑ
11:37 < bridge> <vappy19> Yeeeh but usually is broken xD
11:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the ui design is kind of similar to TeeUniverse
11:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> was it the inspiration? üòÑ
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what exactly breaks if i may ask? üòÑ
11:38 < bridge> <archimede67> would be pretty useless
11:38 < bridge> <teero777> bloat
11:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> No nono, not at all, group mapping
11:39 < bridge> <archimede67> asked experienced mappers about it and they said they probably won't use it, simpler to just share the map file
11:39 < bridge> <cellegenrih> huh?
11:39 < bridge> <teero777> For the 3 people that use it.
11:39 < bridge> <teero777> Way too much work
11:39 < bridge> <archimede67> ^
11:39 < bridge> <cellegenrih> with that mindset where no risk = no work ain't applied here, it's a loser mentality
11:40 < bridge> <archimede67> you say it would be cool to have it but would you even use it
11:40 < bridge> <teero777> Implement it then lmao
11:40 < bridge> <archimede67> no, it's a realistic mentality
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @cellegenrih if it makes you happy to know
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dd-pg, which will be ddnet compatible map wise
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> has network support
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tho not as cool as the web thing.. one person hosts, the others can join
11:40 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Imagine the possibility of mappers coming together, build maps, review maps and even playtest maps using Trashmap implementation or something
11:40 < bridge> <archimede67> as I said, close to nobody will use it
11:40 < bridge> <cellegenrih> source?
11:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> are you a mapper?
11:41 < bridge> <archimede67> multiple mappers
11:41 < bridge> <archimede67> i am yes
11:41 < bridge> <vappy19> Like the connection of the IP, or the server was misconfigured dont let mapping at the same, but should be fixed now
11:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> would you want to explore that idea?
11:41 < bridge> <archimede67> i already thought of it and wanted to implement it
11:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> not like, having this exact thing I said, but just the idea of having it?
11:41 < bridge> <archimede67> yes
11:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Well, there is motivation
11:42 < bridge> <archimede67> yeah but it won't happen
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah only config stuff ok.. i thought getting out of sync or smth
11:43 < bridge> <vappy19> Hmmmm yeh, goes pretty fine
11:43 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I'm kinda sad, that since many people have their own roles in developing this game, nobody would rather take on the quest of making something new, unless you are a veteran like Chillerdragon who experiments stuff like that
11:43 < bridge> <archimede67> that's what you think
11:44 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Can prove you wrong x2
11:44 < bridge> <cellegenrih> So, still I don't have the authority to say what the devs can or cannot do, but this idea of having contributal interaction inside the editor may be possible and since there is a live example (https://github.com/k2d222/twwe/issues) where the foundation of the idea is there, it's not that difficult to do.
11:44 < bridge> <teero777> What exactly is not so difficult about this?
11:44 < bridge> <archimede67> it's not that difficult to do‚Ñ¢
11:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Visuals can be done, the system is there, so the only thing's missing is API between that server and the client
11:45 < bridge> <archimede67> what
11:45 < bridge> <AssassinTee> it is difficult due to synchronization, on a webserver, like twwe all events are synchronized to the server, if you'd do the same thing in the editor, you would need to synchronize between two clients
11:46 < bridge> <AssassinTee> talking about a client integration^
11:46 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the client only need info, so it's not client specific. syncing info needs to be done in the server
11:46 < bridge> <archimede67> plus twwe uses javascript language which has less restrictions than c++ and is easier to work with regarding sockets and live editing
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as said i already have network support
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rust version
11:47 < bridge> <teero777> Is it public yet? XD
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a version from last month is
11:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> So the only problem with this idea would be sync issue? xd
11:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> thats the only problem you throw into my head
11:48 < bridge> <AssassinTee> sync issues, and somebody actually needs to implement it, lastly the code needs to be maintained
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can only say the biggest challenge is to not do out of bounds stuff:
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Jupeyy/dd-pg/blob/d5009f76e5909be7b8e4be7bda16af1e2118c58b/game/editor/src/action_logic.rs#L524-L1796
11:49 < bridge> <cellegenrih> this website ain't maintained, so if someone would implement it, they would contribute to it.
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u have to reject actions if they are "outdated" bcs the clients got out of sync
11:49 < bridge> <archimede67> ideally the solution will not use that "website"
11:49 < bridge> <cellegenrih> So again, sync issues. Syncing can be done in different ways. Priority order or server response system can be done
11:50 < bridge> <archimede67> but also this is simply a huge effort for a thing that almost nobody will use since a big chunk of mappers are solo mappers
11:50 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I suggest master slave, one hosts the map, others can edit
11:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Yes, if new info comes in which contradict the current info sent, it needs to signal it to all other clients
11:50 < bridge> <archimede67> it doesn't make sense to implement something unless users want it, in this case: mappers
11:51 < bridge> <cellegenrih> huge effort. You literally have to make an API which handles map actions
11:51 < bridge> <archimede67> you really don't understand
11:51 < bridge> <teero777> port forwarding just for mapping together? idk
11:51 < bridge> <cellegenrih> have the client recieve the data, have the API make it understandable, read actions, apply actions
11:52 < bridge> <archimede67> if it's so simply why don't you go ahead and implement it
11:52 < bridge> <archimede67> if it's so simple why don't you go ahead and implement it
11:52 < bridge> <cellegenrih> same from client: Send the actions through the API, API sends it to the server, server calculates actions, back the step 1
11:52 < bridge> <AssassinTee> wait, can't filesyncing be done between users with other software? patigas twmap-edit tool can convert maps into directory structures, and then you can sync them instead of the map/client, this could be done in a client patch
11:52 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Lame response
11:52 < bridge> <archimede67> no
11:52 < bridge> <AssassinTee> a lot of mappers host a local server anyway, I do at least
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @cellegenrih it's not completely trivial
11:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Yes, literally anyone in this team can implement it, I am the one who lays down the foundation of the idea and the implementation of the system
11:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I know cuz you devs are amazing
11:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I cant think of anyone who cannot code it off.
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as i said:
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - u need to make sure to not do out of bounds stuff (so lot of hardening vs no network)
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - u need to handle all actions through action events (e.g. undo/redo managers) no other way
11:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> did you write that? üôÇ
11:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the project
11:54 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Yes, I don't think I sent off malicious intent from it :justatest:
11:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> All in all, I only think about the developers pushing this idea away, because they officialize their opinions as a fact?
11:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Like would you not rather make a poll about this idea to the community?
11:55 < bridge> <archimede67> Having an idea is fine, but having a use for that idea is better
11:55 < bridge> <archimede67> yeah
11:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> You know, cuz since it's a community driven game
11:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sorry, I mean: did you implement this project?
11:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> You know, cuz since it's a community driven game, would make sense
11:56 < bridge> <archimede67> as I said, I asked a few experienced mappers about it and said it would be useless
11:56 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I have a prototype map editor project in Godot, where handling Object is similar to handling Quads and Tiles, yet cannot read data from tw maps
11:56 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I have my own experience regarding handling data
11:56 < bridge> <archimede67> now we could make a poll in mapping channel to gather more opinion
11:56 < bridge> <archimede67> now we could make a poll in mapping channel to gather more opinions
11:57 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And I think, if I could ever read map data inside my own editor, I could make an interface for online contribution
11:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I wouldn't do a poll unless someone wants to implement it
11:57 < bridge> <AssassinTee> why can't you read data from tw maps? There are python bindings for doing this, also the map file format is fully documented
11:58 < bridge> <archimede67> I would
11:59 < bridge> <louis> @cellegenrih smth like that doesn't belong in the client
11:59 < bridge> <louis> too much bloat
11:59 < bridge> <archimede67> but yeah
11:59 < bridge> <louis> rather make an external tool that can sync multiple mappers + a live server all at once
11:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because otherwise people will be disappointed
11:59 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I mean, the website version is there I give it that
11:59 < bridge> <cellegenrih> it's amazing really
11:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I find the word "bloat" too vague
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i havent seen the source code of the web version, but is it really robust?
11:59 < bridge> <louis> unnecessary maintenance for little reward
11:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> thanks
11:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think cooperative map editors are cool. especially when they're live on the server
11:59 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://github.com/k2d222/twwe/issues
11:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd guess that there's demand for this, even if mappers don't know it yet
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's not my question
11:59 < bridge> <cellegenrih> eh
11:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> getting out of sync is a matter of timing
11:59 < bridge> <cellegenrih> or matter of restricting more actions
11:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the thing needs to have some sort of synchronization model is what @jupeyy_keks is saying
12:00 < bridge> <louis> i also think in-game map editing is better explored through something like #7666
12:00 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7666
12:00 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I think it's okay as long as you don't have collisions
12:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and a way of reconciling different colliding steps
12:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. by dropping htem
12:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> If the client would not be compromised to other developers (aka using it as intended), you can restrict any further actions, till the current action is sent to the server and verifies it
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, that's what i spent a lot of time for, and this is also the part i'd consider not trivial
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Jupeyy/dd-pg/blob/d5009f76e5909be7b8e4be7bda16af1e2118c58b/game/editor/src/action_logic.rs#L524-L1796
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> search for `anyhow::ensure!`
12:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's used extremly often
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> additionally `?` operator
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> basically it must be panic free
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and in cpp it's really easy to oversee such stuff IMO
12:02 < bridge> <AssassinTee> even if you have a collision, just deciding for one in live editing might be enough, since it's a mapping process, if it's wrong it can be fixed anyway
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, but that's the problem
12:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u have to reject the action
12:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> "just deciding for one" is already a hard problem
12:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because you'll have to revert actions that are not yet synced with the server
12:03 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I think now I get it
12:04 < bridge> <AssassinTee> that's where we are back to the history, if you reject an action, all following actions should be rejected as well
12:04 < bridge> <AssassinTee> ofc, this requries to have a history with all actions
12:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if two ppl apply a tile brush it's ofc basically impossible to decide.. but if a third client also makes the layer smaller in size at the same time, it's very important to not crash üòÑ
12:04 < bridge> <cellegenrih> or just have a "wait for response" indicator to the client whenever their action is being handled
12:05 < bridge> <AssassinTee> that's where we are back to the history, if you reject an action, all following actions should be rejected as well (from a single client)
12:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> priority should be given to the first action, then detecting the compromised action, give a "waiting for response" indicator
12:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's introducing edit latency, likely too long
12:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Have a cooldown on how many actions you can do
12:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you'll have to do this with every action, because you can't know that the other party also just started an action
12:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> with in-app purchases for more actions?
12:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
12:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure why limiting the number of actions helps with the synchronization
12:07 < bridge> <cellegenrih> nono, like each action is under a certain coodown
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so if u draw a tile brush
12:07 < bridge> <cellegenrih> so no spamming
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how do u imagine it?
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if its not instant it sucks already
12:07 < bridge> <louis> try:
12:07 < bridge> <louis>   stuff
12:07 < bridge> <louis> except:
12:07 < bridge> <louis>   pass
12:07 < bridge> <louis> 
12:07 < bridge> <louis> üòÅ
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so u can probably better accept a collision but make sure to not go out of bounds somehow
12:07 < bridge> <cellegenrih> If I draw with a tile brush, the moment my mouse is unpressed, the action occours
12:07 < bridge> <AssassinTee> hodling on collisions might be a good approach, because colissions shouldn't be too likely when mapping with multiple people
12:07 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It also needs a transparent tile indicator, that you intend to edit there
12:07 < bridge> <AssassinTee> holding on collisions might be a good approach, because colissions shouldn't be too likely when mapping with multiple people
12:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> wait for server response, then if it's not compromised, you have successfully painted it.
12:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> if it's indeed compromised, you have to edit your action
12:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> if it's indeed compromised, you have to edit your action, then resend it
12:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> The action should not disappear, unless the user chooses it to, or the server accepted it
12:08 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I'd revert it for that client to the uncompromised state, he might need to redo some stuff, but this should only be the last seconds
12:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> @ryozuki Happy Birthday little one
12:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> We do have that Undo / redo action inside the client no?
12:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> similar to that I guess.
12:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> now that's even more complicated. not only does the server need to send a rejection, but the client somehow needs to hold potential future changes as well, trying to merge them
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is super hard xD
12:10 < bridge> <AssassinTee> exactly
12:10 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Yes, cuz each compromise will need to check all the possibilities on what to do, I know that
12:10 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It wasn't the factor however
12:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> realistically we can assume collisions are not _too_ likely. but additing a merge logic is really insane
12:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so the easiest realistic thing is to accept that one player might overwrite the other persons action
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if they are currently editing the exact same thing for whatever reason
12:12 < bridge> <AssassinTee> agreed
12:35 < bridge> <AssassinTee> Presses automap, all clients desync xD
12:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> imagine godot
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> stayline
12:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> how did valve get almost 1k concurrent player during a closed alpha test
12:50 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
13:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> who are they asking to play tests
13:04 < bridge> <cellegenrih> prob other companies, or maybe Valve is just that fucking massive lol

14:40 < bridge> <learath2> I think it's about time we implement some more spam detection, doesn't have to be extremely smart
14:41 < bridge> <learath2> I was playing tutorial a couple days ago, someone joined, spammed a couple swastikas, left. Absolutely no way for a moderator to moderate that, it has to be automated
14:42 < bridge> <cellegenrih> maybe filtering special characters could be a good start
14:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what are "special characters" here?
14:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @learath2 spam detection would probably benefit from connecting all the game servers üòõ
15:05 < bridge> <learath2> I was thinking something like a "cost" based approach. Each player would have some amount of credits. Each character would have a cost associated with it and you'd only have a certain amount of credits available, credits would be regenerated at some rate (up to a maximum). Repeated uses of any given character would have increased cost (Perhaps exponentially increasing in case of anything that belongs to unicode `S`, `P` or `M` category). Some char
15:06 < bridge> <learath2> Something that is on the edge of dumb and smart, yet cheap enough to calculate with not much memory or performance overhead
15:07 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I see, an effective, yet weird cost punish system
15:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> For starters, we can give each symbol a unique value based off of index value or something,
15:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds complicated enough that lazy spammers might get caught
15:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> then, read each symbol. for each symbol in the sent message, if the previous symbol was different, add those values together. otherwise, multiply those values
15:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> if someone is spamming the same symbols, they get insane amounts, resulting in a spam detection
15:10 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It's only effective against messages that only contain one symbol
15:32 < bridge> <learath2> And flexible enough that we can make it more annoying by messing around with the parameters
15:33 < bridge> <learath2> But I feel at the very least https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/745926398140612678/1245351615100096644 shouldn't be the experience people get
15:58 < bridge> <Iza> is it possible to put in multiple strings in the "exclude" filter from the server browser?
15:58 < bridge> <Iza> like "novice; solo"
15:58 < bridge> <Iza> like "novice; solo" (this doesnt work)
15:59 < bridge> <Iza> and also the "search" filter for that matter i guess
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> remove the space
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it works
16:00 < bridge> <Iza> oh thx
16:00 < bridge> <Iza> maybe this should be displayed as a tooltip
16:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can create an issue to trim the search strings i guess
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno when u ever want a space in front or end
16:02 < bridge> <Iza> idk i thought its normal to have space after ; since that's how you bind multiple things
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah technically u could argue the space must be gone, but for user friendliness i guess trimming makes sense here
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you are not the first to add a space here ^^
16:03 < bridge> <Iza> well should i create an issue?
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd do it
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so yes
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do it xd
16:03 < bridge> <Iza> üëç
16:08 < bridge> <learath2> fun-fact `crc32("gnu") == crc32("codding")` üòÑ
16:17 < bridge> <learath2> crc32 the old one 0x04C11DB7 poly
16:38 < bridge> <learath2> For crc32c I found `crc32c("cuke") == crc32c("nativeness")` and that's all in this dictionary for 176k english words
16:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what are you doing? ^^
16:39 < bridge> <louis> what abt every time you add a semicolon it just creates a lil box around the previous word
16:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or confetti
16:40 < bridge> <louis> :justatest:
16:46 < bridge> <learath2> I've also learned some weird things I've never heard of before, like w-shingling and Jaccard coefficient
19:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> who added me to codecov newsletter xddd
19:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> @tsfreddie  gogo! new project UwU
19:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> @tsfreddie  gogo! new project UwU :owo:
19:17 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, I also got it, looks like everyone gets it regardless of mail settings because it's a legal notice
19:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i didnt even add my email anywhere xD
19:35 < bridge> <learath2> I didn't get one I think
20:13 < bridge> <egyt> What are quads and how should I translate them?
20:52 < bridge> <zhn> ye
21:08 < bridge> <scrumplex> Can I expect anyone here to be at GPN22 this weekend?
21:52 < bridge> <egyt> Other Slavic translations use "quads" too. Oh well.
22:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> didn't get such a mail
