12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> Would it be difficult to make the map editor's multi-layer-selection work on all parameters? (for example resizing or recoloring all selected layers the same way)
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think it would be very useful (not just because I have a map with 300+ layers that need resizing xd)
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ravie this would be quite complicated as not all layers have the same properties
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It might be possible to do if you only select one kind of layer
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Learath2 only tile layers of course, and if they have different sizes just set it to the same one
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let me take a look, if I see an easy way to implement it i'll give it a go
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Learath2 also like a button to set all smaller layer size to the biggest one
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Learath2 also like a button to set all smaller layer size the same value as the biggest one
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> or well yeah, resizing all layers at the same time with the cursor, but that means you'll have to clear all tiles that will be out of range
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @ReiTW we already have a way to select multiple layers, but resizing and recoloring doesn't work with it
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> dunno afteralll, it's been a long time I didn't touch to a latest ddnet version
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :noath:
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @onby no u
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ravie can you give this a try?
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Learath2 I need to compile or something?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ravie are you on windows?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> Yeah
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/runs/472518993
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It only has resizing for now
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can do color too without too much trouble
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ravie so, is it working?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> idk yet, I'm too stupid for github xD
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The last link I sent you is a link to the zip
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it directly downloads
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> hasn't downloaded anything for me
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what happens when you click it?
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Asks for a login
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ?
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> no
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, there is an artifacts button to the top right
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you can't see it I'll download it for you
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I don't really see anything clickable
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://learath2.info/ddnet-windows-latest.zip
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> doesn't seem to work, right clicking a layer deselects all other ones
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh you need to hold shift
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ah worked now, but it wants to scroll back to 1
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and map size 1x1 is not even a thing
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a test version, whatever number you set there will resize all layers selected
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it just defaults to 1 because I didn't know what to show
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe I can default to the largest of the layers
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> makes sense, typing a number in works :D
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you think largest of the layers is good?
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> as the default value?
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah, so people don't accidentally make some layer smaller and cut off some stuff
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> when you want to edit multiple layers and they are different sizes, idk what to default to
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> biggest layer seems most reasonable
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think most people would use it to crop all layers to the final map size, so the biggest layer is good
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Added color, added a warning
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There seems to be a bug with button ids, I'll take a look later
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have 1% charge ðŸ˜›
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Learath2 nice website
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not supposed to have anything on it anyway
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> why paying a .info then
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's pretty darn cheap to get an info
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> why not getting a .tk then
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> or a .ml
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> or one of those free domains
