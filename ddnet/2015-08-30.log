00:10 <@deen> ok, he has a 5.8 KiB/s line
00:13 <@deen> just not enough i guess
01:14 < WolfAlex> deen: are you there?
01:15 <@deen> hi
01:15 < WolfAlex> deen: i've found a map from saavik, where he/she(?) used quads with only a part of the image
01:15 < WolfAlex> do you know how?
01:16 <@deen> based on the name, surely Lady Saavik is male :P
01:18 <@deen> WolfAlex: shift-leftmouse on red points of a quad i think
01:19 <@deen> but i've never mapped anything
01:20 < WolfAlex> deen: thx works!
01:44 < devnull> my bouncer died for the day
01:44 < devnull> did sth interesting happen?
01:46 <@deen> dunno, i just scanned it quickly, was afk all day
02:22 <@deen> any thoughts on putting the #ddnet irc logs online?
02:23 <@deen> devnull: http://ddnet.tw/2015-08-29.log
12:27 < devnull> thank you deen :)
13:19 <@deen> any complaints about putting all logs of this channel online?
13:32 < uchar> Oh! 0.7.0 has bots?
15:04 <@heinrich5991> uchar: more like 0.7 will mitigate the problem of people using bots to boost their server's player numbers
16:55 <@heinrich5991> deen: no problem, might want to put that into the topic though
17:05 < Chairn> http://i21.servimg.com/u/f21/11/55/83/62/screen10.jpg
17:07 <@EastByte> hehe, not bad
17:07 < Chairn> dunno if better to render all tee, or just eyes
17:08 < Learath2> eyes would look better imo
17:09 < Learath2> well maybe or maybe it'd look more stupid
17:14 <@deen> hope that's fine
17:14 <@deen> last day with an empty irc log was 2014-08-03, nice^^
17:15 <@heinrich5991> empty means no chat or not even join/leave?
17:16 < Chairn> join/leave are not appearing in
17:16 < Chairn> so just no chat ^^
17:17 <@deen> this is just my irssi-log, i think it's just chat, but i mostly use it for grepping
17:23 < Learath2> deen: i think the pullrequest is fine atleast on win7 but needs to be tested on linux and winxp
17:43 < Chairn> not really better
17:43 < Chairn> http://i21.servimg.com/u/f21/11/55/83/62/screen12.jpg
17:43 < Chairn> better with full tee ^^
17:47 <@deen> wow, 10k new people try out TW every day on steam
17:48 <@heinrich5991> where do you read that? :)
17:48 <@deen> https://steamdb.info/app/380840/graphs/
17:48 < Learath2> even people on my friendlist that arent involved with tw at all seem to be trying it
17:48 <@heinrich5991> and that probably means we have a very low retention rate
17:48 <@deen> didn't get any more players on ddnet =/
17:48 <@deen> but i get the feeling everyone wants ddnet gone from TW anyway
17:50 < Learath2> thats what the official devs want you to think but the thing it tw community was always a fraction of the ddrace community
17:51 <@deen> Learath2: not just the official devs, i got dozens of comments like that, and no one seems interested in getting DDNet on Steam
17:51 <@deen> so it seems like TW actually has a much bigger community
17:51 < Learath2> now sure they do they just got released on steam
17:51 <@deen> nah, also before
17:52 <@deen> they had WAY more support on Steam Greenlight
17:52 < Learath2> when the storm calms down and people who stay on tw figure out to lift the filter the balance will go back to the way it is
17:52 <@deen> Learath2: apparently they don't really stay, see 50k people having tried TW
17:53 <@deen> maybe some of them would've liked DDNet, who knows?
17:53 < Learath2> we'll never know that because of the stupid filter :D
17:55 < Learath2> well isnt it a fact that at any given time ddnet has more players in total then vanilla ?
17:56 <@deen> Learath2: ddnet 320 - vanilla 533, so no :P
17:56 < Learath2> deen: not now
17:57 < Learath2> 632 ingame on steam say half of them were non steam players before still ddnet had more players before the steam release
17:57 <@deen> doesn't matter
17:57 <@deen> we have 500 people who care enough to vote on steam, TW had 3000
17:58 < Learath2> well its more of a quality of community issue i guess
17:58 <@deen> Learath2: not sure how you mean that
17:59 < Learath2> well say before steam release it would have been ddnet 320 - vanilla 200 and at peak times way better ratios then that
18:00 < Learath2> how is it possible that the ratio is completely reversed on steam votes
18:00 <@deen> Learath2: EVERYONE knows TW, but most don't play actively, just once per week
18:00 < Learath2> imo only if the vanilla community cared more about getting tw released then the ddnet community on getting ddnet released
18:00 <@deen> the DDNet player base is more addicted, many play all day or at least daily
18:00 <@deen> but in general, nearly no one knows DDNet
18:00 <@deen> if you google for DDraceNetwork, you find nothing at all
18:01 < Learath2> I dont think we even got all the ddnet playerbase to vote for ddnet
18:01 <@deen> Learath2: i spammed it everywhere and on servers for days
18:01 <@deen> Learath2: and got insults everywhere for that :P
18:01 < Learath2> and still they didnt care thats what im trying to say
18:01 <@deen> sure they cared and voted
18:01 < Learath2> !ddnetpeak
18:01 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 424
18:01 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
18:01 <@deen> there's just faaaar fewer people even know DDNet
18:02 <@deen> and of those only maybe 10% have steam
18:03 <@deen> most people who've installed linux try out TW
18:03 < Learath2> thats true
18:03 < Learath2> well we need a way of getting more people on ddnet
18:03 <@deen> Learath2: yeah, getting ddnet into distributions/shops
18:04 <@deen> but the TW croud won't like that
18:04 <@deen> and I'm not interested in getting insulted all day
18:04 < Learath2> most of the tw crowd prolly isnt interested in the politics
18:07 <@deen> hi BeaR__!
18:08 < BeaR__> io
18:08 < Learath2> oi
18:09 < BeaR__> hm wondering how to hide my hostmask :d
18:09 < Learath2> register with q
18:09 < Learath2> and mask with +x
18:10 < BeaR__> I need to be registered?
18:10 < Learath2> yep
18:10 < Learath2> or you could be behind a bouncer
18:11 < BeaR__> thanks, will try out later :d
18:11 <@EastByte> or behind irssi or weechat
18:35 < Chairn> is there a way to know if client is on ddrace server?
18:46 <@deen> IsDDRace()
18:57 < Chairn> ty ^^
19:47 < Chairn> deen: to send a chat message for /emote, is it better to use CChat->say that prevents spamming(but add delay if you enter text just after)
19:48 < Chairn> or just CNetMsg_cl_say that can spam server
19:54 < Chairn> prediciton seems fucked on solo server when you're over another tee
19:55 < Chairn> is that new?
19:55 < BeaR__> oh tournament in 5min (:
19:56 < BeaR__> Chairn: indeed, not sure.
19:57 < Chairn> but it's the first time i notice it so, even rapture told me it wasnt like that before
19:58 < BeaR__> yeah, just see it on the tournament servers
19:58  * BeaR__ checks the commit history
20:03 < Chairn> !ddnetpeak
20:03 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 584
20:03 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
20:04 < Chairn> dat download spead 10kb/s...
20:05 < BeaR__> lel
20:05 < BeaR__> hm prediction seems to be ok now
20:13 < Chairn> yup, i guess there was a server setting
21:09 <@deen> yeah, my bad for the prediction server setting
21:10 <@EastByte> what setting?
21:12 <@deen> dunno why it happened^^
21:13 <@deen> maybe just should add the tunes for collision and hooking as well
21:13 < Nimda> Care for your Time by dcg√π just released on Solo at 2015-08-30 20:02
21:14 <@EastByte> kk
21:40 < Chairn> who's using git on windows?
21:44  * fstd_ points at Chairn and laughs
21:45 < Chairn> i have a really weird bug :D
21:45 < Chairn> https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/329
21:45 < fstd_> yeah you just said that
21:47 < fstd_> well, too bad one cannot properly analyze such problems in windows
21:47 < fstd_> a system call trace would probably shed light on the source of the problem
21:49 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Chairn opened pull request #317: Added eye wheel. Render only on ddrace/race/ictf+/dm+/gctf+ server. (master...eye_wheel) http://git.io/vGlBS
22:12 < Learath2> deen: ill be off for like 3-4 days you can merge it after you test it with linux and winxp
