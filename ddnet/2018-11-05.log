00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <freedom> who are programmer, ask in pm please, i have a deal
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> lol what deal, ddos type deal? there is already vali for that :monkaS:
05:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander_> dont know why i posted the screenshot in developer channel
05:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander_> i often dont look at the channel name
07:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Alexander_ nice to see a full server üòÉ
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> I was better the score players bug by dummy

12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They block irc but not discord in my school network...
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> Because irc is for hackers :0

17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> how many degrees can it take to blow up entirely?
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> does any of you know how to use LOCPATH variable so that software can look for translation in the appropriate location?
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> I installed VLC with Nix on a system where i don't have root, but VLC doesn't look for translation in the  path indicated by LOCPATH
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i always get unsupported locale, falling back to "C" locale
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ô™‚ô´> Never used that, be sure the locale you wanna use is correctly generate "as : is listed in locale -a", if not you need to generate it ( locale.gen/locale-gen/locale.conf root needed i guess), if the one you wanna use is already listed in locale -a you should be able to overwrite the system locale per user via ~/.config/locale.conf ( need to relog for changes to take effect )
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ô™‚ô´> as "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" or any locale you want that is already generated
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ô™‚ô´> i guess you could export LANG too and it should works as long as the locale is generated
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <‚ô™‚ô´> using C isn't good as a ton of sofwares won't run, tmux for example
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> thx, i'll take a look at locale.conf tomorrow
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it's weird that setting up LOCPATH doesn't work and even mess with other software
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Thanks for the answer regarding the token stuff @Learath2 
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Are there any plans to migrate ddnet to the 0.6.5 token protocol? Right now connecting to 0.6.5 servers takes a long time due to the rate-limit =\
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I could do that. I thought @heinrich5991 already took care of that
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> He just fixed the ddnet servers to accept the 0.6.5 connections (https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/c7750f3616586d5b68aae0f328741c68f1e44042)
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can implement the new protocol, but I first need to actually read up on the changes as I don't really know the exact specification
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> üëç
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uhm, I think I'd rather not mess with this, it doesn't really fit well into our existing code :/
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyone here?
