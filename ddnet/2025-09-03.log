01:06 < bridge> <blazulite> can u do that for me pretty please,.,..,.,
01:08 < bridge> <kebscs> I mean like a real one with other changes, also with it you could add yourselves to credits too
01:09 < bridge> <blazulite> i mean that's why I asked u cuz u a real dev who can do something else than translating stuff unlike me :justatest:

13:21 < bridge> <kebscs> What do you guys use for website hosting?
13:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for static use github
13:22 < bridge> <kebscs> Something cheap for simple website
13:22 < bridge> <kebscs> I have a domain
13:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can link a domain to github
13:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can link a domain to github pages

13:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** sos @0xdeen
13:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i added crash bug to master which is included in release as of right now i think
13:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fix on the way
14:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** can someone explain me this line of code please?
14:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/4ee6a39405fa648d5f0a18e4d1ea8348093f0a9d/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L4057
14:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ``(pThis->m_aClients[i].m_pRconCmdToSend && str_comp(pResult->GetString(0), pThis->m_aClients[i].m_pRconCmdToSend->m_pName) >= 0))``
14:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** For context this is a check that happens when the permissions for rcon commands changed. So this check determines if the command info for a command such as "kick" is sent to a client or not
14:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** `m_pRconCmdToSend` points to a command info its a linked list and it is non null as long as a authed players is slowly receiving all commands
14:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** `str_comp` with `>= 0` alone is quite fancy
14:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** `@return `0` if string a is equal to string b.  `
14:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ``@return `> 0` if string a is greater than string b.  ``
14:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** why would it check for something other than strict comparison of the currently being sent command???????????????????????????????????????
14:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if it would check for equality i could assume what the code is doing. It might skip the send of the rcon command if it will be sent anyways.
14:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im pretty sure comands are alphabetically sorted
14:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but why does it also guard the removal then
14:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so this does nothing
14:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oh alphabetically sorted is interesting
14:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i highly doubt they are sorted tho
14:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you should check if it is
14:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this is an iirc
14:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** arent they just pushed into the linked list in the order they are registered in
14:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but yes good point if it was sorted then the code would make a little bit more sense
14:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
14:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 
14:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if(DoAdd)
14:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     AddCommandSorted(pCommand);
14:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
14:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> they are sorted
14:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> since `m_pRconCmdToSend` should be a command earlier in the list this is a no-op
14:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** `void CConsole::AddCommandSorted(CCommand *pCommand)`
14:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oho
14:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this is ran on register
14:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes!
14:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the behaviour may be weird for temp/server registered commands but that doesnt apply here
14:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you are right they are sorted
14:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> theres no way to get them unsorted as they are sorted on addition and you arent meant to edit them
14:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** > since m_pRconCmdToSend should be a command earlier in the list this is a no-op
14:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and theres nothing wrong with sending info out of alphabetical order, the client should sort them
14:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so the if statement guards the no-op right?
14:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** instead of being a no-op it self
14:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so the code makes sense right?
14:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im calling it a no-op cuz its always false
14:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the condition is always false?? wait wat
14:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** why
14:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> either there is no previosuly sent command or the previously sent command is earlier in the list
14:21 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** `m_pRconCmdToSend` is previous? im not sure?
14:21 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** isnt that future?
14:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if its future it would always be true
14:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh
14:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wait maybe its for number of command to send /tick
14:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and m_prconcmdtosend is lastsentprevious tick + 5
14:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and m_prconcmdtosend is lastsentprevious tick + sv_commands_per_tick
14:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats a weird way to do it tho
14:23 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** why is it always true then
14:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> did you miss msgs?
14:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
14:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if its future it would always be true
14:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh
14:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wait maybe its for number of command to send /tick
14:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and m_prconcmdtosend is lastsentprevious tick + 5
14:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and m_prconcmdtosend is lastsentprevious tick + sv_commands_per_tick 
14:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats a weird way to do it tho
14:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
14:24 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i saw the messages but they confused me
14:24 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so i responded only to the one that made sense to me xde
14:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the server sends a limited number of commands per tick
14:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> as to not ddos itself
14:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes
14:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe this is the mechanism to stop itself from sending more than what it wants
14:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> instead of a counter
14:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes
14:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wait no
14:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** my condition only ever sends 1 command
14:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** there is no ratelimit
14:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the rate limit is only on auth
14:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i assume it checks if the command was already sent or not
14:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but even if thats the case i dont get it
14:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** because the code it guards is a removal or add
14:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oh wait no it makes sense
14:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if it would remove it wont send
14:26 < bridge> <teero777> can i make my own size_t?
14:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if it would add it will add anyways
14:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** typedef unsigned int?
14:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** unsigned long i guess
14:27 < bridge> <teero777> well i guess
14:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or wdym
14:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> SvServerInfoPerSecond
14:27 < bridge> <robyt3> Why would you?
14:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes yes solly but thats a different part of the code
14:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thats the on auth sending
14:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i thought chat commands were sent at same rate
14:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** that for sure is horribly slow and furo once attempted to fix it but pr never got merged
14:28 < bridge> <teero777> i dont wanna include stddef xd
14:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but my code is not about chat commands
14:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or sending multiple
14:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its about sending one rcon add or remove
14:28 < bridge> <robyt3> Well, no, size_t is platform specific
14:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes then copy the typedef from stddef
14:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
14:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> const int ConsoleAccessLevel = Client.ConsoleAccessLevel();
14:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for(int i = 0; i < MAX_RCONCMD_SEND && Client.m_pRconCmdToSend; ++i)
14:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> {
14:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     SendRconCmdAdd(Client.m_pRconCmdToSend, ClientId);
14:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     Client.m_pRconCmdToSend = Client.m_pRconCmdToSend->NextCommandInfo(ConsoleAccessLevel, CFGFLAG_SERVER);
14:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     if(Client.m_pRconCmdToSend == nullptr)
14:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     {
14:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>         SendRconCmdGroupEnd(ClientId);
14:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     }
14:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> }
14:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
14:29 < bridge> <teero777> yy, ik but it's still just some macro magic right?
14:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that is a silly way to do it
14:30 < bridge> <robyt3> And different for every compiler probably
14:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes its horrible solly but thats not my concern right now
14:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> whats ur concern
14:30 < bridge> <teero777> i guess i have to live with stddef and math.h
14:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> -lsmh
14:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> -l*s*m**h
14:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> -l*s*m*h*
14:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @teero777 why give up
14:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fight the bloat
14:31 < bridge> <teero777> xD
14:31 < bridge> <teero777> i already have my own mem_zero
14:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** based
14:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** continue that route
14:32 < bridge> <teero777> and im not replacing the the math functions xD
14:32 < bridge> <robyt3> Why? Are you targeting some microcontroller?
14:32 < bridge> <teero777> that would quadruple my code size and be slower
14:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
14:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Client.m_SfxFallingWoosh = Sound()->PlayAt(CSounds::CHN_WORLD, SOUND_FALLING_WOOSH, 0, 1.0f, Client.m_RenderPos);
14:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
14:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sound falling woosh == 41, but the sample im looking for is in116
14:33 < bridge> <teero777> no, i just don't like the include directive
14:33 < bridge> <teero777> personal vendetta
14:33 < bridge> <robyt3> Append only programming :pepeW:
14:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> theres no 116 constant i can find
14:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because im looking for set 41
14:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> adoi
14:35 < bridge> <teero777> eyo don't put me in that shelf i only replaced the memset xD
14:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Then you are probably missing out on compiler optimizations
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> i do call __builtin_memset if it exists. it's barely used in some initialization functions so no worries.
14:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why are sounds and sets seperated into a component??
14:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why are sets seperated into a component??
14:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why is there a seperate Sounds() and m_Sounds in gameclient
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> ```cpp
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> static inline void mem_zero(void *ptr, size_t n) {
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> #if defined(__has_builtin)
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> #if __has_builtin(__builtin_memset)
14:40 < bridge> <teero777>   __builtin_memset(ptr, 0, n);
14:40 < bridge> <teero777>   return;
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> #endif
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> #endif
14:40 < bridge> <teero777>   unsigned char *p = (unsigned char *)ptr;

14:40 < bridge> <teero777> #define lcc__pzero(x) mem_zero((x), sizeof(*x))
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> ```
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> here it is if you wonder
14:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @teero777 do you target multiple architectures?
14:41 < bridge> <teero777> i don't know
14:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i can recommend musl its so easy to understand
14:42 < bridge> <robyt3> Engine sounds interface should not be aware of game details
14:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but ye size_t depends on the architecture
14:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sure but the sound component should be minimal
14:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> just handle loading and settings listener pos
14:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
14:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> // play sound from queue
14:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if(m_QueuePos > 0)
14:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> {
14:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     int64_t Now = time();
14:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     if(m_QueueWaitTime <= Now)
14:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     {
14:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>         Play(m_aQueue[0].m_Channel, m_aQueue[0].m_SetId, 1.0f);
14:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>         m_QueueWaitTime = Now + time_freq() * 3 / 10; // wait 300ms before playing the next one
14:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>         if(--m_QueuePos > 0)
14:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>             mem_move(m_aQueue, m_aQueue + 1, m_QueuePos * sizeof(QueueEntry));
14:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     }
14:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> }
14:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
14:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this is probably the cause of that demo bug
14:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> not rly a duplicate
14:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> since its in console
14:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but your explaiantion covers both, and its a wontfix mostly
14:46 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems minimal to me, there is nothing to remove
14:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you cannot play a set with flags because Sound() doesnt expose it
14:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont think m_Sound should wrap Sound()
14:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because both are accessable, Sound() is already used in client alot and set data is global and constant
14:48 < bridge> <robyt3> See also the comment in `CSounds::PlayAndRecord` regarding desynced sounds in demos
14:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i do not see usages either ill try clangd
14:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1412781187398762620/image.png?ex=68b98a83&is=68b83903&hm=f28d9381d52bbe6802541269b8253bc7283ae2484dd35bd8741aa23ea181e5fe&
14:48 < bridge> <robyt3> `m_Sounds`
14:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah
14:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why cant it be playsetat
14:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it could even be polymorphic and use enum classes
14:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> anyway changing all that is not what i wana do right now xd so ill just add flags to m_Sounds
14:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and it doesnt return voiceid
14:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> grr
14:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wait set data isnt constant
15:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
15:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> const auto Error = [](const char* pFormat, auto... Args) {

15:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
15:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i wana use a macrooo
15:39 < bridge> <robyt3> Don't

15:41 < bridge> <robyt3> Reminder that you have 6 stale PRs open :justatest:
15:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ermm
15:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh look im shiny again
15:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> atleast for this one im not blocking

15:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> lots of added info to netmsgs to be able to add it
15:43 < bridge> <robyt3> Most of those commits could be moved to a separate PR and merged quickly
15:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is the plan
15:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh
15:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for that
15:43 < bridge> <robyt3> The feature itself rather needs a discussion instead of a stale PR
15:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sure can do
15:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well its a needed feature
15:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its implementation needs discussion
15:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (cuz it required net changes)
15:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
15:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Sample.m_LoopStart = -1;
15:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Sample.m_LoopEnd = -1;
15:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
15:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> there was a pl;an to support fancy looping samples?
15:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but its unused and unimplemented
15:54 < bridge> <0xdeen> just get a single 30TB disk (and a backup somewhere of course)? That's my approach at least

18:29 < bridge> <patiga> if you want to encode to video, you now (not sure if it'll change) need to do --features ffmpeg when installing twgpu
18:29 < bridge> <patiga> I made ffmpeg optional because many people had trouble building with it
18:30 < bridge> <patiga> and twgpu-encode-demo now has two subcommands: `images` and `ffmpeg`
18:31 < bridge> <patiga> you can for instance just append ` ffmpeg` to your command to make it work (as long as you already built twgpu with the ffmpeg feature enabled)
18:32 < bridge> <patiga> @pathos3005 feel free to ping me whenever you have a twgpu question :)
18:33 < bridge> <patiga> hm, I agree that the order of arguments is a little weird, maybe it should indeed be the first argument
18:33 < bridge> <patiga> but then I'm not sure how it works with the parameters for the entire cli vs the parameters just for the subcommand
18:44 < bridge> <pathos3005> Oh I see, good to know
18:45 < bridge> <blazulite> HUH
18:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ddnet sound system is weird
18:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> have sorted it x-x

18:53 < bridge> <vahemaaa> is there any way to play DDNet on IOS
18:54 < bridge> <pathos3005> No

19:01 < bridge> <blazulite> oh gg
19:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @pathos3005 did you check if /usr/share/ddnet or /usr/share/games/ddnet exists?
19:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the apt ddnet package is really bad
19:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cant connect to most servers due to websockets not being turned on
19:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its basically a virus
19:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is that just cuz its old, and old fullscreen handling fucks up monitros
19:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `        if(WavpackGetTagItem(pContext, "loop_start", aBuf, sizeof(aBuf)) > 0)`
19:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> anyone know why this is segfaulting ):

19:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> as ddnet manually does the file reading i think my callback is a bit scuffed
19:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
19:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> WavpackStreamReader Callback = {0};
19:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Callback.read_bytes = ReadData;
19:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Callback.get_pos = GetPos;

19:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Callback.can_seek = []([[maybe_unused]] void *pId) { return 1; };
19:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
19:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i made set_pos_abs and set_pos_rel but theres no docs on how they work
19:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so i prsesume they are wrong and thtas why its segfaulting
19:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its a shame that an invalid input can segfault
19:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but its a harmless 0x0 segfault
19:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but its a harmless 0x0 read
19:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (by libwavpack not my code)

20:00 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't think meta data is useful. It's not readable in the repository. Licences should be in the text files.
20:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i am using tags for loop_start and loop_end
20:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> since those could change with a custom asset
20:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> hardcoding a loop start time or seperating it into a loop first bit, and loop the loopy bit file also is weird
20:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> hardcoding a loop start time or seperating it into a loop first bit, and loop the loopy bit file is weird
20:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> * hard coding

20:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> * seperate into loop start and loop files
20:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> are all other solutions, but are a bit wack
20:02 < bridge> <robyt3> We use an ancient version of wavpack 4.40 tiny encoder. Why do you need this data in the file at all?

20:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if files get moves around its nice if they had credit in them
20:03 < bridge> <robyt3> Nobody can read the meta data. That's what licence files are for.
20:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but thats not a strong opinion
20:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> mpv shows the author
20:04 < bridge> <blazulite> I MISREAD AS "FRIED"
20:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i did fry the buffer aswell
20:04 < bridge> <blazulite> My americanized ass:
20:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> fried the butter
20:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is using the meta for loop_start/end fine
20:05 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't see the point. Just loop the entire file.
20:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it doesnt work
20:06 < bridge> <robyt3> It should. Music is looped.
20:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this is for sfx
20:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> although music could use it too
20:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Same thing, just play the sound again when it stops

20:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i guess u can do the volume
20:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ?
20:08 < bridge> <robyt3> I recommend first opening an issue to discuss your use case for DDNet, otherwise this will probably become another stale PR
20:08 < bridge> <robyt3> We use a version of wavpack that is more than 15 years old
20:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dodnt need to update wavpack
20:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont need to update wavpack
20:09 < bridge> <robyt3> But it would have to be tested everywhere, and I don't see the use case yet
20:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its for a falling woosh sound
20:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or piano in ddnet
20:10 < bridge> <robyt3> That's a feature and needs an issue to discuss
20:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if you can stop sounds with a custom server you could...
20:11 < bridge> <robyt3> Then you might be solving the wrong problem. Let the server stop sounds instead.
20:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> theres a seperate issue about that, with this and that you can make a very good ddpiano
20:13 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> Hey @heinrich5991 I'm not sure if this is the correct way of talking to you about this issue, but on my custom server I've got a message saying to contact you on this discord. What's happening?
20:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> masterbanned ):
20:13 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> yeah but why :(
20:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u fake players
20:14 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> nope, why would i
20:14 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> this message appears on my server admin console
20:14 < bridge> <kebscs> <https://ddnet.org/rules/master/> did you do any of these
20:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> If the server requires account creation and login to play, the requires_login property must be set to true (refer to server.cpp).
20:15 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> I did not break any of these rules
20:15 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> i just checked
20:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> trust me bro
20:17 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> it does not require any kind of registration]
20:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> russian leaked

20:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> all russians i know put ) ] stuff at end
20:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD

20:18 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> US keyboard, yeah :D
20:18 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> i didn't know about that, i will check
20:18 < bridge> <blazulite> I mean splitting this in two different files (buildup.wv, loop.wv)
20:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats a bit yikes tho
20:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why deallocate and reallocate a voice
20:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i guess you could stitch it at load
20:19 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> i guess you are talking about master-bans.cfg? My server IP is not listed
20:20 < bridge> <patiga> https://ddnet.org/rules/master/ I meant on this site, might be the same list tho
20:20 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> my IP is not on that list either
20:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `Server names should be unique and should not impersonate or duplicate existing servers.`
20:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> "duplicate"?
20:20 < bridge> <patiga> then I recommend you to dm heinrich directly, he isn't in this chat rn
20:20 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> my server's IP is not on that list either
20:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> he sometimes answers dms
20:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> not pings here
20:22 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> "DDNet GER 1 - Lilac 24/7"
20:22 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> or
20:22 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> "DDNet GER1 - AiP-Gores 24/7"
20:22 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> 
20:22 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> shouldn't be duplicates of anything
20:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol
20:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> it is
20:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont put ddnet
20:22 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> but i don't have the official ddnet flag, so users would be able to differentiate, no?
20:22 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> but sure, i can change itt
20:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> its still trying to look like it
20:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> why dont u use a custom name
20:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> TeeRock
20:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
20:23 < bridge> <patiga> your server name has the exact format of official ddnet servers, that is a very probable ban reason
20:23 < bridge> <robyt3> You are not allowed to call it DDNet
20:24 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> Alright, I will change it. I assume I'll have to contact heinrich anyways?
20:25 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, not sure if anyone else handles master bans
20:35 < bridge> <Assa> I'd actually also need this for the recorder tiles in a later step
20:38 < bridge> <melon> DDNet is the name, DDRace is the gamemode
20:38 < bridge> <melon> Same thing with KoG.
20:38 < bridge> <melon> KoG is the name, Gores it the gamemode
20:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @essigautomat for  #10820 you realise this is audio not animation

20:38 < bridge> <bananenbr_t> ah right, thanks all!
20:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> DDrace*
20:39 < bridge> <patiga> well it is a ddnet server, I saw multiple servers also mentioning that in the server name somewhere
20:39 < bridge> <Assa> yes ofc, but audio would be the obvious next step
20:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> having stop start tiles for audio would make ddnet piano really good xd
20:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> having stop start tiles for audio would make ddnet piano possible in master
20:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> it's DDRace ü§ì

20:40 < bridge> <Assa> all client sided, but the server could detect it
20:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i agree with you, but sadly its not
20:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> the game mode i mean, not DDNet
20:41 < bridge> <Assa> ?
20:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> DDrace is DDrace
20:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> DDNet is DDNet
20:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i would like it to be DDRace, but its not, its DDrace
20:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> ok wait im gonna get some evidence for u
20:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> bazinga
20:42 < bridge> <melon> :ChooChoo:  I'm on my phone I typed it out quickly it's not that deep
20:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh right that is a joke
20:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thank you for clarifying

20:44 < bridge> <melon> Dumbesdepublik Reutschland?
20:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> i asked chiller about this 10 days ago
20:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> xd
20:45 < bridge> <patiga> DDRace is capitalized like that literally on the ddnet.org frontpage, I think both is okay ^^
20:45 < bridge> <Assa> idk what I should answer, the wall is no more
20:46 < bridge> <Assa> maybe deen thought the same way xD

20:46 < bridge> <patiga> > DDraceNetwork (DDNet) is an actively maintained version of DDRace [...]
20:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `DDraceNetwork (DDNet) is an actively maintained version of DDRace`
20:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the gamemode is DDrace when we can be asked
20:47 < bridge> <melon> I just..
20:47 < bridge> <melon> 
20:47 < bridge> <melon> It's not that deep :pepe_cry:
20:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well old DDRace is DDRace
20:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> new DDrace is DDrace
20:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i fixed it
20:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> it's DDRace. if it was said by The Deen then shall it be the truth
20:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> but he was not the first creator of ddrace
20:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> was it grayfox?
20:52 < bridge> <melon> 3DA
20:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> never heard of that person
20:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> must have vanished
20:56 < bridge> <learath2> Actually showed up on discord a couple years ago randomly üòÑ
20:57 < bridge> <learath2> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/682243181177208863
20:57 < bridge> <learath2> Got scared away by account stuff, classic
20:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> nice thanks
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> omg soreu is there
21:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> everyone asks where soreu is but nobody asks how soreu is
21:07 < bridge> <melon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1412876761922015282/Screenshot_20250903-210738.png?ex=68b9e386&is=68b89206&hm=e141e689417823b57a1f666105f74f2f6443e81411cd2ab9df7f738a025cec0b&
21:08 < bridge> <kollpotato> everyone wants accounts but no one implements accounts and instead rewrites everything in rust
21:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> is there at least 1  person except chiller who is against accounts
21:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> .
21:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:13 < bridge> <learath2> That's a rare collectible message. Should make it an nft
21:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> not ddnet nfts pls
21:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> unless
21:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> it covers ddnet costs
21:15 < bridge> <kollpotato> maybe with nfts we can afford to hire an account engineer xd
21:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @robyt3 maybe i do want to update the wavpack version, getting rid of all the defines would be nice and it avoid adding a new one for `WavpackGetTagItem`/`WavpackMetadata`
21:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> <https://hydrogenaudio.org/index.php/topic,51985.0.html>
21:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> hasnt been updated, theres no reason i cant add the new function names ontop of this
21:34 < bridge> <robyt3> Good look. Please fix some of your stale PR before opening more though. Upgrading would be good because the static variables for wavpack are a mess.

21:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no i silly billy
21:44 < bridge> <cellegenrih> No wonder the game feels so cooked recently
21:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Why is he against accounts? Does he have like some magical reason for avoiding basic security?
21:46 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @jao187 wait, actual jao? pog
21:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> If you all wanna argue about accounts, IKU made a wonderful room, full of critisicm and the worst take from all people, right here:
21:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/1263223077077254165
21:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ngl even if I tried, Heinrich wouldn't say the F word to me, he would just straight up ban me lmfao üíÄ
21:48 < bridge> <manikoo> sure
21:48 < bridge> <manikoo> at least me
21:49 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I know I should just go to https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/1263223077077254165, however... decisions for a guaranteed take on developing accounts should need some sort of poll from all communities involved with account implementation
21:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And I think having https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/1412075332944531568 as a startup could bring those communities closer for a more mature, private argument
21:51 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Unless there's a better idea for a final decision, please do mention it
21:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @robyt3 <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6570>
21:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why is it an issue to destroy the window
21:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is it because destroying the window takes time (asserts take ages)
21:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the linked issue was closed with a "find a better workaround plz"
21:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> giving a window to a modal parents it to that window
21:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk what "parent" means
21:58 < bridge> <chairn> pin it üòÑ
22:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i am told it means that movement is relative to the parent and the child is ontop and the child dies with the parent
22:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> despite what the issue says, dwm handles it perfectly fine
22:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> nvm it does not
22:03 < bridge> <robyt3> I think it breaks entirely if you open a modal popup while not in windowed mode, i.e. you can't see or close the popup message
22:03 < bridge> <robyt3> I think it breaks entirely if you open a modal popup while not in windowed mode, i.e. you can't see or close the popup message if modal based on a window
22:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the child window goes behind the parent if refocused, which a new window would activate
22:04 < bridge> <robyt3> Test in all 5 fullscreen modes and 5 platforms :justatest:
22:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> do they all even exist on all platforms?
22:05 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, popup messages work on all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, Emscripten)
22:05 < bridge> <kebscs> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/actions/runs/17444049043/job/49533903761?pr=10819>
22:05 < bridge> <kebscs> flaky test?
22:05 < bridge> <kebscs> dont think theres anything in the integration test related to my pr
22:09 < bridge> <robyt3> Possible, maybe it's too slow with Valgrind
22:09 < bridge> <robyt3> I'll rerun, feel free to open an issue if it doesn't fail now
22:09 < bridge> <kebscs> alright
22:09 < bridge> <kebscs> this is 2nd time it failed
22:09 < bridge> <kebscs> before force push same thing
22:10 < bridge> <Ewan> window inheritance is definitely a thing and that's how modal dialogs work
22:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sigh, all video mdoes are already broken
22:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sdl3 does away with a lot of the fullscreen concepts we used to have
22:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also on x11 atleast a crashed window is super ugly cuz it doesnt repaint
22:11 < bridge> <robyt3> I forgot to mention, you also need to test with Vulkan, OpenGL 3 and OpenGL 1...
22:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i doubt theres much difference there
22:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because the window will never be repainted
22:11 < bridge> <robyt3> So just 75 combinations :pepeW:
22:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont have a macos
22:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or a windows
22:12 < bridge> <kebscs> can setup vm for both
22:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> not on this machine
22:13 < bridge> <robyt3> TBF, I don't expect you to fix the SDL3 PR soon, it needs a lot more thinking which gets delayed further by every other PR being opened
22:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I meant all five fullscreen modes
22:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> fullscreen modes are a scam
22:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if the wm supports parenting fully it should work minus old windows exclusive fullscreen
22:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and even then a child may kick it of exclusive fullscreen
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> I think it only works with all because we destroy the window, otherwise it caused issues like the popup not being interactable/visible
22:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well the popup would draw on the window then be moved behind it
22:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im keeping it as is for now
22:20 < bridge> <Ewan> lie
22:47 < bridge> <robyt3> Why did you remove the cleanup commits from this PR? Or are you going to PR them separately?
22:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> they already are merged
22:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Oh, makes sense :kek:
