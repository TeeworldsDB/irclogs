01:53 < bridge> <__bauxite__> Hello thanks for the reply, so being quite new to Linux I'm still learning a lot on how to do stuff. My vps provider gave me some info, something about a UDP Flood, most of the ports were closed from the provider firewall so they are targetting the game port I believe. Game is UDP based, the TCP port is  just for RCON. I'm not sure how to analyse the attack, I suppose I just run `tcpdump -w attack.pcap`? The few IPs they sent me traced back to 
01:53 < bridge> <__bauxite__> 
01:53 < bridge> <__bauxite__> Lately we can barely play the game on the few publicly visible servers we have, as they get attacked immediately, for a small game like ours that essentially kills the game.
01:53 < bridge> <__bauxite__> 
01:53 < bridge> <__bauxite__> I'm looking to setup a server specifically designed to analyse the attack, and then hopefully we can see if we can actually mitigate it by buying more powerful machines and so on. Although I'm unsure right now how to go about doing all this, but I'm making progress I guess as some helpful people point me in the right direction.

08:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well to be fair. ddnet tried a lot of things and it is still massively ddosed.
08:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
08:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> our GER10 have a custom ddos filter that works with whitelisting beforehand using http, and still if it's ddosed enough it's unplayable.
08:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
08:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Guess the best you can do if you have a small community is have 1 server that acts as proxy, public visible for new users -> this server will get ddosed. then one server that acts as proxy, but is not in the server list, where players can connect that you trust. <- and either this server is also the real gameplay server, or you make a third server that is the actual game play server.
08:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
08:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or simply don't open it to the public.
08:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
08:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also since it's a source engine game, maybe steam offers some protection?
09:25 < bridge> <raionheart.eu> Hi Guys. I took a look in the files on github, and i'm a little curious. I wanted to see if i could somehow add a "foe" list like the friend list we have. So i search into the file and find the "friend.cpp". But since i didn't learn C AND i'm not really experienced .. I don't think i will able to add what i want. But for curiosity, in wich file the game load the score tab ? I was searching for, telling me i would found something where you can
09:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> scoreboard.cpp i guess
09:34 < bridge> <raionheart.eu> Okay. I feel stupid.. Should just have tried to search it from the search box. Thanks
10:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok I might google it if you say it‚Äôs easy
11:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hi+
11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> good friday
11:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> nah its bad
11:14 < bridge> <reitw> `tcpdump -w attack.pcap udp and dst port <yourport>`
11:14 < bridge> <reitw> so you filter only on ur gameport
11:14 < bridge> <reitw> during the attack
13:06 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I just slept half an hour at workj
13:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> wait
13:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 40-45 min actually i think :o
13:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'm also extremely tired today xd
13:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not tired
13:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> drink more water
13:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> and maybe go to || gym || and then code in || rust ||
13:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> dude
13:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> these spoilers made me really angry
13:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> especially the second one
13:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> !!! xD
13:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> woke up with numb arms
13:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> because of he way i was laying
13:25 < bridge> <fokkonaut> anyways, time for a cigarette
13:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
13:31 < bridge> <cyberfighter> my ddnet crashed but no dump happened and when i try to open it again nothing happens
13:32 < bridge> <cyberfighter> Nvm they just do this wut

13:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> "laying" aka sitting
13:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I woke up perfectly so that my workmate did not notice anything haha
13:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> he was having lunch break which I don't do today cuz I leave early
13:42 < bridge> <cyberfighter> ok uhm roblox seems to make ddnet stop working if its in fullscreen
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Cool
14:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'm really happy that other apps influence ddnet so much
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If ddnet.isopen do shit
14:05 < bridge> <cyberfighter> ive noticed
14:54 < bridge> <learath2> I am about to go crazy. Why won't TSA say through which path it thinks I'm holding the lock and calling this function
15:06 < bridge> <__bauxite__> Valve has their SDR network that was probably created as a result of these DDOS attacks on their games and pro tournaments, unsure if we can utilize it somehow, I think I saw something in Deen's post about Valve offering to help.
15:07 < bridge> <learath2> Truly the stupidest piece of compiler aid ever offered, you need to annotate everything, it doesn't try proving anything

15:08 < bridge> <0nathan47> hi i want to play last ddnet version on my phone
15:08 < bridge> <0nathan47> if somebody can help me to compile it
15:08 < bridge> <0nathan47> idk how to do
15:08 < bridge> <0nathan47> (ik its hard asf to play on phone)
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 was about to say the keyword but i dont want u to hate me

15:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> # rust
15:11 < bridge> <learath2> Does Rust's fearless concurrency even include any static thread safety analysis? Or does the type system guarantee it in a way I'm not thinking of right now?
15:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> safe rust prevents data races but not race conditions
15:11 < bridge> <0nathan47> hey
15:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> (hope i got it right and not the other way around)
15:11 < bridge> <0nathan47> you skipped me
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah without experience no chance, sry
15:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> without compiling experience
15:11 < bridge> <0nathan47> who i can ask ?
15:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> but the unique mutability of rust references holds big part  in that
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chatgpt, google
15:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno
15:12 < bridge> <learath2> TSA does something different, it makes sure you are holding a capability before accessing anything guarded by that capabilty
15:12 < bridge> <0nathan47> oooh i forgot chatgpt exist ty
15:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> what is a capability  here?
15:12 < bridge> <0nathan47> @fokkonaut maybe i can help me :brownbear:
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/scripts/android
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> these are the build scripts, but without knowledge and local modifications it wont work
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> because they are not up to date
15:13 < bridge> <0nathan47> ty
15:14 < bridge> <0nathan47> @fokkonaut maybe u can help me :brownbear:
15:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Hello. I wanted to ask a question. I dont have much money and Ive seen people run doom on pregnancy tests, so where can i download a ddnet version for pregnancy test.
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> isn't that simply any lock?
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or does it do anything useful further than this xd
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ?
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how drunk are u?
15:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> üò¨
15:19 < bridge> <0nathan47> xDDDD  i thought my english is bad but its not my english its really what i expected xDDD
15:20 < bridge> <learath2> TSA makes sure of it statically
15:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but how does rust not do that xd
15:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> without mutability u cant do lot in rust
15:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and for mutability in threaded context u need a lock
15:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or atomic
15:21 < bridge> <learath2> I guess it kinda does by having mutexes contain what they guard
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah yeah
15:22 < bridge> <learath2> But it's not simply a function of any lock in any programming language. Locks are runtime
15:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i already forgot that isnt the case in cpp xD
15:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im not drunk at all https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1gcoyo5Ssk
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok then go
15:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> go where?
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> let's go
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> compile ddnet
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> on toaster
15:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> nono, im asking U how to do it
15:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks when use io_uring
15:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> and require latest kernel
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is it stable and no security problem anymore? xd
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think yes xd

15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 someone at work mentioned they used to work with this lol
15:49 < bridge> <learath2> Ah it's `localtime` used in `str_timestamp_ex` can't do that, it's not threadsafe
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> is there some localtime_s?
15:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:50 < bridge> <learath2> There is but it's not guaranteed to exist <a:Cool:706933917332275252>
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> (since C11)
15:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/chrono/localtime
15:51 < bridge> <learath2> It's optional since C11 because it's part of Annex K
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> ‚òùÔ∏è ü§ì
15:52 < bridge> <learath2> Are we C++20 yet? If so we can use the new timezone stuff
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> no cuz macos
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> we should drop macos <14 support
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not because of macos, but we should still drop it
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
16:04 < bridge> <learath2> No one really implemented Annex K functions anyway
16:07 < bridge> <learath2> I guess POSIX has localtime_r much earlier than C23
16:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 so u simply cant get localtime in a mt context?
16:10 < bridge> <learath2> Not from multiple threads
16:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> üíÄ
16:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @learath2 where are we ever reading the localtime in a thread?
