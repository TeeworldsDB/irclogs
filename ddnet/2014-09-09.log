00:00 < laxa> same as payment via maim
00:00 <@deen> Thank you laxa
00:00 < laxa> the only way it's free
00:00 < laxa> is if you use your paypal wallet
00:00 < laxa> but I never keep my money on it :)
00:00 < laxa> deen: your welcome, you deserve it :).
00:04 <@deen> laxa: what happens if you go here?: https://www.paypal.com/myaccount/transfer/send

00:04 < laxa> fuck
00:05 < laxa> I only see before commission deen.
00:05 <@deen> what does that mean?
00:05 < laxa> well, before the fees are processed
00:15 <@deen> Woah, these Novice maps get played a lot
00:15 <@deen> houll was released 10 days ago
00:15 <@deen> actually 9
00:15 <@deen> and has 1600 finishes by 1144 people
00:15 <@deen> crazy
00:20 < laxa> deen: can you explain to me, why this is blocked in germany ?

00:20 <@deen> because it has music
00:20 < laxa> WTF
00:20 < laxa> IS THIS 
00:20 < laxa> COUNTRY ?
00:20 <@deen> all music is forbidden since Nazi Germany
00:21 <@deen> (or something like that)
00:21 < laxa> You can't listen music on youtube ?
00:21 <@deen> i think so?
00:21 <@deen> i never tried
00:21 < laxa> Lol
00:21 < laxa> Where do you listen music then ?
00:21 <@deen> on my computer
00:22 < laxa> yeah I could have guessed that. But do you listen some from the internet ?
00:22 <@deen> no
00:22 < laxa> Wtf, ok !
00:22 < laxa> So you download your musics ?
00:22 <@deen> long ago
00:23 < laxa> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_of_YouTube_videos_in_Germany
00:24 <@deen> I'm proud of you, laxa, you've learned to google!
00:24 < laxa> Fuck you xD.
00:24 < laxa> I am just lazy
00:25 <@deen> but that page says circumvention is pretty easy
00:25 <@deen> sounds like you can just pretend to be a proxy for an American and you will get all music videos
00:25 <@deen> i guess that's what people do then
00:26 <@deen> kimsufi is really slow
00:26 <@deen> haven't heard anything from them
00:28 <@deen> Any opinions about the Kobra 3 design?: http://ddnet.tw/kobra3.png
00:28 < laxa> isn't it the same as previous lol ?.
00:28 <@deen> ...
00:29 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/ranks/maps/Kobra.png
00:29 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/ranks/maps/Kobra_2.png
00:29 <@deen> The background shape gets rounder every time^^
00:31 <@deen> and logo gets bigger
00:34 <@deen> first time i stole the background instead of making it myself
00:34 < laxa> woots, kobra is by you ?
00:34 <@deen> no, only the design
00:34 < laxa> oh ok
00:34 <@deen> but zerodin makes the parts
00:34 < laxa> anyway, most "proes" play with entitie
00:35 <@deen> because i didn't like his design and thought the map would surely become popular
00:35 <@deen> back then I was complaining that Novice maps were all too short
00:35 <@deen> so I forced Zeroding to make a really long one
00:41 < laxa> deen: last release from today not on  website
00:41 < laxa> not on release section at least
00:41 <@deen> last release?
00:41 <@deen> oh, weird
00:41 < laxa> map by Elite and Kayumi
00:42 <@deen> now it is haha
00:42 <@deen> (i didn't do anything)
00:42 < laxa> oh my bad
00:42 < laxa> it was a cached page
00:42 < laxa> so bad you can't disable caching on chrome :(
00:42 <@deen> I think you can
00:43 < laxa> afaik, you can only do that in developers mode
00:43 <@deen> set the max cache time for a website
00:43 <@deen> no, i mean the website owner can set it
00:43 <@deen> for each site
00:43 < laxa> oh
00:43 < laxa> Did you saw the map from kayumi ?
00:43 < laxa> Kaylite 
00:43 <@deen> no
00:43 < laxa> Well
00:44 < laxa> I can tell you
00:44 < laxa> I am quite unhappy about it ^^
00:44 < laxa> There are useless parts
00:44 <@deen> when i look at a map i write in forum or release it immediately
00:44 < laxa> where you are dragged by drag-laser for 30 seconds being deepfreeze
00:44 < laxa> it's quite useless...
00:45 < laxa> Well, play it, you'll maybe understand :)
00:45 <@deen> testing maps takes so long =/
00:53 < laxa> deen: I have found a good tutorial, maybe you'll like it !

00:57 < laxa> well, on this nice video, I go to bed ! Cya all.
01:00 <@deen> bye laxa
01:00 <@deen> ah, someone German tried and they could pay without any fees!
01:00 <@deen> 1 € more!
01:01 < laxa> He must have had money on his wallet
01:01 < laxa> that's whyt
01:01 <@deen> or using a banking account instead of credit card
01:01 <@deen> also works
01:02 < bor> i don't have paypal :| i can't get one either 
01:03 < bor> about some videos blocked in germany , the whole youtube website is blocked in iran 
01:03 <@deen> bor: yeah, i know =/
01:04 < bor> but that doesn't mean we don't watch the videos :P
01:04 < bor> if you needed a proxy i can give you one from UK
01:05 <@deen> I could use all the ddnet servers as proxies :P
01:05 <@deen> but i don't need one
01:06 <@deen> OpenFNG running
01:06 < bor> niCe
01:06 <@deen> it's the config by the south africans, i don't know what they set^^
01:09 < bor> seems good 
01:10 < bor> persian pro is back , our user count is back to 0 :|
01:16 < bor> one of main reasons players play on persian pro is because of /r command
01:17 <@deen> yeah
01:17 <@deen> but /r is a cheat, for noobs
01:17 < bor> if you could replace one of novice servers with a non-ranked (or locally ranked) server with easier rules and less restrictions we may get some users
01:17 < bor> people don't born pro , they need someplace to practice 
01:17 <@deen> but then it's just the same as Persian Pro
01:18 <@deen> I never played with /r
01:18 < bor> and its frustrating to practice some place where you need to start over of you mess up 
01:18 <@deen> I think you stay bad if you always play with /r
01:18 <@deen> In good maps your partner can help you when you fail
01:18 <@deen> so it's teamwork
01:18 < bor> thats when you have a pro partner , they use /r when all 3 of them get stuck 
01:19 <@deen> i watched many noobs play on DDNet
01:19 <@deen> and they do quite well without /r
01:19 <@deen> i think it's not necessary
01:19 <@deen> they take a few days, and ragequit, but they always come back and try again
01:19 <@deen> it's more fun with more risk
01:21 < bor> you know better , i was just saying this is a way to get some users , its not really useful to have a lot of empty servers
01:21 <@deen> I know =/
01:22 <@deen> Also, it would create confusion. They finish their map there, and get no points
01:22 <@deen> I think DDNet should stay clean of /r, even if it would bring more players =/
01:22 < bor> you should put something like not-ranked practice server in the name
01:23 <@deen> We had that before
01:23 <@deen> in Iran, actually
01:23 <@deen> and it wasn't popular at all
01:24 <@deen> i think the main reason players play on Persian Pro is because they used to play there for weeks or months
01:24 <@deen> It was similar in Europe, where everyone used to play on DDracemaX because they were older
01:25 < bor> it could be but people i know which was at our teamspeak was convinced by me to try our servers they went back to pro as soon as they found out there is ro /r , also they complained about lack of bugs :|
01:25 <@deen> lack of bugs?^^
01:25 < bor> yea like you dissapear when you pause in pro
01:26 < bor> which could be used to cheat in some specific situations
01:26 <@deen> yeah, that makes so many maps cheatable
01:26 < bor> also in kobra2 i was able to get back inside map in pro servers after i finished , and i had all weapons and infinite jump
01:27 <@deen> how?
01:27 < bor> you need to go very fast to a jetpack solo part and it kind of lags and you get pass the 1 layer block
01:27 <@deen> same works in DDNet
01:27 <@deen> i always do that
01:28 <@deen> Hm, yeah
01:29 <@deen> Actually evil_saeid wanted to work together with me to make Persian Pro DDNet
01:29 <@deen> but we disagreed about /r and disappearing /pause, which is why we didn't do it
01:31 < bor> maybe we should make some tutorial videos of ddnet in persian and put them at aparat
01:31 < bor> (aparat is kind of persian youtube)
01:31 < bor> that could bring in some users
01:43 <@deen> yes, that worked well in Chile^^
01:43 <@deen> Noone knew about Teeworlds in Chile, then a well known live streamer played the game 2 times and now the servers are full
01:52 < bor> except that i have 0 videos on aparant , not really a well known streamer :P
01:53 < bor> anyway its 4am here now , i'm going to sleep  , tomorrow i'll search aparat to see if any of streamers that publish videos about games are intrested in co oporating with us 
01:53 < bor> bye
01:54 <@deen> good night

12:22 < laxa_work> ?
12:23 < laxa_work> Savander: what's wrong ?
12:27 < Savander> because
12:27 < Savander> Witaj == Hello
12:27 < Savander> and Hello = Bonjour
12:27 < Savander> but Hello != Dzien Dobry
12:27 < Savander> Dzien dobry = Good morning
12:27 < Savander> weird ;x;x
13:31 < laxa_work> You are translating to french, I see nothing wrong on those translations...
13:53 <@deen> laxa_work: no response from kimsufi!
14:01 < laxa_work> If I remember, the delay should be about 1 week, I heard that from someone one day.
14:02 <@deen> meh
14:02 <@deen> well, Kobra 3 will be delayed anyway, because Zerodin is sick
14:02 < laxa_work> kobra 3 = next tournament ?
14:02 < Savander> deen: 
14:02 < Savander> someone ddosing?
14:02 < Savander> we all have 180+ ing
14:02 < Savander> ping
14:03 <@deen> high ping does not mean ddos
14:03 < Savander> on ger
14:03 <@deen> it's just a routing issue
14:03 <@deen> we get them quite often now
14:03 <@deen> should be fixed in a few minutes
14:03 < Savander> laxa_work: , i see 
14:03 < Savander> wrong
14:03 < Savander> dzien dobry == bonjour but
14:03 < Savander> witaj not.
14:04 < Savander> hello == witaj and hello == bonjour

14:19 < laxa_work> deen: you took a KS-2 >
14:27 <@deen> no
14:27 <@deen> KS-4
14:27 <@deen> KS-2 would be way too weak for a tournament
14:34 < Savander> wow
14:34 < Savander> kimsufi?
14:34 <@deen> yes
14:41 < laxa_work> wow really
14:41 <@deen> what?
14:41 < laxa_work> 20 euros / moth :x
14:41 < laxa_work> + taxes
14:41 <@deen> 24 €
14:41 < laxa_work> you are a lucky man with your vps in germany ^^
14:41 <@deen> Yeah
14:42 < laxa_work> I guess it's only about luck...
14:42 <@deen> I found a few other ddos protected servers
14:42 <@deen> but they're expensive and have high ping
14:42 < laxa_work> and your KS-4 is going to be at Toulouse right ?
14:42 <@deen> http://eterhost.net/ http://blazingfast.io http://www-kms-hosting.com/rootserver
14:42 <@deen> I don't know where the kimsufi will be...
14:42 < laxa_work> Could you link me the VPS you are suppose to have in GER ?
14:43 < laxa_work> Beh ok
14:43 < laxa_work> Why you choosed Kimsufi over Online then ?
14:43 <@deen> The hoster no longer hosts VPS at all: http://datafabrik.de
14:43 <@deen> * http://www.kms-hosting.com/rootserver
14:44 <@deen> Maybe I should bug him again about the ddos protection
14:44 < laxa_work> I think
14:44 < laxa_work> You should already be fucking happy
14:44 < laxa_work> to have a server that powerfull
14:44 <@deen> but he said he would tell me once it's setup
14:44 < laxa_work> for 10 euros / month xD
14:44 <@deen> Yeah, I am, which is also why i don't want to switch
14:45 <@deen> the same kind of server elsewhere costs 120 € / month
14:45 < laxa_work> and why you choosed kimsufi and not online.net ?
14:45 <@deen> Kimsufi has the chance to be in Strasbourg and it's cheaper and I trust OVH a bit more
14:46 < laxa_work> Ger server is ROOT1G at kms-hosting ?
14:48 <@deen> Huh?
14:49 <@deen> GER is @ datafabrik.de
14:49 <@deen> and not available anymore
14:49 < laxa_work> servers run on Debian ?
14:49 <@deen> yes
14:50 <@deen> all the ddos protected servers are so laggy
14:50 <@deen> ping jumps around all the time for me
15:06 < laxa_work> Have you found the exploit of Meskalin finally ?
15:40 <@deen> He wanted to show me the exploit
15:41 <@deen> but his client crashed when he tried
15:54 < laxa_work> So finally he is not such a bad guy.
15:54 <@deen> well, he is very weird
15:55 < laxa_work> You are a bit weird too :p
15:55 < laxa_work> I guess everyone is in some ways
17:04 < Savander> deen: 
17:04 < Savander> how it's possible
17:04 < Savander> 3 players with same name?
17:04 < Savander> PHO
17:04 < Savander> XPOHOC
17:04 <@deen> Savander: there are similar looking characters in other languages
17:04 <@deen> like the latin e and cyrillic e
17:04 < Savander> lol.
17:05 <@deen> which is why vanilla now only allows ascii characters in names
17:07 < laxa_work> I think it's better !
18:13 < laxa> deen: question !
18:13 <@deen> answer?
18:13 < laxa> could you add last finishes on player profile page on ddnet website ? :)
18:14 <@deen> theoretically yes
18:14 < laxa> but no !
18:14 <@deen> but i thought it would take too many resouces
18:14 < laxa> you already have the list of finishs
18:14 <@deen> but not the last finishes
18:14 < laxa> you don't need to do another sql request do you ?
18:14 <@deen> i would need to do another sql request for every single player
18:14 < laxa> well, can't you calculate the last finishes with that list ?
18:14 <@deen> no
18:15 <@deen> i only get the best finish
18:15 <@deen> not the most recent one
18:15 < laxa> Ah, right
18:15 <@deen> afk, i think i will make it later though
18:15 < laxa> ok thanks man
18:16 <@deen> I'll just do it dynamically
18:16 <@deen> because the players page is already 50% dynamic
18:17 < laxa> I don't understand what you mean :)
18:19 < laxa> does it means that each time a page is loaded you make a new request ?
18:24 < laxa> 41.185.60.23 isn't it an old DDNet IP from Africa ?
18:46 <@deen> what?
18:46 <@deen> why?
18:46 <@deen> maybe it is
18:49 <@deen> Hm, that request is pretty expensive
18:49 <@deen> 0.2 seconds per player
18:51 <@deen> right now the requests for /players/foo take about 0.03 s
18:53 <@deen> Woah, actually a lot of people are using /players
18:53 <@deen> about 1 person every 20 seconds
19:08 < laxa> ./players ?!
19:09 < laxa> oh ok
19:09 < laxa> I thought website wasn't used :p
19:09 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/players/laxa/
19:09 <@deen> Fine like this?
19:10 < laxa> put it on the right of rank & favorite server
19:10 < laxa> same size for ranks as text of points etc
19:10 < laxa> and it's good :p
19:22 <@deen> done
19:30 < laxa> make it 10 finishers :p
19:30 < laxa> and then it's perfect !
19:30 <@deen> you said same size !
19:31 < laxa> size of the text
19:31 < laxa> yeah, I badly said it
19:31 <@deen> here you go
19:31 < laxa> Thanks !
19:32 <@deen> I wanted the flags on ddnet.tw/ranks
19:32 <@deen> but it looks weird to have 100 GER flags on the site
19:35 < laxa> deen: so, each time you load /players, a sql request is made ?
19:35 <@deen> yes
19:35 < laxa> ranks are also dynamic ?
19:35 <@deen> no
19:36 < laxa> you said 50% is dynamic
19:36 < laxa> so I guess only ranks are static
19:36 < laxa> or maybe points are too...
19:37 <@deen> ehm, no
19:37 <@deen> every 20 minutes the statistics are recalculated
19:37 <@deen> but the html is dynamically created
19:37 <@deen> because creating it statically made the servers lag
19:49 <@deen> Servers never like high disk IO
19:49 <@deen> still have to find out whether that has anything to do with ddnet server writing log files to disk without an extra thread
19:50 <@deen> i should try to add a thread
19:56 < Savander> WHAT?
19:56 < Savander> http://ddnet.tw/players/Savander/   http://ddnet.tw/players/savander/
20:03 <@deen> so?
20:04 <@deen> There is a little savander too
20:04 < Savander> :/
20:04 < Savander> it should doesn't matter :c
20:04 <@deen> i made it matter
20:30 < laxa> everything should be cased sensitive
20:48 <@deen> thaNks
21:33 < laxa> deen: help me ! Tons of faker on my server !
21:34 < laxa> xD
21:38 < laxa> deen: know F1 command for "transparency" of tee ?
21:38 < laxa> can't find it
21:40 <@deen> cl_show_others_alpha
21:40 < laxa> Nice ty
21:40 < laxa> bad name...
21:41 < laxa> Not that
21:41 < laxa> I am talking about the transparency of your own tee
21:41 < laxa> in settings the bar is called "lht"
21:41 < laxa> I searched for : lht/skin/color/player/transparency
21:41 < laxa> nothing corresponds T_T
21:42 < laxa> ok I am stupid
21:42 < laxa> I'll search into my .cfg
21:43 < laxa> wtf
21:43 < laxa> can't find it
21:46 <@deen> that's a few bytes of player_color_body
21:46 < laxa> yeah
21:46 < laxa> just found out...
21:46 <@deen> last 2 probably
21:46 < laxa> last 3
21:46 < laxa> making a diff of 2 different config files
21:47 < laxa> know what ed_showkeys and inp_grab are used for ? Can't find why they are for
21:48 <@deen> ed_showkeys shows the keys you press while in editor
21:48 <@deen> inp_grab tries to force the mouse to stay inside the window
21:50 < laxa> Thanks deen
21:50 < laxa> God my friends are annoying
21:50 < laxa> 4 laxa with identical colors on the server xD
21:54 < laxa> I can't find out why sometimes autorecord stops for no reason, or doesn't start at least
21:58 < Savander> maybe teeworlds records 2 demos same time?
21:58 < Savander> autorecord and ddnet record
21:58 < Savander> ??
21:58 <@deen> laxa: autorecord stops when you go over the start line
21:58 <@deen> i think
21:59 < laxa> ddnet record ?!
21:59 <@deen> no
21:59 < laxa> deen: not always
21:59 <@deen> i can't figure out why my code works with debugging output but not without...
22:03 < laxa> cause it's never called
22:03 < laxa> !
22:06 < laxa> deen: should I tell a cheat on a map if I loose a friend for it ?
22:13 <@deen> ok, the code i was taking as a template was just buggy =/
22:13 <@deen> laxa: do what you think is right
22:13 < laxa> Beh...
22:13 < laxa> I have an impossible choice lol
22:14 < laxa> Those retards finished a map with my nickname...
22:16 < laxa> Is it possible to remove their time =x ?
22:16 <@deen> why?
22:16 <@deen> you with your weird request always
22:16 < laxa> xD
22:16 < laxa> Well first they cheated
22:17 < laxa> half the map
22:18 < laxa> I'll send you a fixed version
22:18 < Savander> but
22:18 < Savander> their have
22:18 < Savander> another names xD
22:20 < Savander> 'iaxa' and 'laxđ░'
22:21 < laxa> deen: map uploaded
22:21 < laxa> can't tell you though who cheated or not...
22:23 <@deen> i think my code works now
22:24 < laxa> deen: last finishes doesn't work properly, at least my last finish doesn't appear, even though I forced refreshed it
22:26 <@deen> weird!
22:27 < Savander>  ﻥﺎﻓﺮﻋ
22:27 < Savander> wow
22:28 < Savander> player 22971:  ﻥﺎﻓﺮﻋ
22:28 < Savander> xD
22:28 <@deen> laxa: fixed
22:28 < laxa> found another cheatable map :x
22:28 <@deen> Savander: the chinese names are nice too
22:28 < Savander> but
22:28 < Savander> it last player
22:29 < Savander> 22971, idk how it sort
22:29 < Savander> but..
22:29 < Savander> ;p
22:29 <@deen> it sorts by unicode code
22:29 < Savander> 22959: Ꙫ
22:29 <@deen> lower number comes earlier
22:30 < Savander> ahm, okay
22:30 < Savander> but, 22971 was on ddnet
22:30 < Savander> wow, nice
22:30 < Savander> 22971 different names*
22:30 <@deen> yeah, but it doesn't mean anything
22:30 <@deen> and not "was", but they all finished at least 1 map
22:31 < Savander> ah
22:31 <@deen> i would guess half the people who come to ddnet never finish a map
22:31 <@deen> teeworlds is one of the first games you find on Ubuntu, and ddnet one of the biggest servers
22:31 < Savander> maybe ;], 50 thousand pls lol.
22:31 <@deen> so people just come in, play a minute, and leave
22:32 < Savander> ppls*
22:32 < laxa> deen: impossible 2 uploaded
22:32 < laxa> some cheated time too I guess, can't guess which ones...
22:32 <@deen> laxa: and where was the cheat?
22:33 < laxa> On which one ?
22:33 <@deen> i don't know which maps you uploaded
22:33 <@deen> all?
22:33 < laxa> Impossible 1 and 2
22:33 < laxa> come on test server, I'll show you
22:33 < Savander> btw..
22:33 < Savander> milk is crazy
22:33 < Savander> he finished a lot of maps :P 
22:33 < Savander> all on novice and moderate
22:39 < laxa> sadly, my ethic costed me one friend :@
22:40 < laxa> deen: don't know if you fixed last finished, but now it's fine for me
22:40 <@deen> 22:28 <@deen> laxa: fixed
22:41 < laxa> thought you were talking about Impossible 1 :)
22:44 <@deen> I'm not even sure if we should fix impossible 1 + 2
22:44 < laxa> I keep a friend if you don't fix it xD
22:44 <@deen> these old maps have had these bugs since forever
22:44 <@deen> and everyone seems to know them
22:44 <@deen> and use them
22:44 <@deen> so removing them and removing all 300 ranks is a bit weird now
22:44 <@deen> after they have been played for 3 years
22:45 < laxa> that's I would personnaly do, erase all records.
22:45 < laxa> *what
22:50 <@deen> i guess we'll keep the old buggy maps for now, laxa
22:50 < laxa> anyway
22:50 < laxa> I lost aaa's friendship
22:51 < laxa> he left TS
22:51 < laxa> and he'll never comeback
22:51 < laxa> <_<
22:53 < laxa> deen: can you at least rename the records cheated on impossible 1 ? T_T
22:53 <@deen> no
22:54 < laxa> boah :(
