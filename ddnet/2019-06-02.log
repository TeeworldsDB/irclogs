00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as i dont care shit

00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon hope i didnt offend u my friend, but it looks like we have to talk like politicians here
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @archimede67 did u notice when i called u sir
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it felt so awkward
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> :DDDDD
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> it felt weird
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> coming from u xd
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was doing a inside joke
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess i only could get it
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ðŸ˜‚
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki it is retarded behaviour on my site to use you as Google. And you are allowed to speak with me as you wish.
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Even tho in this case it was more justified than usual to ask you because you worked on the manpages.
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> Catalan boy bad
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @KenWood do you still need help?
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Are you trying to code new tiles?
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> I haven't done anything yet, but I still don't understand what the problem is
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> so I think Yes, i needs help.
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> it's the only thing I didn't do
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/584677655480238090/unknown.png
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Its pretty easy, your tile will not be accepted by the server because it doesnt exist. You have to go into `collision.cpp` in `TileExists()` and you have to replace `TILE_TELE_LASER_DISABLE` with the largest index from your custom tiles, so if you have added an tile with the index bogger than `TILE_TELE_LASER_DISABLE` you have to replace these two with that index
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Btw: Whats that repo?
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> @KenWood  is the tile not being detected? here is how i did it when i added teleport gun tiles https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1204/files
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> hope my comment wasnt rude or anything or else heinrich will pm me saying how a bad boy i am
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> This is the ryo commits about telegun
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> oh need
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea, but basically the changes in mapitems.cpp are not required, its for the client. The tiles that are in this Valid function are for mapping with "Unused" off, so plain ddnet
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> collision
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> big ty
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @KenWood, can you link your repository?
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> I never posted it xd
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> So can you?
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @KenWood do you have a github repo?
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> yes
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can you send the link?
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> but it's empty
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Doesnt matter
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So i can save it for the future
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> https://github.com/BloodWod?tab=repositories
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Oh, you dont have a Teeworlds repo?
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> +
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> Ñ‡Ð’
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> xD

13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> client
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :thonkery:
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there is only lessons and site for me
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> ahah
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> 
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/584711906879733761/unknown.png
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> foko look at his screen
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it says private next to the other repos
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i know
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> but how do you keep ur work if its not on ur pc?
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> making a server is just my hobby, and I'm not working yet
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @jao for this you mean like "Save a replay of 17 seconds" ?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/584723178987847680/unknown.png
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no save_replay should take a seconds argument
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> aah
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> but
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> the length is a separate command
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> so that you can bind the command and set different lengths, for example one time you can save a 10s replay when another time you can save a 30s replay, just by changing the slider in the settings
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> or maybe an optional argument ?
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ok
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @archimede67 i think it would be better to remove the underscores in the Con functions
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ok thanks \:D
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> but
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> you mean like
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> `Con_SaveReplay` ?
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> because every function has an underscore xd
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> every?
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> yea
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Lol
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then leave it like that
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> 
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/584725887031836672/unknown.png
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> xd
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because serverside the con functions are without underscores, i didnt know it was like this in the client
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ah strange xd
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> is there a way to get the min and max of a config variable?
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not really
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> hmm ok, i'll keep that hard coded so xd
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you want to do?
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> for the settings menu i have a slider to set the replay length
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> it goes from the minimum to the maximum of that config variable
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> for now, the values are hard coded
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> so it would be cleaner to have them not hard coded if you see what i mean xd
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, no easy way there
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> yea
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 it would be cool to like get the min and max value of an config var, ive searched for a way of doing that yesterday too.
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for what purpose did you need it?
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I forgot it xd
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd be nice to have a command that resets a config variable
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah yes, thats what I needed it, i wanted to reset it
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah yes, thats what I needed it for, i wanted to reset it
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but you wouldn't need the min and max for that ðŸ˜›
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But it would be the same to get these variables
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Wouldn't it?
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just a dozen lines in `console.cpp`
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but yes, as long as you are in the CConsole context, it's quite easy
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you are out of it you'll need to implement an interface to get that information through IConsole
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> 
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KenWood> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/584743936380239903/unknown.png
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> :oooo
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ?
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ath fucks ddnet
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> readme says: "Our own flavor of the popularÂ DDNetclient modification"
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> First step: Block ddnet xD
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who cares about ath
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @fokkonaut xd
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> you didn't find anything else on the explanations?
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> didnt look through it xd just noticed this
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ah xd
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I mean i noticed that its not the same as for the other hookrhough tile
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that commit is to prevent ddnet servers from verifying ath clients
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which is pointless because if we wanted to we could just send a modchange first
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jean-Claude Van BAN> if there were same flag 'fuck ddnet' for every custom client, it would be so easy to punish cheaters... :thonkery:
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jean-Claude Van BAN> if there was same flag 'fuck ddnet' for every custom client, it would be so easy to punish cheaters... :thonkery:
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lol?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jean-Claude Van BAN> :troll: since there're no /rules there're no rules
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 i managed to completely fake projectile tunings now, i can finally fake the curvature aswell, with using the vanilla GetPos() function. I am kinda proud, and it is working just perfectly :) Ofc, the projectile "disappears" every 4th tick, but thats not noticable without slowing down the playback speed.
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @fokkonaut wot
