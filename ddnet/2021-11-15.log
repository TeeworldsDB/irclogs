07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if only pacman could use multiple mirrors at the same time
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im always stuck to 5mb/s
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when i can download at 70
07:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> 70:justatest:
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki ParallelDownloads and a good mirror could help, or even aria2 as XferCommand
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no paralel downloads doesnt help
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have that
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but since it uses the same mirror it sucks
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe ill try to use axel
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with axel it looks faster
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but the cli breaks a bit xd

20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> @Medvedyk!", kysya post it here
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4340#issuecomment-964568548
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is unsigned â†’ signed conversion not UB when the value is out of the range of the target type?
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what about shifting into the sign bit?
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> if the new type is signed and the value cannot be represented in it, either the result is implementation-defined or an implementation-defined signal is raised
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> is that my stackoverflow searches lead me to believe
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> is what my stackoverflow searches lead me to believe

21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Many people asked the same thing for me too, I recommended them to update / install GPU driver and suddenly it works for them. If you have NVIDIA, you should consider choosing your GPU there and download it's driver here
