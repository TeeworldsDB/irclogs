15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <xansalo> How to play teewrolds 7.2 on freebsd?
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <xansalo> In ports last version 6.5
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> hey, build it
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <xansalo> @♪♫  instruction please?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> @xansalo no idea, try the "Compiling Teeworlds on Linux" page on teeworlds's website, it might not work just like that so have a look at how it's done on the last port it must not be that diffenrent, maybe a build patch something like that
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gdin> @xansalo last time I built 0.6.4 on a freebsd machine, I just had to replace some of the default library paths in the makefile (iirc)
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gdin> process is probably the same for 7.2
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/am1raf/looks_like_steams_getting_dedicated_servers_for/
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who would say, steam could possibly protect us from ddos?, (look at the highlights from first comment), if this ever happens
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Developers can either proxy to their own game servers or use Valve-provided dedicated one"
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Free of charge DDoS protection included as well"
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh well, i guess it is only for paid games
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Relay servers provided by Valve, free of charge for any game released on Steam (opt-in, price is essentially included in the 30% tax)"
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
