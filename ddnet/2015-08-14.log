00:18 < Chairn> wut, voted a map, we were 4 , 3 people voted yes, and vote failed?
00:18 < Savander> maybe moderator
00:18 < Savander> ?^^
00:22 < Chairn> it was vote failed, not vote enforced by
00:22 <@deen> Chairn: veto
00:23 < Chairn> ah
01:47 < Savander> meh, i don't really understand indicators
01:47 < Savander> ^^>
01:49 <@deen> ?
01:49 < Chairn> indicators?
01:49 < Savander> i mean
01:49 < Savander> *int
01:49 < Savander> xD
01:49 < Savander> or *b
01:50 < Chairn> pointers ^^
01:50 < Savander> or something with *
01:50 < Savander> oh. maybe pointers
01:50 < Savander> sorry ^^>
01:50 < Chairn> surely :D
01:50 < Chairn> it can be pointers or array
01:56 < Savander> pointers are used in optimizing the code??
01:57 < Chairn> it allows to have several different class member pointing to the same objects(e.g current loaded map)
11:03 < SideTrack> hi deen u there
11:06 < SideTrack> anyone here
13:04 <@deen> Sure, but not in the exact 4 minutes when you're there^^
13:24 < Sadale> Obviously sidetrack is new in IRC
13:34 < Nimda> Verification 3.0 by Silex just released on Solo at 2015-08-14 13:27
14:31 < o_be_one> vali seems to be back in game servers
14:31 < o_be_one> (oops, hi all :D)
14:32 < o_be_one> and cheat more than before ... (autoaim everytime)
14:32 < o_be_one> on V3Royal
14:32 < o_be_one> hey solala sup', good in Baam :) ? 
14:46 <@deen> o_be_one: i guess you did something against vali? because lots of ddos attacks now
14:53 < Sadale> interesting. it seems that you get ddos everyday
14:54 <@deen> yes
14:54 < o_be_one> deen: hum he cheats since 2 days, just give him a 2h ban yesterday cause he continues to cheat and flame, got some complaints from players about vali
14:54 < Sadale> how do you deal with ddos? :o
14:55  * Sadale is a noob sysadmin
14:55 < solala> hello o_be_one
14:55 < o_be_one> Sadale: our providers handle them well, but seen here that they dump network to know more about attaks
14:55 <@deen> Sadale: buying an expensive ddos protection
14:55 <@deen> , tripling your cost
14:56 < o_be_one> deen: oh theres an other provider to handle ddos ?
14:56 < Sadale> o_be_one, dump network?
14:56 < Sadale> deen, oh...
14:56 < Sadale> deen, I thought that you handle that on your own xD
14:56 < o_be_one> Sadale: yes, tcpdump like, wireshark, etc. and about ddos protection itself, for UDP, its based on algorithms
14:56 <@deen> DoS attacks sure, but a big ddos is impossible
14:56 < o_be_one> solala: whats up ? all is fine on baam ? Where you play too ?
14:57 < solala> atm? nothing
14:57 < Sadale> yep. big ddos need to be solved by, uh, subscribing a better internet line with better server hardwware
14:57 < Sadale> o_be_one, ah
14:58 <@deen> Sadale: well, you can't get a server that handles an > 100 gbit/s ddos attack
14:59 <@deen> need the provider to filter it out
14:59 < Sadale> deen, if you got google-scale hardware, maybe you can do that =P
14:59 <@deen> sure, they can
14:59 < Sadale> probably worth filtering them, tho
15:02 < o_be_one> Sadale: you work as sysadmin ?
15:02 < Sadale> no :p
15:02 < o_be_one> you study ?
15:02 < Sadale> yep. I'm still a lame student. But not on sysadmin :p
15:02 < o_be_one> ok ^^
15:03 < Sadale> I'm interested in this topic because I got a home server. My home server probably won't encounter this sort of attack, tho =P
15:03 < Sadale> Actually, I suspect that it happened once.
15:04 < Sadale> That time my internet access was dead. And my router admin page wasn't working. rebooted the router. web interface still not working. Then I unplug the internet line and reboot the router. The router was working again.
15:04 < o_be_one> sure it won't ... And care about TW theres many kiddys ddosers :/
15:05 < Sadale> Then I plug in the internet line, the router dead again.
15:05 < o_be_one> they just use booters on the web, they dont know what they really do ...
15:05 < Sadale> It lasted for like a few minutes.
15:05 < Sadale> o_be_one, ah.
15:05 < o_be_one> maybe yu got ddosed
15:05 < devnull> if he is running with a dyn ip
15:05 < Sadale> o_be_one, I suspect so. But I can't tell.
15:05 < devnull> its strange
15:05 < o_be_one> well you can ask your provider to change your ip if you want to stop DDoS, but useless if you continue to host and let people get your ip :p
15:06 < devnull> how long does it take for your internet to get down
15:06 < o_be_one> devnull: yes i assume he has static wan ip ^^
15:06 < devnull> that would be sad
15:06 < devnull> monitor your traffic
15:06 < devnull> turn of your home srv and try it w/o
15:06 < devnull> go and search for the error
15:09 < o_be_one> deen: can i know names of all of our providers for DDNet EUR (host and anti-ddos)
15:09 < o_be_one> ?
15:09 <@deen> o_be_one: DDNet EUR?
15:09 <@deen> what server?
15:09 < devnull> eu
15:09 < devnull> europa
15:10 < o_be_one> deen: sorry, GER
15:10 <@deen> there's a fake EUR block server
15:10 < o_be_one> the one at 360
15:10 <@deen> DDNet EUR, the real one, hosts website and test servers, it's at harmony-hosting
15:11 <@deen> with OVH anti-ddos
15:11 < o_be_one> oh really ? nice
15:12 <@deen> i don't run any game servers with ovh anti-ddos because it didn't block any of the big attacks
15:12 < o_be_one> i'll try to work on better anti-ddos for HH by my work, i'm joing the ddos team to add to the cloud team with i already work
15:12 < o_be_one> yes i know, but i'll do my best to grow the ddos protection to handle big udp attack
15:13 <@deen> GER is at nfoserver.com, they have InterNAP anti-ddos
15:13 <@deen> GER2 is at amazon aws, no anti-ddos
15:13 < o_be_one> it's just that about GER ?
15:13 < o_be_one> AWS ^^ i like it :p i work on openstack :p
15:13 < o_be_one> AWS asked me to meet them to maybe work with them last year ^^ i was happy, but the localisation wasnt where i expect to live :p.
15:14 < o_be_one> deen: but for GER you just use nfoservers ?
15:15 <@deen> yes, best ddos protection I've seen so far
15:15 < o_be_one> yes sure i can confirm that
15:15 <@deen> haven't tried any for 400 â‚¬ / month of course
15:15 < o_be_one> but i hope that OVH will be better than internap ahah, its my goal :p
15:15 <@deen> i liked EastByte's theory about that
15:16 < o_be_one> yes we talk about cheap heavy solution
15:16 < o_be_one> what is his theory ?
15:16 <@deen> since OVH is the most used anti-ddos worldwide, the attackers advertise that they can break OVH and everyone optimizes their attacks to get through OVH protection
15:16 <@deen> at least most used in cheap sector
15:16 <@deen> Thanks for the donation, o_be_one =)
15:18 <@EastByte> o_be_one: please make ovh bullet-proof :) thanks
15:18 < o_be_one> your welcome like everytime i do :)
15:18 < o_be_one> EastByte: i'm joining ddos team, dont worry its what i want to do ahah :p
15:18 < o_be_one> i want to be the most hated guy from kids using booters :p
15:19 <@EastByte> then you should better hide your personality^^
15:19 < o_be_one> deen: but TCP protection is ok at ovh, its just over UDP. But if someone dont use UDP for his services, no problem with ovh anti-ddos
15:20 < o_be_one> the udp anti-ddos is just launched on game servers from OVH, its still in beta but it will evolve, they are studying different games as ive seen on theyre website
15:20 < o_be_one> EastByte: well they'll have to kill me soon ahah :D
15:20 < o_be_one> EastByte: what was your theory about ovh ?
15:20 <@EastByte> o_be_one: would be nice to know how to make an udp game protocol supported by ovh
15:20 < o_be_one> and ddos protection
15:21 <@EastByte> what deen said
15:21 < o_be_one> oh ok
15:21 < o_be_one> EastByte: well i know more about what they do to prevent udp ddos, and it's really fine
15:22 < o_be_one> btw, network team is really awesome and with heavy knowledge, learned more about this too, and this is just really impressive
15:22 < o_be_one> (and thats maybe why my ping is better on internap now lol)
15:22 <@deen> if they want to study ddos attacks on game servers, they could try hosting DDNet GER :P
15:22 < o_be_one> deen: thats what i'll want to dos :p
15:22 <@deen> guaranteed 30 attacks per week
15:22 <@EastByte> yea you should bring teeworlds up as an example
15:22 < o_be_one> to do*
15:22 < o_be_one> yes its my project, to handle TW ddos by ovh
15:23 <@EastByte> so you are fighting against internap?
15:23 < o_be_one> but i think i'll try to do this by Harmony Hosting cause they host many game servers
15:23 < o_be_one> no fight against internap afaik
15:23 < o_be_one> they just did peering with them i think
15:24 < o_be_one> cause i got same ping with internap than with ovh, so maybe internep peers with my providers to, its more possible
15:24 < o_be_one> provider too*
15:24 < o_be_one> (wtf my english today ?)
15:27 <@EastByte> deen: I'll implement the spoof protection in ddnet now
15:28 <@deen> great
15:28 <@EastByte> but I think for now I will keep the dummy map without background
15:28 <@EastByte> I'm kinda struggling with the map format
15:28 <@EastByte> deen: also the yellow screen comes from "gfx_clear 1"
15:33 <@deen> EastByte: can't you just use a regular map?
15:33 <@deen> everyone just has to download it a single time or am i wrong?
15:34 <@EastByte> I'm more concerned about possible reflection attacks
15:35 <@EastByte> okay, let me see how big the packet will be with normal empty map
15:39 <@EastByte> "everyone just has to download it a single time or am i wrong?"  currently the dummy map is sent on each connect
15:39 <@deen> ah
15:45 <@EastByte> packet ack: 0 flags: compress size: 623->368
15:46 <@EastByte> hm 368 is still acceptable I guess
15:47 <@EastByte> deen: can we make some statistics about how many clients use the token protocol?
15:48 <@EastByte> (players I mean)
15:48 <@deen> token protocol?
15:48 <@EastByte> SECURITY_TOKEN stuff
15:48 <@EastByte> I just named it token protocol
15:49 <@EastByte> or did you forget about that update? :p
15:54 <@deen> what's the security token supposed to do?
15:55 <@EastByte> prevent packet injection
15:55 <@EastByte> https://github.com/east/teeworlds/commit/96417849c0df374942eb7e993a19ec0ec2fec1ab
15:56 <@deen> right right, now i remember
15:56 <@deen> sure, how do you want to take stats?
15:56 <@EastByte> no idea
15:59 <@EastByte> have you already made statistics for client version and stuff?
16:05 <@deen> not really
16:06 <@deen> no serious ones
16:10 <@EastByte> okay, how should we retreive the information from the server?
16:10 <@EastByte> I could dbg_msg information about a connecting client
16:11 <@EastByte> or using sql?
16:12 <@deen> yeah, write a message
16:12 <@deen> then we can just grep and wc -l
16:13 <@EastByte> okay
16:13 <@deen> or can it be told from the client version?
16:13 <@deen> i can check how high the client versions are
16:13 <@deen> then we don't need to change any code
16:14 <@EastByte> I would like to encourage people to add the security token protocol to their client/server mods
16:14 <@EastByte> so the log should be independent from ddnet client
16:15 <@deen> so are there any clients that have it except ddnet client?
16:16 <@EastByte> currently not
16:16 <@EastByte> I guess
16:16 <@EastByte> well except ddnet based clients like baumalein
16:32 <@EastByte> "[55cdfbce][server]: player is ready. ClientID=0 addr=127.0.0.1:49019 secure=yes"
16:32 <@deen> sounds ok
16:33 <@deen> but i think clients based on ddnet should keep ddnet's version numbers so that they work properly anyway
16:33 <@deen> so using the numbers should work fine
16:35 <@EastByte> currently yes but in the future there will be clients supporting the token protocol itself
16:35 <@EastByte> not based on ddnet
16:36 <@EastByte> the patch can be easily merged in any client
16:38 <@deen> got a nice script to get client numbers of all people on ddnet ger(1) currently
16:39 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/clients-ger.log
16:39 <@EastByte> hmm, from which version do we have token support?
16:40 <@deen> 7.3
16:40 <@EastByte> ah, well
16:41 <@deen> quite a lot of people on vanilla client and a few with really old versions
16:41 <@EastByte> is 0 vanilla?
16:41 <@deen> yes
16:41 <@deen> 1 is old ddrace
16:41 <@deen> 2 is very old ddnet
16:41 <@EastByte> many of some modded clients I suppose
16:41 <@deen> 16 is old baumalein
16:42 <@deen> rest are ddnet client versions
16:49 <@EastByte> old clients or non-ddnet clients will not be able to connect dummys
16:49 <@EastByte> I'm expecting complains there
16:49 <@EastByte> kclient for example crashes on dummy connect^^
16:49 <@deen> you can broadcast a message that they have to update to new ddnet client?
16:50 <@EastByte> for <703 it should be done, yes
17:00 <@deen> but <707 already gets a message whenever they join a ddnet server
17:00 <@deen> and they chose to ignore it for weeks
17:05 <@EastByte> hm I don't think we have to care about that
17:05 < Chairn> f1 is default for console ~deen
17:05 < Chairn> so used to have it on f4 ^^
17:06 <@EastByte> didn't even know it's bindable
17:06 <@deen> f-key binds even work in menu
17:08 < Chairn> i never tried other f-keys than 1 to 4
17:25 <@EastByte> I hate merge conflicts which mix two functions together
17:34 <@EastByte> wouldn't it be cool if there were special diffing tools for each language
17:34 <@EastByte> instead of line based text diffing
17:56 <@EastByte> Savander: btw. pointers are like the evil version references
17:56 < Savander> it's hard to understand for noobies like me :PP
17:57 < Savander> didn't see real functionality for it :D
17:57 < Savander> don't*
17:57 <@EastByte> pointers probably are the most difficult part of C
17:57 <@EastByte> take your time :P
17:57 < Savander> in teeworlds code
17:58 < Savander> i see pointers everywhere
17:58 < Savander> even on functions
17:58 < Savander> D
17:58 < Savander> xD
17:58 <@EastByte> sure
17:58 < Savander> int *something(bla bla, bla bla,);
17:58 < Savander> xD
17:58 <@EastByte> have you worked with references before (some other langauge maybe)?
17:59 < Savander> im not real programmer
17:59 <@EastByte> kk
17:59 < Savander> i was working in java
17:59 < Savander> and php
17:59 < Savander> Java -> for minecraft server haha
17:59 <@EastByte> well in java you are mostly working with references
18:03 < Savander> ou
18:04 < Savander> int i = 0; int b = i;
18:04 < Savander> its reference?
18:04 < Savander> b to i?
18:04 < Savander> (in java)
18:05 <@EastByte> no, not for primitive types
18:05 <@EastByte> but when you are creating an object using new
18:05 < Savander> Object s = null; 
18:05 < Savander> xd
18:05 <@EastByte> you get a reference to that object
18:05 < Savander> aaaa, this!
18:05 < Savander> okay i know now
18:06 <@EastByte> :)
18:42 < Savander> How it's called? public:
18:42 < Savander> 	IInterface() : m_pKernel(0) {}
18:42 < Savander> i mean, this type 
18:43 < Savander> i mean this:   IInterface() : m_pKernel(0) {}  ( colon between interface and pKernel )
18:50 < Savander> ah okay, initialization lists
18:52 < Chairn> oh, just saw a flybot for the first time
18:55 < Savander> flybot?
18:55 < Savander> you're able to fly xD?
18:55 < Savander> without hooking etc?
18:55 < Savander> xD
18:55 < Savander> (even through the freezess !?!)
18:55 < Savander> xD
18:59 < Nimda> Skyisland2 by Storm just released on Ddmax at 2015-08-14 18:53
19:01 < Chairn> nah, a bot that always stays same place with lots of small & fast hooks
19:02 < Chairn> it can be used for solo map like fly out of hell
19:04 < Savander> lol.
19:05 < Savander> it wasnt be in zClient?
19:29 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Chairn opened pull request #284: Fixed double clicking on friend when friend was on top server. (master...upstream) http://git.io/v3D5y

19:55 < Hamid_Jigool> at last year one of friends that i must put some space before map name in autoexec.cfg
19:55 < Hamid_Jigool> and i did
19:55 < Savander> wow, it could be mod error
19:56 < solala> ^ thats what i said with "look at the error"

20:06 < Hamid_Jigool> i put my maps Folder out of "data" Folder
20:06 < Hamid_Jigool> and its work
20:06 < Hamid_Jigool> thank u evrybody
20:06 < Hamid_Jigool> :D
20:25 < Chairn> facebook page needs screenshot, come ger server^^
20:51 <@deen> Savander: why am i in the special thanks for the tw video?^^
20:51 < Savander> you helped me with recording this demo
20:51 < Savander> i put there all of those players
20:51 < Savander> :D
20:51 <@deen> i just jumped around for 1 minute^^
20:51 <@deen> but thanks
20:51 < Savander> ^^
20:52 < Savander> but, you was ^^.
20:52 <@deen> I think .me' wants a DDNet trailer now for http://facebook.com/DDraceNetwork ^^
20:52 < Savander> haha
20:52 < Savander> ^^.
20:52 < Savander> there is a lot of good movie makers
20:53 < Savander> someone probably want to create trailer for ddnet too!

21:00 < Chairn> but this one has no transparency :P
21:01 < Chairn> hopefully, you have removed the name before screenshot

21:38 <@deen> Savander: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/pull/283#issuecomment-131216405
21:40 < Savander> i don't understand ^^>
21:42 < Savander> maybe he want to make demoplayer looked more like html video player
21:58 <@EastByte> lalalala
21:58 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east opened pull request #285: Ip spoofing protection (prevents spoofed connections) (master...antispoof) http://git.io/v3yQs
22:00 <@EastByte> now I need some look overs and testing
22:00 <@deen> Looks nice, eeeee: want to proof read?
22:47 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/LH37UKRD7336
22:47 < Savander> hehe
22:47 < Savander> ^^.
22:54 < Savander> deen, you changed pw on zcatch?
23:02 <@deen> Savander: yeah, I'm doing that right now
23:02 <@deen> zio and .me' asked me to do that
23:02 < Savander> okay ^^ :D
23:03 <@deen> except on one server because it's full^^
23:03 <@deen> i should use fifos for the zcatch servers
23:05 < Savander> ye, zcatch is really popular
23:05 < Savander> on ddnet
23:05 < Savander> fifo will  be usable for news too
23:05 < Savander> :p
23:06 <@deen> but i think fifo is not implemented for zcatch?
23:06 <@deen> if you want, you can implement it
23:06 <@deen> just take the code from ddnet
23:06 <@deen> and also please sv_shutdown_when_empty
23:06 <@deen> it's really useful to restart servers
23:06 < Savander> with fifo i have few problems
23:06 <@deen> i just do this: echo sv_shutdown_when_empty 1 > servers/*.fifo
23:06 < Savander> i can't test it :PP
23:06 < Savander> (windows)
23:06 <@deen> hm, no linux
23:06 <@deen> meh, then i do it^^
23:07 < Savander> but i can add shutdown_when_empty
23:07 <@deen> also, I asked github to give me the ddnet organization
23:07 <@deen> so i can put all ddnet repos under github.com/ddnet
23:07 < Savander> (experience for me! ahah)
23:07 < Savander> oh ye
23:07 < Savander> it'd be cool
23:07 < Savander> all mods in one place 
23:09 < Savander> few people asked me, if i can increase number of players which are required to win the game.
23:09 < Savander> because they are cheating ranking 
23:09 <@deen> yeah, doesn't mean much if you win 100 games vs 5 people
23:10 < Savander> yup
23:10 < Savander> so i should change that?
23:10 <@deen> yeah, your choice
23:10 < Savander> either yours
23:10 < Savander> ^^
23:10 <@deen> nah, you know more about zcatch and it's your mod
23:10 <@deen> i just host it
23:11 < Savander> generally .me and zio knows more
23:11 < Savander> i did it because, when i host zcatch it was small 
23:11 < Savander> only teevision
23:11 < Savander> so i wanted to change a bit this mod, and here we go ^^.
23:11 < Savander> (most popular zcatch servers, mhm)
23:39 < Savander> oh okay
23:52 < Savander> deen,  it's proper? http://pastebin.com/MrQXb0Ht
23:52 < Savander> i can use #else?
23:53 < Savander> ok, nevermind
23:53 < Savander> i can
