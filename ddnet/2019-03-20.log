00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it's ment to counter vote bots that join just to vote
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> theoretically it should take very little time
08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so many things
08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :ninja:
08:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 i know, but if I fork ddnet then https://github.com/def-/ddnet won't redirect correctly anymore. Maybe I'll try forking to def-ddnet-prs or something
08:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, if I create this: https://github.com/def-/ddnet-prs/ then it doesn't show me that it's a fork of DDNet
08:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i think u can still make prs
08:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just more clicking iirc
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or maybe not
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If anyone knows how to "fork to a different repo name" please tell me
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Or how to "mark a repo as a fork of another repo"
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe u could create a own org and fork ddnet im not sure if thats possible
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think u can
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it lets me :P
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/557827586449997845/unknown.png
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, that would work but I don't want an org just to put my PRs there...
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, I was right. After forking and renaming it https://github.com/def-/ddnet now points to the fork, not the original anymore
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen do you have links to def-/ddnet somewhere?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also I'll finish up the composede binds tonight, do you want single modifier or multi modifier?
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Hey, can someone help me connecting a SQLite db with ddnet?
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @fokkonaut i though u professional coder/hoster
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> because u ask how bind sqllite database
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> btw you dont know how to configure/setup it or what? @fokkonaut
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nothing
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> o.O
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Everyone happy now? ^
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (should only trigger each build once)
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @fokkonaut u would need to change all mysql code to sqlite
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or best, use a library which you can use all these
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even postgresql
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and port it to that
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fast google http://www.sqlapi.com/
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://soci.sourceforge.net/
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/rbock/sqlpp11 this one uses c++11 feautres
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Anyone else getting this issue? ^
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> o/
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Leave space on a harddisk for 0 bytesðŸ¤” :troll:
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not harddisk

20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> join the server and try it out yourself, maybe because those players are very, very far away from the own tee
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> when im on showall and spec free, there is some weird soundproblems
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> like it doesnt get more silent the further you go
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> /pause or Spectator mode?
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @fokkonaut they work for me
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> pause
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what version are u at
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar âœª 11.9
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wait, let me restart (as reconnect didnt help)
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well i stand right next to u xD
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> seems like something is wrong, but not always
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yup, works now
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> restarted the client
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> come test on full server
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe that helps: i had the client open for at leats 2 hours but on another server @Jupstar âœª
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe after long time, there is a bug with centering some names on accident?
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i honestly dunno
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it could be things not related to text rendering itself
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but in the char decoding for example
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean, there was a bug when servertime was too high (the ticks) then the laser bounce was delayed, maybe here aswell, if the clienttimer is too high it fails on some calculations
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the bug could be within 1 line, just wrong places parantheses or wrong order calculation
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont really think so tbh
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the most logical thing would be, that there is space added to the name for some reason
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont think so tbh
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> where and why should that happen?
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs i remember there were ppl with insane huge 88 in clan tag
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and deen worked on character decoding
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mh
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> if i call me "=c=o=r=n=e=u=m=" then the name shows in the game fine but in the scoreboeard its cut off
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i think thats something else
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> @deen I can't join GER servers these days, although everything is fine with other location servers
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> it applies for KoG too
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> any GER servers
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> any ideas why ? :v
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> 
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/558053672895119387/Screenshot_1.png
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> nvm I can join some, but not a lot
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unique :)
