17:03 <@deen> couldn't find any problems so far
17:54 <@deen> Timeout protection still seems really buggy
18:09 <@deen> the recvfrom syscalls produce errors all the time. anyone know why?
18:18 <@deen> probably the set timeout when selecting

19:49 <@deen> hm, recently the people asking me for client fixes aren't even using ddnet client
19:50 <@deen> and there's another still active ddrace mod i didn't know about: https://github.com/ftk/XXLDDRace
20:05 <@EastByte> deen: isn't that xxlddrace?
20:06 <@deen> it's mkRace
20:06 <@EastByte> okay
20:06 <@deen> with some ddnet additions
20:07 <@EastByte> teeserver.de looks down from here
20:08 <@EastByte> I don't even know why I still stalk it
20:36 < KinG_> deen: i want to connect my bot to irc what port should i use?!
20:37 <@deen> no idea
21:08 < laxadedi> KinG_: depends on the network
21:08 < laxadedi> go on the website of the network you wanna connect the bot to
21:08 < laxadedi> and it depends too if you wanna use SSL or not
21:08 < laxadedi> default IRC port is 6667 I think
21:09 < KinG_> hey laxadedi i created a channel and the port is 6667 but bot never connects....

21:32 < xrothx> Good evening
21:32 <@deen> hi xrothx 
21:32 < xrothx> How are you?
21:32 <@deen> tired, but fine. and you?
21:37 < xrothx> Pretty tired aswell
21:38 < xrothx> Everything alright with the serverr? 
21:38 < xrothx> Tell me when you will change/stop GER 
21:38 < xrothx> wouldn't want to pay for notting ^^
21:38 <@deen> why would I stop our most popular server?
21:39 <@deen> I'm very rarely getting complaints about it compared to all the other servers we tried
21:46 < xrothx> Okay ^^
21:48 < xrothx> I thought you had soo much lags that you changed the site for that reason.. 
21:48 <@deen> the site was never on GER
21:49 <@deen> i changed the site because the other server was too expensive for me
21:52 < xrothx> You need a server for it? Or is a webhosting package enough? 
21:57 <@deen> a server
22:51 < o_be_one> hi
22:51 <@deen> hi
