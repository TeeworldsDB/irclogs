00:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ i would love to see it merged finally! But I will probably not do it my self in the near future (before 2026)
00:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @pathos3005 yes that is a real problem i agree! Tbh I am having a hard time seeing bots with my bare eyes do you think you can differentiate between bots and good aim?
00:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @pathos3005 yea anyways i would love to turn off the kick votes but then the botters can do what they want. So having someone to help with fun votes would be amazing. Thanks for offering. Can you email me at chillerdragon@gmail.com and i send you the password

12:27 < bridge> <zhn> wait where are you from
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think we already discussed your issue.
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You said you have no anti-virus and no firewall & already restarted your router, so just call your internet provider and ask them.
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> There isn't a lot we can do for you. Maybe the internet provider blocks UDP traffic for many nodes
12:56 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> why i getting killed after using /tc on my local server?

13:43 < bridge> <teero777> do you have enough clips?
13:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 i usually release these videos new years but given that i have not started cutting yet i am not sure if i will make it ._. i have made very little clips this year i will recycle some old ones <:justatest:572499997178986510>
13:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://eieio.games/blog/writing-down-every-uuid/

13:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> content warning: Claude used
13:46 < bridge> <teero777> ah man i wish i could've taken some but the bar is high xD
13:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nono no high bar @teero777 trust me every clip thats not from me is super valuable it adds a new perspective on how ppl play
13:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just take a short clip of your daily driver setup
13:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i got like 2 or 3 submissions which are only pictures no videos and they are just ppls setups at home and all of them have their own style and are interesting to look at @teero77 i am sure yours as well!

16:17 < bridge> <barlars> hey does anyone know how to program in c
16:19 < bridge> <meloƞ> a bit, why? :o
16:23 < bridge> <barlars> my internet will shot down tomorrow and i wanna learn c
16:23 < bridge> <barlars> so i need some course to download
16:24 < bridge> <barlars> free one
16:25 < bridge> <barlars> @blaiszephyr also can i edit teeworlds code with c
16:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> It's written in c++, not c
16:25 < bridge> <barlars> isnt it same but with two plus
16:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> C++ can do everything c can, but c can't do everything c++ clan, it's basically a newer updated and extended version of c
16:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> The actual difference is much more than that, but I don't feel like typing it down atm
16:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @blaiszephyr is JavaScript the same as Java but with word script?
16:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> Hey the question is legit, don't talk him down like that!
16:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
16:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> I didn't know Javascript and typescript differ
16:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> I thought people just did a typo when saying TS instead of JS
16:30 < bridge> <avolicious> TypeScript has to be transpiled to javascript
16:35 < bridge> <barlars> so if i learn c++ can i write everything in c too ?
16:35 < bridge> <avolicious> No 😄
16:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> Well, no 💥
16:35 < bridge> <barlars> so ur liar
16:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> :thisemoji:
16:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Report hi
16:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> m
16:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> The actual syntax and the way to do something differs
16:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just learn which ever C or C++ once you start touching the ddnet source code you will see what you are still missing
16:36 < bridge> <barlars> i want to play with teworlds source code and mess with some basic operating system projects
16:36 < bridge> <zhn> you need to learn both c and cpp then
16:36 < bridge> <avolicious> Learn Rust
16:36 < bridge> <chairn> "basic operating system projects" = bot ?
16:36 < bridge> <zhn> :poggers2:
16:36 < bridge> <zhn> bosp*
16:37 < bridge> <barlars> which one i need to start
16:37 < bridge> <zhn> any
16:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can download this free course on teeworlds development https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhJkqAQmOh5LyYOfnMy4PJB6CSZltQyTc&si=bHbqkKgfREQgi208
16:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Rust mentioned :greenthing:
16:37 < bridge> <barlars> shhh
16:37 < bridge> <avolicious> In rust, we trust
16:37 < bridge> <barlars> damn chillerdragon always suprises me
16:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> In C, we see
16:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :justatest:
16:38 < bridge> <avolicious> C detected, opinion rejected 😄
16:38 < bridge> <barlars> in rust we dust
16:40 < bridge> <barlars> well i still need a offline course to learn c
16:40 < bridge> <barlars> or c++ if its easier to learn
16:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just download the YouTube videos using yt-dlp
16:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Plus any of the intro to C or C++ tutorials out there like for example this one https://youtu.be/-TkoO8Z07hI
16:45 < bridge> <barlars> isnt there a written course (i dont mean the books that older than my grandpa)
16:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> the books are still mostly accurate tho
16:55 < bridge> <zhn> @heinrich5991 do you remember if tw0.3.3 was running good on windows xp?
16:56 < bridge> <zhn> on any windows
16:57 < bridge> <zhn> server fails on map load with "wrong signature"
16:57 < bridge> <zhn> seems that DATA magic word got reversed
16:59 < bridge> <Kaffeine> I think I remember teewars 0.3.2 running on XP. It could not be win7 because it didin't exist, and it could not be vista because people (at least in that community) refused to use it.
16:59 < bridge> <Kaffeine> (back in 2008)
17:00 < bridge> <zhn> i wonder why it fails to load, has something to do with 32bit exe support of win10
17:00 < bridge> <zhn> like it says wrong signature and prints 44 41 54 41, that's exactly DATA xd
17:01 < bridge> <zhn> it can start with compatibility settings applied but misses data folder anyway
17:05 < bridge> <zhn> ok seems runs fine on win7, win10 fucked up backcompat
17:06 < bridge> <zhn> probably you need to boot up win7 even in order to launch it
17:43 < bridge> <teero777> in germany there is "Grundkurs C" which teaches the basics
17:43 < bridge> <barlars> i am not german
17:49 < bridge> <barlars> which distro do u use
17:58 < bridge> <isowner> hi, how to get freeze or no tee?
17:58 < bridge> <isowner> i’m trying write a hud, he show freezes your teams or no
18:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Debian on my laptop and arch on my desktop
18:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> why not arch or debian on both
18:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Search for m\_FreezeTime
18:08 < bridge> <teero777> i bet
18:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk I like both I had Debian already and never had the urge to get rid of it once I switched to arch on the desktop
18:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Arch is nice as a daily driver for work and gaming. But Debian is nice to reproduce things. It’s Ubuntu like so that’s what everyone uses and also CIs and it’s what I use on my servers.
18:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> understandable
18:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> i initially started using debian but then switched to arch
18:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> both are great
18:17 < bridge> <teero777> using an old debian is also good for building binaries for the public
18:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Well my Debian is usually new
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can run my rust builds on my vps, that is not true for cpp builds
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> language issue
18:35 < bridge> <woidless> How do I make sure that when I change the card, my tunes are not discarded on my server?
18:39 < bridge> <zhn> reapply them
18:42 < bridge> <murpi> $rtfm sv_tune_reset
18:42 < bridge> <murpi> $rtfm sv_reset_file
18:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> good bot

18:44 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> bad bot
18:44 < bridge> <DDNet> :(
19:36 < bridge> <murpi> Did we keep the option to keep IDs above the players nameplates? Because how the hell am I supposed to figure out whos who here?

19:39 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> hlep

19:55 < bridge> <avolicious> When will this be merged? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8900
20:05 < bridge> <robyt3> Not in its current state, the verify URL should be derived from the connect string
20:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can someone explain me this hammer in the new bounce map?
20:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1317932817635872849/Bouncy_Kingdom_.mp4?ex=67607c15&is=675f2a95&hm=c64bbecb668512a66d7ce9d632748a25c09eeeef3a30ceb6aab6624f77cdaec6&
20:15 < bridge> <meloƞ> freeze-timer is set to 1, so you basically unfreeze for a single tick (not really, im not entirely sure how it works)
20:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but does that even work when fully inside freeze already? lol
20:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh it does indeed
20:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lol
20:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but only weapons work, not jump
21:13 < bridge> <oxyzo.> Works in the multieasyvolvemap too
21:16 < bridge> <Solly> I wanted ids to be on the same layer same as chat. As for making it visible... I don't think removing IDs makes that case any more visible. You can change the font size below 0 now
21:18 < bridge> <murpi> No one said anything about removing the IDs, the IDs should ideally be kept above the nameplate, like previously
21:20 < bridge> <murpi> https://i.imgur.com/S39y6hA.png
21:20 < bridge> <murpi> Didn't help
21:27 < bridge> <Solly> thats more readable and again moving the ids up doesnt make it much more readable
21:28 < bridge> <Solly> also cute skin
21:28 < bridge> <Solly> thats more readable and again moving the ids up (what i previously called removing) doesnt make it much more readable
21:28 < bridge> <murpi> Is the hook symbol clearly visible to you in the screenshot?
21:30 < bridge> <murpi> I'm sorry but saying moving the IDs where the hook symbol is currently located doesn't make it more readable is... just plain wrong. 😅
21:39 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> @sollybunny did you change that or something
21:39 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> you made the id the same place as name
22:03 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Do the IDs show all the time, or only when in debug mode? (ctrl shift D)
22:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I always thought that desync issues between the client and server allows you to send a request for jumping onto the server, while the client is already in the freeze. Since there isn't proper debugging built-in to check each server tick's actions in order, I cannot determine, whether the order for applying freeze functions come in before or after the Tee movement functions
22:10 < bridge> <cellegenrih> In any case, freeze should have a priority above tee movement to eliminate the one server tick freeze jump.
22:11 < bridge> <meloƞ> We shouldn't discuss breaking existing behaviour on released maps impo. It's not breaking the game, using tunes creates edge cases all the time, and the map is actually fun that way because you get funny save encounters :greenthing:
22:25 < bridge> <totar> https://heinrich5991.github.io/blog/blog/one-tick-unfreeze
22:25 < bridge> <Solly> If you care about the IDs (I assumed you didn't) then yeah OBS. But I assumed otherwise
22:26 < bridge> <cellegenrih> oh, neat
22:26 < bridge> <totar> you can fire mid-tick between being unfrozen and refrozen in the same tick
22:26 < bridge> <totar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1922
22:26 < bridge> <totar> freeze jump is unrelated
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> broken physics
22:27 < bridge> <totar> that happens because freeze is delayed by 1 tick from your current position, if you move down fast enough you can be outside the freeze 1 tick and then grounded the next tick
22:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i defs wanna see ddnet2.0 by superteero
22:27 < bridge> <meloƞ> We moderators are required to see the ID of players at all times in case of any problems
22:27 < bridge> <cellegenrih> so, it is indeed the freezing function goes as last priority
22:27 < bridge> <murpi> The IDs are the only way to identify a player currently on screen when it comes to in-game moderation
22:27 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> what?
22:28 < bridge> <Solly> Sure. As I said in GitHub I'm fine with that being added
22:28 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> This command doesn't work or what?
22:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> He had it turned on, the visibility was blocked by a different reason :nouis:
22:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> That's why he bonked, he knew what the issue was
22:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> imo, IDs in Teeworlds is like positions in an 64 (or any max player amount) position Array, where new players joining the server will occupy any available ID positions, while one player leaving the server will move all other IDs from that player's ID by 1
22:30 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> I use version 18.7 and everything fine:greenthing:
22:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> That would be horrible, imagine you type kick 5 stop being so damn annoying
22:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
22:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> And you kick a random person because someone completly unrelated left
22:31 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> fr
22:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> Would require a full overhaul of the existing system that has been used for over a decade
22:31 < bridge> <totar> there's no reason to do it like that lol
22:31 < bridge> <totar> the current way is fine
22:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It will be needed to overhaul with accounts
22:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> nah, not really
22:32 < bridge> <meloƞ> I mean it requires change, yes. Not an overhaul tho
22:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> because then, each account can have their unique ID, which either can be human readable, or extremely unique
22:32 < bridge> <totar> the server will know the account from the ID regardless
22:33 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> guys, almost every time I'm joining a server i getting id 0, is this rare?
22:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> if you are the first one joining
22:33 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> no
22:33 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> not first
22:33 < bridge> <totar> it just means there was no one in that spot
22:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> then probably, whoever had the ID of 0 left, and then you occupied it, idk
22:33 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> ik
22:34 < bridge> <totar> it gives you the lowest available so id 0 is the most common
22:34 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> when ddnet 3.0?
22:35 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Do does it mean, that from an ID Array, it doesn't move all IDs by a certain amount on player leaving, but rather removes that ID in the Array, allowed to be occupied?
22:35 < bridge> <murpi> Ok
22:35 < bridge> <totar> it picks the lowest empty ID
22:35 < bridge> <cellegenrih> but won't move any existing IDs in case someone leaves
22:36 < bridge> <avolicious> yes, because its an array
22:36 < bridge> <cellegenrih> right?
22:36 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> bruh 2.0 isnt even out
22:36 < bridge> <avolicious> It checks which array slot is empty
22:36 < bridge> <avolicious> = no player assigned to it
22:36 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> when 4.0?
22:37 < bridge> <skibidisigma8261451> i have a meme
22:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It makes sense, somehow I guessed the other option, where you move that position to the end of the Array and then empty it, making other IDs subtracted
22:38 < bridge> <avolicious> Moving costs
22:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> around 3 instructions more, than the original, yeah
22:38 < bridge> <avolicious> Thats expensive
22:40 < bridge> <cellegenrih> can't IDs be tranlated into a byte array for bit shifting by the ID amount?
22:40 < bridge> <louis> :pepeW: what the hell am i reading
22:40 < bridge> <totar> there's nothing wrong with how it works already
22:40 < bridge> <avolicious> What are you trying to achieve?
22:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> can't IDs be tranlated into a byte array for bit shifting ~~by~~ to get the ID amount?
22:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> learning xd
22:41 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> why so many questions
22:41 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> cwllgen u ruined it
22:41 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> o nvm i thouvht totar was askinga qurstion too
22:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I just ask, you don't have to answer it 😄
22:41 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> my job is stripping my braincells away
22:42 < bridge> <cellegenrih> can't IDs (as in the Array) be tranlated into a byte array for bit shifting ~~by~~ to get the ID amount?
22:42 < bridge> <cellegenrih> can't IDs (as in the Array) be translated into a byte array for bit shifting ~~by~~ to get the ID amount?
22:44 < bridge> <soulyvevo> we are at 18,8
22:44 < bridge> <soulyvevo> we are at 18.8
22:46 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :pepeW: waiting till 19.9
22:50 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> dude remember the whole ddnet 2.0 hype
