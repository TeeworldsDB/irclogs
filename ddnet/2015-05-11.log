20:01 <@EastByte> deen: that's bad
20:01 <@deen> indeed
20:16 <@deen> At least lags on GER seem to be gone
20:17 <@deen> Now we have a new problem where some people sometimes get low fps and high ping
20:17 <@deen> no idea how that happens
20:17 <@deen> some can reproduce it on some maps, other can't

22:27 < fstd> :O
22:55 < eeeee> oh noes, git police is upon us
23:02 < fstd> shaddap, u git
23:02 < fstd> i'm just glad i don't have any branches based on what appears to be the primary ddnet branch :)
23:05 < eeeee> he overwrote like last minute of history
23:05 < fstd> fair enough
23:08 < fstd> though i guess it will still require all downstream repos to be fiddled with
23:09 < eeeee> only if they did fetch during that minute
23:09 < eeeee> um, no
23:10 < eeeee> if they pulled to a local branch and created some commits on top
23:10 < eeeee> i think even if you pull to a local branch, it will still update you when you pull again
23:11 < fstd> hm yeah probably right.. if one has never seen the ditched commits
23:12 < eeeee> if you start working on a new feature during that particular minute then you'll kinda get annoyed a bit when you see your shit diverge
23:12 < eeeee> not exactly catastrophic. otherwise you'd be fine
23:14  * fstd considers joining a sock puppet and loudly bitch about how i just in this very moment finished interactively rebasing my years-worked-on project on the now obsolete commit
