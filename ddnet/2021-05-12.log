10:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> is there a way to tell ddnet client to turn off weapon prediction
10:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/841953770819813376/2021-05-12_16-22-57.mp4
10:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sadly no, been focussing this problem too since a long time
10:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, a hack might be to set the m_AttackTick to Server()->Tick()
10:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> let me try that real quick
10:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> that would be way to late for it to reach the client before the prediction kicks in tho.
10:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Server()->Tick() - x
10:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> sounds like a plan
10:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `pCharacter->m_AttackTick = m_AttackTick > Server()->Tick() - 25 ? m_AttackTick : Server()->Tick() - 25;`
10:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> definitely fixes that permanent laser prediction, but one single laser will still get through
10:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> When the original m_AttackTick gets set, or something like that
10:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> we should have a gameinfoexflag for weapon prediction
10:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then it can also be toggled on and off serverside, depending on which weapon one is holding right now, because my server does have extra weapons, it also mispredicts scrolling when taking another weapon than the vanilla weapons
10:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But that also happens when the attack tick is just set to Server()->Tick - 10, because the client just tries to create that laser
11:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> attacktick > servertick - 2 should probably also work, since snapshots are sent every 2 ticks this should work
11:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> `cl_antiping_weapons 0` ?
11:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i mean from server
11:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
11:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> <a:ismetriggered:758293590765338645>
11:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> If people play with weapon pred on, it messes up mods that doesn't use vanilla behaviors that's all
12:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> so
12:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> i come back to you
12:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> i really think that u have to be able to see others assets in a temp file (on/off in settings for those who dont want to download others assets) and save them if u like them
12:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> it would download them when u connect and u could have a refresh button to download the assets of the people that connected to sserver after u
12:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> so it does not start a download each time someone join the server
12:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> this would affect only the using assets
12:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> not all the assets library of everynyan
12:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and now in one setence pls
12:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u want to download assets?
15:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> map votes are not available anymore?

15:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> `/map` still works ðŸ˜„
16:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://github.com/TeeworldsCN/ddnet-pvp/blob/master/src/game/server/weapons/grenade.cpp rate my weapon class
16:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Comrade where?
16:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> 176.9.114.238:8332
18:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> @TsFreddie looked at the pr, and just thought of one thing about Evolve, if you're here
18:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i am
18:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> I think the tunings used in Evolve has to be the same as those used by m_ReckoningCore in server/character.cpp. so it might not work to use tunezones for Evolve if we dont also use it in the server. but it's some time since I looked at how it worked
18:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ic
18:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> what does m_ReckoningCore do exactly?
18:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> ehm, it's not very clear from the code, but I think the purpose is to save server bandwidth by not sending the character if the character didn't move, or if it can be predicted from the last tick (with Evolve)
18:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh
18:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> actually that makes sense
18:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> so the server will try to step the character forward one tick, and if that matches what the client would get with evolve, it's not sent
18:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> yes
18:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so i probably need to revert evolve.
18:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i thought it was for filling dropped ticks
18:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well i guess technically it is
18:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> oh, yeah. if snapshots are dropped the client will still use Evolve, so that can technically still happen
18:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> and give misprediction in tunezones
18:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> so its not perfect
18:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we have a dilemma then
18:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> would collecting the most recent tick from all characters and see if we need to match reckoning or do prediction works?
18:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> hmm, if the server sends a new character, the evolve is automatically overwritten
18:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> right
18:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> actually, it might work to do Evolve still (with tunezones)
18:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> since if the character is in a tunezone the server will probably end up sending a new character every tick (since the Evolve/reckoning fails)
18:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it'd be a bit hard to be 100% sure probably
18:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> the best would perhaps if the client and server could send some flags to agree on using tunezones for Evolve
18:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and send tuning params with tunezone number
18:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but i think that might be asking too much from server.
18:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> maybe we should do that, the current way of getting the tunezones is a bit hackish ðŸ˜›
18:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i mean in most cases using maps' tunezone settings is enough.
18:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> also we now update the entire tuning every time a player moves between zones, instead of sending all tunings just once (if tunings within zones stays the same)
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> do we ever change tunezone settings during actual playtime?
18:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we can just not send them at all if we know the clients is capable of getting them from maps
18:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> yes, it's only possible from rcon, and I don't think anyone does that
18:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> unless testing while making a tunezone part
18:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> or we do send them for simplicity in the server end, but if a flag is set in server, the client doesn't update them
18:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> since they will be the same. and maybe only update it when we are in the test server so mappers can still do it
18:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> actually maybe not sending them is easier
18:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
18:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> yes
18:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> but the cleanest would perhaps be to get them into the snapshot
18:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> and also include tunezone numbers
18:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> also just realized i've made a mistake about evolve
18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i set the evolving core's tuning only at the start of the evolution. should be doing that every tick
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sending them from the server would probably be cleaner than calculating them from the map
18:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that way, the server is in control how the map is parsed
18:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye
18:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it's 1am here tho. i should go to bed.
18:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> would it be possible to add an extended netobject for this? I thought about that last time I looked at this
19:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> btw, we should actually do this. if we know that we always get a new snapshot on each snap, we can check if a snapshot was received. then we could perhaps also get rid of the "floating player" problem during connection dropouts
19:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> actually i just checked the code again, evolve is only used upon receiving netcharacters. so it doesn't seem to affect dropouts.
19:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe the dropout thing is just interpolation
19:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> oh, ok, I see
19:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so i just reverted evolve lol
19:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'll look into sending tunezone infos tomorrow
19:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> ok, nice
19:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> ok so i want that when u connect to a server, u download the assets of people and u see them with they own assets, those assets u downloaded should go in a temporary file so u dont end with 3000 assets, u then could have a button to refresh that download the assets of ppl that joined the server after u, and another button to keep some assets if u see someone using a cool asset u want, and ofc a button to turn it off/on
19:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wont happen
19:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> when i say assets it means the only assets ppl are using
19:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> too many trolls
19:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> wdym ?
19:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> except u mean from some managed database
19:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> wait 1st tell me what could go wrong about trolls
19:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nazi symbols, whatever
19:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you'd get images you don't want
19:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> ah
19:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> well yeah from a database managed so no porn or nazis or $hit
19:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> also idk if i tell it right but u would see the ppl with their own assets
19:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
19:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> generally i like the idea, but not sure yet
19:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probs wont happen very soon
19:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> ye i think not for this year xD
19:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> but would be interesting
19:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> also a first step to this would be to manage assets like skins
19:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i think i discussed that with some ppl on gores server already ðŸ˜„
19:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> so u dont dwnld assets each time u connect to a server
19:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> u just see ppl with default asset if u dont have it or the asset they choose if u have it
19:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> in my memories skins works like this
19:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> @Jupstar âœª u think that would be possible ? :tee_thinking:
20:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> possible yes
20:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> everything is possible xd
20:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> most stuff is possible
20:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> client side anti cheat is not one of them ðŸ˜‰
20:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe not everything for humans xd
20:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at least not without hardware controlled by ddnet
20:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> everything is possible, except nothing
20:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how is client-side anticheat possible, without ddnet-owned hardware?
20:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> hack mod pw
20:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and ban cheaters xd
20:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ¤–
20:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> But yeah, you mean bot clients in first place, but I meant it more philosophically
20:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I would just collect phone numbers in china and ban phone numbers :kek:
20:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> In China they just put camera in your room and spy you
20:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it's true
20:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Bad social score bcs cheating in a 2d  game xddd
20:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I wonder what mine is

20:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Is that good enough?
20:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> How did you lose some xd
20:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> by not paying my credit card bill lol
20:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
20:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> yeah, it's just my credit score
20:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ˜…
20:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why dont pay lol
20:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ˜… I'm paying them
