15:27 < Smegma> Hey fstd_ are you here
15:28 < Smegma> well i testing out you old tournament mod and it was working fine to start off with but then it started putting players in matches with themself?
15:28 < Smegma> maybe its because players left but the game still thinks they are here?

16:30 < F1rSt> deen: are your there? :|
16:30 < F1rSt> #secound day :D
17:31 < ddtee> Hi all! someone can help me with custom commands? i dont understand how it works.
17:31 < ddtee> for example command grenade. i edit flag in "ddracecommands.h" CONSOLE_COMMAND("grenade", "", CFGFLAG_SERVER|CMDFLAG_TEST, ConGrenade, this, "Gives a grenade launcher to you"
17:32 < ddtee> i add after "grenade", "v[id]" but cunt give someone grenade
17:32 < ddtee> or just "v" but anyway dont work
17:33 < ddtee> cant* 
17:54 < Learath2> ddtee, that just changes the command description doesnt change the way the function called operates
17:54 < ddtee> Ah...shit -_-
17:55 < Learath2> ddtee, you are looking for src/game/ddracecommands.cpp:ConGrenade
17:55 < Learath2> thats the function getting called
17:56 < Learath2> look at other functions that take a victim argument
17:56 < ddtee> Learath2: yeah, i search for it. and all the same like in xxlddrace
17:57 < Learath2> check ConKillPlayer look how it handles the victim
17:59 < Learath2> ddtee, well its more complicated then that you also need to modify the function ModifyWeapons to accept a clientID argument
18:00 < Learath2> if you have some experience you can easily pull it off
18:02 < ddtee> Learath2: nope, i dont have any exp
18:02 < Learath2> great time to get some \o/
18:02 < ddtee> Learath2: yap, i want to do this
18:03 < Learath2> im around if you get stuck
18:03 < ddtee> Learath2: ty! 
18:04 < ddtee> Learath2: also, all commands saved in ddracecommands.cpp or i must edit other files too?
18:08 < Learath2> for this ddracecommands.cpp seems to be enough ddtee 
18:18 < ddtee> Learath2: hm, maybe im stupid, but i see in source of ddnet and source of xxlddrace (like a example) - he have exactly the same code.
18:18 < Learath2> gimme the xxlddr code and ill check
18:18 < Learath2> but i gave you better examples of where to get the code
18:21 < ddtee> Learath2: http://pastebin.com/qrvrqjmh
18:21 < Learath2> well the xxlddr version would also give the weapon to yourself unless he has a different ModifyWeapons
18:21 < Learath2> but you are on the right track
18:22 < Learath2> you got the victim client id
18:22 < Learath2> now you need to pass it to the modifyweapons function so it can give the weapon to the victim instead of you
18:23 < ddtee> Learath2: in xxl version he give weapon to person  with id. i check it already and its work
18:24 < Learath2> then you need to check his modifyweapons function see if thats different
18:24 < Learath2> maybe he does GetVictim in modifyweapons
18:24 < Learath2> but that doesnt sound correct
18:29 < ddtee> now im stuck
18:32 < Learath2> ddtee, check ModifyWeapons it gets the clientID from pResult which ends up being your id
18:33 < Learath2> so you need to pass in the result of getVictim to ModifyWeapon so you can use that instead
18:34 < ddtee> easy to say, hard to understand he-he
18:35 < Learath2> tell me which part you are stuck on 
18:35 < Learath2> i cant help if idk whats wrong
18:36 < Learath2> tbh it'd be much easier if you learned some c or c++
18:39 < ddtee> Learath2: yes, but i dont have so much time for this. you can show me how the code should look like ? for me it is easier way to understand this
18:40 < Learath2> i'll guide you but i wont give you code i have other things to do
18:40 < Learath2> so ill go grab some dinner and you think about a good question to ask me 
18:41 < ddtee> Learath2: bon appetit ;3
20:23 < F1rSt> hello i want to run Persian DDnet servers in Iran . How can i start ?
20:28 < Learath2> first you ping EastByte or deen i guess
20:29 < F1rSt> yeah i know :D they dont answer
20:30 < F1rSt> Guys Download teamspeak application :| there we can Poke users so they'll understand :|
20:31 <@EastByte> we had ddos problems with all Iran servers so far
20:32 <@EastByte> what kind of server is it this time?
