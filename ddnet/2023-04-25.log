04:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for indie dev i highly recommend existing solution (like microsoft's playfab), less effort, not that much more expensive than hosting your own server for the user base you're expecting to have.
04:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or if you expect to publish on a single platform (like steam), using the platform's service directly (usually for free) is a good idea too.
04:28 < bridge> <ùêäùêëùêÄùêã> thanks i will look into it
05:09 < bridge> <Ewan> fred how r u doing
05:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> Ok
05:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I'm waiting for my KFC
06:01 < bridge> <Ewan> Epic
06:01 < bridge> <Ewan> Haven‚Äôt had KFC in a minute
08:30 < ChillerDragon> @Robyt3 do you play ddnet? if yes under which name?
08:35 < bridge> <Ewan> woah i never even thought of that
09:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Robyt3 in-game is Robyt3
09:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
09:16 < ChillerDragon> rly jopsti?
09:17 < ChillerDragon> but does he play?
09:17 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1682406985.png
09:17 < ChillerDragon> where did my c++ line numbers go :(
09:17 < ChillerDragon> ``  CC=clang CXX=clang++ CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address,undefined -fsanitize-recover=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer" CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address,undefined -fsanitize-recover=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer"  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DHEADLESS_CLIENT=ON -DCURSES_CLIENT=ON
09:18 < ChillerDragon> a

09:18 < ChillerDragon> yesterday i still had line numbers xd
09:19 < ChillerDragon> ``DDNet: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 4.4.0, BuildID[sha1]=f4622ec1ca0e2802458ccca060d681619257dfc8, with debug_info, not stripped``
09:19 < ChillerDragon> not stripped they say
09:19 < ChillerDragon> and yet asan giving me the full lap dance
09:20 < ChillerDragon> watf
09:20 < ChillerDragon> @Robyt3 you dont play very much then i assume? whats your motivation for working so much on the code base then?
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe he plays lan server 24/7 xd
09:45 < bridge> <Robyt3> I almost never play race. Used to play vanilla or some other PVP mods like Insta or Catch if there are enough players. I mostly just like to code nowadays.
09:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Honorable
09:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Chiller u compiled as pie
09:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dunno if the sanitizers can handle address randomization
09:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mh but u in debug mode. Weird weird
10:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I See. Well thanks for doing it \:)
10:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@Robyt3)
11:51 < bridge> <DefaultO> who coded this bot
11:51 < bridge> <DefaultO> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1100358393803309056/image.png
11:55 < bridge> <murpi> @ChillerDragon hey random, apperantly all people here are stupid
11:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> :Ray:
11:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> shots fired
12:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> note for future self: design a table you know will have a lot of records based on a date using psql partitioning, because later on will be a chore to migrate to partitioned tables
12:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and cuz im lazy i just deleted old data
12:12 < bridge> <Learath2> Partitioning is about where my knowledge of SQL ends. I can sort of see it help with the issue you mentioned this morning but I also don't see why your original query performed so badly
12:13 < bridge> <DefaultO> no index
12:14 < bridge> <DefaultO> or outdated index
12:14 < bridge> <DefaultO> or outdated index (when you insert/updated a lot on an indexed table, you have to recreate the index from time to time)
12:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk it had 7million rows
12:15 < bridge> <DefaultO> that's nothing
12:15 < bridge> <Learath2> He already had an index on the date
12:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dude if u dont know what utalk about better stfu
12:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the explain literally says it
12:15 < bridge> <DefaultO> I do know what I am talking about
12:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sometimes u rly make me mad
12:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no u dont know shit
12:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u just blabber
12:15 < bridge> <DefaultO> my company does the documents for most german companies
12:16 < bridge> <DefaultO> we have at least 50 million entries in a table
12:16 < bridge> <DefaultO> recreating the index from time to time helps
12:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :fuckyousnail:
12:16 < bridge> <DefaultO> if you were smart enough to create an index in the first place
12:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my god
12:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im done
12:17 < bridge> <DefaultO> not my fault you are not as smart
12:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (timeouted both for insulting each other)
12:33 < DefaultO> Don't wanna complain. But Heinrich banned me from the ddnet Server for things that happened outside of it.
12:33 < bridge> <spur> you timed him out and he left the server :kekW:
12:33 < DefaultO> Nah I have been banned @spur
12:33 < bridge> <spur> wat
12:33 < bridge> <spur> how u talkin
12:33 < DefaultO> irc chat
12:33 < bridge> <spur> wtf is irc chat
12:33 < DefaultO> heinrich got no power here
12:33 < DefaultO> https://webchat.quakenet.org/?channels=ddnet&uio=d4
12:34 < bridge> <spur> ah
12:34 < bridge> <spur> heinrich is an odd person, have you ever seen him in a happy mood?
12:35 < DefaultO> he was visibly interested when I talked with him about Teeworlds bot in our dms
12:35 < bridge> <spur> he gets interested in things besides moderating this discord?
12:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well he might be bit strict very often, which makes normal conversations hard sometimes, but he is also very intelligent and does a lot for ddnet.
12:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If I assume right, he plays the role of a ddnet discord mod after rules he set himself and is pretty consistent about them. So basically like a robot xd
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> He can time out the bridge too default0
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Poor chiller dragon
12:39 < bridge> <Learath2> Normal conversation is easy, discussions are where we have an issue usually. People get way too heated
12:39 < DefaultO> Would he take away every method for support
12:39 < DefaultO> I already don't have any access to the reports channel anymore
12:39 < DefaultO> I think
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just say sorry and he will unban
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Can't be so hard
12:44 < DefaultO> Meh
12:45 < DefaultO> #freeryo
12:45 < DefaultO> He is innocent
12:45 < DefaultO> But I still believe that rebuilding the indexes was the smart move
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Aren't indices kept up to date
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What would be the sense of them else
12:46 < DefaultO> I don't think so
12:46 < DefaultO> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/indexes/reorganize-and-rebuild-indexes?view=sql-server-ver16
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Would be surprising to me, but i am not biggest SQL/database lover
12:46 < bridge> <Learath2> They are, but they aren't guaranteed to be optimal when updated on the go
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah makes sense
12:47 < bridge> <Learath2> Some things get fragmented
12:50 < DefaultO> I just know that we run even bigger Databases
12:50 < DefaultO> And there is no way a proper table with 5M entries should be slow
12:51 < DefaultO> But I have no knowledge on Ryos case
12:51 < DefaultO> It was just mentioned by someone else
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is still the question if indices are the problem here tho. Sounds more like the query is inefficient then
12:52 < DefaultO> could be the case if the query contains sql that checks (nearly) every entry - such as string comparisons
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'd have assumed even without rebuilding the indices would be reasonable fast
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Rebuilding sounds like a on top optimization of u know u are reading often and writing rarely
12:54 < DefaultO> Can't scroll up in this IRC chat to quote the other one. But the wording slow query was dropped.
12:54 < DefaultO> rebuilding is not needed if you only read, rebuilding should be done nightly or when not used if you are inserting new entries to the table and update entries in general
13:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Anyway, i doubt ryo uses Ms stuff. So it this isn't a useful discussion without him anyway
13:01 < DefaultO> it would only be useless if that doesn't apply to SQL databases in general
13:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I cannot imagine that it is much less of a problem than it sounds from you. Ryo did vacuum and analyze do he probably is suspecting something already
13:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I cannot imagine that it is as much of a problem than it sounds from you. Ryo did vacuum and analyze do he probably is suspecting something already
13:04 < DefaultO> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
13:06 < DefaultO> Also just checked. Rebuilding is done in other databases with the ``ANALYZE TABLE table_name;`` command
13:07 < DefaultO> Some also have the ``OPTIMIZE TABLE tbl;`` command
13:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> finally free
13:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> next time when i ask for something i will exclude this guy from it
13:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> since i dont enjoy convos with it
13:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thats all ill say
13:29 < DefaultO> you can ignore me, but I will never be gone
13:29 < DefaultO> :ghost:
13:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i suggest u simply make a special case for chiller on matrix, and disable irc
13:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> nobody uses it anyway
13:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Chiller cries in pain. He hates element BCS Js bloat XD.
13:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Btw chiller, did u ever try a terminal client?
13:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think he tried weechat
13:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> with the matrix extension i told him
13:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> probs didnt like it
13:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I see
13:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I like having a method to join the developer chat without proprietary software
13:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> true
13:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> then simply not let ban evaders abuse it
13:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is matrix proprietary?
13:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> not that i know
13:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe the client
13:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I was offline
13:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> matrix is open, irc is (more?) open
13:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i know its ok, told learath bu he has no perms
13:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> he is +o on IRC
13:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> irc is the most open, but also insecure
13:34 <+bridge> <Steinchen> Damn. thought u ra
13:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe he forgot the credentials?
13:34 <+bridge> <Steinchen> Damn. thought u rq
13:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> probably xd
13:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but irc with the OTR extension is nice
13:34 <+bridge> <-StormAx> he became a fucking web-hook
13:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> only works for private convos tho
13:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why tho, i can fully self host it. Or BCS of other reasons?
13:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks i think matrix can be federated
13:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the problem its more complicated to setup
13:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> IRC is a standard, matrix aims to be a standard but a lot of it is still "whatever synapse does"
13:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> iu used to host a irc server
13:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ircv3
13:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd
13:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think most networks use this
13:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i used it too
13:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> unrealircd also exists I think
13:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> also twitch uses it IIRC
13:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ah ye
13:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So the development is less open?
13:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> well irc is rly open in that there are lot of implementors right
13:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> idk how many matrix implementors are there
13:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> element is the dominant right
13:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, basically
13:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 do u prefer mpv or vlc
13:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> there are a couple of alternative clients. last I checked (couple of years ago) they were far from usable with encryption
13:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I see. That explains why they need two million years to implement webrtc correctly lmao
13:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> in the linux weeb world i heard many ppl say mpv is better than vlc
13:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I use mpv, I liked that it doesn't show user interface
13:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The only fast client i know is the CPP one. The web apps are all so slow when decrypting. Very avoiding
13:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Annoying
13:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think it generally has less problems(for me) but also less settings, at least over ui
13:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i had to use mpv to watch anime rn cuz i stopped emerge mid-qt
13:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and vlc needs qt
13:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its nice too yeah
13:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i need to integrate it with rofi tho
13:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it also plays better with syncplay
13:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i.. lack a file browser
13:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
13:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I use ffplay to replay streams tho. Seems to be the only player that minimized delay for rtmp
13:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> does it work with twitch?
13:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dunno, my friends and I use rtmp with nginx
13:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
13:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's nice BCS higher quality streams
13:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> YouTube has a rtmp backend tho
13:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> At least for the stream upload
13:47 <+bridge> <arch1t3cht> > VLC is not recommended because it often displays wrong colours, introduces visual artifacts, and breaks intensive subtitles. Here are some comparisons showing these issues -

13:47 <+bridge> <arch1t3cht> from thewiki.moe
13:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i see
13:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> mpv
13:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> a quick read
13:49 <+bridge> <arch1t3cht> on windows it also links an ancient version of libass so some subtitles are broken, though I guess that's not a problem on linux
13:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it says it also decodes better with nvidia on linux, which i have
13:49 <+bridge> <arch1t3cht> though font caching is still weird
13:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and works better with tiling
13:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> which i have
13:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> libass is a good library name
13:50 <+bridge> <arch1t3cht> vlc would also upscale chroma with point for a long time, not sure if it still does that
13:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> $drake vlc mpv

13:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> `mpv "$(ls -1 | rofi -dmenu)"`
13:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> nice this works
13:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i just realized im not using the full power of rofi
13:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Fake ryo. Where is rust alternative
13:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/davatorium/rofi
14:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> idk anything as good as rofi in rust
14:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> `bindsym --release Print exec maim -s --format=png /dev/stdout | xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -i`
14:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this is my way to take screenshots
14:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> `bindsym --release $mod+o exec maim -i $(xdotool getactivewindow) --format=png /dev/stdout | xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -i` to take a perfect screenshot of the active window
14:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mhh
14:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i3 powa
14:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> `bindsym $mod+d exec --no-startup-id rofi -show drun`
14:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and my program launcher
14:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Too nerdy for my workflow
14:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks im the fastest at opening firefox in the west
14:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Xd
14:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sad only that browsers are bloated slow software

14:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> bloat time
14:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> worst offenders, cuz they take a lot to compile and they update a lot due to security issues i think
14:07 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thats why i always run "upgrade --exclude "firefox""
14:07 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> upgrade is my script

14:12 <+bridge> <arch1t3cht> looks like it doesn't any more
14:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @arch1t3cht do u know if u can advance to delay subs
14:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> in vlc i know how to
14:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> sometimes i need that cuz unsync subs
14:14 <+bridge> <arch1t3cht> `z` and `Z`
14:14 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh nice
14:15 <+bridge> <arch1t3cht> there's a nice hotkey cheat sheet somewhere
14:15 <+bridge> <arch1t3cht> I think it was this one https://i.imgur.com/LNGJf4u.png
14:19 <+bridge> <Learath2> matrix is just such a complicated thing, I honestly never quite enjoyed it
14:19 <+bridge> <Learath2> with homeservers and stuff it just makes my brain melt
14:21 <+bridge> <Learath2> Make sure you configure it properly, it didn't want to use nvenc by default for me
14:21 <+bridge> <Learath2> well nvdec in this case but yeah
14:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> how to xD
14:21 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks what do u think about https://www.amazon.es/Noctua-NH-U12A-chromax-Black-Disipador-Torre/dp/B098XP1Y38
14:22 <+bridge> <Learath2> Well first check if it works out of the box
14:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it did
14:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i watched a anime while eating
14:23 <+bridge> <Learath2> I mean if it is using your gpu out of the box
14:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why is it so expensive?
14:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it said gpu
14:23 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i mean noctua is the best brand for this
14:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mh i dunno, but very expensive for a air cooler
14:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks which do u have
14:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> what temps
14:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i reached 88 compiling gcc
14:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
14:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so idk anymore
14:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i guess i need new cooler
14:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the hyper 212 suxs
14:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i read the 5800x is hard to cool cuz small die
14:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> or smth
14:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I have dark rock pro 3
14:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And V4 costs like 80‚Ç¨
14:26 <+bridge> <Learath2> @Ryozuki if it doesn't say `nvdec` or `vdpau` on the gpu line it's not using your gpu
14:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I doubt my cpu was ever over 70¬∞
14:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> AO: [pulse] 44100Hz stereo 2ch float
14:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> VO: [gpu] 1920x1080 yuv420p
14:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> AV: 00:00:02 / 00:24:00 (0%) A-V:  0.000
14:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Even with 16 cores. But maybe depends on fan target
14:28 <+bridge> <Learath2> `gpu` there is the video output driver, gpu is the modern one
14:28 <+bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, that's not hardware decoding
14:28 <+bridge> <Learath2> Try starting with --hwdec
14:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> hm same
14:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do i need any flags
14:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> on gentoo
14:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh there is nvenc
14:30 <+bridge> <Learath2> Yeah you want nvenc on gentoo
14:30 <+bridge> <Learath2> I also have `vdpau` enabled, not all applications can use nvenc/nvdec
14:32 <+bridge> <Learath2> There is one big problem with firefox on linux, it can't use vdpau or nvdec, only vaapi, so videos don't get decoded on gpu and it annoys me very much
14:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sounds annoying indeed. I mostly use Firefox for exactly that^^ video Playback is awesome
14:33 <+bridge> <Learath2> Do you have it working on linux with hardware accelerated decoding?
14:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes but amd
14:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It has vaapi backend
14:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> do you like xmpp?

14:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i have this
14:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no vaapi in sight xd
14:34 <+bridge> <Learath2> Ok you  have vdpau, nvidia doesn't support vaapi anyway
14:35 <+bridge> <Learath2> There used to be a weird stub driver that redirected vaapi requests to vdpau but it was a buggy mess so every distro removed it
14:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> > Core mpv functionality can be extended with Lua or JavaScript scripts or C plugins.
14:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> lol js but no rust
14:35 <+bridge> <Learath2> Not particularly. I don't mind the wire protocol, but the homeserver thing is a little weird still, atleast in my mind
14:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm, that's kinda what makes email good though
14:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i need to remember why i have qt deps in gentoo
14:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I like a little federation
14:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i wonder what uses it
14:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> vlc?
14:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh true
14:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> vlc does
14:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I only use it BCS home server actually xdd
14:39 <+bridge> <Learath2> if you have `equery` you can do `equery d <package>` to find out what depends on it
14:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh
14:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> equery poggers
14:42 <+bridge> <Learath2> `equery d dev-qt/qtcore` üòõ

14:42 <+bridge> <Learath2> Those ones with the pink qt5 thing mean it's only dependent if the qt5 useflag is enabled
14:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ok i added nvenc and vdpau
14:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> also libcaca
14:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> funny name
14:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> caca = shit in spanish
14:43 <+bridge> <Learath2> Now when you do `--hwdec` in mpv what happens?
14:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1100401672573948004/image.png
14:43 <+bridge> <Learath2> For me it was still only decoding on gpu but then copying back to the cpu
14:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> Using hardware decoding (nvdec).
14:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> AO: [pulse] 44100Hz stereo 2ch float
14:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> VO: [gpu] 1920x1080 cuda[nv12]
14:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> AV: 00:01:54 / 00:49:25 (4%) A-V:  0.000
14:44 <+bridge> <Learath2> Okay, seems it's not copying back for you
14:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> how to make it default
14:45 <+bridge> <arch1t3cht> mpv.conf
14:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ye but what option xD
14:46 <+bridge> <Learath2> `hwdec=auto`
14:46 <+bridge> <Learath2> you can copy the example config from `/usr/share/doc/mpv...`
14:46 <+bridge> <arch1t3cht> you can usually just copy the options you set on the cli one to one
14:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so just `hwdec`?
14:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> auto worked
14:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> does mpv display it always at max quality or whathever
14:48 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> or do i need to config it too
14:49 <+bridge> <arch1t3cht> wdym max quality
14:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> profile=gpu-hq
14:49 <+bridge> <Learath2> You can do `profile=gpu-hq` it'll set the scaler and a couple other things
14:49 <+bridge> <arch1t3cht> if you use profile=gpu-hq then disable deband
14:49 <+bridge> <arch1t3cht> deband just makes existing banding worse more often than not
14:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ok looking good
14:50 <+bridge> <arch1t3cht> some more advanced config guides (custom upscalers and whatnot) here:
14:50 <+bridge> <arch1t3cht> <https://web.archive.org/web/20220603192313/https://lightarrowsexe.github.io/moon_blog/mpv-made-easy/>

14:50 <+bridge> <arch1t3cht> <https://iamscum.wordpress.com/guides/videoplayback-guide/mpv-conf/>
14:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i have a nerdy anime setup now too
14:52 <+bridge> <Learath2> You can also mess around with the scaler afterwards, I think I heard `ewa_lanczossharp` is better if you have a beastgpu
14:52 <+bridge> <Learath2> It's actually quite impressive how configurable mpv is, they support so many things, you can change like everything
14:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the only missing thing is someday to leave pulseaudio and use pipewire
14:53 <+bridge> <Learath2> I did it on both my machines, it's actually trivial to switch
14:53 <+bridge> <Learath2> took me 20 mins max
14:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ohh
14:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ill do it after the work metting i have in 10 mins xd
14:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> meeting*
14:54 <+bridge> <Learath2> and mpv is a native pipewire client, so it doesn't rely on the pulseaudio plugin and you get nice nodes in the graph üòÑ
14:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> nice
14:54 <+bridge> <Learath2> I was listening to a lecture with bad audio, ran it through an AI denoiser node and an EQ to cut out a buzz
14:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> are we a native pipewire client
14:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ddnet
14:55 <+bridge> <Learath2> doubt it, we use SDL and I don't think they do native pipewire yet
14:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> boo
14:56 <+bridge> <Learath2> https://www.phoronix.com/news/SDL2-Lands-PipeWire-Audio nvm they did
14:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what is native pipewire?
14:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I thought pipewire only offered jack/pulseaudo APIs?
15:00 <+bridge> <Learath2> pipewire offered a pulseaudio and jack api through plugins
15:00 <+bridge> <Learath2> it has an api of it's own that is pretty easy to translate to, which is what the plugins do iirc
15:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And in the end it is all alsa? Xd
15:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> alsa is both the name of the kernel API and the name of a library
15:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's all alsa the kernel API, but not alsa the library
15:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> AFAIK
15:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok
15:06 <+bridge> <Learath2> hm, I don't remember if pulseaudio and pipewire rely on libalsa
15:06 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I thought that no
15:07 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> pulseaudio depends on alsa-lib on archlinux
15:07 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> pipewire doesn't
15:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I just want obs to finally support audio per application. Shouldn't it be easy to implement with pipewire
15:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And webrtc too
15:08 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> should also be doable with pulseaudio
15:08 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I remember doign that
15:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mh k. Will later look
15:09 <+bridge> <Learath2> hm, in gentoo both pipewire and pulseaudio depend on alsa-lib
15:09 <+bridge> <Learath2> even with the alsa plugin disabled
15:10 <+bridge> <Learath2> should be pretty trivial if obs is a native pipewire client, it just needs to create a sink and get the stream from the application
15:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah probably it already works. Maybe more hidden. On windows u have window audio source and select window
15:14 <+bridge> <Learath2> You can probably already just wire it by hand in qpwgraph or using the pw-cli
15:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yep
15:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I have a dummy source for that rn
15:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But easier in obs directly
15:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this so much
15:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> imagine being able to watch hentai while streaming
15:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> (joke xd)
15:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> on windows u need a shady program for split desktop adudio
15:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i need to learn this stuff
15:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u have a tldr on migrating
15:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> my meeting is over so i can mess with my audio now
15:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.gentoo.org/support/news-items/2022-07-29-pipewire-sound-server.html
15:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> found this
15:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> Best part is that you really dont need to learn anything if you dont want to, the out of the box experience is the same as pulseaudio
15:37 <+bridge> <Learath2> I used this and the pipewire page on the gentoo wiki
15:40 <+bridge> <Learath2> One problem I had was that audio was low out of the box, but I just had to set the ALSA volume to 100%
15:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> pavucontrol will work?
15:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its a nice tool xd
15:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> or whats the pipewire alt
15:41 <+bridge> <Learath2> pavucontrol does still work
15:41 <+bridge> <Learath2> pulseaudio plugin is very very complete
15:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> nice
15:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> does firefox has native pipewire

15:44 <+bridge> <Learath2> firefox is extremely slow when adopting stuff like this
15:44 <+bridge> <Learath2> They still haven't started using vdpau because they were fighting about whether they should wait for vulkan video or not for half a decade
15:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ah there is also something thats been bugging me but unrelated
15:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont like login display managers
15:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but i didnt know how to get the bus or udev right
15:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i have xdm without anything
15:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so when i login in the tty it works but it always says a warning xd
15:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i wonder how to get the logs
15:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i have XDM
15:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but wanna get rid of it
15:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> startx logs
15:49 <+bridge> <Learath2> idk what you mean, I never used a dm so it certainly is possible
15:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> tldr when setting up gentoo i guess i messed up a bit my config
15:49 <+bridge> <Learath2> Are you having an issue starting a dbus session?
15:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and idk if im using xdm or not, i login through the tty tho xd
15:49 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i remember having a issue with it if not using a display manager
15:50 <+bridge> <Learath2> You login through a tty, then how do you start x?
15:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i forgot
15:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this is like programming
15:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> a setup u made ages age is not urs anymore
15:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i guess x gets started by XDM but it doesnt have any "frontend" configured?
15:52 <+bridge> <Learath2> When you log in, does it automatically get you into a gui?
15:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no
15:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> my .xinit looks like this
15:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
15:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
15:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 
15:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> if [ -n "${GPG_AGENT_INFO}" ]; then
15:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki>   kill $(echo ${GPG_AGENT_INFO} | cut -d':' -f 2) >/dev/null 2>&1
15:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> fi
15:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 
15:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session ssh-agent i3
15:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
15:52 <+bridge> <Learath2> So you do `startx`?
15:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont run startx
15:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i guess if i remove xdm
15:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i should do that
15:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ill remove it
15:53 <+bridge> <Learath2> I wonder what even starts x for you, I thought display managers were started by the init system
15:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it is
15:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> rc-update shows it
15:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> display-manager |      default
15:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ah
15:54 <+bridge> <Learath2> but you log in on a tty you said
15:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1100419665005649982/image.png
15:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i have this
15:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but with xdm
15:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but xdm is not there
15:55 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so its a weird thing it does
15:55 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> probs
15:55 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:55 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
15:55 <+bridge> <Learath2> do you maybe have an exec startx in your bashrc or bash_profile?
15:55 <+bridge> <Learath2> I remember gentoo suggesting that in a wiki page
15:55 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no i dont
15:55 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i nver read that
15:55 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so my dumb self thought, ok ill use a display manager to make startx auto
15:56 <+bridge> <Learath2> I mean there is no harm to a dm üòÑ
15:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its bloat
15:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i like my tty login
15:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> do i put exec startx
15:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> in bashrc or profile
15:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh wait
15:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i have  it in my profile
15:57 <+bridge> <Learath2> Ah, that explains it
15:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1100420435650285618/image.png
15:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what's the point in doing 'native' pipewire if it also supports the pulseaudio API?
15:58 <+bridge> <Learath2> You aren't using XDM at all
15:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah im not xd
15:58 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i disabled the display manager in rc-update
15:58 <+bridge> <Learath2> Honestly, nothing much for most applications, there is some pipewire specific stuff exposed in the pipewire api, but mostly advanced stuff
15:59 <+bridge> <gotroyb> I've been using this for a long time if you are interested in taking a look üòâ https://github.com/gotroyb127/dotfiles/blob/5d72589137d0218ae8990fe8e9185c02b62f70ce/.profile#L50
16:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ur not someones alt right?
16:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ok ill check
16:00 <+bridge> <Learath2> @Ryozuki don't forget to add `gentoo-pipewire-launcher &` to your i3 config
16:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u have ur tmp in a tmpfs
16:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i do
16:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :BASEDHALT:
16:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> portage tmp too
16:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> just need 12gb ram for firefox tmp files
16:01 <+bridge> <Learath2> Nope, I do sometimes mount a tmpfs there though
16:01 <+bridge> <Learath2> Maybe I should always have it on tmpfs
16:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it saves lots of writes
16:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and good use of ram
16:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> otherwise i hardly reach 10gb
16:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> usage
16:02 <+bridge> <gotroyb> No, I'm not, I'm me ;). I've been silent generally.
16:03 <+bridge> <gotroyb> It'd probably help if I got /nicked to zogtib.
16:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> with or without the full stop?
16:03 <+bridge> <gotroyb> without
16:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> not to be pedantic, but a alt saying "im me" is also correct
16:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> after all you are always u :p
16:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> (im joking anyways)
16:04 <+bridge> <zogtib> That's right, but I'm not an alt.
16:04 <+bridge> <Learath2> This is a cute idea, I'll steal it
16:04 <+bridge> <zogtib> (oh and thanks for /nicking me)
16:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh
16:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i havent thought about goign full tty only
16:05 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> zen mode
16:05 <+bridge> <Learath2> I don't have `exec startx` so I can stay in tty if I'd like

16:07 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> nice explanation of io_uring, too
16:07 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 can u tell me ur use flags for pipe
16:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and do i need alsa-plugins
16:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ddnet.org seems down
16:09 <+bridge> <Learath2> `media-video/pipewire sound-server extra` I don't have anything else
16:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> media-video/pipewire X dbus extra ffmpeg pipewire-alsa sound-server ssl v4l
16:10 <+bridge> <Learath2> gstreamer might be fun to mess around with too if you want
16:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no pipewire-alsa ?
16:10 <+bridge> <Learath2> Oh yeah, `X dbus readline ssl` from my `USE` too
16:10 <+bridge> <Learath2> Nope
16:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> pipewire-alsa     Replace PulseAudio's ALSA plugin with PipeWire's plugin
16:10 <+bridge> <Learath2> You can use it though if you like
16:11 <+bridge> <Learath2> I don't have any ALSA clients left so I didn't even think about it
16:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> tbh im a bit confused with whats alsa and whatnot
16:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:11 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> do i have alsa clients
16:11 <+bridge> <Learath2> Yeah it is confusing, I think when we say "alsa client" we mean clients that use libalsa directly for their sound output
16:12 <+bridge> <Learath2> I guess there is no harm in enabling pipewire-alsa too just in case you do
16:12 <+bridge> <Learath2> No need for those to go through the pulseaudio plugin

16:25 <+bridge> <Learath2> did you set `-sound-server` on pulseaudio as suggested on the migration guide?
16:25 <+bridge> <Learath2> `-daemon` actually sorry
16:26 <+bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, that's why you have it, you didn't set `-daemon`
16:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i fixed it
16:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i had to deselect a library
16:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> sudo emerge --deselect media-sound/paprefs
16:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> > Removing media-sound/paprefs from "world" favorites file...
16:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i found some unholy thing in my rc-update
16:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> sudo emerge --deselect media-sound/paprefs
16:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> > Removing media-sound/paprefs from "world" favorites file...
16:30 <+bridge> <Learath2> eww
16:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> do u use udev btw?
16:30 <+bridge> <Learath2> but you are supposed to have it üòÑ
16:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
16:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> added global pipewire
16:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the only things that support it
16:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1100428740879716494/image.png
16:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> sad world
16:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> also added the session thing
16:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ill reboot and hope for the best, after obs finishes compiling
16:32 <+bridge> <Learath2> yeah, I've been meaning to migrate to eudev but didn't have time to mess around with it
16:32 <+bridge> <Learath2> udev breaking is more than a 20 minute issue to debug üòÑ
16:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ye xd
16:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> hello from the unbloated world
16:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> pipewire
16:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it works
16:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> my audio was at 40 but i put it at 100
16:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i control my audio from my bose speakers
16:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
16:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 2023-04-25 16:35:37 I client/sound: sound init successful using audio driver 'pulseaudio'
16:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ddnet says this tho
16:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i guess ddnet being ddnet
16:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> it is possible our sdl2 is too old, maybe compile a new one?
16:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh
16:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i recompiled sdl2 with the flag but not ddnet
16:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> same
16:37 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm

16:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> hehe
16:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i know it works thanks to mpv
16:40 <+bridge> <Learath2> Ah apparently SDL2 uses pulseaudio if it's available always
16:40 <+bridge> <Learath2> Try `SDL_AUDIODRIVER=pipewire ./DDNet`
16:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 2023-04-25 16:44:49 I client/sound: sound init successful using audio driver 'pipewire'
16:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh nice
16:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> should i export SDL_AUDIODRIVER=pipewire
16:45 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i will do it
17:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T6ClX-y2AE&t=2611s
17:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i got my cgit mirror up again
17:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://git.edgarluque.com/
17:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> im no longer affected by microsoft  closing github
17:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :BASEDHALT:
17:30 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> don't hold your breath, sourceforge is still up
17:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if github would be shutdown today, i wonder if gitlab could even handle it at all xD
17:35 <+bridge> <Learath2> They probably have good enough automation that they‚Äôll scale without problem
17:35 <+bridge> <Learath2> Running more gitlab nodes isn‚Äôt too hard
17:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wonder if gitlab is even that scalable
17:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean how many users does gitlab have, they probs never tested it with like 20times the amount xD
17:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> I think I remember some sharding in the code if needed
17:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or much more probably
17:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> cgit interface is so much faster
17:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> than github
17:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no js bloat
17:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it also has basically no functionalty xd
17:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so rewrite github in rust to compile it to wasm
17:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and hope that browsers will do more wasm optimizations soon
17:40 <+bridge> <deen> that's the best problem to have, everyone would be pumped to work on making it scale
17:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ^^ true
17:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> this reminded me of this

17:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (rust is mentioned there @Ryozuki :p )
17:55 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> oh nice
17:56 <+bridge> <ReiTW> what if ur file is only named \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.mkv
17:56 <+bridge> <ReiTW> what if ur file is only named ()[]()()()()()[]()()]()[)]([].mkv
18:06 <+bridge> <ReiTW> wtf bors big spammer
18:08 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> amazing PR @Robyt3
18:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> gotta try out the IME again ^^
18:33 <+bridge> <KDaniel> The newest version of Tater-Client crash if you try to load a map in map editor.
18:33 <+bridge> <KDaniel> Someone got this error too or was this a one of the last changes and i miss merged it? 
18:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> any specific map?
18:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does ddnet not crash?
18:42 <+bridge> <Robyt3> The exception implies that a file has no modified date or it could not be determined
18:46 <+bridge> <KDaniel> nah you cant get to the map select.. if you click on file-> load ... then it crashes
18:46 <+bridge> <KDaniel> 
18:46 <+bridge> <KDaniel> the person who told me this said that the newest ddnet version dont crash
18:47 <+bridge> <KDaniel> yea i understand the error message but i dont want to some new handling into system.cpp or other functions what is extra changes to the main branch
18:47 <+bridge> <Robyt3> I don't really understand this exception though. Here is the only result on the internet for it: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71345845/assertion-timeptr-nullptr
18:47 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Does Tater-Client have the same `str_timestamp_ex` implementation as ddnet?
18:49 <+bridge> <KDaniel> since tater-client don't need to change it this should be the same
18:58 <+bridge> <gerdoe> looks great
19:42 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> weechat is trash for Matrix but best for irc. I use gomuks for Matrix it‚Äôs quite solid
19:42 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> (@Jupeyy_Keks)
19:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nheko is fast, but not terminal based. and kinda looks like telegram xD
19:54 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Matrix is bad eitherway
19:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> send from matrix
19:54 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> The protocol is just bloat. And the main china controlled spynet matrix.org instance is slow af. And the federation is just annoying
19:55 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Okay gotta admit on iOS Matrix crap beats irc clients
19:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so what else can we use
19:56 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Which is also fair since real OGs don‚Äôt own phones
19:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i need smth that is as good as discord, and matrix is the only thing close
19:56 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> irc all the way
19:56 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Better than Matrix and discord combined
19:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ü§™
20:06 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> There used to be fosscord which apparently rebranded and took down their website that made it look like a Fortune 500 company https://github.com/spacebarchat/spacebarchat
20:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
20:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> good to know tho
20:08 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk how good it is. Honestly their good design and marketing scared me away.
20:09 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> For me every average corp marketing speech and modern front end seems like a scam site to me.
20:10 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> If you have a good product why would you need to advertise it. If your product is a scam or can‚Äôt speak for it self you need to rely on shiny ads banners and designs
