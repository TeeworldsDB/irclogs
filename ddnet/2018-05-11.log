01:44 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: do they not have an irc channel for that?
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I'm probably asking questions the wrong way â€“ most of the time when I ask something on IRC (as also this time), I get no answer in the channel
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Tell them you know what's wrong and give some non-sensical explanation and they'll start correcting you. Best way to ask ðŸ˜„
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we're getting closer to 500GiB of uncompressed teehistorian data
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> seems to be going at around 300GiB of compressed teehistorian data per year for me
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> really?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. both parts. which do you mean?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I thought we were running it for longer already
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just half a year so far?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh well, that's a bit of a problem then
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> My mirrors are running out of disk soon-ish
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you compress the data?
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mh
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so 100 GB compressed already, 100 still free
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so it will work until maybe end of the year
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> any new plans about what to do with all that data?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or just use it for checking botters?
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> one long-term idea would be to provide downloadable replays of races
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (it's far from being implemented)
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're free to drop your copy of teehistorian, I think we have two more, @Learath2's and mine
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why would you keep data of a year ago runs?
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or you notice botters so late that you need that data?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or you notice botters after long time that you need that data?
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess that was the intent behind de*en's question
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if we wanted to offer downloads of replays next to player's ranks, we'd still need all of them
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess you could do quite some stuff with this ðŸ™‚
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. overlaying all players playing a single map ðŸ˜„
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> would be funny to see where they fail
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> looks that wrong xD
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/444478095475474432/wrong_cursors.png
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ?
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> hook  collisions
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> hook collisions
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> red hook collisions
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> fix them.
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @DanilBest  thats a trick which is possible with a bind. you basicly set up the mouse max distance to 2 and you can only aim in 8 perfectly straight angles around you. very useful for double rockets
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also rly useful in some maps with 45Âº edgehook
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> that's not wrong xD
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> sorry
15:38 <+coffee> Hi there :)
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> hi
15:39 <+coffee> I have a specific question about DDNET and the GPDR compliance
15:39 <+coffee> How can we deal with this regulation when we're hosting a ddnet server?
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deleting the server logs regularly (if you keep them at all) should suffice
15:44 <+coffee> what about user authentication ?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> user authentication?
15:44 <+coffee> yea 
15:44 <+coffee> user login / password
15:44 <+coffee> lol
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's only between you and staff members, isn't it?
15:45 <+coffee> Sure, but let's talk about some other modded contents
15:46 <+coffee> The thing mod against zombies with leveling
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not a ddnet thing though. but we can also talk about that
15:46 <+coffee> This mod ask the registration
15:46 <+coffee> Players need to be registered to get xp
15:47 <+coffee> by example what if I write this feature for ddnet ?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not going to happen, probably? ^^
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what kind of XP would you earn?
15:48 <+coffee> You could keep your items when logout
15:48 <+coffee> When I made blockz I had this idea
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably: read the GDPR ^^
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you need to give users the possibility to view and remove their data
15:55 <+coffee> it seems to be a pain
15:55 <+coffee> are you talking from slack ?
15:55 <@heinrich5991> no, from discord
15:55 <@heinrich5991> why is that a pain?
15:57 <@heinrich5991> afaik you don't have to automate it
15:57 <+coffee> Well, I will have to provide several big features : Registration form with privacy infos, tool for exporting recorded data about the users, etc.
15:59 <@heinrich5991> afaik exporting recorded data doesn't have to be automatic
15:59 <@heinrich5991> but you have definitely have to do it on request
15:59 <@heinrich5991> but that sounds like a simple SQL query
15:59 <+coffee> This is not a mere task
16:00 <+coffee> And it has to be automated :p
16:00 <@heinrich5991> where do you read that?
16:00 <+coffee> Because i'm lazy
16:01 <@heinrich5991> because you're lazy what?
16:01 <+coffee> I'm lazy people cannot rely on me to delete their data
16:02 <+coffee> The whole thing has to be automated
16:02 <@heinrich5991> you could automate it once the first request comes in
16:02 <@heinrich5991> I mean it's easier to build a small script that does it
16:02 <@heinrich5991> than to build a UI around it
16:04 <+coffee> also what about the ddnet forums ?
16:04 <@heinrich5991> I guess the software will give a solution to that
16:05 <+coffee> https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=2419821
16:05 <+coffee> I found this topic
16:09 <+coffee> I guess it's a pain for phpbb too heinrich5991 :D
16:10 <@heinrich5991> I think the GDPR is reasonable
16:10 <@heinrich5991> if complying with these privacy regulations is pain, then there were privacy issues before
16:10 <+coffee> I mean phpbb didn't find a proper balance
16:10 <+coffee> phpbb is not ready yet
16:10 <@heinrich5991> they had 2 years
16:12 <+coffee> I know i can't speak for them.
16:13 <+coffee> but, heh, good luck with that :p
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> How do I compile Teeworlds (Vanilla) server from master? When I follow the guid for compiling 0.7 it compiles but when I run it, it says something like `Input point for procedure _ZdlPvj not found in library *path to executable*` and closes
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mh. sounds strange
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> It's windows after all
21:58 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vpyoH
21:58 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master a7b7789 def: Add sv_sql_validservernames (fixes #1123)

22:05 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 59675fe def: Rate-limit /lock (fixes #1122)
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> I think it's giving mw errors because of a missing flag for mingw when it compiles Teeworlds
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kriss7475> I'll try adding the flag tomorrow
