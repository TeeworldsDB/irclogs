02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> why 23 letters alphabet?
02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> which 3 letters are missing?
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> seems like some ppl registered with qqq email provider and they return my mails (wiki) for dmarc check fails lol
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> will have to check later..
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> zzz
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got this
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1054409677846360085/IMG-20221219-WA0032.png
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from my company
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> M1 2021
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kek
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im being filthied!
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> lol
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so another macos dev now
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> pls test molten-vk
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and also pls make it work, disable all vsync etc
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i want to finally know m1 fps
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bruv
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i gotta unpack first xd
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> plug in and go
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <dieKartoffel> Woah
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet must be first game to install
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it weights quite a lot
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Same as mine I guess
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they put stones inside, so it doesnt fly away in the wind
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but dont tell anyone
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think they put enough cooling mass inside that I haven't heard the fan yet in 1 year of usage
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xDD
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the laptop itself is cold
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupeyy_Keks I'll try with vulkan again
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Since the FPS bug was fixed, can probably ship with moltenvk support now
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if its really fixed ^^
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It‚Äôs like a solid block of metal too, so much headroom
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupeyy_Keks About 1700 fps at 1920x1080
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice on which map, is it more than opengl at least? üòÑ
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But with graphics bug in main menu
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1054423342880411819/Screenshot_2022-12-19_at_16.41.22.png

16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Multeasymap with entities
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it peaks to 6k
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> there still smth wrong probably xD
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> also peaks to 10k inbetween
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> neat clipping bug on the last pic
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The image is also blurry
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh  too bad smth makes it not use full power
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think it can still beat my CPU
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> (CPU is main bottle neck in entities)
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1054424098945634355/image.png
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> OpenGL3 is at 2200 fps
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The clipping bug looks like the one that has been there for half a decade now üòõ
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it should‚Ñ¢Ô∏è be fixed, since we respect the ratio between window size and canvas size
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tsfreddie even tested it back then
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It was macOS not reporting the correct viewport size on first launch with highdpi iirc
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i guess its an SDL bug then?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I remember tsfreddie working on it, it was supposed to be fixed I guess
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Iii think sdl generates a resize event after a while, even tho your early call returns the wrong size
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We could just ping SDL to get correct size after initializing everything from our side maybe
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> void CGraphics_Threaded::ClipEnable(int x, int y, int w, int h)
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> {
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     if(x < 0)
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>         w += x;
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     if(y < 0)
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>         h += y;
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     x = clamp(x, 0, ScreenWidth());
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     y = clamp(y, 0, ScreenHeight());
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     w = clamp(w, 0, ScreenWidth() - x);
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     h = clamp(h, 0, ScreenHeight() - y);
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     m_State.m_ClipEnable = true;
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     m_State.m_ClipX = x;
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     m_State.m_ClipY = ScreenHeight() - (y + h);
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     m_State.m_ClipW = w;
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     m_State.m_ClipH = h;
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> }
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it directly uses the window width apparently
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen do u also have this bug in opengl?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Iirc just reacting to all sdl resize events properly just fixed it. Though I thought we do that now, idk. Atleast that‚Äôs how I fixed it when making teeworlds resize properly
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, not seen with opengl
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe a moltenvk issue?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think this causes it:
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > [mvk-info] Created 3 swapchain images with initial size (3840, 2160) and contents scale 2.0 for screen LG HDR WQHD.
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> which is wrong, 2.0 scale is on my other screen
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> on this screen 1.0 scale
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> rip
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but maybe we also fetch it incorrectly
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is it screen index 1? üòÑ
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> on the other hand, i dont even have control over it over the SDL Vulkan interface
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> screen 0 is the LG one where I want to display it
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> screen 1 is internal scaled screen
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk how we get it in vk, but in gl it used to be a mismatch between the size you could query thru sdl and the size you got by a direct gl call. Only one of them were correct
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And everything looking blurry on Vulkan, so it probably renders at half resolution and then scales
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I ever get my macbook fixed I can investigate it again, but for now it‚Äôs prohibitively expensive
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 700‚Ç¨ for a keyboard change‚Ä¶ insanity
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Seems like atm it's not that important since OpenGL has higher performance than MoltenVK still
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which is actually kinda surprising given how much better vk maps onto metal, which I guess is the only thing the m1 gpu actually supports
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in vulkan its basically like this
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ask SDL for a surface
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> query surface capabilities:
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```c++
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     uint32_t                         minImageCount;
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     uint32_t                         maxImageCount;
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     VkExtent2D                       currentExtent;
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     VkExtent2D                       minImageExtent;
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     VkExtent2D                       maxImageExtent;
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     uint32_t                         maxImageArrayLayers;
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     VkSurfaceTransformFlagsKHR       supportedTransforms;
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR    currentTransform;
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     VkCompositeAlphaFlagsKHR         supportedCompositeAlpha;
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     VkImageUsageFlags                supportedUsageFlags;
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> create images with that info
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The FPS jumping between 6k and 0 sounds like another bad bug in the MoltenVK implemetnation
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If you want to change something there, you can ping me to test it, easy enough to run vulkan
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean if molten vk itself already says something about wrong scale, i guess its falsely aware of what happens under the hood üòÑ
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does the vk backend also recheck the extents after sdl resize events?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> My guess is that it somehow uses the scaling info from wrong screen
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> vulkan doesnt need this
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it can basically run without SDL for surface related stuff
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats also one of the pros vs opengl
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs it can run on any thread unrelated to SDL
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yes, you know when the surface propertys changed
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen do we still wait after submitting one frame?
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> on m1
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> was it opengl only?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```c++
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> #ifdef CONF_PLATFORM_MACOS
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>     if(str_find(GetVersionString(), "Metal"))
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>         WaitForIdle();
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> #endif
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well no idea if this affects the vk backend too
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but normally‚Ñ¢Ô∏è this limitation should not affect vulkan
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe they even fixed it for opengl already, tho on OpenGL other than Vulkan its indeed a SDL call to swap images
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no difference
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1054451537096749106/NIF_output_over_10_years.png
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the breakthrough from not long ago
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> But as far as i heard it's not really a breakthrough
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iit confirms the theory it is not just a engineering problem
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> The total energy is still minutes 298 mj
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that u can make this energy without an immense gravitational well
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like the sun
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Minus
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a breakthrough vs what we had before xd
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats a breakthrough
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> But magnetic fusion is probably still better. Like iter
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> This is a different concept
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34037794
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The technique used at the National Ignition Facility involved shooting 192 lasers at a 0.04 inch (1 mm) pellet of fuel made of deuterium and tritium ‚Äì two versions of the element hydrogen with extra neutrons ‚Äì placed in a gold canister. When the lasers hit the canister, they produce X-rays that heat and compress the fuel pellet to about 20 times the density of lead and to more than 5 million degrees Fahrenheit (3 million Celsius) ‚Äì 
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The fuel and canister get vaporized within a few billionths of a second during the experiment. Researchers then hope their equipment survived the heat and accurately measured the energy released by the fusion reaction.
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks also about the fuel
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Finally, while one part of the fuel, deuterium, is naturally abundant in sea water, tritium is much rarer. Fusion itself actually produces tritium, so researchers are hoping to develop ways of harvesting this tritium directly. In the meantime, there are other methods available to produce the needed fuel.
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> A friend works at cern and he says it's nice to have but not really a game changer yet
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sadge
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Fusion will probably not play a role for climate change
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if it works
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its seen as the holy grail

19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> When we put the Master Server in the VPS, it gives us complete and correct server information
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> But when we remove it and put it on a new client, we run into a problem and it gives us this error.

19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> lets be honest many code was already invented by someone else
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just as many knowledge that is shared doesnt have the true source in it but some newspaper or similar xD
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> now with AIs, what source do u even want to give? XD
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it works when the masterserver is on the same machine, but it does not work when it's on a different machine?
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> Yes Ÿà it works when the masterserver is on the same machine, but it does not work when it's on a different machine?
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> But my master server has no problem
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm trying to understand the situation you're explaining to me
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not yet trying to give a solution
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you explain again when it does work and when it doesn't?
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't understand this: do you mean you put the master server on a new vps?
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> yes, When we try to add the MasterServer, we get the same error that we sent
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's the situation in which it works?

20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> DDPER
20:11 <+ChillerDragon> yea i figured
20:12 <+ChillerDragon> but why not use the existing master servers? is it because the persian internet is cut off or something like that?
20:12 <+ChillerDragon> and can i also register on your masterserver? o.O what is your master servers ip?

20:15 <+ChillerDragon> you are missing SSL o.O
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> master server
20:16 <+ChillerDragon> yes master server but why do you need a master server for anti bot client?
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> Are you familiar with DDPER?
20:16 <+ChillerDragon> not really thats why i am curious
20:16 <+ChillerDragon> its not my ping zone
20:16 <+ChillerDragon> i heard once that its a bit cut off from the internet we use with like own subnets and stuff

20:17 <+ChillerDragon> yes that much i know
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> but what motivated you to go through the effort of hosting own master servers?
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> network speed?
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> i created new master server i used rust/cargo
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> iranian Linux
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> yes 
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> but why
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> https://ddnet-persian.ir/
20:18 <+ChillerDragon> xd
20:18 <+ChillerDragon> yea its still loading...
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> WTF üòê
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> The internet is weak
20:18 <+ChillerDragon> yes
20:18 <+ChillerDragon> so you added your own master server for speed?
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> The internet is weak
20:19 <+ChillerDragon> yes okay i think i got it
20:21 <+ChillerDragon> im not sure if the ssl is an error @heinrich5991 do the servers expect ssl from the master server?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, they do, ChillerDragon
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> well thats the issue then isnt it?
20:24 <+ChillerDragon> https://ddper.ir/

20:26 <+ChillerDragon> a
20:26 <+ChillerDragon> nvm then
20:26 <+ChillerDragon> i assume you use a closed source modified ddnet server to talk with the master right?
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> Ow yess
20:29 <+ChillerDragon> and you changed the ``sv_register_url`` config variable?
20:29 <+ChillerDragon> did you try if your master works with an unmodified ddnet server just to make sure that this is not the issue?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> i checked
20:34 <+ChillerDragon> and did it work? or not?
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> No
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> w8
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> yes i changed it src
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> I have no problem with rust and I turn it on on your client. It is completely fixed. When I turn on my master server, I have a problem and it gives a udp error.

21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> i changed sv_register_url and in src code
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that means the game server did not receive the packet from the master server
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> that means the game server did not receive the packet from the master server
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> My master server does not send the information to the client
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you watched it in wireshark?
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wait, why the client?
21:10 <+pample> Hey, points shown on https://ddnet.org/maps/Divinum-32-V2 doesn't seem to reflect points shows in game, not too sure if that's normal or already reported somewhere, maybe it just changed today and the website wasn't updated yet idk only the static part seem to be on github 
21:11 <+ChillerDragon> yo heinrich in case u want a wireshark oneliner ``wget -O /tmp/per.pcap curl https://zillyhuhn.com/tmp/per.pcap;wireshark /tmp/per.pcap``
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what pcap is that?

21:18 <+ChillerDragon> why tho?
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> Chiller Can i see Server ?
21:18 <+ChillerDragon> which?
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> https://master.ddper.ir/servers.json
21:18 <+ChillerDragon> i could reproduce your issue i guess
21:18 <+ChillerDragon> but i dont have a fix
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> You turned it on
21:19 <+ChillerDragon> wot
21:19 <+ChillerDragon> i tried to connect to your master yes
21:19 <+ChillerDragon> did not work
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> Look, when we connect the master server to our client, we face a problem
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, it seems the problem is between game server and masterserver
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> And the servers do not appear on the main page of our client
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> No
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because the masterserver doesn't list them, I guess
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> Server And Client fixed
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you see the server in the https://master.ddper.ir/servers.json list in the browser?
21:21 <+ChillerDragon> no
21:21 <+ChillerDragon> so far it seems like a master issue
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then it doesn't seem like it's a problem with the client
21:22 <+ChillerDragon> yea
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> because the masterserver doesn't list them, I guess @heinrich5991
21:22 <+ChillerDragon> might be language barrier tho
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but then it's not a client issue
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> How does teeworlds master server work?
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> @heinrich5991
21:25 <+ChillerDragon> he playn da game chil
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> How does teeworlds master server work?
21:27 <+ChillerDragon> how do you mean "how does it work"? Do you want the technical details? Or how to run it?
21:27 <+ChillerDragon> i think u did pretty fine job running it since the web endpoint looks good
21:27 <+ChillerDragon> and you probably wanna know how the ddnet master works not the teeworlds one
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> I just want to know how you turned on the master server and it is active
21:28 <+ChillerDragon> the teeworlds one uses udp as far as i know and the ddnet one is a rust rewrite by heinrich which introduced some http stuff
21:28 <+ChillerDragon> yes thats what i thought
21:28 <+ChillerDragon> you did turn it on correctly
21:28 <+ChillerDragon> just something is broken :D
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> What is the problem that does not turn on? And the list is not shown on the server?

21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> at least, they give the source for the material there
21:33 <+ChillerDragon> hm heinrich what does "Not found" mean? could you extend the error message to say what was not found? https://master.zillyhuhn.com/servers.json
21:33 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/648b025906251182f5c626fc6536cca00a1e553e/src/mastersrv/src/main.rs#L849
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the masterserver doesn't serve servers.json
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you need to serve it using your own webserver
21:33 <+ChillerDragon> oh wot
21:33 <+ChillerDragon> interesting
21:33 <+ChillerDragon> is there docs on setting up a master server?
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, sorry
21:34 <+ChillerDragon> ah no i guess thatll do thanks
21:34 <+ChillerDragon> putting that sentence of yours in a readme.md at src/mastersrv would probably be sufficent
21:36 <+ChillerDragon> okay that might be an error source tho
21:45 <+ChillerDragon> https://master.zillyhuhn.com/servers.json
21:45 <+ChillerDragon> pog got server registered
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice üôÇ
21:46 <+ChillerDragon> do you use the latest master server? @OR-MAhdiyar could you leak a bit of your setup how do you serve the servers.json why is your endpoint https://master.ddper.ir/register and not https://master.ddper.ir/ddnet/15/register ?
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> It is not necessary to put the version in the link  we generally use 1 version of the client, when we update, we update the master server as well
21:52 <+ChillerDragon> so you edited the master server code too?
21:53 <+ChillerDragon> did you try running an unedited master server already?
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> Yes
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> yes
21:54 <+ChillerDragon> did it work?
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> No, It worked when the master server was on a VPS
21:57 <+ChillerDragon> where is it now if not on a VPS?
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> where is it now if not on a VPS?
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> It is located in another VPS
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> Now the master is separate in another VPS
22:00 <+ChillerDragon> maybe some firewall things? if its the exact setup
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> ufw and iptable disabled
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> .
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> amm
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> chiller?
22:18 <+ChillerDragon> ye?
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> ufw and iptable disabled
22:19 <+ChillerDragon> yea i meant more your hoster maybe
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> What should I do now?
22:21 <+ChillerDragon> make sure the setup is the same on the vps that works and one the one that does not
22:22 <+ChillerDragon> if it is really the same then contact your hoster maybe
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, I'd try it with a differnet server first
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> localhost is kind of a special case
22:23 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea it was client and server on the same host true
22:23 <+ChillerDragon> is the master on the other vps that was working still up?
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> Yes thi on
22:24 <+ChillerDragon> whats the url?
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> Yes ths
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> https://master.ddper.ir/servers.json
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> this?
22:24 <+ChillerDragon> no this doesnt work
22:24 <+ChillerDragon> you said on the other vps it did work
22:25 <+ChillerDragon> do you have the url of the other vps?
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> no this doesnt work
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> yes my vps
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> I only use this client master server
22:33 <+ChillerDragon> i do not know what you mean by "client"
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <OR-MAhdiyar> im used master server for client
22:47 <+ChillerDragon> you mean teeworlds/ddnet client as in the game client it self? There is no need to introduce that for testing until servers.json shows entries. Its much easier/faster to test with the browser
22:49 <+ChillerDragon> the language barrier is a bit annoying sorry i go to bed now. Hilarious that we already have ai that perfectly understands english and code. And yet there is no way to communicate with people that do not share a common language.
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you actually tried using a translator? ^^
