10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 why did you use `#define GET_INT(integer) (integer) = str_toint(Up.GetString())` instead of `Up.GetInt()`?
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because I figured it would be easier to implement for third-party software
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> feel free to change it, I think in 0.7 they changed it for the normal protocol as well @Learath2
15:07 <@Learath2> heinrich5991: I have a very tough issue with fixing the protocol compatibility in 0.7, do you have a second to brainstorm?
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Learath2: what's the issue?
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Old versions trust m_NumClient to be the amount of clients we send. But we cant know how many clients fit in the packet before we craft it
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had a very meh idea of crafting the packet until we add num clients, craft the rest of the packet and drop clients until the extra int for numclient fits, however you know that's very ugly due to the way the packer works
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only two ways I know of to pop off clients is either finding a way to iterate the packer backwards or keep note of the offsets of every client I add, both are ;(
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> returning different server info depending on the requesting client is not an option?
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 problem is how many clients we send to an oldclient
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> remember offset of last client
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> after each client check that the int + header + clients still fit
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if not, return previous packet
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (use `CVariableInt` directly)
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I'm stupid, I tried handling it after I filled the packet
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ofc I should handle it during filling it. Thanks @heinrich5991
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're welcome 😉
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Two heads are better then one :P
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my uni postponed the next semester by one week, corona
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or rather my state (berlin) did that
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A month for italian unis
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have other effects? 🙂
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I'm completely stuck in istanbul
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But friends who are stuck on the other side in italy report that the streets are completely empty and the vibe is pretty meh
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> got a sensible computer at least?
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 sensible enough for working on some coding
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't deserve to play games anyway so I don't mind
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ~~
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 how is berlin? Italy is supposedly the worst in europe but idk
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> berlin looks fine
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> people go about their day mostly as usual
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> large events are cancelled, at least the uni tries to encourage people to work from home
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> btw, are you into coding challenges?
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I found some nice ones: https://cryptopals.com/
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 r u doing the ctf that liveoverflow announced?
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, link?
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> liveoverflow is a fun watch, I thought the guy was @heinrich5991 for a while 😛
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nowhere near that skilled
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Wtf @Learath2
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://youtu.be/kLZdnvvQRKY
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cscg
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I considered participating this year
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I tried but too lazy
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doit
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> The Perl challenge is so frustrating
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 he might be more acquainted with ctfs but dont undersell yourself :P
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're flattering me, thanks 😛
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I've never really done any serious RE unfortunately
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I should kick myself a little more. I'd love to do some hardware disassembly/RE
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm actually also really interested in some hardware work, especially "security" devices
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd be fine with non-security devices for starters
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That ring buffer attack on most garage doors was really interesting e.g.
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> given that I have no experience
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ring buffer?
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not a ring buffer, soz. A shift register
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> shift register? 🙂
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Turns out many garage doors out there use a shift register to store the transmitted code, which allows you to reduce the amount of transmissions needed by a whole lot which made all of them very easy to bruteforce
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know what a shift register ist
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *is
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, it's a type of register you can shift bits into, and out of one at a time. Like a queue of bits
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Problem was that the cpu was checking the code every time a bit is pushed and not after getting all 12 bits
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You generate a string of all possible 12 bit combinations with overlap and transmit that a couple times instead
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Turns out to be a lot less bits then without overlap. The guy figured it out with one of those logic analyzers
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think there was a youtube video where he describes how he devised the attack
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 happen to have the link?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also @Learath2 mind merging the antibot stuff? ^^
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :f3:
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I'll find you the link when I get home, I'll review the antibot stuff as soon as I'm done with this extended serverinfo patch for 0.7
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 is there a way to estimate the size of a packed int cheaper then Packing it?
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just pack it. should be optimized out
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (if you pack it into a buffer that is not used elsewhere)
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You sure? i'd need to pack it and then subtract the buffer from the end of the packed data, is the compiler clever enough?
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well I guess if any compiler is smart enough it's a C/C++ compiler, those are so aggressive with optimisations
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> cant u assume max size (4 bytes per?) if its only an estimate
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://godbolt.org/z/LYWgCt
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> seems so
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that it's optimized out
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 one more little bug and I can review yours, do you know of a way to append a packer to a packer?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tried adding the second packer as raw, but that doesn't seem to work :/
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AddRaw(.Data(), .Size())
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `AddRaw(.Data(), .Size())`
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> should work
16:19 <@Learath2> Ah I forgot to reset the packer
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the liveoverflow is apologizing for the name
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rightfully so 😛
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> NOOO, old clients don't trust the m_NumClients so the server looks as full as the amount of clients we send
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 is that an acceptable shortcoming? I don't think I can fix it
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> wasnt this a problem during ddos attacks
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> when the server wasnt sending players
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and then not showing up
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they "fixed" it in 0.7
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you can't send short packets anymore
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> eh
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well given in the past the server wouldn't even show up if the clients didn't fit in the packet I think this is acceptable
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when in reality they only helped mitigate dos attacks
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 yes
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i guess im thinking of a different problem then
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but the one i describe is where the client tries to determine playercount by counting the players the server sends
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> which doesnt work when the server omits player list under heavy load
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2492 I'm done
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Take a look at mine, I'll take a look at yours 😛
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I won't merge yours though(?)
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oy does that
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 why do you drop the more-players-packet if it arrives before the main packet?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 because the entry doesn't exist by then and I have no idea how to handle that
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and yeah I know you won't merge, just looking for a review
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think™ ddnet handles that
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe you can take a look at that
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for the protocol extension, I'd add a UUID, and scan the whole packet for it
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just so that you're compatible with other (possible, unlikely to exist) modifications
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 this isn't really a whole extension, I'm not sure if we can extend the protocol without breaking compatibility
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I kept the initial packet the same so the old clients can also use it, I have "giex" for requests from the serverbrowser but that's not really a thing for ingame serverinfo updates, we'd need some way to keep track of the version of the client and whether it supports the new protocol, is that a thing vanilla wants? I'm not sure if oy would merge an extension like that
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 why do you have a separate `ANTIBOT_MAX_CLIENTS`? Shouldn't you tie that into the engines `MAX_CLIENTS` so there is no chance it falls out of sync?
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have a separate `ANTIBOT_MAX_CLIENTS` so that the API doesn't accidentally become incompatible
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe I should add a test that they're the same and add a comment to recompile all anticheat modules if you change it
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> given that there are probably no protocol extensions that you could be incompatible with, I guess this is fine
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (re your PR)
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Your pr LGTM, the last concern I have is how we'll build the official servers
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do we build official servers?
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Currently we just git pull and build, I think we need a new (private)repo for the antibot code
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nah
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> antibot can be built sporadically and the `.so` can just be copied in after the built
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> antibot can be built sporadically and the `.so` can just be copied in after the build
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does this generate an antibot.so?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the build? yes
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you add `ANTIBOT=ON` to the command line
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so we just don't copy the one built along with the server and use @onby's module instead
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Great, I don't see any issues then
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> \o/
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :D
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hi ping
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> hi
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> cool to see this geting implemented
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We still should have a private repo with the antibot code we can all work on
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> currently it's an almost-not-modified version of noby's
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> gitlab?
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just includes
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and I believe no one except noby really wants to change that code 😄 @ @onby
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can merge this tonight and we can try deploying it. Will add a new script to ddnet-scripts to pull from a repository and build the antibot too
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i plan on making updates
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ive been constantly updating it for the past couple years rly lol
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I do trust @onby but I'd still not want to run code we can't see on ddnet servers
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes sure
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just a note regards modification
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just a note regarding modification
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ye if we make a private repo for the 3 of us or whichever other admins then its fine as long as the code never leaves that repo
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Github private repo?
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> would work up to a couple of members, not as a subrepo of ddnet though
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i use gitlab since free private repos
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, I could own the repo, ddnet org doesn't have private repo allowance
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, you're even have a subscription
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, you even have a subscription
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nah, I'm a student
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we could host the repo on gitlab aswell if you prefer that
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (I'm a student for atleast 2 more years so that'd be the lifetime) 😛
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its about the same right
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> other than offering free private. repos
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, github too, for up to three (four?) collaborators
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> is that new
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i only moved from gitlab to github because of the private repos thing
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if yall can do it on github then fine by me
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, I'll create the repo on github, add y'all as contributors
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :D
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> so when i make fixes to the anti bot code
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i will push them there? and theyll be added whenever is next convienent time
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> exactly
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> sounds good
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can we push our glue code there, as well?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> glue code?
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @onby
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, glue code from the other side
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the code was fucking entangled 😛
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> like the code that connects the
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well it'd be nice if you could use the .so on your servers aswell @onby
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yes heinrich made stuff a lot cleaner in the interface
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 private repo when
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and at some point i wana use wat he did
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> on blocker at least, fng is a different repo cus laser stuff
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean I could try to help you with that code as well, if you want
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so we can have one unified codebase
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ❤️
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby what is your github name?
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :heartw:
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> https://github.com/nobody-mb
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 you can push whenever
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have horrible rebound rhinitis and it's giving me headaches :/
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 how could ddnet handle the main packet not arriving first?
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you queue up the packets based on NETADDR or sth?
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> storing the players for that IP address
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see no easy way to do that
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 🎉
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 let me try building this on the server
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> see if it loads antibot null
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I already modified stuff on ddnet.tw
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> go there plx
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (only added flags, maybe to git clean if you want a clean slate)
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, be careful with git clean I guess
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> git checkout -- build.sh
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm trying it out on ddnet.tw btw
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just there for now
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> k 🙂
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> food
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 ddnet.tw:8370 now runs antibot null
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 all the servers are going to be running antibot null in a second, but there is an issue
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the server binary links to libantibot.so in the src folder, seems it is linked with absolute path, you need to do sth there to not do absolute paths but I'm no dynamic linkingwizard
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```ddnetger ldd DDRace64-Server_sql | grep antibot
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2>     libantibot.so => /home/teeworlds/src/master-build/libantibot.so 
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (0x00007f174f4ff000)```
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 other servers won't load the antibot or the debug message is somehow getting lost, I need to go
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> please take a look
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> uh oh xd
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It compiled fine and I checked that it also linked fine and it can find the dynamic lib, checked it through ldd
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And if I run the server manually it does load the antibot, however if i let the server restart it wont
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Couldnt figure it out and had to leave
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Is antibot also on 0.7 servers? 🙂
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon no. antibot isn't really on 0.6 either, it's just a test phase right now
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the changes needed can be seen here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2081
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I think it broke something and I dont have my laptop with me, can you please take a look?
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I only have a couple of minutes
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 restart doesn't work, you say?
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Restart doesnt work but more importantly @nexus says votes are broken
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ~~
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think you should just roll it back if you dont have the time to diagnose
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what to do to rollback?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ./build after checking out the commit?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Yeah votes are broken, i can't change map rn
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Gwendal server, port?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I think so, am not completely sure
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> ddnet ger 8309
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 change is applied everywhere?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> jao tested with admin command and it didn't work aswell
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks like a crash on map change
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> will roll back
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I have a build-fixup.sh there for this occasion
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks good, ty
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what do I need to do after executing this script?
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nothing, I guess
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you check the script, im not a 100% sure if i do the copying
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you do
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> checked the script
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thanks, had to leave urgently
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Gwendal ger2 should be fine now, can you check? maybe try twice
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> ok
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> 1st time didn't work
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> ok
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> 2nd worked
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> thanks!
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice, ty
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> k, empty servers restarted, should be good now
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> classic "didn't test the map change" bug from me 😦
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I should add that to the test suite
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what the crash is, you dont seem to change anything relevant
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the server crashes after the map change
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably some data structure in the antibot that thinks some player is still there
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> will take a look tonight, have to leave now
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> ye it just go back on the map that was here before voting
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> and it says u got timeout
