00:41 < shorefire_> deen: hey :)
00:41 < shorefire_> deen: uploading now lol
00:42 < shorefire_> Her webcam isnt great but hey, it'll do
01:05 < shorefire_> hey deen, you around? :)
01:07 < shorefire_> deen: the deed is done, want a clue? ;)
01:13 < eeeee> kek
01:13 < eeeee> whats all the drama about?
01:14 <@deen> i muted him on a server, he's trying to blackmail me into letting him do what he wants on DDNet servers
01:14 <@deen> which means insulting and blocking people mainly
01:14 <@deen> or you mean the separate drama we had before?
01:14 < eeeee> blackmail you how?
01:14 < eeeee> was he gonna post some exposing content here or what
01:15 <@deen> not going to comment on that, sorry
01:15 < eeeee> just curious why a ban was warranted instead of just keeping that clown around here
01:16 < eeeee> and if he really wants to post some stuff i don't really see how a ban would stop him
01:17 < eeeee> there's always webchat...
01:17 < eeeee> anyway good luck dealing with that
01:21 <@deen> I still don't like drama, would prefer to do something more productive instead
01:23 < eeeee> drama is inevitable unfortunately, especially so when you have a single person in charge of everything (and a single lady person in charge of testing) and a community of kids which serves as catalyst
17:26 < BeaR_> hui \o
17:26 <@deen> hi
17:26 <@deen> Everything alright, BeaR_ ? Haven't seen you here for some time I thin
17:26 <@deen> k
17:26 < BeaR_> yep, thanks (:
17:26 < BeaR_> working on my bachelor thesis ^^
17:26 < BeaR_> so have some less spare time
17:28 <@EastByte> hello BeaR_ :)
17:28 < BeaR_> hey
18:29 <@deen> I should also be working on my master thesis =/
18:29 <@deen> BeaR_: doing anything interesting?
18:30 < BeaR_> fluid simulation on mobile systems (:
18:30 <@deen> why on mobile systems?
18:30 < BeaR_> love this topic^^
18:30 < BeaR_> opengl es 3.1 came out with compute shader support
18:30 < BeaR_> well
18:31 < BeaR_> also some request by a larger company or sth like this
18:31 <@deen> what's their/any application?
18:31 < BeaR_> to test how fast it can be
18:31 < BeaR_> games probably
18:31 <@deen> great
18:32 <@deen> I'm mentoring someone on a Nim GSoC project even though we weren't accepted to GSoC^^
18:32 < BeaR_> haha :D
18:32 < BeaR_> which topic ?
18:32 <@deen> https://github.com/Araq/Nim/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas#high-level-game-library
18:33 < BeaR_> ah cool (:
18:33 <@deen> The guy has worked 6 years in the gaming industry and knows the emscripten developers personally, sounds promising
18:34 < BeaR_> hm whole summer for 500loc :D?
18:35 <@deen> huh?
18:35 < BeaR_> he probably able to write in less then a week :d
18:35 <@deen> the minecraft clone needs a nice framework below it
18:35 < BeaR_> nvm ^^
18:35 < Nimda> Alpha by Kosho just released on Solo at 2015-05-15 18:32
18:35 <@deen> and yeah, most of our projects wouldn't take a whole summer
18:35 <@deen> the idea was that you could combine or extend them
18:36 < BeaR_> ah nice
20:10 < Nimda> Ice Water by Ñı©Ø just released on Novice at 2015-05-15 20:07
20:37 < lady> eeeee
20:50 <@deen> lady: he may be at work
20:50 < lady> but this web client has bug
20:51 < lady> or I'm too stupid for that
20:51 <@heinrich5991> tell what you'd tell eeeee
20:51 <@heinrich5991> maybe someone else knows the answer
20:53 < lady> I took 2  weapons and when I'm switching them with mousewheel, it's changing only between like hammer and rocket :c
20:53 < lady> instead of hammer, pistol and my 2 weapons
20:56 <@deen> that sounds like a bug
20:56 <@deen> I hope 1-5 work at least
20:56 < lady> yes
20:56 < lady> but it's ok if I took one weapon
20:56 < lady> and not ok when I have nothing (it should switch between pistol and hammer but it doesn nothing)
20:58 <@deen> very strange, no idea how that could have happened
20:58 <@deen> I guess eeeee will see this later
20:58 < lady> bye then...
21:08 < eeeee> uh
21:09 < eeeee> that's weird, i never tested that
21:10 < eeeee> but i thought people use the mouse wheel only to make noise
21:10 < eeeee> coz pressing 1-5 to switch is way more efficient
21:25 <@deen> haha
21:29 <@heinrich5991> look at the top of hn :)
21:30 <@deen> i know
21:30 <@deen> I was thinking about congratulating in the name of the Nim team, but that may be seen as a cheap marketing trick
