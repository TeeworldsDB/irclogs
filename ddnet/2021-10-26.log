00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> Tilemaps can reference more than one image/spritesheet
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> 
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> Wdym by polygons with 4 vertices? Is this for a specific feature? Polygons in Tiled have no vertex limitations.
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> Or do you mean other way aroubd? I see
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> those are teeworlds/ddnet map limitations
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> So im not sure what you mean by polygons, but yeah, I'm imagining that you would use a Tiled python script that will output JSON conformant to your own ddnet JSON format, and when it encounters those sorts of limitations it issues an error to the user
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yeah I guess just throwing an error would be fine. you convinced me that its probably possible to create workarounds for everything
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> currently I'm not really motivated enough to start this, the size and complexity of the tiled map format make it a little daunting and I currently enjoy other projects more (currently I'm working on a blender add-on to import teeworlds/ddnet maps and am making good progress :D https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap-blender/ ). If I come back to to working on twmap maybe I'll go for the tiled format, having someone I can ask for help would definitel
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> Oh yeah like I said, you can just do JSON for everything. For my game I never touch TMX etc its all json
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> blender lol
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> just porting ddnet maps to everything now
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> raytraced ddnet map pleaae
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> raytracing nice
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> could also make a mod "what does the tee actually see" where you can only see outline of everything, bcs thats what a 2d entity would see
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> that wouldn't be hard to prototype at all too
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> but yeah for raytracing 2D stuff you have to allow some refraction to avoid that
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is your game available somewhere, or just an educational project?
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> its an ugly wip https://github.com/AODQ/pulcher
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> i do the Tiled JSON map loading stuff here tho if thats what you were asking https://github.com/AODQ/pulcher/blob/master/plugins/base/src/base/map/map.cpp
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> Just use JSON loader and ignore anything tiled related
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the youtube video looks quite impressive
02:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> thanks. im working on the AI for the single player campaign enemies but I hate writing AI lol
03:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> looks very similar to Soldat 🙂
03:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> Yeah it takes a lot of stuff from Soldat. If you've played Xonotic a lot of weapons and mechanics are similar to that too
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> New Multeasy update?
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> image.png
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/902461804318445588/image.png
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lmao pistol damage \:) love it
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Petition to make ddnet mod friendly \:)
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Can we get some custom controller hooks like vanilla has?
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That was for an April 1 event where I enabled pistol damage on DDNet servers
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Oh that sounds fun!
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen do you need any help getting a release out? I have a couple hours today, I can give a hand if there are any outstanding issues that need fixing
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make the changelog :greenthing:
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can try to make the changelog now
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I proposed a couple years back to automate generating a changelog :D
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think we need the crash fixed before release
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 👀
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i proposed it some weeks ago
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4240 if you can find something out
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with this
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen do we have the core and the binary of the crash?
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, it's on a few servers
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ssh fra.ddnet.tw
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> cd servers/crash
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Perfect. I'll get home in like an hour then I'll take a look
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ooh, I even have an idea what the issue is
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That backtrace sounds familiar
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen does it happen on a shutdown?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't thin kso
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I saw it in logs where a player killed and left, but there were other players on the server I think
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wish I'd taken my laptop with me, so curious :D
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh it's not what I thought it was :/
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> @Patiga so i still havent found out why it deletes the messages. but i found out its 100% the bot
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki\: make a wiki site with automated changelogs, i was asked a few times ingame already if there are human readable changelogs for github somewhere \:D
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats hard to do without conventional commits
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with conv commits and https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just need 1 command
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we just need to enforce it :monkalaugh:
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as ez as putting "fix:" before a fix and "feat:" before a feature
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cant it use pr names?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it uses commit messages
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they are probs sometimes too specific
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not rly
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they allow lot of flexibility
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g "chore:" for something not related to code like CI settings
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g you add a new feature to client, you would do "feat(client): added blood and gore"
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and when the changeloge generates it creates sub sections for each
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> client, server, etc
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md>
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> an example generated changelog
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok, but sounds pretty complicated xD
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how so
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just add fix or feat:
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i thought dev ppl were smart
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i am a potato
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/902541972257001512/unknown.png
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this would just need to be written
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chore: Upgrade ddnet-libs
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so much iq
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> needed
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> alone the word "chore"
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd forget it
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs i never use that vocabulary
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not if u see it before
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cmon ur just being petty
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u usually dont do any chore anyway
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u would do just fix or feat
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> @Learath2 i got the ddnetbot to work now but it cant find players cant list points or smth
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to run the support scripts to download and generate the required tables
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Jupstar: Why am I not seeing colors on console when I run DDNet?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe ur terminal doesnt support it
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> urxvt-256colors, should be ok
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> how is it detected?
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wait i added a arch wiki link in the code
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see colors
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Some terminals support the full range of 16 million colors (RGB, each with 8 bit resolution): xterm, konsole, st, etc. The corresponding TERM values xterm-direct, konsole-direct, st-direct, etc. are supported starting with ncurses version 6.1 [4]. For more info about terminal emulators and applications that support true color, see [5].
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Note that the Linux kernel supports the SGR escape sequences for true-color, but it is pointless to use it, because the driver maps the 24-bit color specifications to a 256-colors color map in the kernel (see the functions rgb_foreground, rgb_background). For this reason, there is no terminfo entry linux-direct.
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Color_output_in_console#True_color_support
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the last sentence sounds to me like, it auto converts it if true color not supporter
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the last sentence sounds to me like, it auto converts it if true color not supported
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe u need rxvt-unicode
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on arch
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I have that, weird
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i dunno, just use a good terminal then xD
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use alacritty and it works for me
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we cant support all stuff that never works
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> where are they? what are they called?
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even xterm can handle it
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what does tput colors say
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 256
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ❯ tput colors
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 256
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> weird
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> echo $COLORTERM
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> truecolor
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and this?
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> data/tools
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I can't ping nuborn here, but it looks like he removed the blinking code on the server side for disabled pickups
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dont remember the order you run the scripts in
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @nuborn\:
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wwwwwaaaaaaaait xd
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> rxvt-xpm
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Note: By default urxvt uses the same colors as Xterm, except one. Add URxvt.color12: rgb:5c/5c/ff to Xresources to change this.
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk xd
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> We need this for older clients that do not predict the doors
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or any 0.7 client or whatever, basically any client except the one that is not released yet
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pickups?
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah wait a sec
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its door code and doors dont blink right
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then its fine sorry
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> all gives me errors like that
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/902546565607096340/unknown.png
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> 0
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you first need the diskcache module, and that script needs to run in python2
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You also need to download the cache file from ddnet.tw
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> where
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> seems to work now
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> seems to work now the scripts but still dont know what to do with them
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://ddnet.tw/players-cache.zip
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You also need https://ddnet.tw/players.json is one you need too iirc
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> page not found
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I dont remember the exact url for that one
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://ddnet.tw/players.msgpack maybe?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah yes msgpack
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> ls
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I too type ls into chats
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 😄
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> haha
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why are you even trying to run the bot? It really is hard to keep running
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> @Styli wants it xD
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You'll need cron jobs to get all these files and run the scripts regularly
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is one more file you need from ddnet.tw, the releases file. Idk the url for that either
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You also need the records table from our sql backup, dont remember the url to that either
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Wait a second, are doors not being predicted for movements? :(
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> aww, i thought they would be predicted already in this pr, then what is all of this for when its not being used right now?
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought we also got prediction in for them didn't we?
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i just tested it on my server, it seems like its not there :/ the only thing that works for doors is showing them closed/open correctly while always sending end and start points
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so, they get sent correctly but there seems to be no prediction
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So you still get the weird jittery movement when trying to got thru a closed door?
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Would have been nice to get that in aswell
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> released already?
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> @fokkonaut projectiles and pickups are predicted now, doors and draggers are not
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll rebuild 15.6-rc3 with it
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> with what?
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> There is no prediction for doors :/
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> with your pull request
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah, but i think it shouldnt be too much to add prediction for doors before the release. We got the CCollision m_NumSwitchers and the switcher array filled already, plus we know which door is closed etc by switchstatus, we would just need to fix them up for the moverestrictions clientside
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> yes, clipping pickups in general (fokkonauts pr) should improve things even more
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol, actually it should be predicted already
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ohhhh
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> it's not that hard to add door prediction, but getting it to work consistently when doors are added/removed from the snapshot is a little more work/thinking
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> since the code for doing something like that doesn't exist already (in the server doors are just static and created when map is loaded)
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what about this\:
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4245#issuecomment-951810850
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Please no more new features for this release
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> does it need a fix?
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @nuborn how do you handle the case where doors intersect?
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @nuborn i think its pretty easy to do, if we use a CDoor clientside too, like other entities
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then they would only exist when the objects are there
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> Jupstar: yes, it looks like the length of m_pSwitchers is actually m_NumSwitchers+1, while m_NumSwitchers is the last index
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> @Learath2 yes, that part wouldn't be trivial, so didn't want to rush anything
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how we do it on the serverside
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> doors that got created first get overriden
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol what?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> I think the server just overwrites the tiles in CCollision when the map is loaded, so CDoor doesn't actually do anything after that
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> so doors can overwrite each other, etc (I think, at least)
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 yes, crossing two doors of different numbers can create a hole where the cross, when the one only is deactivated
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> crossing of the same numbers dont matter#
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> crossing of the same numbers dont matter
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The people who made ddrace initially collectively thought about 10 seconds on the problem
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking of an elaborate solution like generating a linked list of intersecting doors we can loop thru to figure out when to remove the collision
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> have fun :D
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its not nice code to work with at all
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Cant fix it now. I bet there are runs abusing that fact
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, atleast makes prediction easier
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have created an ingame editor to place entities like pickups, doors and for the doors its really annoying to not fuck up existing doors
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> on add/remove
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> took a while to have all of that working fine
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 i am getting a little bit mad about the fact that my server keeps disappearing from the master list, do you know why that happens?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Server respons its registering just fine
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Its not any firewall, since it happened with my old and new hoster
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I would appreciate some instructions for how to debug https masterserver issues like that too ^
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> at the moment it's a block box for me
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> blocker
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ban
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> black*
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I also saw ddnet sevrers disappearing from time to time
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they came back at some point
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i have no idea what this is about tho
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> once a full brutal server disappeared while i was on it, i couldnt find it anymore, 5-10 min later it appeared again
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, you're not the only one affected
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> manually pinging these servers works fine
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't really know how best to debug https master issues that happen randomly like this either
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> add more log?
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean it should know that it doesnt contact the server anymore, or if its a logic bug, maybe allow a var that on fly can tell what servers are about to be pinged(even if not reached)
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```c
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> MACRO_CONFIG_INT(SvServerInfoPerSecond, sv_server_info_per_second, 50, 0, 10000, CFGFLAG_SERVER, "Maximum number of complete server info responses that are sent out per second (0 for no limit)")
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> couldnt it also be that you have a small dos and the master list gets ignored?
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or have you made sure already that its not that
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its only for clients i see, so thats why kog in the past sometimes didnt show clients on a ddos attack
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @nuborn i knew one day the numswitchers would be a problem again
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rename it to NumSwitchersPlusOne
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or MinusOne
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> MinusOne
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> m_NumSwitchersNotLength
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> yes, it would be more intuitive to have the length
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this fixed the crash?
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or is that unrelated
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> unrelated
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> also, what if the number of switchers is 1? m_NumSwitchers = 0. or length = 0 -> -1
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wanted to see the RC
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye length is always 1
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> minimum
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for some reason there is always one switcher
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> oh, yes, we always add one more, so it kind of always works
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lmddracecodeo
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> translating from english to any latin based lang is hard
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz english uses to much tech stuff
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont even use my native lang in ddnet client
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but well i like translating it
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also use english so much i forget the words in my native language
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its also that alot of words sound so bad in native languages xD
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> map would translate to "Karte" in german. Sounds so shit xDDD
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like you try to find a way without navigation system
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lets play a Karte
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lets play a card xDDDDDDD
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it has two meanings
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe Spieldfeld would be better, but also uses much more letters than "map"
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bugs in catalan means "insectes"
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and nobody uses this
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok but this is special case \:D, bcs bug actually means bug
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its also "wrong" in english
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in english has the  meaning of software bug
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you say "he trobat un insecte al meu codi!" (i found a bug in my code)
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> people will look u weird imho
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddd
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you say "he trobat un insecte al meu codi!" (i found a bug in my code!)
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "In 1946, when Hopper was released from active duty, she joined the Harvard Faculty at the Computation Laboratory where she continued her work on the Mark II and Mark III. Operators traced an error in the Mark II to a moth trapped in a relay, coining the term bug. This bug was carefully removed and taped to the log book. Stemming from the first bug, today we call errors or glitches in a program a bug"
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thanks little moth xD
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well computers back then were rly big right
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> was bound to happen
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> \:D

18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen is there a reason for the margin?
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (bottom is the actual)
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> switcher 0, from game layer
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah its cuz its applied globally
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> also very stupid: game and front layer doors dont work if switch layer doesnt exist, probably known by many already tho
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe i can disable the margin for the changelog specifically
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah ok
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when add colors, client yellow, server red, editor green xdd
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (@Ryozuki)
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and names also in colors, i want purple
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but a dark purple, not a light one
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> still no idea.
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> https://ddnet.tw/releases/
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> ?
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> https://maps.ddnet.tw/
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you give me a pcap from a time where that happens?
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a pcap on the serverside would also be interesting. alternatively, one could log very verbosely with `RUST_LOG=debug`
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the log option is probably not realistic, it's probably too much data
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, are the outages long enough that getting a pcap is viable?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> could also get a pcap and wait for an outage
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i think it looks too cramped without
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> i like that the word 'bug' and also how it was originally found, makes the onus of the error put on an external force. 'Yes, there is a bug in my software' as if  it's some external force  of nature outside anyone programmer's control.
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think of an insect when I say bug, I seem to view the word similar to defect
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> when im hosting 2 servers with ddnet-server, is there a easy way to connect bans?
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> like when i ban someone on the first he also gets banned on the second one
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ṨtylerTime (i help on multeasy)> where do self hosted server store the bans?
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know, we use something like a globalbans.cfg for official ddnet servers
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> The server ban list is not stored on the hard drive. Type "bans" in F2. they are pretty deep in the engine
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> The server ban list is not stored on the hard drive. Type "bans" in F2. they are pretty deep in the engine
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> with bans_save you can save it to a file
