00:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :justatest:
00:37 < bridge> <totar> mods can't do this?
00:37 < bridge> <totar> or you disabled it
00:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> No one should be able to at everyone in a server this large
00:38 < bridge> <totar> idk
00:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> The API has the ability to disable it even if you have perms
00:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> But discord doesn't expose it
00:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I love when I do \\@ping and it either ignores the backslash or turns into @<....>

05:33 < bridge> <Ewan> I watched mr. godbolt's talk and I was expecting to learn more about assembly but it was actually not very directed at all and I don't think I walked away with anything but it was cool to go and see so many cpp people in one room

07:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> hi headshot
08:12 < bridge> <Ewan> cool
08:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** been a while since i had to do this one `$ git clone git@github.com:ChillerDragon/ddnet --recursive FUCKGITBROKE`
08:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but for the life of it i had no idea what was going on wtf. I aborted a rebase so i tried to do it again and every time i would start a fresh rebase it would give me the changes from the last rebase somehow.
08:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** like i rebase branch master onto branch a and suddenly i get changes neither in a or master
08:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ???
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> the fresh clone is a bulletproof strategy
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> i used to do it all the time and then i started trying to actually use git correctly and i spend 10x as long trying to remember how shit works sometimes
08:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i have the feeling .git tried to be smart and "rememberd" that i solved that conflict already
08:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but there is a reason i did `git rebase --abort` i was NOT happy with it!
08:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if that is true it could be really nice ux which lets you switch around branches and shits and it "auto" resolves known conflicts
08:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** is that really whats happening????
08:21 < bridge> <Ewan> i am truly clueless
08:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> framebuffer too

10:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i need my debug prints to actually work
10:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its so flawed that a global method depends on state wether it logs to the console or not

10:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** like how is that even a thing

11:22 < bridge> <Assa> > this needs some serious reviewing
12:07 < bridge> <Assa> so if I ban a person by IP, is the ban saved in the database?
12:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** which database?
12:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** no bans are not saved
12:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa you have to copy the ban to your `autoexec_server.cfg` if you want to save it
12:27 < bridge> <Assa> Feature Request: Sync bans between servers.
12:28 < bridge> <robyt3> #8410
12:28 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8410
12:31 < bridge> <Assa> thanks roby
12:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** we need a general solution for inter server group communication
12:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** like a selfhosted master that syncs all state between a group of game servers
12:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** we need that also for https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6754
12:41 < bridge> <Assa> I propose doing this just over the database, however for your usecase this might be too slow. Other scaling software does it this way as well, like nextcloud for example
12:42 < bridge> <Assa> And we are already synchronizing this way anyway, as we need to synchronize map-records/times over multiple servers
12:46 < bridge> <Assa> yes, the move feature doesn't make sense with a database
13:00 < bridge> <melon> i also like that more than a DB solely for bans
13:00 < bridge> <melon> 
13:00 < bridge> <melon> it's an ongoing internal discussion, but we can't just store ip's in a database and send that ip to 600 servers across the world
13:01 < bridge> <melon> the entire system is bad in general, and i would love Chillers suggestion, adding a db for synchronizing bans sounds like yet another permanent temporary solution
13:01 < bridge> <melon> i also like that more than a DB solely for bans
13:02 < bridge> <Assa> idk why it's temporary. I'd also ban possible account IDs like this. Just swap IP with ID
13:02 < bridge> <Assa> idk why it's temporary. I'd also ban possible account IDs like this. Just swap IP with PlayerIdentificator
13:03 < bridge> <Assa> isn't a database already synchronizing states between servers like a masterserver?
13:03 < bridge> <Assa> isn't the database already synchronizing states between servers like a masterserver?
13:05 < bridge> <melon> yes, but i simply see it insufficient if we want to fix the greater evil, which is inter-communication between! servers
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> here your deleted 600 servers argument would also fall apart btw
13:06 < bridge> <melon> thats why i deleted it.
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> okay ðŸ˜„
13:07 < bridge> <melon> also it wasn't about the server architecture, it was about privacy concerns which dont fit into the current discussion
13:08 < bridge> <melon> > but we can't just store ip's in a database and send that ip to 600 servers across the world
13:08 < bridge> <melon> > 
13:08 < bridge> <melon> ^ what i said
13:08 < bridge> <Assa> idk, a database sounds more reasonable to me. It'd allow backups, you could save a history of bans, and it would save the banlist accross reboots
13:08 < bridge> <Assa> you mean saving the IP adress is the concern?
13:08 < bridge> <melon> thats why i deleted it - i hate to discuss this topic because i did answer that question internally around 30 times before xd
13:09 < bridge> <melon> thats why i deleted it - i hate to discuss this topic because i did answer that question internally around 30 times before xd
13:09 < bridge> <melon> 
13:09 < bridge> <melon> in short, yes - ip's are personal data
13:09 < bridge> <thrava> Assume that I change the tune command to chat command for whatever and want to use it in the chat input, is it possible to let the client show or list the tune param names like the tune command in F2 console (without editing the client)?
13:09 < bridge> <melon> thats why i deleted it - i hate to discuss this topic because i did answer that question internally around 30 times before xd
13:09 < bridge> <melon> 
13:09 < bridge> <melon> in short, yes - ip's are personal data
13:09 < bridge> <melon> long version: cant be asked to go into detail rn
13:09 < bridge> <melon> no
13:09 < bridge> <thrava> ok thanks
13:09 < bridge> <melon> no(t that i know off)
13:10 < bridge> <melon> no(t that i know off)
13:10 < bridge> <melon> 
13:10 < bridge> <melon> i think there was an issue about that?
13:10 < bridge> <Assa> I'd argue we are already doing this btw ... and chillerdragons solution in putting it in the autoexec is also exactly doing this
13:10 < bridge> <melon> exactly aaaaaaand, exactly
13:11 < bridge> <Assa> and that's why you don't want to talk about it :justatest: oops i guess

16:02 < bridge> <melon> 
16:02 < bridge> <melon> why the magnus copyright?
16:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, I also left that as an open comment on the PR now:
16:06 < bridge> <robyt3> > Not sure if the copyright should be copied, as these files were also copied from `broadcast.cpp/h`.
16:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Watafak is this branch
17:04 < bridge> <melon> Easy, wrong remote xd
17:05 < bridge> <timakro> I thought why not push the branch to ddnet/ddnet then noticed I would be the only one who does this :D

17:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> i found @learath2
17:14 < bridge> <learath2> Me fr
17:55 < bridge> <zhn> @robyt3 are "<- ->" buttons in editor necessary? they are duplicating functions of so called shifters (- %d/%d + stuff)
17:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Those buttons move the selected envelope instead of changing the selection.
17:57 < bridge> <zhn> oh fair
17:58 < bridge> <zhn> and also question from # 10961
17:58 < bridge> <zhn> > Is there any logic difference between adding and duplicating envelope? Undo and redo actions remain same
17:59 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe not right now, because the envelopes being added are already initialized before, but the actions should be different. Duplicating copies an existing envelope. Adding creates a default envelope with two points.
18:00 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, i mean action stores new envelope itself anyway, duplicate action will do the same
18:00 < bridge> <zhn> i will make another action anyway just for the future needs
18:03 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, actions should perform the entire operation, but this isn't done for all of them yet. It would be easier to understand if actions are self-contained.
18:52 < bridge> <zhn> @robyt3 is this arranging alright?

19:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I guess there's no spatial partitioning scheme?
19:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Please post it on the issue, I'll comment later. Also test on a 5:4 resolution.
19:13 < bridge> <zhn> same result on 5:4
19:42 < bridge> <pilonpl> is that good or bad?
19:43 < bridge> <Teero> ddnet struggles at 300 on my cpu
19:44 < bridge> <pilonpl> okay so like what even is this software
19:47 < bridge> <Teero> it's my own physics
20:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> What promise did u break xd
20:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Is that compatible?
20:46 < bridge> <Teero> no
20:46 < bridge> <Teero> i never promised anything
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I meant like.. Was there something special you had to break to make it much faster
20:50 < bridge> <Teero> only ordering
20:56 < bridge> <totar> ordering can be fixed if you combine all the tees in the neighboring tiles into a single sorted list and then doing them in the ID order but that's a lot of performance for no visible difference
20:57 < bridge> <totar> also change to gameworld api for thread safety

21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> that's purgatory
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> it'll just be an endless 1v1 and everyone else (including you) has been captured

21:21 < bridge> <Assa> - oh this server already goes for 2 hours
21:21 < bridge> <Assa> - joins

21:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> don't scare them new players
21:24 < bridge> <Assa> zCatch was the only place where I have ever seen a player teleportation bug due to player collision after it was fixed, I still don't understand what happened and I wish I'd have a clip
21:24 < bridge> <Assa> like we were in a 1o1 and we just randomly swapped positions <.<

21:34 < bridge> <Assa> more likely some other issue xD billion possibilities
22:37 < bridge> <filoqcus> Is it possible to change the maximum size of a message that can be written in chat?
22:37 < bridge> <filoqcus> :owo:
22:38 < bridge> <Assa> possible yes, but you'd need to change the server, the client and the netcode :omo:
22:38 < bridge> <filoqcus> ðŸ˜”
22:38 < bridge> <filoqcus> hard
22:39 < bridge> <Assa> you _could_ implemend a feature in the client, where it splits a huge message into multiple
22:39 < bridge> <Assa> **but** this would just invite more spam tbh
22:39 < bridge> <filoqcus> But in my case it's real, can you tell me where, please?))))
22:39 < bridge> <melon> isnt that already the case?
22:39 < bridge> <melon> 
22:40 < bridge> <melon> If you paste a huge text the client automatically sends snippets of it automatically, similar to the console
22:40 < bridge> <melon> isnt that already the case?
22:40 < bridge> <melon> 
22:40 < bridge> <melon> If you paste a huge text the client automatically sends snippets of it automatically, similar to a console

22:40 < bridge> <melon> 
22:40 < bridge> <melon> If you paste a huge text the cliend sends snippets of it automatically, similar to a console
22:40 < bridge> <filoqcus> Yea
22:40 < bridge> <filoqcus> But it works very strangely, but it works
22:41 < bridge> <melon> i would like to change it up so it doesnt automatically send the messages but require confirmation
22:41 < bridge> <melon> there have been cases of moderators accidentally leaking.. stuff because of our forced workflow xd
22:41 < bridge> <filoqcus> But I would really like people in the chat to be able to communicate more through messages, which is why I am asking this question
22:42 < bridge> <filoqcus> :owo:
22:42 < bridge> <melon> not officially on our servers i'm afraid
22:43 < bridge> <filoqcus> I'm not asking for this to be added to the game. I would like to add it to my servers ðŸ˜„
22:43 < bridge> <Assa> promitity chat next? /s
23:13 < bridge> <totar> This is how texting over sms works btw, all phones just do it completely invisibly without showing you at all.
23:14 < bridge> <Assa> technically this is also how all of the internet works, IP packets also get split into multiple
23:14 < bridge> <Ewan> "all phones"
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> it being broken up into multiple messages isn't a feature of SMS there's just a size limit for those messages
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> they add their own logic on top of it
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> did u never run into those limits on older phones or what
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> ever pay for minutes
23:15 < bridge> <totar> Even old phones had that feature to split messages
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> depends on how old and what phone
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> mine didnt
23:15 < bridge> <totar> Mine did xd
23:15 < bridge> <pilonpl> But how would the receiver merge the messages together?
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> metadata
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> (or they don't)
23:16 < bridge> <pilonpl> Metadata?
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> yes?
23:17 < bridge> <pilonpl> But that would require message splitting to be an official feature
23:17 < bridge> <Ewan> right
23:17 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of the time the messages are not merged
23:17 < bridge> <totar> The part that describes the group of messages takes up space, its not like you get it for free
23:18 < bridge> <pilonpl> I don't even know how sms works
23:18 < bridge> <Ewan> recently everything has been using RCS
23:18 < bridge> <Ewan> SMS is the first standard for text-only messaging across cell phones. it's gotta be like 20 years old
23:19 < bridge> <Ewan> 1993
23:19 < bridge> <Ewan> 32
23:19 < bridge> <totar> Iphones only support rcs for like a year, I still send texts over sms often for whatever reason
23:20 < bridge> <Ewan> that's whenever you're lacking service or RCS can't be established iirc
23:21 < bridge> <Ewan> there's a handshake and then it's just encrypted traffic on 443
23:21 < bridge> <totar> No its the receiver
23:21 < bridge> <totar> I can send rcs
23:21 < bridge> <pilonpl> Everyone just uses Facebook messenger
23:21 < bridge> <pilonpl> Over the internet
23:21 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't think that's even true
23:21 < bridge> <Ewan> statistically
23:22 < bridge> <Ewan> unless you consider WhatsApp to also be Facebook Messenger
23:22 < bridge> <pilonpl> Or WhatsApp
23:22 < bridge> <pilonpl> Whatever
23:22 < bridge> <pilonpl> It's all the same
23:22 < bridge> <Ewan> no
23:22 < bridge> <Ewan> they're both meta but they're different apps with different features and different backgrounds
23:23 < bridge> <pilonpl> I hate them both
23:23 < bridge> <Ewan> whatsapp used to be good
23:23 < bridge> <totar> fb messenger is up there
23:23 < bridge> <totar> In popularity
23:23 < bridge> <Ewan> i wouldnt be surprised if they're #1 and #2 respectively
23:23 < bridge> <totar> It might be #1 in some regions
23:23 < bridge> <pilonpl> Fbm just doesn't work
23:24 < bridge> <pilonpl> It has trouble playing videos
23:24 < bridge> <Ewan> user error
23:24 < bridge> <pilonpl> Nope
23:24 < bridge> <pilonpl> It just stops playing the video when anything else is happening at the same time
23:24 < bridge> <pilonpl> Like an animation playing lol
23:24 < bridge> <Ewan> on what, your phone?
23:25 < bridge> <pilonpl> Yeah
23:25 < bridge> <Ewan> because there's a central media playback state
23:25 < bridge> <Ewan> it will pause other things
23:25 < bridge> <totar> how can it be user error that a video doesnt play
23:25 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of "gifs" (gifs dont really exist anymore) are animations which are incorrectly marked as having audio
23:25 < bridge> <Ewan> it's surprisingly common on the web, you'll have random silent animations pause music and stuff
23:25 < bridge> <Ewan> even ads
23:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i'm just really skeptical it's a widespread issue
23:26 < bridge> <Ewan> how would that ever make it to production
23:26 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds like the video plays but is interrupted by something else
23:26 < bridge> <Ewan> which is mostly outside of their control
23:26 < bridge> <totar> Im completely unskeptical that there can be bugs in software
23:27 < bridge> <Ewan> it doesn't sound like a bug
23:27 < bridge> <pilonpl> Yeah it's interrupted by people sending messages
23:27 < bridge> <pilonpl> Or by people reacting
23:27 < bridge> <Ewan> does it make sounds
23:27 < bridge> <Teero> @totar can help rq? im i cant find a bug
23:28 < bridge> <pilonpl> How is it not a bug, why would i want a video i am watching to pause only because someone read the latest message?
23:28 < bridge> <Ewan> it sounds like a bug now
23:28 < bridge> <totar> have you seen the app we're using right now, everything is react slop. Facebook invented react slop
23:28 < bridge> <Ewan> Yes
23:28 < bridge> <Ewan> exactly
23:29 < bridge> <pilonpl> Btw what do you mean by GIFs aren't real?
23:29 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1419073007351234712/image.png?ex=68d06e3a&is=68cf1cba&hm=f2f035c42454646788bf9e7bf7b186c74e57a160db8fba84626c3084fe105e69&
23:29 < bridge> <Ewan> pretty much everything in there is a mp4
23:29 < bridge> <Ewan> it used to actually mean graphics interchange format
23:29 < bridge> <Ewan> now it's just "short video without sound"
23:30 < bridge> <Ewan> modern container formats can accomplish the same exact effect with actual compression and hardware decoding
23:30 < bridge> <pilonpl> Well i guess mp4 is simply just better
23:30 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
23:31 < bridge> <Ewan> .gif still exists but it's literally frame count, size per frame and a very long and large uncompressed series of 24 bit pixels
23:31 < bridge> <pilonpl> But GIFs still look low quality
23:31 < bridge> <pilonpl> So idk
23:31 < bridge> <pilonpl> Is it just an aesthetic now
23:32 < bridge> <Ewan> oh i was slightly wrong
23:32 < bridge> <Ewan> the pixels are not 24 bit
23:32 < bridge> <Ewan> there's a 256 color palette which can contain 24 bit color values
23:32 < bridge> <totar> how is this possible if all of them seem to download to my PC as .gifs
23:32 < bridge> <Ewan> the pixel data is 8 bit
23:32 < bridge> <Teero> https://tenor.com/view/ddrace-gif-24493247
23:33 < bridge> <Ewan> there are definitely still gifs around
23:33 < bridge> <Ewan> but if you're searching through the gifs thing and a certain one takes 5x as long to laod
23:33 < bridge> <Ewan> it's probably an actual .gif
23:33 < bridge> <Teero> downloads as mp4 for me XD
23:33 < bridge> <totar> huh
23:33 < bridge> <totar> it does
23:33 < bridge> <totar> https://tenor.com/view/pokemon-pikachu-clap-clapping-clapping-gif-gif-13465728489229726846
23:33 < bridge> <Teero> mp4
23:33 < bridge> <Teero> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/825281791950323759/1289151953946935297/IMG_3433.gif
23:33 < bridge> <totar> how do I make my mp4s show up as gifs then
23:34 < bridge> <totar> gif
23:34 < bridge> <Teero> lol wtf this is just an image
23:34 < bridge> <totar> gifs are just sequences of images
23:34 < bridge> <Ewan> u can absolutely have 1 frame GIFs
23:34 < bridge> <Teero> yea nvm it downloads as a gid
23:34 < bridge> <Teero> yea nvm it downloads as a gif
23:34 < bridge> <Ewan> they are super super common on the web
23:34 < bridge> <Ewan> GIFs were used before PNG was widespread for uncompressed web graphics
23:34 < bridge> <Ewan> GIFs were used before PNG was widespread for lossless web graphics
23:35 < bridge> <Teero> tater somehow im still getting loops. but only if i add the players after i started the replay.
23:35 < bridge> <Teero> this is so weird
23:35 < bridge> <Teero> because the original world is never actually touched
23:35 < bridge> <Teero> where i add the characters. every other world is just based on that. and i basically delete the buffer so it has to do every tick from scratch again
23:36 < bridge> <Teero> how is possible that it loops then
23:36 < bridge> <Teero> but not if i initially add all the players
23:36 < bridge> <Teero> it should be the same thing
23:36 < bridge> <totar> idk it's probably a small mistake
23:36 < bridge> <totar> I can't possibly say what it is
23:36 < bridge> <Teero> true
23:39 < bridge> <Teero> i hope i wake up some day
23:42 < bridge> <Ewan> same
23:44 < bridge> <Assa> @robyt3 I just played fastcap and the flag grab seems to be broken ðŸ˜®
23:48 < bridge> <robyt3> What's broken about it?
23:48 < bridge> <Assa> I grab flag, but I don't carry it around
23:49 < bridge> <Assa> am I stupid ðŸ¤” maybe it's the mod
23:50 < bridge> <robyt3> Test if it's different with an older client version
