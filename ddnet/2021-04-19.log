00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> isn't int in general the same size as a pointer?
00:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> No. See for example 64bit Windows.
00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types
00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> size_t and ptrdiff_t (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/ptrdiff_t) are probably what you want
00:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RayB.> üòÇüëç
00:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> OMH
00:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The prodigal son
00:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Huh, RayBan still alive?
00:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RayB.> was kinda shocked to see my name in 2021, hope you can still move forward lol
02:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We were doing a timeline of things that happened in ddnet üòõ
04:28 <+bridge_> [freenode] <AlwaysLivid> re: Haiku, the reason why the game won't run as-is right now is because of an oudated mesa implementation that should get up-to-date soon (haiku support was upstreamed to mesa)
04:28 <+bridge_> [freenode] <AlwaysLivid> just making sure to leave this here as a matter of public record
06:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> we were doing a ddnet timeline and discussed old drama. you can put it here if you remember:https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/Timeline
09:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/833601980861382656/unknown.png
09:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wasnt the name not fitting into scoreboard thing fixed?
09:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> check that 99999 guy
09:19 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> how does he not fit?
09:19 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> aaaaah missing n
09:20 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> I assume cuz ids are activated
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> maybe the name is only that
09:20 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> no see left side
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> ah
09:20 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ye the bug report is a riddle :D
10:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always forget to use the best macro in rust for debugging: <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.dbg.html> you can put it anywhere :PepeA:
10:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/833616883587481600/unknown.png
10:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> what is that
10:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a macro you can put around any expression
10:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it prints to stderr debug info
10:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since in rust everything is an expression you can put it anywhere
10:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> wow
10:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wow
11:08 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> thats cool actually
11:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> If it's too long, it's too long. It was only fixed that clan and name collided
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> Can i ban MAC-adress?
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> no
17:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> :feelsbadman:
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <! lukaspeuwu sus> chat is lazy
17:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <! lukaspeuwu sus> wrong chat
19:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> how can i make an autoexec file?
19:50 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> thats what some closed src games do dont they? They send the MAC for extra ban options and tracking.
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> create file in config dir and name it autoexec.cfg
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> where's the config dir?
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/FAQ
19:55 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> lmao FAQ
19:55 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> we need a FAQ bot now :D
19:55 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> !faq config
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> it doesnt execute at start
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> @WAV server or client autoexec
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> client
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> autoexec_client.cfg
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it also uses autoexec.cfg as fallback
19:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> i tried autoexec.cfg and it did nothing
19:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> did you also put smth into it?
19:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> yes
19:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> sometimes it expects it in the data directory, maybe not the case for client though
19:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> i did put it in data dir
19:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i should always use config dir first
19:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> just put it in appdata too
19:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> i tried that after data dir
19:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> maybe i should rename it into autoexec_client.cfg?
19:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can try
19:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also make sure it has the proper ending
19:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in windows the file ending is default off
19:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so its not autoexec.cfg.txt
19:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or smth
20:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> maybe it doesnt work like i expect it to because its a say command
20:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon[m]: sending mac address in closed source games works about as well as in open source games üòâ
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> a say command in a bind or just a say command? if you exec say when the game first starts that's not going to do anything
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> since you're not in a server immediately
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> unless autoexec works on server join and not game start?
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I want a view like the packet view in wireshark. I want to put structured logs in there though. do you know if such a product exists?
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> autoexec is on game start
20:06 < roco> chiller
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> we should at least have an event for server join
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i dont see why this would be game-breaking
20:06  * roco slaps ChillerDragon around a bit with a large fishbot
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i hate messing up my zoom binds just connecting to another server
20:06 < roco> CHILLER
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> i dont want a bind for it, i just need it to be always there
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ok but where would your client say it, you're not connected to a server yet
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> im pretty confused about what you want exactly
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> what does the say do?
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> a say command that executes on server join
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> cant do that
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> /ninjajetpack
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doesnt come to mind
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> there's no event binding
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> wish there was...
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but i understand why it's not added yet
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it would be (potentially) cheat-like for some event types
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> but not on server join
20:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> nope, that would be like setting up an event listener, which has been talked about but idk
20:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> idk if the devs have any background on this but i would at least like to see a server join event
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> the syntax would be like bind, `on server_join cmd`
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> or at least change the /ninjajetpack to have saved state
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> if /ninjajetpack was a client setting then it just fixes that yeahg
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> if /ninjajetpack was a client setting then it just fixes that yeah
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and honestly, i would prefer that too
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but i understand why that's complicated
20:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> since you appear as a ninja because of the server and others also see you as a ninja i believe
20:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> then the server should save that
20:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> well, that's not really helpful if you change servers
20:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> there are no name-based server settings
20:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> that would be insecure anyway
20:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> it can communicate to other servers since its all ddnet
20:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> mm but i think it's best that there is no server level settings for players
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> since someone else could use your name and fuck with your settings
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it's not a good idea imo
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> how about bans? how are they saved?
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ip
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but ip bans are easily avoided
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> is there no userid ban?
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> basically no matter how you skin the cat, there's no consistent way to do anything on the server in ddnet lol
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> in terms of player data
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it's either based on ip or name
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> that's why i suggested a set uid for everyone
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i mean there should just be auth
20:15  * roco slaps bridge_ around a bit with a large fishbot
20:15  * roco slaps ChillerDragon around a bit with a large fishbot
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but some people prefer no auth
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i don't really care either way but i am leaning towards auth
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> i don't like the idea of someone taking my name and finishing maps
20:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> since i wanna finish them
20:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> :p
20:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> #3411
20:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3411
20:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> start a petition
20:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah lol
20:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> its been a topic for forever
20:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> there's a reason why people keep suggesting it
20:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> express your opinion there, cuz having this discussion here will most likely get lost by tomorrow
20:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> idfk know what you have against it
20:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> fair
20:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> "u can just Come and start playing instead of being annoyed with login shit" this is the crux of their argument but literally every other game has account-based player data already lol
20:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it's not some magic luxury that teeworlds was set up this way, it's just how it happens to be
20:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> just make a one time auth on ip
20:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> whether it was intentional or not doesn't really matter
20:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i like the uid idea
20:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but wondering how simple it would be to get someone's UID
20:19 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> yes and literally every other games is closed source. Just because all are doing it it does not mean its good
20:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i don't see what being closed source has to do with necessitating account-based player data
20:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> yea lol
20:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> when i sign up for gitlab i dont expect them to pull out a sign that says "our number one policy is openness so there are no accounts"
20:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nothing, just your argument being refuted
20:21 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> Oh man its a comparison. The focus of my statement lays on "dont just copy what others do because they do it but see if its better to do so"
20:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> but sometimes its better to look what the better one's are doing
20:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> they're not related at all, it's not a matter of because they're doing it, it's just sensical
20:22 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> So then bring arguments. should be very easy when the majority does it one way
20:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> wtf
20:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> security, ownership, appeals + functional decisions about player account data
20:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> there are many pros
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> everyone wants it
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> not everyone
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> except for the people who cheat
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but a lot of people do
20:23 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> Thankyou for starting to name reasons, thats all I wanted to get.
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> plus not to mention BANNING PEOPLE IS EASIER lol
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> it's common sense what she said
20:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> the reasons
20:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i accept that it will likely never happen
20:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i just will never shut up about it as long as i am hooking and hammering
20:25 <@heinrich5991> if you want to have a proper argument, say the reasons, even if they're "common sense"
20:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> agree
20:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> dont understand why we cant do opt-in authentication like kog
20:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> i'm 99% sure the reasons she mentioned were mentioned a long time ago
20:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it isnt intrusive for anyone
20:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> it's just a circle
20:26 <@heinrich5991> just go to github to discuss it I guess
20:26 <@heinrich5991> you're basically rehashing the arguments
20:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> because you want us to basically
20:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> im done talking about it, mostly cus yea its been said
20:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> also i have to work xd
20:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> I don't think kogs account system will help with ban evasions, im pretty sure they still rely on ip-based bans
20:29 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> I dont like how KoG is doing it. There is no advantage. It just made [!Fake] clan bigger than KoG and nobody cares if you are logged in or not.
20:30 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> Optional accounts are useless anyway and forced accounts should not be centralized. Other than that I dont care about accounts
20:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> then make a better system
20:31 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> WAV you have a way of discussing that does not help with anything
20:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> as much as i appreciate your enthusiasm WAV i have to agree lol
20:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> i'm sry but this problem doesn't seem to have any end since there are pages of discussions about it xd
20:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> well by optional auth i didnt mean exactly like kog. there should be some in-client reminder that you can log in besides just a server echo
20:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> plus maybe some badge on the website or something that your name is tied to an account so others can prove no one has submitted times on your behalf
20:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> well, unless you share accounts ofc
20:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> some incentive for ity
20:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> some incentive for it
20:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but i agree that it should be centralized. i only bring up optional accounts as a compromise to the purists who can't handle accounts being added lol
20:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it seems that that github issue is fairly recent though and the last reply was only a month ago
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> my understanding was that it was more stale
20:34 <@heinrich5991> I don't think it should be centralized
20:35 <@heinrich5991> this would give a single point of failure
20:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i misread what you said, and i think im using centralized in a bad way, i mean primary
20:37 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> One advantage of accounts could be whitelisting against ddos. We did this back then for tournaments on nfo servers.
20:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> name changes would become a trivial and less sticky request to make, banning accounts in general would be much better, since they would need to make another account
20:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://i.pinimg.com/originals/15/fd/18/15fd187ebf03b220998a9e0ea965cca1.gif
20:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> you wouldn't need to play detective as much with people's identity, you'd put some level of trust in the auth system and offer facilities for detecting new logins + safe account recovery
20:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> makes moderation so much easier
20:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i have had hour long conversations with USA mods before about whether or not someone was intentionally name-faking me on my deadname and halfway through the conversation i just couldn't care less anymore
20:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it's just more cognitive load than it's worth lmao
20:44 <@heinrich5991> just head over to the github issue, otherwise next week you'll tell the same arguments ;)
20:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> what heinrich said :P
20:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i don't plan to talk about it after this, but if i feel like i have sufficient talking points past what has been said already i will post there
20:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> at least not on this server ;)
20:45 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> IMO bans work good enough already. I dont see that huge problem right now. Spammers can be muted and blockers are not that common like all people think. I dont encounter them often as the maps are mostly made a way that makes blocking hard. I only see it on multieasymap and on KoG. As KoG has a majority vote blockers are not a big problem there either.
20:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> You can't compare kog with ddnet
20:46 <+bridge_> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> I dont, I compare more the maps. Gores makes spawnblocking kinda easy.
20:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> how will accounts help with spawn blocking
20:47 <@heinrich5991> we do have a problem of spammers evading their bans with proxies
20:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> not just spammers
20:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> they're saying it won't have an effect @Jupstar ‚ú™
20:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it would definitely cut down on repeat offenders though
20:48 <@heinrich5991> argh now I accidentally wrote something again :<
20:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> since there is a particular person who is quite persistent xD
20:48 <@heinrich5991> ‚Üí github issue ;)
20:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i mean, i guess i still contributed by making you think about the issue again :D
21:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think someone should just implement it, and then the discussion can start xD
21:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> in a fork?
21:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
21:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just implement everything semi decentral and rest happens from itself
21:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> test servers? or what were u thinking?
21:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nope, just start implementing it
21:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so add the login protocol while no one is using it, so that it can be tested when it's decided
21:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> yeah people here are making it way too complicated
21:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> no
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it is actually complicated lol
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just feel like ppl are acting like its something insane to plan. just make it so that you can play without account, having it loginable over ddnet for the normal ppl(which saves ur private key, bcs ppl will 100% loose it), and decentral as implementation and for the ppl that absolutly dont want to have it stored in ddnet
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> i knew someone of you'd say that
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it can't add too much friction or some players will be upset
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> just how it is
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ‚ú™ comment on github please üòâ
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I posted a design, even ^^
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> also i didnt see this but heinrich said `rcon passwords can go away except for one-time passwords` which is a HUGE plus for self-hosted
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i feel like @Learath2 said everything needed there
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> like this would save me so much time haha
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or you
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno both all
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that's quite nice @lynn
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> once all sql stuff and protocl is done the rest happens from itself i assume
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs then there is feedback and not so much todo anymore
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> people are afraid of this shadow that doesnt even exist yet, but maybe if they could see the face of it they could judge it properly?
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the normal ppl wont even see it until its some kind of ready for test
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it really more like, now nobody really wants to start bcs it nobody is really sure what todo or where to start üòÑ
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i could be wrong and maybe somebody did start, but dunno who
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> like most long forgotten issues lol
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> anyone done any tests of it? it seems like someone posted a web app of something
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but it's no longer active
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Most people dont enjoy making things that will generate a lot of drama
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but also most ppl for some reason think they need an account then
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> i support accounts!
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> even tho most devs here agree not todo forced accounts
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> speak to the existing player base and ask them how they feel when their name is being used by a new player ;)
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idc?
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i am wondering how you would handle not forcing accounts
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> like does accounts even mean much at that point
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can transfer points
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i guess you could have some badge in game as well?
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> to any name u want
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you need to force it onto users, then it's obviously not good üòÑ
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> to show you are logged in?
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> "display name"
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah in scoreboard it could be shown too
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but if they appear the same then no one knows
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah okay
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in fng save server i allowed both
21:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> worked fine, except that /login is unsafe, bcs no encryption
21:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i added a session key i think xd
21:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://aliveclan.de/#ranks
21:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the green ones are the ones with accounts
21:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> well that was just 1 example of use case
21:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wanted to provide a point that it's not obviously something that the existing player base wants
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deutsch :PepeA:
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> well using discord does not give a proper representation of 'player base' as its heavily skewed and most people here dont like change which i cannot understand.
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> e.g. strong hook on all
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bottom right u can select language
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> very smooth with javascript xDDD
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> now i forgot that language completly xD
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/833783051850743898/unknown.png
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> cant even write simple php stuff anymore
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π doesn't work
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> most is empty xD
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice logo tho
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its not really translated
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs the russian guy that wanted it just didnt answer xD
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://uniqueclan.net/ shameless plug :PepeA:
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @SPYRES why even ask on discord if you're going to discard the feedback anyway? ^^
21:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> True, but it atleast gives you some idea which is better than none at all. Eitherway, what ever you do in life you wont be able to please everyone.
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Take that guy (banana090) who coded fix for weak, as soon as the skewed polls said "no" he dipped and I didnt see him implement another feature after that (unless I could be wrong). If I were a dev I would be heavily discouraged by that (again ironic because I havent contributed coding wise) but it is what it is.
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but you can still try to please the most people and not use that phrase to justify not doing that üòâ
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think we voted most of his features
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and they are even in now
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> from dev side, it was mostly about code quality
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Yes, but we talking UI/EX changes there. Ofc every player will say yes lol.
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what?
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Yes, but we talking UI/UX changes there. Ofc every player will say yes lol.
21:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I welcome you to check the votes
21:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. we also voted to use less roundings, but most disagreed
21:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> even tho e.g. list have roundings in roundings which just looks bad xD
21:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> example
21:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/833785231416492052/unknown.png
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> favoriten :yoo:
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's at least good for recognizing where one button ends and another starts
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good for UX
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i play deutsch üòÑ
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is a saying, users only use 20% of the features or smth like that
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Anyways, I dont want to drag this on. I have stated afew points and I appreciate your feedback.
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but we have Ravie, he is graphic god, he can come up with smth better, also before that, we didnt havce that roundings
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it was voted as part of animations
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://dzone.com/articles/applying-8020-rule-software
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :yoo:
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i bet there are many unused config vars
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> like 90% xD
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/833785747764150363/unknown.png
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the buttons and inputs itself in ddnet feel like a 2010 program tbh
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 2010? thats pretty new xDD
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but this is what happens when u draw a rect and dont use a texture like most games
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine a cutey teeish themed button
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> without a nice background map ddnet looks like 1995 xD
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> white in white
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/833786312472657950/screenshot_2021-04-19_21-28-56.png
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> soo much white
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it always kills me xD
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> everything is a transparent white
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just transparency changes
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> factorio is the perfect example of a good but really functional ui imho
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they perfected it even more after 1.0
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/833786797628325908/fff-364-train-gui-old-110.png
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love it
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :yoo:
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/833786865010081812/fff-364-train-gui-new-2.png
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> layout nice
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> design is ok
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> osu ui is insane imo
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> osu!lazer
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> these previews are nice
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @louis osu focused a lot on animations
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its true it looks nice, but you have to take into account
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> their ui needs are super simple
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just scroll and select a song
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> :monkalaugh: its a bit more but yeah its more simple
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> osu!lazer has a lot more tho
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also their api is rly good https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u can make menus with it so ez
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yeah you also need the anime background preview
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> like u can visit the online stats from inside the game, where u usually need to just tab out to chrome
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i wish ddnet had smth like that
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> you guys are gonna distract me by talking about osu
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ddnet mapping approval should be like osu's
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i will die on this hill
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how long have you been around ddnet?
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> :justatest:
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> map testing is the thing that always makes drama
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no matter the year
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> 8 months
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> osu maps are a lot more simple tho
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i think a modified system would be great tho
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> btw why does discord keep bugging me to use their dumb stickers
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> just let people play maps on unranked servers
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> vote for their favorites
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> then voted ones are looked at by approval team
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so much better than just "think your map is good enough randomly? submit it!"
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-361-tips-110-drag-building.mp4
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if we had the ability to render easily anywhere making tips would be rly ez
21:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> but the thing its probably easier to join shit maps on ddnet than osu
21:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> my favorite maps i have made became good because of rapid iteration based on feedback
21:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> you can't do that with the current system, at least not without really good friends
21:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> who will join your private server... where it's the same map... and you're afk in editor...
21:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but on a public server? people can change the map if they're bored and try all sorts of maps
21:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> idk imo the current system is HIGHLY exclusionary and doesn't really help newer mappers
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> too intimidating
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i mean
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> black box of submit map
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> u cant expect ppl to join "unranked" maps
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> right up there with ddnet mods and popular mappers
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> they dont play on test servers normally
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> because they're password protected
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> thats not true
21:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> ppl enjoy playing actual maps over test servers
21:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> even if they know the pass they'd probably rather play on big t0 servers or whatever
21:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> cause with testmaps ur 50% playing trash maps
21:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> have a contribution rating then, idc xD
21:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i know i wouldnt care
21:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i would play trash maps if i cared about the person making it
21:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> just like i would play a trash novice with a noob
21:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> same thing
21:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> its not because of the experience im having
21:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it's about who im helping
21:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> what if someone has no friends
21:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> public server + you might find it fun to dig through random maps with friends
21:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> or random people
21:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> doesnt matter
21:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it's like mario maker super expert
21:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah the levels are shit
21:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but it's interesting to see what crazy stuff you find
21:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> the game being open-ended and trusting of its users are core values of the game, i dont see why those same values cant be upheld with the mapping system
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ok im really gonna go back to work now xd
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> usually the problem is that nobody wants to code it
23:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://whatlang.org/
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> f3 if you know rust (and by know i mean like, basic types and how to fix the compiler warnings yourself)
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> im curious how many devs know it
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u havent read this channel?
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i spam rust everyday
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> no i know that
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i want to know how many others
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> heinrich knows it, patiga too
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> timakro learned a bit too
23:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> o
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> any reason the devs role isnt visible in the sidepane btw?
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> learath is a C guy
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> just not important enough to show?
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @lynn because it means nothing
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i think it means something :D
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u make some commits u will get it
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> fair enough
23:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i would like to be able to see all the devs at one view though
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/graphs/contributors
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> u
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do /credits
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on any server
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> plus github name is not always the same as on discord
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but ty
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye mine is not same

23:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so who else would it be?
23:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> well actually
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it says "& others" so maybe it would
23:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i guess we would need to define "help" lol
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> d3fault coded a few things
23:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @Ryozuki  even konsti made some code xD

23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i have been thinking about moving out of this apartment and in with a bunch or roommates, and just a regular job somewhere random
23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> being a dev is not all it's cracked up to be, at least the type of work im doing anyway
23:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i have been thinking about moving out of this apartment and in with a bunch or roommates, and just get a regular job somewhere random
23:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Miguilim> :lab_pepewut:

23:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> oh
