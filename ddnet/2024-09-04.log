00:30 < bridge_> <Tezcan> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5593 could someone who is familiar with this take a look at it? @heinrich5991
00:36 < bridge_> <triki> it's possible to turn off hot reload by saving map?
00:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> so i guess *this* is why we get so many ppl who can't register
00:49 < bridge_> <zhn> yep
00:50 < bridge_> <zhn> works for old folks because they have maps in their downloadedmaps
00:50 < bridge_> <zhn> im dumb sowwy
02:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @melo∆û wats the biggest bug
05:58 < bridge_> <melo∆û> strong/weak hook
06:33 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> :troll:
07:54 < bridge_> <vappy19> üçà
08:00 < bridge_> <sedonya> gm
08:01 < bridge_> <teero777> gm
08:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Yea good call melon xd
08:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I think I mapped a part once that only works with weak hook lol
08:16 < bridge_> <maxpon298> :banhammer:
08:33 < bridge_> <melo∆û> :gigachad: :kek:
08:40 < bridge_> <melo∆û> We played 4K ( a 4* insane ) map with 16 people yesterday, one part requires the other to have strong or you can't make it - was a fun 50 minutes...
09:20 < bridge_> <cyberfrighter> biggest bug is hammer fly
09:25 < bridge_> <screeeny> hooking thru corners when u stand in corner
09:29 < bridge_> <teero777> Physics quantizing is really bad
09:37 < bridge_> <cyberfrighter> 12 years ago??? lmao
10:53 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Brand new 0.7 technology @cyberfrighter
10:54 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @screeeny: hammering through walls is also a bug :D
10:54 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Was fixed in 0.6

11:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> empty one tho
11:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Crashed in a sane way?

11:05 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> and array expressions as well üòè
11:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> segfault ofc, llvm is c++
11:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/107198
11:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> my riscv emulator supports now the ziscr extension

11:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> fill zero day, get fame
11:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah but assertions and software exceptions are probably saner. This one sounds more dangerous
11:33 < bridge_> <abricotiabricota> Hey guys do you think it's possible to make automatic generation of map ? By assembling blocks or procedural generation ?
11:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/iMilchshake/gores-mapgen
11:46 < bridge_> <learath2> this looks cursed, why did you do this?
11:46 < bridge_> <learath2> Cool language bro
11:47 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> you didn't know about ways to make this segfault :justatest:
11:47 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i do not as well, but im 100% sure they exist
11:47 < bridge_> <learath2> I like my languages dangerous
11:48 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i fixed integer literals btw
11:49 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> and now i wanna add methods and then try to connect a tee to ddnet server :greenthing:
12:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the compiler at work we making spit out this from some user made library
12:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its probs some zero sized types
12:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nevetherless, it shouldnt make llvm segfault :cPES_Wink:
12:02 < bridge_> <learath2> Add native teeworlds support to your language
12:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/rysk/blob/master/tests/instructions.rs
12:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i love rust testing tools

12:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://docs.rs/rstest/0.22.0/rstest/
12:02 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> add teeworlds int packing in standard library
12:37 < bridge_> <wats> wtf

12:40 < bridge_> <_vencha> what does this mean?
12:40 < bridge_> <_vencha> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1280839818548609075/resim.png?ex=66d98a89&is=66d83909&hm=10abd48993292147c339add5d97adb878fb8445aef896b560193f17737add574&
12:40 < bridge_> <_vencha> in the status command
12:58 < bridge_> <furo> It's the integer representation of the flags the client is currently sending.
12:58 < bridge_> <furo> 
12:58 < bridge_> <furo> 1 - in game (not in menu)
12:58 < bridge_> <furo> 2 - menu
12:58 < bridge_> <furo> 4 - chat
12:58 < bridge_> <furo> 8 - scoreboard
12:58 < bridge_> <furo> 16 - hook collision
12:58 < bridge_> <furo> 
12:58 < bridge_> <furo> So, 17 in this case means the player is in "ingame" (1) and have hook collisions on (16).
13:05 < bridge_> <jxsl13> @essigautomat
13:40 < bridge_> <abricotiabricota> Ye thanks i hear about that, sry i was mean about ddrace, it's so harder that why i ask
13:40 < bridge_> <_vencha> are there any other integers than these 5
13:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ddrace lives from creative parts, so I'd say it's not possible
13:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe with some AI, but hardcoded sounds kinda hard.
13:55 < bridge_> <furo> These five are the flags that the DDNet client sends.
14:05 < bridge_> <abricotiabricota> Ofc ye but i'vnt level xd any i will try just assemble blocks from famous map, u know if python can have interractions with the game ? Else i give up xd
14:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You can use twmap which has python bindings. There should even be a python lib in the installier for that
14:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks they fixed my issue
14:53 < bridge_> <jxsl13> that's fast
14:57 < bridge_> <jsaurusrex> I have a question, a while back i set out to create a physics checker test for ddnet, i didn't manage to make one because i kept running into issues but i remember some others were working on similar projects
14:57 < bridge_> <jsaurusrex> do any physics tests exists atm?
15:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks do u know a nice LLM setup to make logos for gh projects?
15:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd

15:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not any open source one tbh.

15:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> How did you create yours?
15:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> random web

15:38 < bridge_> <learath2> Recreate it in inkscape
15:38 < bridge_> <learath2> One more skill acquired
15:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We need better AIs
15:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I have no skill
15:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why is there no AI yet that can redraw it in inkscape
15:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> redicilous
15:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ridiculous
15:47 < bridge_> <learath2> I'm sure one of them can give it a try in svg üòÑ

15:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just use it, who cares
15:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's not perfect anyway
15:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> true but something better than nothing keks
15:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, just use it.
15:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The prompt was kinda weird xddd

21:50 < bridge_> <Ewan> Where can I play
21:51 < bridge_> <matodor> find FlatCIty server, password `tws`
21:51 < bridge_> <Ewan> Where‚Äôs it hosted
21:51 < bridge_> <nikhard> hey! I need some help with network model creation.
21:51 < bridge_> <nikhard> What I understand it when server listen the port, then accept socket, it stuck over one (or more, if clients are connected to other sockets as variable) client and can't accept another.
21:52 < bridge_> <nikhard> My code goes like: listener on port 2000, listener accepts user, while true {if packets are received, then send that packet back to connected client}, client takes packet and put it's data on screen.
21:52 < bridge_> <nikhard> How can I do multi-client connection? Only way I found it's waiting two clients connect, then server processes them one by one. But if one of clients disconnected, he can't connect while second is connected. Need to reload all the clients.
21:52 < bridge_> <nikhard> 
21:52 < bridge_> <nikhard> How on normal servers it does? Is there an async connection and disconnection? And maybe server need to load user message on DB, then only from DB to second client, when it calls for data?
21:52 < bridge_> <zhn> moscow
21:53 < bridge_> <Ewan> you should be able to connect to multiple clients on the same port as long as it all happens in the same process
21:53 < bridge_> <Ewan> This is gonna be epic
21:55 < bridge_> <nikhard> but listener waits all time for a new connection, right? maybe there's a function to set timeout
21:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> idk what you are using
21:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> and I‚Äôm not too network smart anyway
21:56 < bridge_> <zhn> he's using sfml something something
21:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> Hmm
21:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> I know a SFML maintainer who I can ask
21:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> I may see him on thursday
21:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol
21:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> but that is just graphics/audio middleware isn‚Äôt it
21:57 < bridge_> <nikhard> lemme find it
21:57 < bridge_> <nikhard> it have graphics, audio, network and something
21:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> I see
21:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> can u share the code
21:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> well rip
21:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> good luck
