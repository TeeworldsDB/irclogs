11:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 I JUST PUSHED ON MASTER
11:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and did ctrl+c bruvv
11:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** can u pls pls check if its protected
11:39 < bridge> <learath2> Can you not break things please
11:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** bruv i try
11:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** something i forget to create branches
11:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** sometimes*
11:40 < bridge> <Assa> it's protected but maybe not for maintainer role
11:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** that would be fatal
11:41 < bridge> <melon> Just don't have ddnet as your main remote dummy!
11:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oh rigt
11:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont xd
11:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** nvm nothing was even close
11:41 < bridge> <melon> :cat_hmm:
11:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** smort
11:41 < bridge> <melon> Maintainer btw
11:41 < bridge> <melon> :KEKW:
11:41 < bridge> <Assa> fixed that as well, called it upstream
11:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** usually when i have ddnet as my default remote i dont commit and push
11:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** we should be safeish ... for now
11:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** also i smh trust heino to have set it up properly
11:42 < bridge> <melon> git pull upstream/master
11:42 < bridge> <melon> 
11:42 < bridge> <melon> Git push --force origin main
11:42 < bridge> <melon> heino will land in your dms quicker than the Finanzamt if you mess with upstream :KEKW:
11:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ono
11:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i forgot my branch name xd only remembered it starts with pr_ so tab completion should do
11:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ``$ git checkout pr_``
11:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ``Display all 652 possibilities? (y or n)``

11:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thanks
11:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> This sounds like a challenge
11:49 < bridge> <Assa> this sounds like proper project Management, be aware that emergency fixes now need a PR at least
11:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** not even deen is pushing to master
11:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** we should be fine
11:50 < bridge> <learath2> Or an admin present
11:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you can also emergency pr
11:51 < bridge> <learath2> I pushed once a couple years ago
11:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** <:banhammer:392813948858269696>
11:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** couple years ago deen used to force push the entire history into oblivion 
11:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** different times
11:52 < bridge> <manikoo> In computer development, "push" refers to different actions, most commonly uploading changes or code to a remote repository (like Git), sending data from a server to a client (push technology), or adding an element to a data structure like a stack. The specific meaning depends on the context, whether it's version control, communication protocols, or data management.
11:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** this is a gaming discord not computer development!
11:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** in gores "push" refers to being in someones ass and potentially risking a crash
11:54 < bridge> <manikoo> do no push master then
12:05 < bridge> <Assa> !remind 10080 PR for other freeze shields
12:05 < chillerbot12> Helo Assa I will remind you at Tue Sep 09 2025 12:05:13 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.
12:08 < bridge> <Assa> @robyt3 any opinions on #10708 and #10733?
12:08 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10708
12:08 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10733
12:13 < bridge> <Assa> I know these look kinda bad, but using somehow the same datastructure is required for new editor rendering
12:13 < bridge> <Assa> and introducing new datastructures is also very meh
12:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** IT HAS BEEN 5 DAYS!!!!!!! The atomic pr strat works better if the prs actually get merged eventually #10772
12:25 < chillerbot12> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10772

13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> wtf so late
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh i wanted to do 360
13:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 lerato sos wat i do with the linked fakin list??? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/55c7bea515d9ace28158eccc3b1f46f7249b7c98/src/engine/shared/console.cpp#L84-L94
13:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if the authmanager is the one who knows which commands can be used and i have the callback with a clientid in the CConsole wat i do in the scope of a CComand to find the next link omagawd?
13:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** rewrite entire console=??????????????
13:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** bro this is never gonna happen
13:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i regret doing this
13:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i should hard fork and abandon ddnet forever
13:35 < bridge> <Assa> ^maintainer btw
13:35 < bridge> <learath2> So maybe authmanager is not the right place for this and the console should know about ranks afterall. Idk design is an iterative process, you are the one doing it. I told you what I would first attempt, if it doesn't work you iterate
13:37 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe you need more callbacks, maybe instead of callbacks an interface, `IPermissionManager`
13:38 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe the linked list of commands isn't a great idea to begin with?
13:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** im gonna collapse
13:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** we need to call lerato
13:51 < bridge> <Assa> `pChillerDragon->Collapse();`
13:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i hate programming
13:59 < bridge> <manikoo> ^maintainer btw
14:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> we should build ddnet targeting x86-64-v2
14:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> minimum
14:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> v2 is first intel core
14:03 < bridge> <0xdeen> benchmark the difference first
14:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> how would u benchmark it
14:03 < bridge> <0xdeen> build against x86-64, build against x86-64-v2, run both versions on the same system and measure fps
14:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u know someone using a pentium ill be amazed
14:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok if im not lazy maybe ill do it when im home
14:04 < bridge> <manikoo> i was doing it before last month
14:04 < bridge> <bomab> i played on pentium from 2021 to 2023
14:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> what pentium
14:04 < bridge> <bomab> pentium d 925
14:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean ideally we could distribute v1 v2 v3 v4
14:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> json parsing can be simded hard
14:06 < bridge> <0xdeen> Intel Core2Duo/Quad is still running DDNet well, and doesn't work with x86-64-v2
14:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
14:06 < bridge> <0xdeen> if the performance gain is < 10%, not worth it. we shouldn't be json-parsing every frame
14:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> if its over 10% ur open to releasing them?
14:07 < bridge> <0xdeen> Yeah, I think 10% performance would be worth it. People on older systems still have x86 to fall back to
14:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder if we have manual simd optimizations possible to do
14:08 < bridge> <0xdeen> There are probably ways to double DDNet client performance without excluding old CPUs
14:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
14:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt say dont distribute old
14:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i said add v2 to the list
14:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
14:08 < bridge> <0xdeen> no, that's overcomplicating things, should just have one release for x86-64
14:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> hm ok
14:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> stockfish does that tho
14:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> stockfishchess.org/download/
14:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://stockfishchess.org/download/
14:10 < bridge> <0xdeen> I don't think DDNet and Stockfish have much in common üòÑ
14:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
14:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks what do u think
14:12 < bridge> <bomab> ~~distribute installer which automatically detects which version to download~~
14:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> that's a different topic
14:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** cant steam do that?
14:14 < bridge> <0xdeen> No, Steam doesn't allow that fine-grained. You could have separate code paths in the same binary, or ship multiple binaries, and have a starter process that picks the correct one for the CPU's capabilitiy
14:14 < bridge> <0xdeen> No other CPU options than this
14:14 < bridge> <0xdeen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1412410466080260136/Screenshot_2025-09-02_at_14.14.50.png?ex=68b83140&is=68b6dfc0&hm=a4bc3d12fa1c04aa049353582dd94e9b5abb8db1d1704baa9273b6656ae58e31&
14:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/09/01/rust-lld-on-1.90.0-stable/
14:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 is the `IPermissionsManager` a full on kenernel interface?
14:21 < bridge> <learath2> No just as something to group together the callbacks, make it more contextful if needed. Idk what exactly you are having trouble with tbh so it's hard for me to help
14:21 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe you design what you think is appropriate and we talk about it after?
14:23 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yea tbh before we discuss technical details we should decide on user facing features
14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks https://github.com/davidlattimore/wild
14:23 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** I made a more detailed proposal https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10681#issuecomment-3244454047
14:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 you mean a real interface? So a class with only virtual methods and then another class that defines the actual instances? Or just a regular class that holds multiple callbacks and context?
14:38 < bridge> <learath2> I was thinking maybe you could have `CAuthManager` implement the interface so it can be used in the console for rcon
14:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i see so a real interface
14:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so basically https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10762 xd
14:40 < bridge> <kebscs> finally 19.4 üéâ
14:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** <:feelsbadman:391614770303991808> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10699 did not make it into 19.4
14:45 < bridge> <remakepower> 2 months!
14:45 < bridge> <remakepower> Finally, the ddnet 19.4 is coming.
14:45 < bridge> <kebscs> why is it called client side, when it gets bad words from the server
14:46 < bridge> <manikoo> you can play nightly
14:46 < bridge> <manikoo> version
14:47 < bridge> <remakepower> I have already been playing on Nightly Build version.
14:47 < bridge> <vahemaaa> can i update the turkish translation right now?
14:47 < bridge> <remakepower> *almost half a year ago.
14:47 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Do you only open a PR to update translations? I'd like to translate my PR related texts
14:48 < bridge> <kebscs> yes but it should be based on <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10797/files>
14:48 < bridge> <vahemaaa> alright
14:48 < bridge> <remakepower> You can translate it after merging.
14:49 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> It's already merged
14:49 < bridge> <remakepower> No
14:49 < bridge> <robyt3> You need to update your translations based on #10797
14:49 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10797
14:50 < bridge> <remakepower> No. (I means it hasn't been merged yet)
14:50 < bridge> <robyt3> The censoring happens on the client-side and you can choose your own URL for the censor list
14:51 < bridge> <kebscs> i dont think a lot of people have their own website setup with exact censor words format
14:51 < bridge> <remakepower> I found that the server community identity is not work on 0.7 only servers.
14:52 < bridge> <kebscs> so itll probably stay default url
14:52 < bridge> <remakepower> Is it a bug?
14:53 < bridge> <robyt3> You mean when connecting to a DDNet server via the 0.7 address?
14:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Content creators that need it can host their own list on localhost
14:54 < bridge> <kebscs> a lot of effort for some noobs who dont know how to do that
14:55 < bridge> <remakepower> The Community won't work as the server address is 0.7 version.
14:55 < bridge> <remakepower> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1412420545458213014/image.png?ex=68b83aa3&is=68b6e923&hm=5b52024e0e1246818984b6a2b7c700bb3bbc799a9eeaad71dd1f7c285d18959d&
14:55 < bridge> <kebscs> would be nice if it also took .txt files or smth
14:55 < bridge> <remakepower> Even the address has been joined into the info.json
14:55 < bridge> <remakepower> Even the address has already been joined into the info.json
14:55 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't think we enabled the file protocol when compiling curl. I guess you could also replace the file locally, then set an invalid URL so the working local file will be used.
14:57 < bridge> <remakepower> ü§î
14:57 < bridge> <remakepower> So is this a deliberate design or a bug
14:58 < bridge> <robyt3> It's a bug, please open an issue
14:58 < bridge> <remakepower> OK
14:59 < bridge> <robyt3> Regular users can use the default list, which is probably not ready yet
15:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats what my initial impl did but i handed over pr to chiller
15:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway its rly easy to avoid the list
15:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> needs more work
15:01 < bridge> <robyt3> It should cache the file locally as well I think
15:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> afaik it does it and checks date
15:01 < bridge> <robyt3> If the download fails it will use the local file
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> 10k line pr
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> lot of new strings i c
15:02 < bridge> <robyt3> Touch controls editor added like 10% more translation strings :justatest:
15:03 < bridge> <kebscs> :kek:
15:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kebscs the bad words are on the server but the filter is on the client
15:07 < bridge> <robyt3> Close call getting the touch controls editor into this release though, I had a premonition that deen would make a new release this week
15:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I love how the deen release event is random and not communicated earlier xd
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 does valgrind massif slow the program to unusuable or can it be used to measure a real functioning program?
15:11 < bridge> <remakepower> There isn't any release candidate version of DDNet 19.4 now.
15:13 < bridge> <remakepower> So I think 19.4 will be released next week at the earliest
15:13 < bridge> <robyt3> Deen hasn't written the release notes yet
15:14 < bridge> <remakepower> ü§î
15:14 < bridge> <robyt3> Because it takes time
15:15 < bridge> <remakepower> Maybe deen is working on editing it now.
15:15 < bridge> <remakepower> Maybe deen is working on editing it now. (Maybe?)
15:16 < bridge> <learath2> It does slow it down quite a lot. But it is usable usually. I can kinda find stuff in ddnet with it
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> note im talking about massif
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> not valgrind to find leaks or stuff
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> just wanna know where allocations are happening
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> to reduce memory usage
15:18 < bridge> <remakepower> I was very surprised that DDNet has been using C++ 20 for quite some time.
15:19 < bridge> <kebscs> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/.mailmap>
15:19 < bridge> <kebscs> what is it for @ryozuki ?
15:21 < bridge> <learath2> I haven't used it tbh, but I'd imagine it to be about as slow as valgrind itself given it's probably the same vm
15:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> @kebscs u dont know mailmap?
15:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was a kid and i changed mails a lot, mailmap simply maps the contributions from different mails to the same
15:22 < bridge> <kebscs> what is it used for in repo
15:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> its used by git
15:22 < bridge> <kebscs> on github acc you can add multiple emails and all commits count to your acc
15:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> and github to track stats correctly
15:22 < bridge> <kebscs> idk about repo
15:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a git thing not github
15:23 < bridge> <Assa> Can sb ping me when deen released the changelog? I want to watch over it as I have done a lot this sprint
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> also i dont have old emails anymore either
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> its common to have this in repos
15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmailmap
15:23 < bridge> <kebscs> idk never seen it

16:00 < bridge> <learath2> There is a nano coder sitting in front of me
16:00 < bridge> <learath2> First time I've ever seen it
16:01 < bridge> <melon> :justatest:
16:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> üëÄ the hell
16:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> nano masterrace
16:17 < bridge> <learath2> Like actually unironically hacking away at LLVM with nano
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> where do u see coders irl?
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> llvm? pro
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> im a llvm contributor btw
16:22 < bridge> <learath2> I'm doing a masters now. Back in school
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> with real C code made by a REAL dev
16:22 < bridge> <learath2> I'm so proud of you for using a real programming language
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah nice, i dont see coders irl rare breed, more if they actually code non web
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> im trying to lock for hackathons or events at barcelona
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> wanna see how ppl fare here
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> im trying to look for hackathons or events at barcelona
16:23 < bridge> <learath2> This class is full of true nerds. People with rust stickers on their laptops, multiple people with framework laptops. People using vim, nano. I didn't see one windows user
16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> what masters
16:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://timnash.co.uk/customising-nano-productivity-friday/
16:26 < bridge> <vahemaaa> im done translating turkish.txt, where a deen

16:32 < bridge> <learath2> Computer Security
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats so vague
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> details
16:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u install mcaffee as a masters graduate? xd
16:42 < bridge> <melon> you tell people not to redeem
16:42 < bridge> <melon> ig
16:42 < bridge> <learath2> Well my first course is software security, where we'll learn reverse engineering, rop chains, etc
16:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah nice
16:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> is there a kernel dev masters
16:43 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe? Idk. I'll take the Advanced Compiler Construction elective tho. It's based around LLVM
16:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh nice
16:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> that one i would take too if no kernel one
16:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> do not redeem it reference?
16:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i have no uni degree soo
16:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> im just a random
16:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> wtf not even a bachelor?
16:44 < bridge> <0xdeen> Nothing wrong with nano. Had a colleague doing great work with it.
16:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> i thought u had a masters xd
16:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> what does bachelor equate to
16:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> if bachelor is the 4y one nop
16:45 < bridge> <learath2> Just surprising. Never seen anyone using it for anything but very early set up
16:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> i learnt all by myself
16:45 < bridge> <learath2> Tbh you didn't miss anything. I learned nothing from my bachelors
16:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> ur job didn't care about u not having a degree?
16:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah, what im most interested in is the math foundation
16:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> so maybe if i went to uni now i would do a math one
16:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> its what i lack most
16:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> and well maybe physics a bit too cuz hardware
16:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> @0xdeen "[Editor] Automatic quad clipping [Ryozuki]"
16:48 < bridge> <learath2> It might end up being too deep for your taste
16:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt know i contributed, lol
16:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its probs wrong
16:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess
16:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 is uni completly free for u?
16:51 < bridge> <learath2> No, but very cheap for eu citizens in nl
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> when i went to uni i wasnt at my best in life, and i had to pay like 700 per semester (or idk the word), i also had no job (lived with parents) and i didnt pass some subjects so i had to repeat them, which means also more money and i was 0 motivated cuz i didnt like it very much
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i love programming and stuff its weird
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> (and my parents struggled to pay that)
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> then i did a 2 year officially recognized thing here in spain and i just paid 300 for a year and aced it, got me a internship and job and xp
16:52 < bridge> <learath2> Some people just don't like formal education no matter the subject
16:52 < bridge> <0xdeen> Oh, you're in Netherlands?
16:52 < bridge> <learath2> Yep, I basically moved, very very quickly üòÑ
16:52 < bridge> <Assa> ping :feelsbadman:
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh nice
16:53 < bridge> <0xdeen> I only know Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam, because that's where DuckDB came from
16:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> @0xdeen do u know rocksdb?
16:53 < bridge> <learath2> This software security lecture is very interesting. It's basically designed as a rat race though they seem to have toned it down this year. You basically compete amongst eachother
16:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> well its keyvalue
16:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> how do u compete?
16:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> as in if u do better the other can fail the subject? xd
16:54 < bridge> <learath2> We have a lecturer from the cwi in the latter part of this year I think
16:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> anime like
16:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u do ctfs
16:54 < bridge> <learath2> There is public leaderboards, you are given hacking challenges. Fastest people get more points
17:04 < bridge> <0xdeen> Sure, YugabyteDB and Materialize are both using it internally.

17:15 < bridge> <peter0x44> glad that worked out fo ryou
17:15 < bridge> <peter0x44> glad that worked out for you
17:15 < bridge> <peter0x44> I failed my university entrance exams so hard I couldn't do any course worth my time
17:15 < bridge> <peter0x44> but managed to leverage some connections to get referred to a job anyway
17:16 < bridge> <peter0x44> I failed my university entrance exams so hard I couldn't do any course worth my time

17:21 < bridge> <robyt3> This shouldn't have changed which function is being used
17:24 < bridge> <0xdeen> Don't get scammed guys: https://x.com/smilingerik/status/1961439631653617983
17:26 < bridge> <robyt3> Please provide more details. How did you configure the project? Did you clone ddnet-libs? The function is defined in `glew.h`, no idea why it would be missing for you.
17:28 < bridge> <robyt3> `CONF_BACKEND_OPENGL_ES` should not be defined at all when compiling for Windows.
17:31 < bridge> <0xdeen> Long time no DDNet release, there were so many PRs to go through...
17:33 < bridge> <rehoboamrulit> 1. I didn't understand the question
17:33 < bridge> <rehoboamrulit> 2. Yes
17:37 < bridge> <kebscs> what are the differences between included, excluded, ignore?

17:39 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> what about 50$ (on steam)
17:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> isnt that great?
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> 3 months, not a bad cadence

17:42 < bridge> <kebscs> hard to translate
17:42 < bridge> <robyt3> How did you call `cmake` to configure the project?
17:43 < bridge> <robyt3> What OS are you using to build? Which cmake generator did you use?
17:54 < bridge> <rehoboamrulit> I created a build folder through the console on Windows, entered cmake .. and it completed successfully, but when compiling it gives this error
18:02 < bridge> <robyt3> Clear your build folder, then run cmake again and post the full output

18:10 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> can i have a developer role?
18:10 < bridge> <learath2> Aye, Amsterdam, for at least this year, prolly the next too. And if I don't hate it maybe I'll settle here
18:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So fast xd
18:10 < bridge> <learath2> Which PR did you get merged?

19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> it made up citations to MIT, cornell and harvard websites that even look like legit URLs until you click and see there's nothing there
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> and there never was
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> marketing is too powerful
19:45 < bridge> <Ewan> > An MIT study found that 95% of organizations are getting "zero return" from generative AI, seemingly every major outlet is now writing an "are we in a bubble?" story, and now Meta has frozen AI hiring.

20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> pog i got a keyboard driver properly
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> like it broadcasts keys to threads that subscribe
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> pub fn thread_kb_listener() -> ! {
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki>     let rx = KEYBOARD_BROADCAST.subscribe();
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki>     loop {
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki>         let key = rx.recv_timeout(Duration::from_secs(4));
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki>         if let Ok(key) = key {
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki>             serial_println!("Got key: {:?}", key);
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki>         }
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki>     }
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
20:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> clean af
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> beautiful
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> ed os or e dos?
20:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> ed os
20:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> v2
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> rip
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> e dos funnier
20:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> why
20:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u know better name im open
20:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just named it after my irl name
20:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> + os
20:57 < bridge> <Ewan> ya i noticed
20:57 < bridge> <Ewan> was mainly joking
20:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
20:57 < bridge> <Ewan> good name
20:57 < bridge> <Ewan> i think this year i will actually go to cppcon
20:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also have a mailbox struct to send requesta and receive responses
20:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> so i can make a kernel render thread
20:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> and others can do "render api calls"
20:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> never went to one
20:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> nor rustcon
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> how would u handle large video payloads asynchronously
20:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> uhm
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> kind of a challenge i dont understand bcs atomic only goes so far
20:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> im just using a framebuffer right now
20:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> no real driver
20:59 < bridge> <Ewan> valid
20:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> what do u mean by this
20:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> the requests/mailbox is thread safe theorically^tm
20:59 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds like u have a mailbox struct and u will use it for render thread messaging
20:59 < bridge> <Ewan> im just curious if it's performant to send a lot of data in the mailbox or if that's even how it works
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> #[derive(Debug)]
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> /// A mailbox for sending requests with the type T and getting responses with the type R.
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> pub struct Mailbox<T, R> {
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki>     queue: SegQueue<Request<T, R>>,
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki>     owner: ThreadId,
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> #[derive(Debug)]
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> /// The message info.
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> pub struct Request<T, R> {
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki>     /// The sender thread
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki>     sender: ThreadId,
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki>     /// The response given when the message was sent.
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki>     ///
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki>     /// Saved so we can place the value in the response when the message is processed.
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki>     response: Arc<Response<R>>,
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki>     /// The message
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki>     pub message: T,
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> #[derive(Debug)]
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> pub struct Response<R> {
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki>     /// Whether the response is fulfilled.
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki>     fulfilled: AtomicBool,
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki>     taken: AtomicBool,
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki>     // Thread to wake on response.
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki>     thread: ThreadId,
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki>     value: UnsafeCell<MaybeUninit<R>>,
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> hm i would say it works nice, since its all lockless
21:01 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
21:01 < bridge> <Ewan> when i did the async ddnet skin loading thing i kept running into micro lags bcs of mutexes
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> also i wake and park threads
21:01 < bridge> <learath2> Where is it? When is it? Might be fun
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> impl<T, R> Request<T, R> {
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki>     pub fn answer(&self, value: R) {
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki>         without_interrupts(|| {
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki>             unsafe { self.response.value.get().write(MaybeUninit::new(value)) };
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki>             self.response.fulfilled.store(true, Ordering::Release);
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki>             let sched = sched();
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki>             sched.thread_wake(self.response.thread);
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki>         })
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki>     }
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> the thread who owns mailbox answers request with this
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> impl<T, R> Request<T, R> {
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki>     pub fn answer(&self, value: R) {

21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> the thread who owns mailbox answers request with this
21:02 < bridge> <Ewan> like 30 minutes from me, the free admission day is the 19th
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> /// Send a request, returning a Response that can be waited for values.
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki>     pub fn send(&self, request: T) -> Arc<Response<R>> {

21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki>             let sender = sched().current_id();
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki>             let response = Arc::new(Response {
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki>                 fulfilled: AtomicBool::new(false),
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki>                 taken: AtomicBool::new(false),
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki>                 value: UnsafeCell::new(MaybeUninit::uninit()),
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki>                 thread: sender,
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki>             });
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki>             self.queue.push(Request {
21:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> api usage with 2 threads
21:03 < bridge> <Ewan> flow reminds me of Qt signals/slots but it's transparent
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> like u can actually see and use the intermediate struct
21:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> making this is a good way to learn atomics xd
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> yea i never really understood all the different layout options related to atomics
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> past the fact that there are a few for different scenarios + rust copies cpp's model more or less
21:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
21:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> u need to know about ordering
21:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> its kind of like a lock
21:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> acquire, release
21:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> acquire with load, release with store
21:05 < bridge> <Ewan> yea i've used them before but never implemented
21:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh i didnt implement atomics
21:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> atomics exist at cpu level
21:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> (not sure about the ordering bit i think too)
21:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> well im not sure
21:06 < bridge> <Ewan> ig what i'm saying is i'm familiar with the concept but don't know about the details in the different implementations
21:06 < bridge> <Ewan> writing an OS with atomics will require u to learn about the latter even if not implementing them
21:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> i should look at atomics at assembly level
21:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think implementing atomics is more a compiler thing than os thing
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i am pretty sure it's mostly a hardware feature
21:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> its just a x86_64 feature
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> possible in compilers but only performant because the cpu works in an atomic friendly way
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> like using older msvc versions to target old windows actually has bad consequences related to mutex performance
21:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> well
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> ig bcs some hardware support flag or metadata being set to old ver
21:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> the mutex is not a hardware thing actually
21:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> the mutex is provided by kernel
21:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill need to implement a mutex for user space
21:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder if i can copy futex
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> if u want
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> for projects like personal OSes i'm a big fan of the NIH philosophy
21:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats that
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> "not invented here"
21:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> my goal right now is to have a really solid foundation for kernel threads and scheduler
21:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> and then move back to drivers
21:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> (thats why im making mailboxes and subscribers)
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> basically means you forgo any existing libraries in pursuit of learning the intrinsics of whatever it is you'd use the library for
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> and u can choose to apply that to any part of the project piecemeal
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> but it might be cool for the user space mutex
21:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah nice
21:10 < ChillerDragon> @Pathos wat u need dont ask to ask
21:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> well u kind of have to do most stuff in kernel dev
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> does ur os have a binary loader
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> for executables
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> that's some of the most interesting stuff to me
21:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> v1 has, i didnt do yet for v2 cuz im making solid foundaiton as i said
21:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> elf loading isnt that weird, (if u ignore shared librariies)
21:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> its mostly mapping memory and copying
21:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> (i didnt do shared libs yet)
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> well dont ignore shared libraries cuz that's one of the interesting parts xd
21:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> and relocations
21:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i did some relocations
21:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> and tls
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> relocations like what
21:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> thing is there is so much stuff to do for os u gotta take some corners xd
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> ye u dont need it in ur os if udon't feel like it
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> just moving sections of the executable to their respective memory locations?
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> that's where shared library loading gets kinda interesting to me
21:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need it but i dont even have proper user space, hwo would they use shared libraries, thats my thinking
21:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would first do a network driver
21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
21:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> and filesystem
21:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanna do edfs
21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds awesome
21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> having a e.g. linux driver compatibility layer could be rly cool as well but probably huge in scope
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> it'd be awesome if u could use ur compiler experience to do some static recompilation of a linux driver to do it the edos way
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> filesystem is fun but apparently hard to make stable lol
21:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think a driver is tightly coupled to the kernel
21:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> unless u do a microkernel
21:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> where drivers are userspace
21:21 < bridge> <Ewan> that's why it'd be cool
21:21 < bridge> <Ewan> but if they rely too much on specific things it could be impossible

21:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not going to us
21:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> also ticket costs like 200 or more
21:22 < bridge> <learath2> Mmh, the US sounds a bit tough

21:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> daym
21:29 < bridge> <Ewan> thankfully they have free friday
21:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not for normies
21:35 < bridge> <totar> do all of the tickets get covered by employers? Is that why they're that high?
21:36 < bridge> <totar> I guess it's kinda like training in a way to send your employees here
21:47 < bridge> <Ewan> usually
21:48 < bridge> <Ewan> their target audience is often loaded enough to make it work out of pure interest tho

22:10 < bridge> <0xdeen> did you just doxx yourself?
22:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** e wot xd
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> it's from a local server so there's not much more on there than my name and phone#
22:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i think matrix is down
22:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** gg
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> idk if it's this guy's idea of networking since it seems like he could be late into a degree or a new grad
22:13 < bridge> <Ewan> I'm a little skeptical
22:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wanted to see what deen was replying to but now i know its ewan
22:13 < bridge> <Ewan> he responded "no but I can help connect you" when I asked if his company was hiring. immediately sketched out

22:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ryooo?????
22:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wat did u do?
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> stalk online job posting channels, get ppl to send theirs to you, ????, profit
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> training data for LLM ai builder? absolutely clueless
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> there are enough examples
22:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** woah thats a first. I have been vote banned so fast i did not even receive the chat message about the vote call. Thats some shady funvoter race condition oO
22:18 < bridge> <blazulite> @noketchup I'm a bit confused about the "Layout" spanish translation

22:18 < bridge> <blazulite> Wouldn't it be better to translate it as "√ìrden"? or "Estructura"?

22:20 < bridge> <De√´ivid!> "orden" is also okay

22:21 < bridge> <De√´ivid!> yea its a good synonym
