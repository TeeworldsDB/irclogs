00:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @ChillerDragon is there any program that ports 0.6 map into 0.7 without breaking too much shit?
00:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> also 0.7 map editor... fucking fix it
00:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> or i wont go to 0.7 ever
00:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> amazing vid btw
00:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Cellegen i did not find any tool for porting maps that really convinced me. And my attempt to implement ddrace layers to 0.7 client was also kinda experimental so idk when that is gonna happen.
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i have a hell of a trouble with scaling images just so that the editor can properly render it
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> cuz it doesnt have autoscale
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ?
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> my picture of an unhook tileset is 600x600 px
00:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and somehow its over 600kb
00:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> like wtf???
00:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> oh alright, ddnet graphics tools
01:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> (nvm graphics tools are broken too, unusable)
01:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but there's a website https://compresspng.com
01:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> this is fucking usefull
01:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> this is fucking useful
01:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Isn't it the same as the graphics tools at downloads?
02:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> how come ddnet always crashes when i open it when a youtube video is playing in the focused tab
02:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> or when i alt tab to ddnet when playing a video
02:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> if u found a way to *always*crash ddnet u should run it with a debugger and find which part of the code is responsible
02:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> if u found a way to *always* crash ddnet u should run it with a debugger and find which part of the code is responsible
02:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> it just turns the screen black and either take a minute to finally be able to close or just crashes my computer
02:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> yes it always crashes
02:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> do i run it through visual studio debugger?
02:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> idk on windows
02:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> idk how to do it
02:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> if u compiled the client then that sounds right
02:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> if not then idk maybe xd
02:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> if not then idk, maybe xd
04:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 that one is my fav
12:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @louis ye visual studio debugger is fine
12:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> compile in vs and then run in debug mode from visual studio
13:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @louis if it crashes your computer, I doubt a debugger will be of much use, it probably crashes deep in the kernel or some driver
15:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> @Cellegen  there is nothing wrong with the 0.7 map editor... I had also no problems porting maps to 0.7... idk what you do wrong
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> Well the image scaling on 0.7 is not automatic tho, i needed to manually upscale the picture and reduce it's quality to optimize it
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> otherwise bugs will happen
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk what that image scaling is
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> where do images get scaled in editor
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> fe: i had 600x600 pixel ratio on the picture
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and 0.7 completely ruins the render cuz it cannot render less than 1024x pictures properly
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ??
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so fuck i've spend 5 hours fixing my fucking picture to 1024x1024 so that 0.7 can properly render it
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 1024 sounds like a good minimu size anyways in 2019
15:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> it is, but my problem is, that 0.7 does NOT have support for different scaling values
15:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> while it still can be compiled
15:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> (the image to the client)
15:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> nicely, ddnet does
15:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> ehm... sry to mention but teeworlds always required you to use 1024x1024 anyways...
15:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> yeah, thats a problem anyway
15:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> at least it should force scale ratios onto pictures to match with the editor
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> no its not, it earlier tw versions the editor just denied adding a image at lower resolution
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> no its not, in earlier tw versions the editor just denied adding a image at lower resolution
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i know that, and that is why i said that 0.7 does not have great support over different ratios
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> so you miss the check?
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> ðŸ˜„
15:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i checked both the picture and the client, and seems like it cannot render properly less than 1024x1024 pictures
15:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> yea because internal everything bases on that resolution
15:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> well fuck that solution ðŸ˜„
15:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i hate 0.7 editor
15:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> completely
15:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> but your problem has nothing to do with the 0.7 editor itself
15:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> just a missing check, nothing else
15:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> just what kind of missing check?
15:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> toward the picture or the client itself?
15:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> and the 1024x1024 resolution comes from the game internals because a block aka "pixel" (tee size) is 64x64 and you have 256 blocks (view from entities), so graphics have to have the same size
15:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i think u are talking about ddnet's mechanics
15:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> its already been fixed this problem
15:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> I'm not talking about ddshit, but vanilla (and ddnet uses the same as well)
15:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> not kinda :monkaS:
15:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> its seperate af
15:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> I think ddnet may have implemented a scaling mechanism to fix such issues, thats all
15:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> yes, finally you see it why i hate 0.7 editor ðŸ™‚
15:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> but basically teeworlds requires 1024x1024 images, thats not a secret
15:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but fucking hell i've spent 5 hours to compile a FUCKING PICTURE.
15:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> you can't expect the vanilla game to implement mod things ðŸ˜„
15:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> just for this
15:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> 0.7 bs
15:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> thats not
15:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> a mod thing
15:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> its a usual mapping requirement
15:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> I believe even 0.6 hadn't had a scaling mechanism
15:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> to make life easier
15:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> just use 1024x1024 resolution, whats your problem?
15:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> yes cuz they haven't thought about autoscaling
15:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> why should they even care about it?
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> my fucking god cant you understand?
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> I HAVE SPENT 5 HOURS TO MAKE A 600X PICTURE ONTO A 1024X PICTURE SO IT CAN BE COMPILED
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> 5 hours.
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> fucking hell.
15:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> just use gimp and resize your image. so hard?
15:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> yes, there are different ratios, the printing quality, the different color dimensions, RESOLUSION etc
15:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> yea
15:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> and whats the matter?
15:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> there are good tutorials outside to do so
15:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i dont wanna make a 2mb map duh
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> you don't have to
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> omg show me *master*
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> no time
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> then fuck you and dont waste my time.
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> but you have google/bing/duckduckgo/whatever, just use it
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> can somebody tell this autistic kid that its related to ddnet and not any programming manner?
15:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> well, I only wanted you to understand that your problem isn't a problem.... you could have read that you need 1024x1024 resolution and you could find ways to resize it. vanilla *could* have implemented resizing, but you shouldn blame them for missing that feature....
15:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> please do me a favor and accept a challenge, im gonna send you an image and spend the last 5 hours to compile it with 0.7 without breaking its rendering ðŸ¤¡
15:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but boy, it wasnt just resolution
15:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ðŸ˜­
15:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> it was the compiling
15:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> yea, understood your point. you wanted to keep the size
15:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> AND make it fairly optimized
15:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> so it wont go up to 1MB or higher
15:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> since its PNG
15:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> yea, and?
15:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> that. was. fucking. hard to do manually.
15:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> who the fuck wastes so much time just so that one picture would work
15:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and i dont wanna talk about the rest of them.
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i see you dont have a problem with it, cuz you dont fucking know how to map correct?
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> I have my problems with people complaining about things that are no things if you never got used to mods like ddnet. do you get my point?
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> feels like im talking to myself :tee_thinking:
15:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> yea, maybe because I don't have enough time to discuss it properly right now
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> btw autistic kid, you said. I'm a few % autistic (for real, yes) but not a kid ðŸ˜„
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> so, 5 mins left. @Cellegen  I have a question: do you still have your 600x600 image?
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> ik you also have a 1024x1024 one now, but I'm asking for the smaller one
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> I'm asking because if I recall correctly either ddnet or 0.7 switched the png library, that could be your issue then
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ddnet didn't
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> upscaling an image to nearly twice the resolution is never a good idea... it will always look shitty, especially on 4k displays. no matter whether the client does it or you do it manually
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> 0.7 uses 3d textures (or misuses them as texture arrays) so they have to split the tileset into 256 64x64 tiles before using it
15:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> in 0.6 it was more of a side effect that other resolutions worked
15:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> just like the physic engine does then?
15:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> (the 3d textures)
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> has nothing to do with physics but more with rendering (opengl)
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> advantage of this is that you dont need borderfix anymore
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> yea but the physics engine also works with 256 x 64 x 64
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> that was what I was referencing to
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> yeah okay
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> and I also said that its no but in vanilla, so I was right. 600x600 was never supposed to work, but they just fixed a bug with the 3d textures then?
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> and I also said that its no bug in vanilla, so I was right. 600x600 was never supposed to work, but they just fixed a bug with the 3d textures then?
15:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> kind of yes. but it should probably tell the mapper that he cannot use resolutions other than 1024x1024
15:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> ye, that was the missing message/popup I mentioned earlier
15:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> right now nobody really wants to touch the 0.7 editor since somebody is completely rewriting it
15:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> ooh what's gonna be in the new editor
15:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> i didn't have a closer look at it. not sure how the progress is
16:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @redix do you happen to know how exactly they abuse those 3d textures? It drove me insane trying to figure it out
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> they are using the third coordinate to determine which tile should be rendered... it would be better to use 2d texture arrays but as far as i know they need shaders to work
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> they are basically generating a 64x64x256 texture from the tileset
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> with texture arrays you could also use mipmaps. with this 3d tex approach you cannot
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> When port to py3
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2020 is here soon
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> it's actually the serverstatus script that requires py2: https://github.com/BotoX/ServerStatus/blob/master/clients/client.py
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really wanted to write an ansible playbook to deploy servers this time ðŸ˜›
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 should i learn ansible
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a decent way to deploy servers that's not too complex
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do many companies use it?
19:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah it is pretty common
19:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The others are Chef, Puppet and Salt. First 2 are more common then the last one
19:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Terraform is really interesting technology, infrastructure as code is a weird concept
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> guys. open this map and just take a look at it. if you spectate some tiles disappear and if you try to place some hook for example in the editor its all weird.
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/651858332931325958/tele_number_bug.map
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Spectate? in the editor?
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ingame. too
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't get the bug, there are some tiles that aren't visible when you are ingame?
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> more like this bro
19:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/651858886671859755/screenshot_2019-12-04_19-53-49.png
19:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll take a look, but it looks like a slightly corrupted map to me ðŸ˜›
19:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yeah i opened a old map. ive seen it befor ebut not that the tiles disappear and some even move with you
21:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Lol
21:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Btw  @Learath2 in vanilla dc worstwish was looking for you. I thought i will forward his message.
