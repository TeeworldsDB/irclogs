00:13 <@deen_> There went my internet, back
00:13 <@EastByte> deen: on the 31c3 I will allocate some 10gbit ports for ddnet so we can run a big event :)
00:13 <@deen_> EastByte: haha
00:13 < TestTee96> http://prntscr.com/4un7yn
00:14 < TestTee96> deen_:  Do you want me to host a Test GER server for you
00:14 <@deen> the website is dynamic, so I'd also need linux =/
00:14 <@deen> and a database and stuff
00:15 < TestTee96> for a teeworlds server? 
00:15 <@deen> i don't think we need a test server
00:15 < TestTee96> Alright
00:15 <@deen> but thanks for the offer
00:15 < TestTee96> Contact me if I can help you
00:16 <@deen> Sure, thanks
00:29 <@deen_> higher ups?
00:29 < shorefire> As in player skill/how well known they'rwe
00:29 < shorefire> Like Ama, Aoe, welf, lady, etc
00:29 <@deen_> i think the community is pretty nice, and i have talked to noobs too
00:30 <@deen_> they don't seem to be afraid to bring stuff up
00:30 <@deen_> and the "deen" on that server wasn't even me^^
00:30 < shorefire> ah he was timing out anyway lol
00:31 <@deen_> The list of testers is here, shorefire: http://ddnet.tw/staff/
00:31 <@deen_> You're not a tester anymore since I didn't see you being very active on the forum
00:31 < shorefire> Which you removed me from
00:31 < shorefire> ?
00:31 < shorefire> Yet you said to me a few weeks ago I still am?
00:31 <@deen_> maybe you were a few weeks ago, i honestly don't know
00:31 < shorefire> I said why dont you re-add me to the list and you said 'you dont need to be on the lsit you can still be tester' ?
00:31 <@deen_> aaah
00:32 <@deen_> yeah, everyone can just test
00:32 < shorefire> Exactly but
00:32 < shorefire> without being on the list
00:32 <@deen_> i thought you were talking about "official testers"
00:32 < shorefire> none even listens to a thing I have to say
00:48 < shorefire> [00:41:37] Also something I wanted to bring up with you deen 
00:48 < shorefire> [00:41:44] I think the tester should be there only to test for bugs
00:48 < shorefire> [00:41:56] Not to judge how 'good' the map is and not to ask the mappers to change parts because they dont like it
00:48 < deen_> [00:45:36] Sorry
00:48 < deen_> [00:45:47] My internet connection is dying a lot today
00:48 < deen_> [00:46:03] Here we go:
00:48 < deen_> [00:46:07] Shorefire. I looked through the logs and would summarize it like this: You came on the server and asked why a map wasn't released yet. (Note that the mapper asked me NOT to release it yet since he's still changing stuff.) The testers explained to you that no official tester has fully tested the map yet. They also explained to you that you're not an official tester. Then you started insulting 3 testers at once, entirely unprovoked:
00:48 < deen_> [00:46:23] [14-10-10 00:17:10][chat]: 3:-2:Shorefire: Just these retard mods being retards
00:48 < deen_> [00:46:27] [14-10-10 00:17:15][chat]: 3:-2:Shorefire: lady Lady Saavik the phyco
00:48 < deen_> [00:46:30] [14-10-10 00:17:18][chat]: 3:-2:Shorefire: Ama: the cunt
00:48 < deen_> [00:46:34] [14-10-10 00:17:20][chat]: 3:-2:Shorefire: Welf: the ego
00:48 < shorefire> [00:46:36] Entirely unprovoked?
00:48 < deen_> [00:46:37] [14-10-10 00:17:23][chat]: 3:-2:Shorefire: The perfect crew lol
00:48 < shorefire> [00:46:38] really deen?
00:48 < deen_> [00:46:40] [14-10-10 00:17:24][chat]: 6:-2:Welf: Shorefire: stop it or ban
00:48 < deen_> [00:46:43] [14-10-10 00:17:26][chat]: 3:-2:Shorefire: see
00:48 < deen_> [00:46:47] [14-10-10 00:17:30][chat]: 3:-2:Shorefire: Express opinoin = ban
00:48 < deen_> [00:46:50] Stop insulting the people who put hours of work into DDNet every day for months now. Noone is perfect and they don't need to be, but they help the project more than you can imagine so I will not tolerate this. If you don't stop I will ban you personally, Shorefire.
00:48 < deen_> [00:47:10] yes, i read the chat, it was unprovoked
00:48 < shorefire> [00:47:15] Funny how you skipped what they said to me
00:48 < shorefire> [00:47:30] strange that, aint it?
00:48 < shorefire> [00:47:41] ugh I'm tired
00:48 < shorefire> [00:47:42] cya
00:48 < deen_> [00:48:04] i don't want to post the entire chat since you posted very personal insults in there
00:48 < deen_> [00:48:09] well, bye
00:48 < deen_> anyway, the worst thing the testers said to Shorefire was "Shorefire: you are not a tester"
00:49 < deen_> oh, and also "Shorefire:  just leave everyone alone"
00:49 <+Welf> maybe i said sth like you are not a good tester
00:50 < deen_> what a nice guy
00:50 < deen_> [14-10-10 00:47:52][chat]: 3:-2:Shorefire: I hope the ddos comes back
00:50 < deen_> [14-10-10 00:47:56][chat]: 3:-2:Shorefire: and this shit gets taken down
00:50 < deen_> Welf: I read the chat, you guys handled it very nicely. no insults at all
00:50 < deen_> thanks for trying to be reasonable with someone unreasonable
00:51 < deen_> [14-10-10 00:48:09][chat]: 3:-2:Shorefire: ddnet needs to die
00:51 < deen_> [14-10-10 00:48:48][chat]: 3:-2:Shorefire: This place is run by a bunch of fucking kids
00:51 < deen_> [14-10-10 00:48:53][chat]: 3:-2:Shorefire: half of them crazy cunts
00:51 <@heinrich5991> stop it, it's ok
00:51 <@heinrich5991> he's gone
00:52 < deen_> i thought it was important to post
00:52 < deen_> It's not the first time we got something like this from shorefire
00:52 < deen_> and sometimes people believe him and they may actually start ddosing us
01:20 <@deen> should work from here now
01:33 < Maple> help deen
01:33 <@deen> what?
01:34 < Maple> welf wont stop trolling me
01:34 < Maple> he called me a dickhead

08:50 < hannibal> good morning
09:50 <+laxadedi> good morning !
09:50 <+laxadedi> hannibal: 10 minutes and 7 hours left :p
09:50 < hannibal> oh you are so right - i'm counting :D
09:51 <+laxadedi> I don't get why you want that much to be in week-end if you enjoy what you do at work.
09:51 <+laxadedi> I just wanna be tonight to have a full night sleep personally :p
09:51 < hannibal> i know the reason, it's embarrassing.
09:52 < hannibal> i'm currently trying to quit using a drug. and i let myself take it at weekends
09:52 <+laxadedi> xD
09:52 <+laxadedi> Weed ?
09:52 < hannibal> worse :(
09:52 <+laxadedi> wut
09:52 <+laxadedi> cocaine oO ?
09:52 < hannibal> let's not talk about it :D
09:53 <+laxadedi> Well, it's been nearly 10 years that I am smoking :x
09:53 < hannibal> yes, i smoke weed as well. every day... :/
09:53 < hannibal> ever tried to quit it?
09:54 <+laxadedi> my only drugs are cofee and tobacco
09:54 <+laxadedi> hum... think I quitted 1 week once, and 2 weeks another time
09:54 <+laxadedi> 2 weeks wasn't by choice
09:54 <+laxadedi> 1 week by choice :p
09:54 < hannibal> ah you smoke cigarettes for 10 years?
09:54 <+laxadedi> yeah
09:54 < hannibal> well.. that's not that bad. :D
09:54 <+laxadedi> I don't do drugs :p
09:55 <+laxadedi> Each time I tried, it ended in a bad reaction
09:55 <+laxadedi> I smoke around 15 cig / day
09:55 < hannibal> that's reasonable. don't worry
09:55 < hannibal> you'll get 80 nevertheless :p
09:55 <+laxadedi> I don't think it is :p
09:56 <+laxadedi> I think it's mostly about luck
09:56 <+laxadedi> I could die tomorrow from a stroke
09:56 <+laxadedi> or never
09:56 < hannibal> more like chance
09:56 < hannibal> if you smoke, you increase your chances of dying early
09:57 <+laxadedi> ok
09:57 < hannibal> but still 
09:57 <+laxadedi> I am going to do something I should not do :p
09:57 < hannibal> you could also live 100 years
09:57 < hannibal> right now?
09:57 <+laxadedi> !calc 365*9*15
09:57 <+Nimda> 365 * 9 * 15 = 49 275
09:57 <+laxadedi> OMG
09:57 <+laxadedi> 50k cigarets smoked xD
09:58 < hannibal> 9 years though :D
09:58 < hannibal> didnt yoiu say 10
09:58 <+laxadedi> ok, how much seconds do you loose each time you smoke ?
09:59 < hannibal> haha
09:59 < hannibal> 300
09:59 <+laxadedi> well, apparently it's 11 minutes
09:59 <+laxadedi> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1117323/
09:59 < hannibal> oh you mean
09:59 < hannibal> how much earlier you will die
10:00 < hannibal> you have to count in the time that it takes to smoke one as well.
10:00 < hannibal> it's lost life time
10:00 <+laxadedi> !calc 50000 * 11 / 60 / 24
10:00 <+Nimda> ((50 000 * 11) / 60) / 24 = 381,944444
10:00 <+laxadedi> wow
10:00 <+laxadedi> I have lost 1 year already !
10:00 < hannibal> :D
10:00 < hannibal> oh would it be comfortable if we could calculate our life time like that
10:00 <+laxadedi> No, cause I smoke indoor at home, and I take a break when I work to smoke, so it's not lost time
10:01 < hannibal> there was this joke
10:01 < hannibal> that sex gives you an additional life time of 15min or something
10:01 <+laxadedi> wow
10:01 <+laxadedi> I am fucked
10:01 < hannibal> so each time you smoke, just have sex once
10:01 <+laxadedi> yeah sure, I am gonna have 15 times sex a day
10:02 < hannibal> :D
10:02 < hannibal> maybe masturbating counts as well
10:02 <+laxadedi> my sex life has been empty for 6 years
10:02 <+laxadedi> oh right, nice !
10:02 < hannibal> i'm taking a break now
10:02 < hannibal> cu in 15min :D
10:02 <+laxadedi> I'll do the same
10:31 <+pause> laxadedi: yo
10:32 <+laxadedi> pause: yo mofo
10:32 <+pause> laxadedi: I really need to pay you a hooker then
10:32 <+laxadedi> :D
10:32 <+pause> laxadedi: This is charity level now
10:32 <+pause> Maybe government will give me tax reduction 
10:32 <+pause> LOL
10:33 <+pause> laxadedi: How can i kick my ghost on quakenet ?
10:33 <+laxadedi> your ghost ?
10:33 <+pause> If i disconnect, but still not timeouted
10:34 <+laxadedi> there is no name service on quakenet, you have to wait
10:34 <+pause> Not the case right now, but i wondered
10:34 <+pause> Oh, shit, ok
10:34 <+laxadedi> No nick name reservation too
10:35 <+pause> laxadedi: Do you prefer asian or eastern europe hooker laxa ?
10:35 <+laxadedi> eastern europe
10:36 <+pause> Good choice !
10:37 <+pause> Well, come near my work when you feel like it !
10:38 <+pause> xD
11:17 <+laxadedi> pause: I don't want a hooker, but a call girl :p
11:17 < hannibal> whop, had a meeting i did not expect.
11:19 <+pause> laxadedi: That stuff costs way more i guess
11:20 <+pause> I'm not a roman emperor, and i promised you a hooker, not a call girl XD
11:20 <+laxadedi> hooker sounds quite dirty to me :(
11:20 <+pause> Well it's more or less the same, changing the name does not change the thing itself
11:21 <+laxadedi> it's not the same !
11:21 <+pause> Would you feel better if i called that a "stress relieving female worker" ?
11:21 <+laxadedi> lol
11:21 <+laxadedi> I am not stressd

11:24 <+pause> laxadedi: Well, why do you want a call girl then ?
11:25 <+laxadedi> yeah xD
11:26 <+pause> What ?
11:26 <+pause> How is that an answer to my question lol
11:26 <+laxadedi> oh, I didn't read the why
11:26 <+laxadedi> it's better, feel like you got more privacy than a hooker, and it's indoor and not hidden in some dirty place
11:27 <+pause> laxadedi: Well, there's those things called hotels i heard
11:27 <+pause> Not going to pay for that though
11:27 <+pause> And you've got to have a place anyway
11:28 <+pause> Well, maybe not for low-end ones XD
11:29 < hannibal> stress relieving female worker, haha. how is this not the standard term for this job :D
11:30 <+pause> hannibal: I don't know, people should like euphemisms by now !
11:30 <+pause> look the linked video for lots of laugh =P
11:31 < hannibal> can't.. need my headphones right now :D
11:31 <+pause> hannibal: Too bad =P
11:35 < hannibal> btw are you all at work too?
11:36 <+pause> hannibal: I am
11:36 <+pause> laxadedi: So, what is it going to be ?
11:36 < hannibal> what does it mean if someone requests CTCP version from me? :D
11:36 <+pause> hannibal: someone is querying your irc client for name, version, etc
11:37 < hannibal> i clicked webchat on ddnet.tw :p
11:37 <+laxadedi> I requested your client name, that's a CTCP request in IRC.
11:39 < hannibal> i remember that i used "limechat" on my macbook
11:40 < hannibal> and in the old days.. mIrc :D
11:42 <+pause> laxadedi: Sooo ?
11:43 <+pause> laxadedi: I want to honor my promises, but if you don't that's fine to me XD
11:43 <+laxadedi> xD
12:03 <+pause> laxadedi: There's also charming chinese hookers in their 50s near my work, i'm sure you would love that
12:04 <+pause> laxadedi: I call them 'nausea emitters'
12:04 <+pause> Goes perfectly with the sweet sewage smell in this area
12:07 <+pause> *nausea field emitters
12:09 < hannibal> where do you live
12:10 < hannibal> i mean country :D
12:13 <+pause> hannibal: France
12:14 < hannibal> ah, okay
12:16 <+pause> hannibal: Lol, did you expect something like north korea ? xD
12:16 < hannibal> god no. i was sure it would be european
12:18 < hannibal> gotta admit, i am a bit francophile :D been there multiple times, love reading books that take place there, et j'adore la langue! 
12:18 <+pause> hannibal: Nice =D
12:18 <+pause> Where do you come from ?
12:18 < hannibal> switzerland
12:19 < hannibal> but the german part
12:20 <+laxadedi> eating in front of computer, please entertain me
12:20 <+pause> laxadedi: We're not call girls laxa
12:21 <+pause> hannibal: Lots of bunkers in switzerland !
12:21 < hannibal> oh, lunch time already
12:21 < hannibal> bunkers?
12:21 < hannibal> guess so..
12:21 < hannibal> we have to hide if someone comes for us, no alternatives.
12:21 <+pause> Yup, i heard there was enough bunkers for the whole population XD
12:21 <+pause> Sounds awesome
12:22 <+pause> Especially with things to come
12:22 < hannibal> hm, isn't it standard that there's at least enough space for the whole population?
12:22 < hannibal> lol
12:22 < hannibal> guess not if you say it like that :D
12:22 <+pause> hannibal: Not at all in the rest of the world
12:23 < hannibal> we use them for
12:23 < hannibal> hmm what's the english word
12:23 < hannibal> refugees?
12:24 < hannibal> or asylum seekers.
12:24 <+pause> hannibal: In bunkers ?
12:24 <+pause> LOL
12:25 < hannibal> yea, not the best solution. but space is limited.
12:26 <+pause> They'll be glad in case of nuclear war =D

12:48 <+laxadedi> On teamspeak : "Hey baguette !"
12:48 < hannibal> j'aime votre comics (belgium & france), j'aime votre literature (dumas!!), j'aime votre painteurs (end of 19th century!!)
12:49 <+laxadedi> you should say : french comics, cause comics have different meaning depending on the culture.
12:49 < hannibal> in german we say "francobelgian"
12:49 < hannibal> to this particular style of comic
12:49 < hannibal> gaston, spirou et fantasio, etc
12:49 <+pause> gaston ! =D
12:49 <+pause> My favourite one =P
12:49 <+laxadedi> tintin and asteric are the most famous
12:49 <+laxadedi> I think
12:50 <+laxadedi> asterix
12:50 < hannibal> yes
12:50 < hannibal> et the ones by peyo
12:50 < hannibal> smurfs
12:50 <+laxadedi> schtroumpf ?
12:50 < hannibal> and johann & pfiffikus (don't know original name)
12:50 < hannibal> the little blue things that live in mushrooms :D
12:50 <+laxadedi> johann & pirlouis
12:50 <+laxadedi> they are called : Schtroumpf
12:50 < hannibal> ok
12:50 < hannibal> in german: die schlümpfe
12:51 < hannibal> et alexandre dumas, not comics, but books. the count of monte christo, the three musketeers
12:51 < hannibal> my favorite ones :D
12:52 <+laxadedi> I don't have much knowledge about classical and old books
12:52 <+laxadedi> not much about recent ones too xD
12:52 < hannibal> :D books are my world.
12:52 < hannibal> i work as editor, so i read for a living :D
12:52 <+laxadedi> Ah ok lol
12:53 <+laxadedi> You are going for bankrupty I guess
12:53 <+laxadedi> Internet is going to take over the books slowly but surely
12:53 < hannibal> actually, i'm specialized on e-books :D
12:53 <@deen> nice, hannibal 
12:53 <+laxadedi> oh
12:53 < hannibal> thx deen, i like my job, just started a few weeks ago
12:53 <+laxadedi> Btw, don't like this. I'll never read any book on a screen.
12:53 <@deen> hannibal: you should proof-read some maps. :P
12:53 < hannibal> :D and some server messages!
12:53 <+laxadedi> same for comics
12:54 < hannibal> yea laxa for me as well
12:54 <@deen> the server messages have wrong grammar for comical purposes!
12:54 < hannibal> :D
12:54 <@deen> i copied them directly from the ddrace wiki
12:54 <@deen> some russian wrote them years ago
12:54 <@deen> and they made me laugh :D
12:54 <+laxadedi> belgium musik : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ublchJYzhao&index=1&list=PLj97VuRMYYDYYmlyd8uXKq_kKV_EIfC3i

12:55 < hannibal> yea it's not really important. i actually like them. not for their grammatical faults, just because they are positive 
12:55 < hannibal> oh i like stromae
12:55 < hannibal> i saw (on tv) a movie of a recent live show from him. it's really more of a theatrical show than a lame music concert. looked very interesting
12:56 <+laxadedi> don't know about that
12:56 < hannibal> can't compare it to other pop stars that just sing play back
12:56 < hannibal> he really danced, and sung, and played his roles like a comedian or actor.
12:56 < hannibal> he looks so nice ;D
12:58 <+laxadedi> Well, nearly 1 hour of break already, should go for my smoke then work :)
12:58 <+laxadedi> I have 2 screens at work, so I see when anyone speak :p
12:58 <@deen> i just noticed FRA2 has an AMD cpu!
12:59 <+laxadedi> What difference does it makes ?
12:59 <@deen> I'm surprised now, because it's faster than the dedicated kimsufi server (both 4 cores) and faster than the 6 cores of GER
12:59 <@deen> I expected amd to be slower, and I've never had an amd server cpu before
13:00 <+laxadedi> how can you know that ? You benchmarked it or what ?
13:00 <@deen> my "benchmark"
13:00 <@deen> i just compile ddnet server everywhere and look how long it takes :P
13:01 < hannibal> such a good artist. just watched another video ;D
13:02 <@deen> and apparently harmony hosting is not overselling cpus
13:02 <@deen> you actually get exclusive cores
13:03 <+laxadedi> Nice to know
13:03 <+laxadedi> how much time for compiling the full release then ?
13:03 <@deen> just tested again^^
13:03 <+laxadedi> I take 36 second for "release"
13:03 <+laxadedi> on my i7 920 at home
13:03 <@deen> actually same time on Kimsufi KS-4 and HarmonyHosting
13:03 <@deen> both 7 seconds
13:03 <@deen> for server only
13:04 <+laxadedi> oh, you made me fear xD
13:04 <@deen> bam server_sql_release
13:04 <+laxadedi> I take 26 seconds for client only
13:04 <@deen> and 13 seconds on the 6 cores of Datafabrik
13:04 <@deen> the bad one at KMS took about 30 seconds
13:04 <@deen> Iran takes a few minutes :P
13:04 <@deen> afk
13:05 <+laxadedi> let me try that
13:07 <+laxadedi> 1:54 for "server_sql_release" with a mono core@1.6Ghz :)
13:26 < hannibal> back :)
13:39 <@deen> back
13:39 <@deen> laxadedi: it's a bad "benchmark" though, since it depends on compiler version and stuff like that

14:02 <+Nimda> [Dice Game] Rules: Be the first to get 50 or more points on your permanent score by rolling as many dice as you want one at a time. If you roll 1-5, the points get added to your temporary score. If you roll a 6 you lose all points on your temporary score. You
14:02 <+Nimda> can stand any time, which adds your temporary score to your permanent score and your opponent gets the turn. If a player gets 50 or more points and stands, the other players have still one chance and can roll dice, trying to beat the score.

16:03 <@deen> hi BeaR 
16:03 < BeaR> hey (:
16:03 <@deen> I'm really wondering how other communities deal with ddos attacks
16:04 <@deen> it can't be possible that TW is the only game with this problem?
16:04 <+laxadedi> I had a similar on another game with little community, really old game
16:04 <+laxadedi> a mmorpg
16:04 <+laxadedi> one of the oldest of his kind
16:04 <+o_be_one> T4C :D
16:04 <+laxadedi> yeah
16:04 <+laxadedi> :)
16:05 <+o_be_one> B)
16:05 <+laxadedi> but it's a complete other story, cause officials servers are hosted on shitty laptop with shit connection
16:05 <@deen> hahaha
16:05 <+laxadedi> and you don't have any other choice when you pay a license for it
16:05 <+o_be_one> lol
16:05 <+laxadedi> unless you get exclusivity of the license
16:06 <+laxadedi> Anyway, I really think that if you have no money, you can't do shit about it...
16:07 <+laxadedi> So little games are fucked
16:07 <+o_be_one> deen, u need to know that TW is the only game and community where i have all these ddos
16:07 <@deen> o_be_one: yeah, i guessed so =/
16:07 <@deen> other games have smaller attacks probably
16:07 <+o_be_one> none of other games and project that i host got ddosed like that
16:07 <+o_be_one> yes
16:07 <@deen> but it's weird, why is teeworlds like that?
16:07 <+o_be_one> idk
16:08 <+o_be_one> my company own one of the biggest love website, with 3000 to 6000 simultaneous customers online
16:08 <+o_be_one> with a poor ddos protection, and the website is never down ...
16:08 <@deen> "love website"? is that a dating site or what?
16:08 <+o_be_one> yes dating,
16:08 < hannibal> i was thinking
16:08 <+o_be_one> i didnt found the word :p
16:08 <+laxadedi> adopteunmec.com ?
16:08 <+o_be_one> lol :p
16:09 <+o_be_one> no i work in Canada :p 
16:09 <@EastByte> I think the problem is that kids don't know how dangerours ddosing actually is
16:09 <+o_be_one> QuebecRencontre :p
16:09 <@EastByte> and we only have them
16:09 <+o_be_one> yes
16:09 <+o_be_one> and how its illegal too
16:09 < BeaR> listened to a talk a year ago, they basically just added some small server which forward the requests to the actual game servers. /:
16:09 <+o_be_one> remember when you was kid ...
16:09 <@EastByte> BeaR: which is a good solution
16:09 <@deen> BeaR: yeah, we discussed an idea like that before
16:10 < BeaR> dunno how it would affect the ping as it was a mmorpg if I remember correctly and they basically just wanted to keep the connections alive
16:11 <@deen> minecraft is popular with kids too. no attacks there, o_be_one ?
16:11 < BeaR> there has been attacks on minecraft (:
16:11 <@deen> yeah, teeworlds is extremely dependent on good ping
16:12 < hannibal> i wouldn't say that teeworlds has that many more kids than other games?
16:13 < hannibal> basically every game i've played has it's fair share of 12y olds but also the older players
16:13 <@deen> maybe it's just because noone does anything against the ddosers in TW
16:13 <@deen> for example the last guy, BlackLine. He just started ddosing for fun and came here with his real ip
16:14 <@deen> could just go to the police about that
16:14 <+laxadedi> fun clip : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwRxha8zSU&list=PL97E674D7F6A4A9BB&index=1

16:14 < BeaR> tbh never heard of ddos in teeworlds in the last 5 years except that attack on the master server
16:15 <@deen> BeaR: ddnet has had attacks since forver, but usually rather small ones and not so often
16:16 <@deen> and there was this 1 project that had to go down because of constant ddosing
16:17 < hannibal> and i've heard other admins complain about it. but i think they get smaller attacks, because they said their protection works..
16:17 <@deen> so far FRA2 hasn't gone down since i set the new firewall rules
16:25 <+o_be_one> deen, no attacks about MC ..
16:25 <@deen> maybe tw is a target because it's open source
16:26 <@deen> anyway, I'm trying to make timeout protection for a longer time on GER now
16:26 <@deen> at least once the server is down
16:26 <@deen> so that you can maybe get your tee back after a ddos
16:28 <+o_be_one> deen, do you keep HH ? i can ask refund easyly if you want
16:28 <@deen> o_be_one: still testing it
16:28 <+o_be_one> k
16:28 <@deen> but it looks better than kimsufi
16:28 <@deen> so i'd rather cancel kimsufi
16:28 <+o_be_one> yes thats why i use it ...
16:29 <+o_be_one> Kimsufi was my start, no more
16:29 <+o_be_one> kimsufi is very too cheap
16:29 <@deen> more expensive than HH
16:29 <+o_be_one> and my experience is bad with it, bad support, etc.
16:32 < BeaR> hm seems like I need to rewrite the whole sound interface :D
16:32 <@deen> BeaR: oh wow
16:32 <@deen> why?
16:32 < BeaR> lacks several features
16:33 < BeaR> sdl audio interface is not that useful imho /:
16:33 <@EastByte> but we have sound D:
16:33 < BeaR> but with a bad interface :D
16:33 < BeaR> can only play sound global in the map :/
16:34 <@deen> not at a position?
16:34 <@EastByte> are you talking about tw? sure you can
16:34 <@EastByte> (play sounds at specific positions in gameworld)
16:35 < BeaR> well has some drawbacks
16:36 <@deen> yay, one liner ddos recovery for ddnet servers
16:36 <@deen> while true; do ping -c 1 8.8.8.8 > /dev/null && sleep 30m && ping -c 1 8.8.8.8 > /dev/null && echo conn_timeout_protection 1000) || echo conn_timeout_protection 10000; done
16:36 <@deen> (ping*
16:37 < Wohoo> hi all
16:37 <@deen> hi
16:38 < Wohoo> hei deen, there is no Skin  section in forum? only Client, Map and server
16:38 <@deen> yes
16:38 <@deen> i don't like skins
16:39 < Wohoo> but i have a funny bugged skin to show
16:39 <@deen> i think we have more than enough
16:39 <@deen> post in client or offtopic
16:39 < Wohoo> it is about bug on it, not about adding skin, i use standard too
16:39 <@deen> then client
16:42 <@EastByte> deen: did we ever discuss a ddnet accountsystem?
16:42 <@deen> no idea
16:43 <@deen> it was planned for hookrace
16:43 <@EastByte> yea
16:43 <@deen> i didn't want to have the trouble in ddnet
16:43 <@deen> especially since players are already playing
16:43 <@deen> without accounts
16:43 <@deen> so people could steal accounts
16:43 <@EastByte> right
16:44 <@EastByte> but I guess people would love to sign into their ddnet clients
16:44 <@EastByte> and being able to detect fakers for example
16:45 <@deen> yes, would be nice
16:45 <@deen> then we need account servers
16:45 <@deen> and regular servers have to be connected to them too?
16:45 <@EastByte> could be done completly client side (without ddnet tw servers)
16:45 <@deen> how?
16:45 <@EastByte> you can keep a list of all online accounts
16:46 <@EastByte> and clients requests whether a player is online on some server
16:46 <@deen> so a client can just tell the account server "I'm on server x" and the account server believes it?
16:47 <@EastByte> would be neccessary yes
16:47 <@deen> but it would also work on non-ddnet-servers
16:47 <@deen> that's nice
16:47 <@EastByte> yea
16:48 <@deen> btw, people use +showhookcoll to identify if someone is botting or not :P
16:48 <@deen> in the ictf community, it's funny
16:48 <@EastByte> how?
16:48 <@deen> suspected botters are asked to install ddnet client
16:48 <@deen> and use +showhookcoll while playing
16:48 <@deen> as proof that they're not running their bot client
16:48 <@EastByte> ah and then they are worse then before?
16:48 <@deen> if they were botting, yes^^
16:48 <@EastByte> hmkay
16:49 <@deen> hm, i like the idea
16:49 <@deen> with accouns
16:49 <@deen> what about the account server
16:49 <@deen> it will get ddosed
16:49 <@EastByte> nice way to spread the ddnet client (that anti bottin thing)^^
16:49 <@EastByte> might be a problem
16:49 <@EastByte> but we would use tcp I guess
16:49 <@deen> but then you're just not logged in, so everything would keep working
16:50 <@EastByte> yep
16:50 <@deen> but if the server knows nothing then people can keep faking others and making fake ranks
16:50 <@EastByte> well, logged in players might check what they've done before
16:51 <@EastByte> and remove some ranks
16:51 <@EastByte> just an idea
16:51 <@EastByte> but I'm not sure about binding accounts to ranks
16:51 <@deen> no, they shouldn't be able to remove ranks
16:51 <@deen> yeah, maybe it's good enough when others see who's logged in
16:52 <@deen> but hm, the client needs to request a lot of info from the account server
16:52 <@deen> every time someone joins a server
16:52 <@EastByte> indeed
16:52 <@deen> that kind of information should really come from the gameserver i think
16:52 <@EastByte> ddnet server could offer special support for that
16:53 <@deen> you also want global chats?
16:54 <@EastByte> well that's your idea^^
16:54 < Wohoo> can you help me? do you know how use spoiler tag on forum?
16:54 <@deen> there is no spoiler tag afaik
16:55 <@EastByte> anyways, it's hard to implement / requires quite a long dev time
16:55 < Wohoo> it may be usefull to post screenshot
16:56 <@EastByte> WOW, would be cool to upload screens using the account
16:56 <@EastByte> and demos
16:56 <@deen> and connect the account to your player profile and mapper profile
16:56 <@EastByte> yea
16:56 <@deen> so you have everything on the website
16:56 <@deen> indeed
16:57 <@deen> and then you need a demo downloader in ddnet client
16:57 <@deen> so you can get the most recent demos of your friends
16:57 < BeaR> lel
16:57 <@deen> haha
16:57 <@EastByte> well, dreaming about ideas is easy ^^
16:57 <+laxadedi> hannibal: you there ?
16:58 <@EastByte> deen: maybe we should implement a http lib into ddnet
16:58 <@EastByte> http is friendly :)
16:58 <+laxadedi> if you like electronic music, you should definitively check that :

16:58 < BeaR> EastByte: why :D?
16:59 <@deen> EastByte: you mean the current one isn't good enough? :P
16:59 <@EastByte> oh there is one?
16:59 <@EastByte> it must be horrible since I didn't note^^
16:59 <@EastByte> BeaR: because of ddos protections and so on
16:59 <+o_be_one> Teetime, u like blmap baam x) ?
16:59 <@EastByte> http has high priority
17:00 <@EastByte> deen: also everything could be ajax
17:00 <@deen> EastByte: posting raw text using net_tcp_send isn't good enough?
17:00 <@EastByte> ajaj
17:00 < hannibal> laxadedi: now i'm here.. but just to say goodbye. i'm off for the weekend :)
17:00 <@deen> bye hannibal 
17:00 < hannibal> cu ingame all :)
17:00 <+laxadedi> hannibal: xD
17:01 <@EastByte> deen: by using http you can just use your python http environment to work on it
17:01 <@EastByte> implementing own protocols is a bad idea I think
17:02 <+Teetime> o_be_one: lol no, i dont even get the point of blocker
17:02 <@EastByte> no one does :)
17:03 <+o_be_one> Teetime, but its you on baam blockern o ?
17:04 <+Teetime> Probably another one with this name
17:04 <@EastByte> ^ his name really is famous :)
17:04 <@EastByte> dunno why
17:09 <+o_be_one> too bad :(
17:10 <@deen> but something is weird at HH, all cpu cores report the exact same load^^
17:10 <@EastByte> haha that's strange
17:16 < Wohoo> bb all
17:41 <@EastByte> deen: can you check #teeworlds? _guest has some problem relating dos/flood on vanilla
17:41 <@EastByte> maybe you know which issue it could be
17:41 <@EastByte> afk
17:41 <@EastByte> oh wait, you aren't there
17:43 <@EastByte> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/6755728
17:43 <@EastByte> afk
17:51 <@deen> we just ban all packets from an ip when it spams too much
17:51 <@deen> i'd guess that works against this kind of issue =/
17:52 <@deen> if people had ipv6 that would be cool
17:53 <@EastByte> indeed
17:53 <@deen> we have more than enough ips there
17:53 <@deen> for any ddos prevention attempts
17:54 <@EastByte> hm I don't think that makes it harder to take down the server
17:54 <@EastByte> especially because ovh doesn't support ipv6 rules^^
17:54 <@deen> ah^^
17:54 <@deen> but i think ddosers don't use ipv6 either :P
17:54 <@EastByte> yea, find a botnet that supports ipv6
17:55 <@deen> do the master servers even work with ipv6?
17:55 <@EastByte> what I know is that the master server's ip entries are 18 bytes long
17:55 <@EastByte> for ipv6 support
17:55 <@deen> hm, how would i register my ipv6 address?
17:55 <@EastByte> but now sure whether it works completly
17:56 <@EastByte> bindaddr [::] or something
17:56 <@deen> because GER has ipv6
17:56 <@deen> but well, since no players have it it doesn't matter much
17:56 <@EastByte> FRA too
17:56 <@EastByte> atleast it can be well used for communication between servers
17:57 <@deen> between the few servers that have it
17:57 <@EastByte> hm mostly supported I think
17:58 <@EastByte> except you try to order servers in chile
17:58 <@EastByte> or china
17:58 <@EastByte> I guess the chinese firewall doesn't even know ipv6
18:04 <@EastByte> deen: mysql allows access from multiple clients at the same time right?
18:04 <@EastByte> so you can lock tables or something
18:04 <@deen> of course!
18:04 <@deen> lock?
18:04 <@EastByte> so it's easy to run multiple accounts servers on different servers
18:04 <@deen> and then?
18:05 <@EastByte> for example if a user gets logged in twice at the same time on differen account servers
18:05 <@EastByte> easy to handle it right?
18:06 <@deen> i don't understand =/
18:06 <+laxa> https://www.plastc.com/card
18:06 <+laxa> Interesting product if you use a lot of cards !
18:06 <@EastByte> for example if we want a user only to be logged in once
18:07 <@EastByte> how do you prevent a collision when accessing mysql?
18:07 <@deen> on a single database?
18:07 <@EastByte> yes
18:08 <@EastByte> from multiple account servers
18:08 <@deen> ok, now i understand what kind of lock you mean
18:08 <@EastByte> user.online = true if ...
18:09 <+laxa> deen: your https is broken
18:09 <@deen> laxa: how so?
18:09 <+pause> laxa: You read hacker news now ?
18:09 <@EastByte> laxa: you are broken :D
18:09 <+laxa> pause: what ?
18:10 <+laxa> deen: it doesn't load the whole website
18:10 <+laxa> and you don't have a redirect from http to https, but I guess it's what you want

18:10 <@deen> laxa: do i advertise the https site anywhere?
18:11 <+laxa> hum no :)
18:11 <@deen> what part doesn't work?
18:11 <@deen> youtube vids don't work, i guess that's a security feature
18:11 <@deen> rest seems to work to me
18:12 <+laxa> http://snag.gy/HKpl4.jpg
18:12 <@deen> might make sense to use https for the forum because of the login
18:12 <@deen> laxa: weird, for me it works
18:12 <+laxa> because it's probably cached
18:12 <@deen> ah, you haven't accepted the certificate for https://ddnet.tw
18:12 <@deen> meh
18:12 <+laxa> I accepted it, otherwise chrome would not let me browse the website
18:13 <@deen> i thought you accepted only for forum.ddnet.tw
18:13 <+laxa> ok

18:13 <+laxa> my bad
18:13 <+laxa> :)

19:43 <+laxa> startssl.com
19:43 <+laxa> I got mine from here
19:43 <+eeeee> yeah
19:43 <+laxa> and if you are a student, you can get the new github plan
19:43 <+laxa> and have a certificate from I don't remember website

19:44 <+Nimda> Foss may refer to Foss (surname), people with the last name Foss, Foss Shanahan (1910-1964), New Zealand diplomat, Foss Westcott (1863-1949), English bishop, Tom Foss, fictional character from Kyle XY, Foss Gly, fictional character from two Clive Cussler novels, Night Probe! and Cyclops, Foss, Oklahoma, town in Washita County, Oklahoma, United States, Foss, Oregon, community in Tillamook C... ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foss )

19:44 <+laxa> not foss
19:44 <+eeeee> software
19:44 <+laxa> :)
19:44 <+eeeee> :P
19:44 <+laxa> I guess the github student plan is quite nice
19:45 <+laxa> I didn't took it yet, cause I would have no use for it.
19:45 <+eeeee> so does deen have a concrete plan about the accounts or all of this is just ideas?
19:46 <+laxa> I think this is mostly ideas,
19:46 <+laxa> we will just see I guess
19:46 <+eeeee> well while sitting back and watching deen do things for us sounds nice
19:47 <+eeeee> i'd like to at least share my knowledge of making account servers if it's applicable
19:47 <+laxa> deen welcome any help :)
19:47 <+laxa> but I really think that the best thing for teeworlds would be to remake it from scratch in full object C++
19:47 <+eeeee> yeah i'm just wondering if anyone figured a way to hack the accounts into vanilla
19:48 <+eeeee> best i've seen so far was teerace with their rcon auth
19:48 <+eeeee> which was still plaintext
19:48 <+laxa> since teerace is open source, they could use most of their identification system I guess
19:49 <+eeeee> it's not secure tho
19:49 <@deen> so much fun on this map with 52 people
19:49 <@deen> 55*
19:49 <+laxa> !twp deen
19:49 <+Nimda> deen is currently playing Dusty Road on server : DDNet GER - Moderate [DDraceNetwork].
19:49 <@deen> all at the start^^
19:49 <+eeeee> nice
19:51 <+eeeee> at the dawn of blocking we once had 55 players on a blocker server running ddrace-zt-III
19:57 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
19:57 <+Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 327
19:57 <+Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 532 users online at 2014-09-28 20:14:41
20:06 <+eeeee> like what about letting people register on ddnet.tw and auto-logging their ip into their account ingame while they have a browser with ddnet.tw open
20:09 <+eeeee> if ddnet.tw accounts had some bells and whistles like charts or showing what are your friends playing or global chat, i think people would use it
20:12 <@EastByte> and there might be less shitstorms because they aren't faking each other

22:03 <@deen> good start with the new hoster^^
22:04 <@deen> 24 hours and server is down
22:04 <@EastByte> doesn't happen often to see dedicated servers unreachable
22:05 <+laxadedi> I love this
22:05 <+laxadedi> you can connect to IRC server with fucking chat
22:05 <@deen> yeah, I'm on it
22:05 <+laxadedi> but they won't give the name of the fucking damn server
22:05 <@deen> server is Klat00.org but they speak french anyway
22:05 <+laxadedi> let me come
22:06 <@deen> it's ok, i'm not even reading^^
22:08 <+laxadedi> good organisation, someone relaunched nginx, so you got disconnected :p
22:08 <@deen> nice, got disconnected
22:08 <@deen> guess their irc server is down :P
22:09 <@deen> ah no, just me
22:09 <@deen> damn laxa, talking about me
22:10 <+laxadedi> I am asking them that they can do about foreign client :)
22:10 <@deen> ...
22:10 <+laxadedi> what
22:10 <+laxadedi> they can do\
22:17 <+laxadedi> apparently they have been ddos wednesday evening lol
22:17 <+laxadedi> they went down for 5 minutes
22:19 <+Nimda> DDNet FRA2 went back online!
22:21 <+laxadedi> they don't know where it's coming from, they say it's neither hardware not network not ddos
22:21 <+laxadedi> -not+nor
22:21 <@deen> yes, i understood that
22:23 <+laxadedi> I feel like those people would like to have nimda announcing server that goes down :p
22:23 <@deen> sure, send them nimda
22:40 <@deen> ZAF getting ddosed
22:41 <+Nimda> DDNet South Africa went down!
22:52 <+Nimda> DDNet South Africa went back online!
23:26 <+Learath2> maybe vali decided to go to the root of his problems and take down ovh instead
23:27 <+eeeee> i wish he tried to dig even deeper and just ddosed himself
23:28 <+eeeee> this way you could say that entire internet is down
23:28 <+Learath2> that would be kinda funny
23:28 <+Learath2> how do you stop the ddos shitstorm if you cant give the command to stop it
23:29 <+eeeee> well theres always a backup connection
23:29 <+Learath2> lets point all ddnet.tw domains to vali's ip next time he comes
23:29 <+eeeee> e.g. cell phone
23:29 <+Learath2> what if he has a Nokia 3310
23:30 <+eeeee> yeah that's possible if he spent all his money on ddosing and can't afford a good phone
