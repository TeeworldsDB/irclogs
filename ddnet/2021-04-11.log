00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i wonder what languages our fonts support, i saw someone using bengali, didnt even know that language exists xD
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> google even has a font for it
00:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hind+Siliguri?subset=bengali
05:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> is there an accepted way to offer bounties for fixing issues?
05:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> or just, idk +1 issues
05:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> Literally no one's getting paid for contributing to ddnet
05:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> doesn't mean they can't be
05:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> there's a particular issue i would like to offer a bounty for
05:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> No one will care to pay you to fix something
05:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> Since they get nothing out of it
06:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> People fix stuff for fun
06:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> No one's doing it as a profession here
06:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i think hes saying he'll pay someone to fix an issue m88
06:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> But that's just more weird
06:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> not rly
06:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> uhhhhhh alright anyway
06:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ill post the issue
06:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and she! but its ok
06:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> I'm used to calling everyone he on the internet my bad
06:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> nono not you, louis :P
06:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and louis,, you know me ingame xD
06:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> :okay:
06:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_bounty
06:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> "Bounty driven development is one of the Business models for open-source software. The compensation offered for an open-source bounty is usually small. "
06:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i dont want to spur an off-topic discussion about this, but it's a thing :D
06:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> Do you want to get your own code fixed?
06:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> no, it's not my code. ddnet client
06:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> But why do you want to pay someone for it?
06:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> Does the problem bother you that much?
06:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> because.. i care about it being fixed? xD
06:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> yes
06:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i don't mind paying someone for their time. despite everyone working for free, getting paid to fix things people care about is a way to show support
06:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> one sec ill post the issue
06:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3706
06:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> offering 10 usd zelle/paypal to anyone who can fix this :D
06:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i will likely try to contribute to other github issues personally, but we will see
06:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> People would've probably done it for free if you'd make people aware enough of it
06:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it would be cool to see this working honestly
06:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> my personal motivation is a bind that toggles my entities, pretty much the only use case i can think of, but a good one
06:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> my personal motivation is a bind that toggles my entities (between different entities, not on/off), pretty much the only use case i can think of, but a good one
06:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> Sounds like you only play with entities on
06:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it depends. if i need to focus on finishing a map / if a map's tiles are too distracting i use them
06:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> let's not talk too much about that here though ^^
06:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <WAV> Nice
06:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> Qianye seemed cool but i rq
10:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think its weird at all
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
12:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> big pog
13:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :poggers:
13:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Damn hes challenging me
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Gorden> no chance @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti
14:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> i gave more
14:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :monkalaugh:
14:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @lynn 
14:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/actions/runs/738203698
14:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> here you can download your client
14:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Chairn Hey, I am just curious, the stackoverflow question about the nvidia thing explicitly asked for directx, maybe using that client with NvOptimusEnablement(which kinda also is a nightly anyway) and trying the GL to dx12 works there? would be worth a try ðŸ˜„
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i tried and it didn't work ðŸ˜¦
15:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> what
15:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh, my bot parse the entire ddnet.tw/players page :justatest:
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably a better approach ngl
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i also kinda made a api out of ddnet.tw before making the bot
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so the bot is calling the api instead of parsing the page itself
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Makes sense and do you cache in your api?
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye
15:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I guess we should start exposing this data from ddnet.tw instead of having the bot have its own db
15:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ‘€ if you can have a straight up json api, that would be nice
15:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm looking into it
15:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ¥³
15:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/830792010730045500/unknown.png
15:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have exactly 1 hour,not sure whether to spend it looking into the bot thing or finishing up my pr that has been a draft since ages
15:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> pr. i've decided for you. do it now. stop chatting
15:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'll try to staticly link nvapi then, maybe that works xd
15:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> wow looks cool af
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> uuuh our storage system really needs work, the current way it's set up is actually quite me
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> h
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> starting ddnet with currentdir being data actually breaks quite a lot
15:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the heuristic lookup for datadir is also ugly
15:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ideally we should only look for data in the same directory as the binary
15:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and datadir should be special
15:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Chairn so the linker output said it proceeded the NVAPI library, so its atleast aware of it, but im not really sure if thats actually enough or if it has to be traded for the OGL lib, but the stackoverflow thing also isnt very verbose on that xD
15:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Maybe MSVC linker just works like that xD
15:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
15:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/actions/runs/738290193
16:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> wtf
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> what is that activity chart
17:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> uh, @heinrich5991 how do we fix style now? been a while since I did any ddnet stuff
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> scripts/fix_style.pyh
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> scripts/fix_style.py
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 ^
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the trick is never doing that and still passing check-style ðŸ˜‰ real programmers!
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are some things I disagree with clang-format when it comes to style :P
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I'd be really grateful if you could take a look at my PR, especially the concurrency part in CUpdater
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> concurrency? you love making me cry, huh?
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 btw is the pr planned to check the whole files every startup?
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it checks the whole data directory every startup
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AFAIK yes
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's pretty quick but you can disable it if you want to save a couple ms
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i just wonder if thats sane
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> instead of checking modify time or smth
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you're loading the files from the data dir anyway, it's not much of a difference
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh fix_style is making some weeeeird changes to files I didn't even touch
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> clang-format 10 please
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> well parts*
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah but arent u loading like only 50% of it
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, tell me
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maps, language files etc.
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> are not loaded
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd really rather not rely on the filesystems timestamps for this
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's already very quick and async
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maps & translation are 1.5 out of 33.7 MB
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or 54 out of 692 files
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't seem to be worth it to exclude
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> sha256 is also pretty darn performant
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tell that the potato computers
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> all of the time will be spend on IO
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah probably
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and it's 1.5 out of 33.7 MB or 54 out of 692
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If anyone has a shittier computer feel free to give it a go
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I probably have the worst machine out of you all ðŸ˜‰
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that I still develop on, idk even why
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if there is no reason to upgrade, dont do it xd
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> speed
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> uh even with clang-format-10 this is touching many things I haven't even touched
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. have you reset it to the start before running clang-format-10? (careful, don't erase your actual changes!)
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah I did a `git reset --hard HEAD`
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you send an example of what clang-format 10 changes?
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 can it also check like if the integrity was ever executed? E.g. it could be useful for android to copy everything from the .apk data
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but that only happens at updates or first time setup
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, I figured it out
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not sure I get the question, what do you mean by "integrity was ever executed"?
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is a very simple pr btw, at compile time it goes thru all data files to generate a list of shas, at launch it goes thru all data files to check the shas
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> e.g. u have a hash for all files
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> once the check is executed it creates a hash with all files too(ofc they match)
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and when there is an update you can easily do a check before loading client data
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think in general CStorage needs a rather large rework
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we defs need a explaination that you can store your modifactions inside the config directory, tho nobody will understand it and ask here xD
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 the changes in CUpdater also should fix the many weird intermittent bugs we get with the updater
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The Restore Files button will happily move it for them if they insist on not learning where the files are supposed to go
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh thats nice
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah if there are only extra files and modified files the popup won't close but I'm out of time today, so that'll have to stay for tomorrow
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PopCorn181> @heinrich5991 i have the worst pc
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, battle ðŸ™‚
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what CPU do you have?
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he has opengl 1.x only pc
18:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª I think I asked before but can you think of a way to isolate a ui element on all gl versions we support? I want to dim the entire screen except for one "thing"
18:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The best I could come up with was to render everything once, render a dark overlay then render the "thing" on top
18:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cant u just render a fullscreen half transparent dark quad and then render ur ui stuff
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The point is that the ui stuff is already something we render, I'm basically trying to highlight some ui elements
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was looking to avoid the double render
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so you want to integrate it directly into the "normal" code?
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you can do stuff like that
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah sort of, but I think without gl3 it's not possible for me to render a dark overlay with a shape
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with stencil buffer
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah no stencil buffers before 3.3, no? ðŸ˜›
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they should exists since ever
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh really?
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well since 2.0 yes
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but before not sure, but i assume yes
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm I'd need to "render" the mask into a stencil buffer, right?
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you render your whole screen with stencil enable, then render ur ui element with a different stencil mask
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then render a fullscreen transparent dark quad everywhere, where stencil has a specific value
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I guess it doesn't really save me any hassle, I still need to render the "thing" twice
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so its not really twice, its just working with, what the stencil is designed for ðŸ˜„
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> e.g. every pixel renders a 0 into stencil, except your ui element
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so the quad just renders everywhere, where pixel is equal to 0
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> aah I see what you mean
18:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I really doubt gl1 has stencil buffers though
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> nvm, it does
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think opengl doesnt really make any kind of garantuee that the GPU has to support stencil buffers, atleast not in older versions. But i doubt these GPUs exists? XD
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean 1994 there defs was a different situation or whenever gl 1.x was released xD
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> pleasant

23:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I asked first :p
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I used to run a TW server on a 500 MHz AMD Geode LX800: https://www.alix-board.de/produkte/alix1e.html
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> But no GPU to play on ðŸ˜„
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> It was awkward to use since the CPU doesn't even have SSE, strange for an x86 CPU still being produced in 2019
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> @Jupstar âœª works! paypal?
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Congrats to @Jupstar âœª for being the first person getting paid to work on DDNet ðŸ˜„
23:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> hey if you love the game and want to support specific fixes, i dont see a reason why they have to be the only one :)
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i will likely keep doing this if there's other issues i would like to see fixed, or just attempt to fix them personally
23:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> also... what's the basis for getting the `Dev` role? not that i selfishly want it or anything :P
23:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen I offer Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU 1007U @ 1.50GHz
23:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i wont take any money tho
23:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> aww ok
23:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> thank u though you are amazing ðŸ’–
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> Thanks Jupstar and Deen for fixing that ^^ really helps me! (i'm WatermelonDriveway)
