12:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 sometimes booting i get a kernel panic, apparently it is unable to mount the rootfs, i wonder if this is cuz the ssd is dying or some issue

12:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> would a initramfs help? xd
12:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> weird thing is it boots like 50% of times,
12:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and when booted there are no apparent issues
12:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe ill need to downgrade the kernel

13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The editor gets so much love out of the sudden
13:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish
13:20 < bridge> <Ewan> I‚Äôm familiar
13:20 < bridge> <Ewan> What does it have to do with OSS
13:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> please tell me what else you're familiar with, so I can avoid giving you duplicate informatio
13:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> n
13:22 < bridge> <Ewan> I‚Äôd consider running the biggest open source platform, designing & maintaining many languages with open source specifications & implementations, and constantly increasing the amount of open source software used in their products a net positive
13:23 < bridge> <Ewan> Don‚Äôt know how that can be interpreted as a bad thing
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Microsoft changed, but they are still money b*tches
13:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the bad thing is that this apparently forgets history, where companies (especially microsoft) used such a leverage to make things worse for open-source
13:25 < bridge> <Ewan> This is what you have to do as a business
13:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This is what was taught to you a company had to do
13:26 < bridge> <marmare_314> I'm trying to implement a proof mode for backgrounds. Does anyone have some ideas how to get access to the CMenuBackground class (especially the positions m_aPositions) from the editor? I was thinking of maybe extending the IGameClient class.
13:27 < bridge> <Ewan> Have you noticed that the two most popular desktop OSes are both made by companies most would consider to have very scummy practices
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I used the ddrace time markers as positions
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And somewhere is an enum for the UI pages
13:27 < bridge> <Ewan> I don‚Äôt really know what history you refer to that pertains specifically to OSS
13:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Have u noticed that Linux is the biggest operating system in the world?
13:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> perhaps you could move the menu positions to some shared file, and let both the editor and the menu_background access it
13:30 < bridge> <Ewan> There is no company behind Linux, moot point.
13:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> red hat and canonical are kinda big
13:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> linux is a kernel remember
13:30 < bridge> <Robyt3> We generally try to avoid accessing the client components from the editor. But this is already done once in the editor to access the camera position. You can use the kernel to get a pointer to the gameclient and then get whatever component you need. See `CEditor::LoadCurrentMap` implementation. If you find a better way that would be preferable.
13:31 < bridge> <Ewan> It‚Äôs the largest because the footprint & power for particular tasks on most distributions are obvious pluses for the enterprise world
13:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. the one where outlook (still!) very badly supports open protocols
13:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> many many companies benefit using linux, specially SaaS and cloud providers
13:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> aws
13:31 < bridge> <Ewan> Where the average user (i.e. the vast majority of the cashflow) has no need for such things
13:32 < bridge> <marmare_314> Then @heinrich5991s suggestion is probably the best.
13:32 < bridge> <marmare_314> What time markers?
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Linux foundation is kinda
13:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ms is worse than discord, extend embrace extinguish is real, they also spread FEAR for things that are competition, such as saying opengl was trash and thus fear mongering it wasnt supported on vists, which led to the rise of trash directx

13:33 < bridge> <Learath2> Does the table printed above include the correct drive?
13:34 < bridge> <Ewan> I love Linux but its success is not due to the actions of any particular company. This is unrelated anyway because my message was related to how businesses grow, not how there is a successful product without the ownership of any one company
13:34 < bridge> <Ewan> It was kind of far fetched to bring up
13:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill need to check, i wont be home for 2 days sadly xd

13:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> related read
13:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think u have a bad understanding of companies. Basically ddnet org can be considered a company too. U think too much from a capitalism standpoint
13:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (2010 context)
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "Companies take various forms, such as:
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> voluntary associations, which may include nonprofit organizations

13:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> business can exist and grow without being predatory
13:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think yes
13:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the uuid never changed right
13:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i have fstab by uuid
13:38 < bridge> <Ewan> You‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm using the words company and business interchangeably. But that means nothing. Because Microsoft is a business and everyone in the conversation knows that their motives are different from the Linux Foundation‚Äôs
13:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> changes*
13:38 < bridge> <Learath2> Yes it's a part of the filesystem header
13:38 < bridge> <Learath2> As long as it's privately owned, sure
13:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> My claim only was that u don't need generating/ maximizing 
13:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> money as motivational source to create things
13:39 < bridge> <Ewan> Microsoft does
13:39 < bridge> <Ewan> It is a publicly traded company
13:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes and that can come with a risk
13:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> E.g. if they see open source as the enemy
13:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Rn it seems Microsoft changed their position at least partially
13:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oddly it started happening when i got 6.2
13:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe i should stick to 6.1 which is next lts now
13:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And that didn't mean this will always be the case
13:40 < bridge> <Ewan> They have already ‚Äúproprietated‚Äù open source as much as they ever will
13:40 < bridge> <Ewan> And nobody is really paying the price
13:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> them owning github is so so dangerous
13:41 < bridge> <Learath2> Oh did 6.2 get stabilized?
13:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> which is why i also self host
13:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> git
13:41 < bridge> <Ewan> What can they do to it that would damage open source without harming themselves tenfold?
13:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk gentoo has it
13:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> they can excert influence
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Anyway just to be clear I am on noones side in this discussion. The people working at Microsoft are good devs. I enjoy stuff like vs code. Tho this trend is rather new in Microsoft business history
13:42 < bridge> <Learath2> If you didn't unmask gentoo sources that means it is stabilized
13:42 < bridge> <Ewan> Agreed
13:42 < bridge> <Ewan> I don‚Äôt really know what you mean
13:43 < bridge> <Ewan> Encourage other businesses to do better? Cool
13:43 < bridge> <Ewan> Self hosted git services are better than ever
13:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wouldnt mine m$$ minding their business if their strategy wasnt to  entice devs to do win only stuff, like games
13:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> then i wouldnt care less
13:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wouldnt mind m$$ minding their business if their strategy wasnt to  entice devs to do win only stuff, like games
13:43 < bridge> <Learath2> @Ryozuki can you check your kernel cmdline?
13:43 < bridge> <Ewan> Sorry I really don‚Äôt know what you mean
13:44 < bridge> <Learath2> When you get back. Because rootfs is mounted by using that if you dont have an initramfs
13:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it had nothing, then i tried to add rootdelay=3 and nothing
13:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill check when im back
13:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lucky i have a boot usb
13:44 < bridge> <Learath2> Ok then idk how your computer even works 50% of the time
13:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it seems it doesnt now
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i tried 4 times before i had to go
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and all panics
13:45 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe obvious, have you tried a chroot system upgrade
13:45 < bridge> <Learath2> No initramfs = you have to have `root=UUID=<insertrootuuidhere>`
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> there is no upgrade here xd
13:45 < bridge> <Learath2> In the cmdline that is
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh rly
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
13:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill check when im back
13:46 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, maybe grub choked while generating the config and you missed it? Happens to me when I do system upgrades sometimes I miss errors
13:46 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs very easy for something to break upstream & you not notice until the upgrade completes
13:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i didnt see any error
13:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i have my own script that compiles the kernel, installs and then recompiles nvidia drivers
13:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and then grub
13:47 < bridge> <Ewan> you use nouveau?
13:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no
13:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hence why recompile
13:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> do u even use gentoo
13:48 < bridge> <Ewan> do u even lift bro
13:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sometimes
13:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u wouldnt ask that question if u used gentoo
13:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz nouveau is compiled with the kernel
13:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> <a:ThinkSmart:1039124602779090974>
13:51 < bridge> <Ewan> that‚Äôs not exclusive to gentoo
13:51 < bridge> <Ewan> you usually just blacklist the driver and use the nvidia binary
13:51 < bridge> <Ewan> no recompile needed
13:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
13:52 < bridge> <Learath2> He means nouveau is part of compiling the kernel, so it would be unnecessary to state recompile nvidia drivers as a separate step
13:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u just talking without knowinh
13:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i suggest u read the nvidia gentoo wiki
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> on why recompiling is needed due to abi changes in the glue between kernel and blob
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont got time for that
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ur loss
13:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i am not the one with a nonfunctioning gentoo install üòÉ
13:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lul
13:54 < bridge> <Ewan> jokes aside
13:54 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe
13:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i never did the gentoo
13:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats not a problem for me tho
13:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i enjoy the tinker
13:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and learning
13:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> unlike others
13:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i did until I didn‚Äôt
13:55 < bridge> <Ewan> and i was tired of bailing my system out
13:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ur just weaker
13:55 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
13:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
13:55 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe I value my time more
13:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> bullshit
13:55 < bridge> <Ewan> and i have a short attention span
13:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ur not elite enough
13:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im on mobile or i would link a vid
13:55 < bridge> <Ewan> if i spend time fixing system anything i was doing before is dropped
13:56 < bridge> <Ewan> the computer is a tool
13:56 < bridge> <Ewan> it should just work
13:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> weak mindset
13:56 < bridge> <Ewan> u on some other shit
13:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nah
13:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the computer is not just a tool
13:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> specially nowadays
13:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its a way of living
13:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's his best friend
13:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
13:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its learsth girlfriend
13:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I spent more time with my computer than any human probably xd except me
13:59 < bridge> <Ewan> i need the computer to work or I can‚Äôt get anything real done
13:59 < bridge> <Ewan> fixing the system is cool but unproductive

18:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can control the positions with these tiles
18:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> time checkpoints are they called
18:47 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> lulz, was it needed to switch from c-array to std::vector
18:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> std::array i'd say is the way to go
18:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yes u are right
18:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not needed since the size is const
18:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tho u could use constexpr newer c++ versions should see through it at compile time
18:49 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> i thought constexpr things are more c++20 than c++17
18:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> c++20 adapted them more in the standard library yes
18:49 < bridge> <marmare_314> I didn't want to include <.../menu_background.h> in editor.h. So I cannot know the size of the fixed array.
18:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in 1 month or so we switch to c++20 anyway
18:51 < bridge> <marmare_314> I know which tiles you mean, but I couldnt find anything in the code
18:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway, its not in a hot path anyway so it doesnt matter‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
18:51 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> but you could just pass &m_Positions and fill it with this data xd
18:51 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> you know size of the array anyway
18:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/5e2e1e25e3047fcdf42d97ab4ca37a46c1856975/src/game/client/components/menu_background.cpp#L285-L292
18:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as said time cp 1 = first entry in the enum
18:54 < bridge> <marmare_314> Oh that shouldn't have been that hard to find xd Should be easy to fix tho
18:55 < bridge> <marmare_314> yes youre right, that should work
19:20 < bridge> <marmare_314> Is there any easy way to know if they have changed or do i have to check every frame while proof is enabled?
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they change as soon as the tiles are placed
19:29 < bridge> <marmare_314> Yes but there is no indicator if the tiles have changed right?
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess no xd
19:31 < bridge> <marmare_314> Good thing i changed it back to an array, this should balance out xd
