06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> We see slowdowns down to ≤ 1.2x. A 1.2x slowdown means that if the suite takes 10 minutes to run by itself, it will take around 12 minutes to be recorded by rr.
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> 
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> it's worth a try.
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Wow bummer. Why not at least Mac?

08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> and fokkonaut\: rmdir
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Ryozuki)
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> nvm

11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> single-threaded code? These reverse debuggers usually run everything on a single core, so if you had 120 threads working in parallel, you'd at least get a 120x slowdown
12:03 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki it didnt even ping u did it? I deleted the email without looking closer at it. I get so many github emails from random projects. But after reading ur twitter thingy i noticed how funny it is :D 
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i get so many random emails from chillerdragon xd
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> haha tru
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> im also known github spammer
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar github is the only social media i have :D since i watch yt on my tv i lost the comments section
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki was a good marketing stunt tho his gh profile got some views https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1654423678.png
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this is also social media
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> tbh i all redit giggles of my life combined cant compet with me rofling over this https://github.com/EpicGames/Signup/pull/24
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> omg english
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u want to be fame, tag all github users and ask for follow in trade of follow
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> youtube 2006 style
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> ikr
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> f4f
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> best
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> guess how i got my github follows. I can spoil you its not because of my quality typo prs.
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 😕
12:57 <+ChillerDragon> omg now i get nsfw emails and im in public :D this epic fail is getting out of control
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I didn't get a notification
13:23 <+ChillerDragon> of the epic thing?
13:23 <+ChillerDragon> do you get any gh mails?
13:23 <+ChillerDragon> maybe its overloaded :D
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> takes time
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its overloaded

13:29 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1654428558.png
13:29 <+ChillerDragon> my life is cursed these days
13:30 <+ChillerDragon> love how the only printable string is ERROR
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's not utf8 i guess
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or are those ncurses chars?
13:30 <+ChillerDragon> yea i think i broke something on my laptop
13:31 <+ChillerDragon> should be normal server log ._.
13:31 <+ChillerDragon> but its ddnet++ dont worry ddnet is fine
13:31 <+ChillerDragon> its def a me issue. Just wanted to share my cursed sufferings
13:33 <+ChillerDragon> restarting helped :) maybe some junk from https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5340 cracked my terminal
13:33 <+ChillerDragon> time to merge w upstream. Thanks for the fast fix deen :)
13:34 <+ChillerDragon> ah wait its still unerged -.-
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <@unexploredtest:kde.org> lol
13:40 <+ChillerDragon> aaa it killed my irc client
13:40 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1654429182.png
13:41 <+ChillerDragon> my server returns with exit code 1 :( and i feel so low iq not figuring out why it does so. It never reaches the last return statement in server.cpp int main(). It has no asan issues. No crash backtrace. No log message saying like "map not found". It just savagily exits with code 01.
13:42 <+ChillerDragon> what are possible reasons a server exits with code 1?
13:43 <+ChillerDragon> can i somehow force gdb to show a backtrace? Like how it exited
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: You might have awkaned Zalgo
13:44 <+ChillerDragon> zal who?
13:44 <+ChillerDragon> sounds scary
13:44 <+ChillerDragon> also looks scary on duckduckgo images
13:45 <+ChillerDragon> > Zalgo is an Internet legend about an ominous entity believed to cause insanity, death and destruction of the world, similar to the creature Cthulhu created by H.P. Lovecraft in the 1920s. Zalgo is often associated with scrambled text on webpages and photos of people whose eyes and mouth have been covered in black.
13:46 <+ChillerDragon> yea that sounds reasonable
13:48 <+ChillerDragon> thank god im shell pro and know the `reset` command this is becoming annoying
14:08 <+ChillerDragon> Any chance that my secret exit code 1 is a division by zero? But shouldnt gdb tell me if it is a division by zero?
14:08 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/3c597aff959aa8bc9bf22c6c65e6e071209cf183/src/engine/server/databases/connection_pool.cpp#L117
14:09 <+ChillerDragon> first iteration i = 0 and then `i % 20` is a breaking stuff? right?
14:09 <+ChillerDragon> probably should be `if(i > 0 && i % 20 == 0)` instead of `if(i % 20 == 0 && i > 0)`
14:11 <+ChillerDragon> ah no the zero divison is the other way around i think
14:11 <+ChillerDragon> so `0 % 20` is legal but `20 % 0` isnt
14:11 <+ChillerDragon> meh keep diggin then
14:21 <+ChillerDragon> yo @Jupstar any chance `std::this_thread::sleep_for(100ms);` would ever exit the programm with code 1?
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> why not set an exit handler breakpoint with gdb?
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> instead of randomly guessing code
14:23 <+ChillerDragon> u mean `break exit`
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `catch syscall exit exit_group` I guess
14:23 <+ChillerDragon> ou
14:23 <+ChillerDragon> dafaq this looks fancy
14:24 <+ChillerDragon> lemme try
14:25 <+ChillerDragon> seems to be triggered for every thread tho
14:25 <+ChillerDragon> yea watever i can spam continue
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `break exit` then
14:26 <+ChillerDragon> yea but that backtrace was so useless
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, true
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so it's a normal exit at the end of main()
14:26 <+ChillerDragon> there is also break _exit
14:26 <+ChillerDragon> nah
14:26 <+ChillerDragon> i dont reach the end of int main
14:27 <+ChillerDragon> at least thats what my puts debugger says :D
14:27 <+ChillerDragon> the last line that is being run is `std::this_thread::sleep_for(100ms);` in `void CDbConnectionPool::OnShutdown()` as far as my puts statement tell me
14:28 <+ChillerDragon> i slowly feel like its an external kill
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> external kill is a signal
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so you can catch those and check
14:30 <+ChillerDragon> sounds smort
14:30 <+ChillerDragon> break signal? :D
14:31 <+ChillerDragon> `catch signal all`mb
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31627061
14:32 <+ChillerDragon> :D
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> github in general feels like such an innocent place
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> there are so few trols
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there are if u go deeper
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> but for example ddnet
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder what kind of weird software u can find here
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> there are no crazy prs and issues of ppl adding like nsfw stuff
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because most ppl dont have a github account
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and have no reaso nto have one
14:34 <+ChillerDragon> yea so its pretty trol free
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Why do all that effort to troll the 3 people who read PRs regularly? There are much easier ways to get more attention
14:34 <+ChillerDragon> hmm
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
14:34 <+ChillerDragon> because you would be the only one
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also usually dev is more behind the scenes on communities
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> non devs simply dont check github
14:35 <+ChillerDragon> but devs could trol too?
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur the trol
14:35 <+ChillerDragon> no proof
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with ur issue links on ur random tools
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:35 <+ChillerDragon> axaxaxax
14:35 <+ChillerDragon> imagine having no upstream merge deamon running
14:36 <+ChillerDragon> -9 is SIGKILL right?
14:36 <+ChillerDragon> dat one didnt trigger
14:36 <+ChillerDragon> meh
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://tech4gamers.com/ddr5-memory-prices/
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good time to buy ram i guess
14:37 <+ChillerDragon> but yea gdb would also show sigkill
14:37 <+ChillerDragon> nice time to restock my ram since i broke half of it
14:38 <+ChillerDragon> invest in ram today
14:38 <+ChillerDragon> but also do you ever run out of ram? because i dont i think
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont xd
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i have 32 gb
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 1 month to go for 4000 series
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i hope they add huge performance increase
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they go from 8nm to 5nm apparently
14:53 <+ChillerDragon> is the sql worker thread supposed to be running when the main thread finishes?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i am against it
14:54 <+ChillerDragon> im not sure if it is the case right now in ddnet but i think so
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> there was a discussion about threads running after main thread
14:54 <+ChillerDragon> a
14:54 <+ChillerDragon> wheere
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> imo u should clean what u create
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cleaning is also pretty fast compared to creating
14:55 <+ChillerDragon> im losing my mind here
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well i can only send u a discord link XD
14:55 <+ChillerDragon> im sure it is something really stupid
14:55 <+ChillerDragon> send irclogs link
14:55 <+ChillerDragon> is it in #developer?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
14:55 <+ChillerDragon> u can also gimme a search term
14:55 <+ChillerDragon> i got grep and irclogs
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> heinrich and learath and me were involved
14:56 <+ChillerDragon> usual suspects
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> "heinrich5991 — 23.04.2022
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ddnet does that, for example
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> other threads might be stuck
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I guess you have to call _Exit in that case
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah no, quick_exit
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah no, _Exit, nvm
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Jupstar — 23.04.2022
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what threads do we keep open
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Learath2 — 23.04.2022
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I don't quite see when else C++ would destruct the statics"
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> somewhere around there it started
14:56 <+ChillerDragon> ONE SEARCH TERM DONT DUMP THE FAKIN CONVO
14:56 <+ChillerDragon> bliet
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the discussion evolved
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it escalated
14:57 <+ChillerDragon> im gonna print all of it and read it in the bathtub
14:58 <+ChillerDragon> any chance a dangling thread could cause my non zero exit code?
14:58 <+ChillerDragon> whos exit code is even returned? the one from the last thread or the main thread?
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think ncurses use some other terminal codes, maybe they conflict somehow. 
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I would recommend you to start the server with a debugger in vs-code, much more simple then gdb with the best plugins.
15:00 <+ChillerDragon> ewww
15:00 <+ChillerDragon> vscode
15:00 <+ChillerDragon> but hey im desperate
15:00 <+ChillerDragon> ima try configure vscode to run shit
15:01 <+ChillerDragon> but also i cant really reproduce the issue outside of integration tests xd so i gotta launch vscode from there
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you can run it in gdb inside vs-vodium xD
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you can run it in gdb inside vs-codium xD
15:01 <+ChillerDragon> the editing lord
15:01 <+ChillerDragon> i got u the first time
15:01 <+ChillerDragon> i invented typos i can read it
15:03 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar here u go proper shareable link https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/irclogs/blob/f3f2afbaaa6bfd6a08f0cb41ca97503eec4906cc/ddnet/2022-04-23.log#L98
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> stalker git
15:03 <+ChillerDragon> ikr
15:04 <+ChillerDragon> i rly want microsoft to read my nice messages

15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i love chillerdragon
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its for eternity
15:04 <+ChillerDragon> they are probably feeding it into code pilot
15:05 <+ChillerDragon> yes in 40k years some alien race is going to the arctic valut and read all jupjapjasturs messages
15:06 <+ChillerDragon> also my lawyer suggested me to collect declaration of consent from all of you before publishing your chats
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean there is trends to make old picture more alive with all these KIs
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so maybe future aliens have fun reviving us based on our IRC logs
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nothing is impossible

15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> use fancy electron!

15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wow it messed up the order. I blame matrix. Its the worst.
15:31 <+ChillerDragon> omg this exit code 1 is driving me crazy
15:31 <+ChillerDragon> im gona rq debug that shit
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> whats so hard bout it
15:31 <+ChillerDragon> and play some ddnet in my ncurses client using the gpu boosted terminal emulator for extra fps
15:32 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1654435860.png
15:32 <+ChillerDragon> i just have no idea why the program quits
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice
15:32 <+ChillerDragon> and why it quits qith exit cide
15:32 <+ChillerDragon> so i rq
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> show backtrace
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> of all threads
15:33 <+ChillerDragon> there is none
15:33 <+ChillerDragon> ou
15:33 <+ChillerDragon> all
15:33 <+ChillerDragon> ok
15:33 <+ChillerDragon> but i thought other t6hreads cant influence
15:33 <+ChillerDragon> wat was it `bt all`right?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but it happens randomly?
15:34 <+ChillerDragon> uhm
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or when u exit the client?
15:34 <+ChillerDragon> define randomly
15:34 <+ChillerDragon> i cant reproduce
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but its at close?
15:34 <+ChillerDragon> but it happens 10/10 times in the integration tests
15:34 <+ChillerDragon> it happens on "shutdown" rcon command
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> set a breakpoint at the end of the main function and see whats still open
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah so its server side?
15:34 <+ChillerDragon> its kinda random if it reaches main
15:35 <+ChillerDragon> depending on what i comment out or where i put print statements it reaches different last spots
15:35 <+ChillerDragon> ye server
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ddnet?
15:35 <+ChillerDragon> ddnet++
15:35 <+ChillerDragon> pog
15:38 <+ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/YB
15:38 <+ChillerDragon> output of `thread apply all bt`
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sone> What client is this?
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> term-ux
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> chillerbot-ux compiled with -DCURSES_CLIENT=ON
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1654436490.png
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sone> oh xD already have that one. Ok checking it out
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> enjoy backdoor
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> hrhrhrhhr
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sone> what!?
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> xD
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> i think u need both -DHEADLESS_CLIENT=ON and -DCURSES_CLIENT
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> =ON *
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sone> backdoor in opensource software
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> well opensource does not make it backdoor free
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> just easier to find the backdoor
15:44 <+ChillerDragon> did you read the sourcecode?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sone> and then remove it. not yet but I'll diff it up
15:45 <+ChillerDragon> best clickbait tactic to get ppl to read ur code
15:45 <+ChillerDragon> say its virus
15:45 <+ChillerDragon> marketing dragon
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sone> xD
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sone> well I was gonna anyways bcs I am curious
15:46 <+ChillerDragon> fan
15:46 <+ChillerDragon> its rly bad code dont read it
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sone> 😮
15:46 <+ChillerDragon> i mean look at the scuffed screenshot its clearly bugged af
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sone> isn't that just your terminal because you didn't reopen it? I had a similar bug today with lf (list-files(filemanager)) where executing the DDNet client with somechanges broke UTF-8 in my terminal
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Na that’s as good as my curses client currently gets .\_.
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> I implemented the first prototpye of the material layer and some physics handling with a dummy material. Is anyone motivated for some very spontanious testing and feedback?
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I will test it later this evening and read your code...
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> hmm okay thank you ❤️ I noticed, that the show-entities overlay is not working yet. I already fixed the problem partially, but it loads the wrong image right now (the default entities) and I need to look deeper into it
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> I will tell you if it's finished
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sone> this is what I was talking about
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sone> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/983037493878329396/shot_20220605_184934w.png
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> @c0d3d3v fixed material layer not rendering with show entities, this was harder then expected
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Ah ye deen alr fixed that \:)
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@sone)
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you can't catch kill signal, it's the only one with stop to not be catchable
19:59 <+ChillerDragon> yea that makes sense
19:59 <+ChillerDragon> but its not sigkill if it were sigkill gdb would show it
20:33 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 when rebase https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2754
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, idk, I don't like it without a lot of storage changes to go with it and I haven't got time to do the storage changes
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ppl are more used to use the config dir now. Assets tab also helps. Maybe its not even needed anymore
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dunno any app that does this as a runtime check everytime
22:43 <+ChillerDragon> yea lets not collect stale prs
