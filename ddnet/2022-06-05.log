06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> We see slowdowns down to â‰¤ 1.2x. A 1.2x slowdown means that if the suite takes 10 minutes to run by itself, it will take around 12 minutes to be recorded by rr.
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> 
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> it's worth a try.

11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> single-threaded code? These reverse debuggers usually run everything on a single core, so if you had 120 threads working in parallel, you'd at least get a 120x slowdown
12:03 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki it didnt even ping u did it? I deleted the email without looking closer at it. I get so many github emails from random projects. But after reading ur twitter thingy i noticed how funny it is :D

13:29 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1654428558.png
13:29 <+ChillerDragon> my life is cursed these days
13:30 <+ChillerDragon> love how the only printable string is ERROR
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's not utf8 i guess
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or are those ncurses chars?
13:30 <+ChillerDragon> yea i think i broke something on my laptop
13:31 <+ChillerDragon> should be normal server log ._.
13:31 <+ChillerDragon> but its ddnet++ dont worry ddnet is fine
13:31 <+ChillerDragon> its def a me issue. Just wanted to share my cursed sufferings
13:33 <+ChillerDragon> restarting helped :) maybe some junk from https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5340 cracked my terminal
13:33 <+ChillerDragon> time to merge w upstream. Thanks for the fast fix deen :)
13:34 <+ChillerDragon> ah wait its still unerged -.-
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <@unexploredtest:kde.org> lol
13:40 <+ChillerDragon> aaa it killed my irc client
13:40 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1654429182.png
13:41 <+ChillerDragon> my server returns with exit code 1 :( and i feel so low iq not figuring out why it does so. It never reaches the last return statement in server.cpp int main(). It has no asan issues. No crash backtrace. No log message saying like "map not found". It just savagily exits with code 01.
13:42 <+ChillerDragon> what are possible reasons a server exits with code 1?
13:43 <+ChillerDragon> can i somehow force gdb to show a backtrace? Like how it exited
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: You might have awkaned Zalgo
13:44 <+ChillerDragon> zal who?
13:44 <+ChillerDragon> sounds scary
13:44 <+ChillerDragon> also looks scary on duckduckgo images
13:45 <+ChillerDragon> > Zalgo is an Internet legend about an ominous entity believed to cause insanity, death and destruction of the world, similar to the creature Cthulhu created by H.P. Lovecraft in the 1920s. Zalgo is often associated with scrambled text on webpages and photos of people whose eyes and mouth have been covered in black.
13:46 <+ChillerDragon> yea that sounds reasonable
13:48 <+ChillerDragon> thank god im shell pro and know the `reset` command this is becoming annoying
