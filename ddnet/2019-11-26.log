15:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rip RIPE
15:12 <+fstd> wasn't there one /8 for each reserved by IANA still?
15:12 <+fstd> or have they already eaten through theirs?
15:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its time to buy some ipv4s its good investment o.O
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now let us watch as they scramble to reassign some, then watch as ISPs put more and more people behind more and more NATs until the internet becomes unrecognisable
15:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> isn't there ipv6
15:42 <+fstd> at my workplace i have a /17 but less than half of it is used
15:42 <+fstd> should consider selling some for profit and profit
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's probably cheaper for corporate to buy more NAT hardware then to invest in migrating to ipv6
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And everyone knows that corporations care about nothing buy money
21:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Kaisi> some older hardware and software doesn't work with ipv6, consider that pls
21:47 <+fstd> that might have been an argument 20 years ago
21:47 <+fstd> for physical thingies that actually implement ipv4 in hardware
21:48 <+fstd> fuck those, if you ask me, and fuck devices that do it in their firmware but have no mechanism to update the firmware
21:49 <+fstd> come to think about it, a router from 20 years ago will probably not be able to keep up with todays throughput anyway
22:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ipv4 gives more money else it would have died 15 years ago xd
22:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> Ipv8 is out since 1month
22:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> Enjoy it
23:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ it's not something that's intrinsic to ipv4 that is more profitable. It's just the advantage of being the status quo and it's limitations being relatively easy to work around with NAT
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ipv6 adoption has been long seen as a chicken and egg problem
