12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Well I guess we don't need to see the releases hereüòÆ
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I just updated the client and the game ran at 4 fps, it was fixed by downgrading the client again, but I thought I'd let you Devs know anyway
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mhhh
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> from what version to which version?
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> Was 10.8.6 pressed update in the client and it updated to the newest version
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try turning opengl3 on or off, depending on what it was before
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> one minute, need to install 11.0.3 again
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> With opengl on the game doesn't run at all
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I have to set gfx_opengl3 to 0 in settings_ddnet to get it to run again
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If you want to see releases, go on discord, or use a news reader: https://ddnet.tw/releases/feed/
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can even use some tool to convert feeds to emails if that's more convenient:
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Or fix the nimda plugin üòâ
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Nah we don't need that fix i gues
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://i.redd.it/b8p0ikpwpdh01.png
19:31 <@deen> saw that too
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> lol
19:32 <@deen> I mean you can take that as the opportunity to figure out how to fight back against different kinds of attacks and then apply to some anti-ddos company. but that doesn't really help us^^
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for the german-speaking community: http://www.stupidedia.org/stupi/DDNet
19:34 <@deen> stupidedia is shutting down btw
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, didn't know
19:35 <@deen> DoNe wrote the article 3 years ago
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it says that they're changing their software and concept
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but still remain up
19:37 <@deen> scroll down
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, thanks
19:38 <@deen> So DDNet is disappearing from all wikis, first DDNet wiki, now stupidedia
19:40 <@deen> My non-programming related post is doing ok on HN, I'm surprised
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> even though you forgot to call your voting ring. ts ts
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deen: my ddnet 11.0.3 client tells me "DDNet 10.8.6 is out! Update now"
19:41 <@deen> heinrich5991: wrong update server
19:41 <@deen> weird
19:42 <@deen> Actually my post was getting pushed down on HN thanks to anti-flamewar detection (more comments than votes), but a mod pushed it back up
19:44 <@deen> -anti
19:46 <@heinrich5991> deen: heh. I also cycle to uni every day :)
19:46 <@deen> I used to do it once a week, but it was ~45 km each way, so a bit exhausting
19:47 <@heinrich5991> yea, it's more like 15-20min for me
19:47 <@heinrich5991> public transport is also 15min, but only once every 20min
19:47 <@heinrich5991> I end up getting to uni faster than if I played the waiting time lottery
19:48 <@deen> heh
19:50 <@heinrich5991> okay, but your cycle path looks way nicer :D
19:51 <@heinrich5991> I'm cycling through streets
19:51 <@deen> also, umap is pretty easy to use, never made a custom map before
20:22 <@heinrich5991> TIL going through red lights as a pedestrian isn't forbidden in germany, if the situation permits it
20:24 <@deen> haha, good to know but I did that anyway
21:25 <+fstd> heinrich5991: source?
21:25 <+fstd> https://www.bussgeldkatalog.org/fussgaenger/ says it can cost you (gasp) 5 euromonies
21:25 <+fstd> that said, who cares about red lights ;)
21:26 <+fstd> ("if the situation permits it" sounds awfully vague, too)
21:27 <@heinrich5991> mhh
21:27 <@heinrich5991> empty street for example
21:27 <@heinrich5991> https://dejure.org/gesetze/StVO/25.html
21:27 <@heinrich5991> enn die Verkehrsdichte, Fahrgeschwindigkeit, Sichtverh√§ltnisse oder der Verkehrsablauf es erfordern, ist eine Fahrbahn nur an Kreuzungen oder Einm√ºndungen, an Lichtzeichenanlagen innerhalb von Markierungen, an Fu√üg√§ngerquerungshilfen oder auf Fu√üg√§nger√ºberwegen (Zeichen 293) zu √ºberschreiten
21:28 <@heinrich5991> mh..
21:28 <@heinrich5991> it sounded differently when I first read it
21:30 <+Learath2> well if the street is empty, there is no policeperson to fine you :P
21:31 <+fstd> the police have proxies called 'red light cameras' tho :s
21:32 <+fstd> (for cars anyway)
21:32 <+Learath2> doubt they watch them for pedestrians crossing
21:32 <@deen> That reminds me, I remember Lady Saavik always being pissed at having had to pay two fines for jaywalking in Poland :D
21:33 <+fstd> Learath2: pedestrians can't trigger them to begin with
21:33 <+fstd> (but it prevents me, sometimes, from ignoring a red light with my car when it'd obviously be safe)
21:34 <+fstd> like, when literally nobody is around, like at night
21:34 <+Learath2> in turkey they flash all lights yellow after 2am, means cross at your own discretion
21:35 <+fstd> in germany they do that with some lights, but it doesn't mean "cross at your own discretion", that would be totally un-german
21:35 <+fstd> instead it makes the next lower level set of rules take effect (which the traffic lights normally override)
21:36 <@heinrich5991> :D @ that would be totally un-german
21:36 <+Learath2> the phrase "lower level set of rules" would short circuit an average turkishpersons brain, so they just say "cross at your own discretion, don't be a cunt, don't kill anyone"
21:37 <+fstd> actually i'm wrong though, what i said refers to traffic lights that are completely off
21:37 <@heinrich5991> traffic lights are completely off in the direction that has right of way
21:37 <@heinrich5991> in the other direction they're blinking yellow
21:37 <+fstd> yellow blinking means they're kinda sorta off, but the road that sees the blinking (only 2 out of 4 lights will blink) has to yield
21:38 <+Learath2> I think if you look at the actual laws tho, flashing yellow is just becareful
21:38 <+fstd> yep that
21:38 <@heinrich5991> but on pedestrian crossings they still blink yellow at night
21:38 <@heinrich5991> even though cars have right of way AFAIK
21:38 <@heinrich5991> like traffic lights for cars that are solely for a pedestrian crossing, not some T-intersection or intersection
21:39 <@heinrich5991> rm command still runnnign
21:39 <@heinrich5991> but it still hasn't hit me what is wrong with it
21:39 <@heinrich5991> still running
21:40 <@heinrich5991> waah
21:40 <@heinrich5991> ah done
21:40 <@heinrich5991> mh.. nothing looks off
21:42 <+fstd> this is why i like ^T
21:42 <+fstd> aka SIGINFO
21:44 <@heinrich5991> you know what distinguishes SIGINFO from SIGUSR1? :)
21:44 <+fstd> yes
21:45 <+Learath2> I don't
21:45 <@heinrich5991> SIGUSR1 terminates the program if it doesn't handle the signal
21:45 <@heinrich5991> SIGINFO doesn't
21:45 <+Learath2> TIL
21:45 <@heinrich5991> but that's about the only difference
21:45 <+fstd> lol
21:46 <@heinrich5991> it's responsible for not being able to reliably be able to send SIGUSR1 to programs
21:46 <+fstd> process groups*
21:46 <+fstd> and that's a *huge* difference
21:46 <+fstd> another big difference is that SIGINFO's purpose is clear, while SIGUSR1 in no way means "dump info to stderr"
21:47 <@heinrich5991> yes, but that could be mitigated
21:47 <@heinrich5991> i.e. define SIGINFO=SIGUSR1
21:47 <+fstd> by adapting a lot of programs in case they have a spare signal to use
21:47 <+fstd> not really feasible
21:47 <+fstd> i mean it would work for dd, i guess
21:47 <+Learath2> not really a good idea imho, programs could be using both currently
21:48 <+fstd> fetchmail however would try and pull mail then
21:48 <+fstd> init/systemd would do god knows what
21:48 <+fstd> programs that use SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are in trouble generally
21:48 <+fstd> yeah and what Learath2 said too
21:48 <+Learath2> systemd would prolly handle it just fine, it'll upload the signal and the current state to the cloud and the neural network will figure out what you want
21:49 <+fstd> ^^

21:50 <@heinrich5991> heh
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ? xd
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> english plz
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes pls :(
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some people actually read those convos ^^
22:11 <+fstd> sorry, this is now a german kanal.
22:12 <+Learath2> if you'd actually read it you'd come to the conclusion that the last german line was something along the lines of "jaywalking = 5e"
22:12 <+Learath2> :P
22:12 <+Ryozuki> also it looks like the √∂ is parsed wrong by the irc-link
22:12 <+Ryozuki> or idk what it is
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> "die Artikelproduktion und -Qualit√§t der letzten Monate sagt eigentlich alles" from Stupidedia's last message, now i feel guilty xD
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "the article production and quality of the last months actually says it all "
22:30 <@heinrich5991> Autobahn betreten oder √ºberschritten    10 ‚Ç¨
22:32 <@heinrich5991> Sollte er sich im Rahmen der Stra√üenverkehrsordnung f√ºr Fu√üg√§nger f√ºr die Fahrbahn entscheiden, darf er nur am rechten Fahrbahnrand gehen. Beim Abbiegen nach links ist zu beachten, dass sich der Fu√üverkehr nicht links einordnen darf.
22:37 <+fstd> not sure if i ever mentioned it, but i rode a bicycle, drunk, at night, without lights, on the autobahn once... it's only ~5 km and hell of a shortcut compared with the regular route and that stretch tends to be super empty at night, so it seemed like a good idea
22:37 <+fstd> anyway it wasn't empty enough, someone did call the cops on me and i only barely and with luck managed to escape
22:38 <+fstd> wonder what *that* would have cost me...

22:43 <+fstd> WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK
22:44 <+fstd> fucking lunix
22:44 <+fstd> the real offender here was firefox
22:44 <+fstd> but YES why not just kill factorio instead
22:47 <@heinrich5991> factorio has autosave, hopefully it wasn't so far back
22:47 <+fstd> yes, it'll be fine
22:48 <+fstd> doesn't make it any better though
22:49 <+fstd> i mean i'd be fine if it terminated on its own behalf, or even segfaulted
22:49 <+fstd> but preemtively killing the wrong process?
22:49 <+fstd> i mean factorio was literally idle for the last 30 minutes, and i was just zooming into google maps (checking into whether my 5km estimate was accurate)
22:49 <+fstd> when everything froze for like a minute
22:50 <+fstd> and then factorio gets rekt instead of firefox...
