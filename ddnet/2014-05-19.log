03:01 <@deen> oh, and quite expectedly still noone likes IRC^^
13:19 < shorefire> Hello
13:19 <@deen> hi
13:20 <@deen> VPS working finally?
13:20 < shorefire> Nope, I gota change vps
13:20 < shorefire> they just got back to me
13:20 < shorefire> asking for my bloody birth certificate
13:20 <@deen> what?
13:21 <@deen> wtf?
13:21 < shorefire> Exactly
13:21 < shorefire> I'm not sending them that
13:21 <@deen> Did they give a reason?
13:21 < shorefire> Apparently they've got people trying to use their vps's for illegal reasons
13:21 <@deen> "apparently"
13:21 <@deen> haha
13:21 < shorefire> so they're asking people for birth certificates, passports, etc
13:21 <@deen> Yeah, I understand them
13:22 <@deen> They have the cheapest VPS worldwide i guess
13:22 < shorefire> True
13:22 <@deen> and unlimited traffic
13:22 < shorefire> I just need to search for another one now :/
13:22 <@deen> of course it's used for illegal stuff
13:22 <@deen> Hm, I'm happy at http://datafabrik.de/ but i guess they're too expensive
13:22 <@deen> 20 â‚¬ / month
13:23 < shorefire> Heh yeah, too much for me
13:24 < shorefire> They tried to get me to send a bank statement/utility bill along with my proof of ID, lol
13:57 < shorefire> https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/
13:57 < shorefire> How's the $5 package look?  Think that would be enough for a few teeworld's servers?
14:00 < shorefire> Holy crap, the Russian servers run on only 242mb
14:07 < shorefire> Whelp,  DigitalOcean it is
14:07 < shorefire> I'll upgrade to 1gb ram if I need to
14:12 <@deen> Teeworlds needs no memory
14:13 <@deen> DDRace needs a lot more, but still not much
14:13 < shorefire> Ah, yeah I noticed the USA servers hardly ever go above 512 ram anyway
14:13 < shorefire> Setting up my account with digitalOcean now
14:14 < shorefire> They look pretty nice
14:14 <@deen> on ddnet servers what takes most memory is the global database
14:14 < shorefire> Ah, ok
14:14 < shorefire> This vps will be in amsterdam
14:14 < shorefire> So not far away from the last one I was going to get really
14:15 <@deen> yeah, i just saw
14:15 < shorefire> What are you running on, Debian 7.0?
14:15 <@deen> most servers are debian 7
14:15 <@deen> i think 1 is debian 6 and one centos
14:16 < shorefire> Ah, ok
14:17 < shorefire> Up and running in 60 seconds, that was pretty great
14:17 < shorefire> damn lol
14:29 <@deen> nice
14:34 < shorefire> What are the depends for the server?
14:34 < shorefire> (Not building it)
14:34 <@deen> g++ and boost?
14:34 <@deen> ddnet server?
14:34 < shorefire> "GLIBC_2.14" not found
14:34 <@deen> while building?
14:35 < shorefire> No, running the pre-built
14:35 <@deen> give me more context
14:35 < shorefire> Running the pre-build ddnet server
14:35 <@deen> aaaah, the prebuilt one is compiled on ubuntu
14:35 < shorefire> Ah, do I need to compile myself?
14:35 <@deen> i didn't think so
14:35 < shorefire> Maybe I'm just missing something
14:35 <@deen> apt-get install libc6
14:36 <@deen> But yeah, you could also recompile
14:36 < shorefire> Already at the newest version
14:36 <@deen> I always compile on all servers
14:36 <@deen> you have debian 7?
14:37 < shorefire> Yes
14:37 < shorefire> oh
14:37 < shorefire> no not here
14:37 < shorefire> On my vps, yeah
14:37 <@deen> but you're running it on your vps
14:37 <@deen> Maybr you got the 32bit version, but your system is 64bit?
14:37 <@deen> Oh no, actually i get the same error on debian 7
14:37 <@deen> oops
14:37 < shorefire> Heh
14:38 <@deen> that's weird
14:39 <@deen> i have an old version of ubuntu, why does it have newer libraries than debian 7?
14:42 < shorefire> Know of any way to fix this other than re-building?
14:42 <@deen> no
14:42 <@deen> updating glibc would break your system
14:42 <@deen> Why don't you want to rebuild?
14:42 <@deen> Takes a few minutes
14:42 < shorefire> Alright, I'm just terrible at it, always forget how
14:43 < shorefire> Hopefully it doesn't take too long on my vps
14:44 <@deen> Nah
14:44 < shorefire> What files was it I didn't need again?
14:44 < shorefire>  /other/mysql?
14:45 <@deen> if you don't want mysql, yes
14:45 < shorefire> Alright
14:45 < shorefire> I don't need it
14:48 < shorefire> I just need to run bam server_release, right?
14:49 <@deen> yes
14:50 < shorefire> Alright,  I need to go do some stuff so I'll be afk for a bit.  Cheers
15:19 < shorefire> You wheren't kidding lol, with about 4-5 people on the server only 4% mem is being used
15:19 < shorefire> and about 1% cpu
16:32 <@deen> mem used mainly depends on the map you run
16:33 <@deen> and once you have had 64 players mem stays up a bit higher, but then doesn't increase any more i think
16:33 <@deen> (64 players at same time)
16:35 < shorefire> Ah, ok
16:35 < shorefire> I put my server up to test
16:35 < shorefire> now there's like 11 people on it
16:42 <@deen> Votes should be included in the maps download now
16:42 <@deen> votes.cfg in each directory
16:43 < shorefire> Brilliant, thanks
16:44 < shorefire> Do I just have to have a votes.cfg file?
16:44 < shorefire> I thought votes could only go in autoexec
16:44 <@deen> in your autoexec.cfg you can write
16:44 <@deen> exec novice/votes.cfg
16:45 <@deen> then you have a novice server
16:45 < shorefire> Ah, thanks
16:45 < shorefire> I'll probably have all of the maps in the same server
16:45 <@deen> That will be a problem
16:45 < shorefire> Why?
16:45 <@deen> You need votes to change the server type
16:45 <@deen> when you have too many votes people get kicked^^
16:45 < shorefire> Ah
16:45 <@deen> There was a quite low limit in vanilla teeworlds
16:46 <@deen> i removed it and can get higher vote counts, but only with dirty tricks
16:46 <@deen> i send the votes in parts in 500 ms intervals
16:46 < shorefire> heh
16:46 <@deen> so they slowly build up
16:46 <@deen> but that works with scripts, not in teeworlds
16:46 < shorefire> So is it possible to change votes on the go like you do without anything complicated?
16:46 <@deen> clear_votes clears them
16:46 <@deen> so if you want a vote for brutal server
16:47 <@deen> add_vote "Brutal Server" clear_votes; exec brutal/votes.cfg
16:47 < shorefire> Exactly what I wanted, thanks
16:47 < shorefire> Just locked the server so noone else can join, once everyone leaves I'll shutdown and do that
16:48 < shorefire> Also need to do the motd and other things
16:48 <@deen> no need to shut down
16:48 < shorefire> oh
16:48 < shorefire> the reload command
16:48 < shorefire> does that reload all configs?
16:48 <@deen> no, it reloads the map
16:48 < shorefire> oh
16:48 <@deen> but you can have your settings in a config and exec that
16:48 < shorefire> Ah, ok
17:20 < shorefire> add_vote "Brutal Server" clear_votes; exec data/maps/brutal/votes.cfg
17:20 < shorefire> doesn't appear to work
17:20 < shorefire> It clear's the votes and then nothing
17:26 <@deen> Ah
17:27 <@deen> I know why^^
17:27 <@deen> You need some more ""
17:27 <@deen> add_vote "Brutal Server" "clear_vote; exec votes.cfg"
17:29 < shorefire> Ah ok, cheers :p
17:29 < shorefire> It's alright if I add "Gamemode: ddnet.tw" in my motd right?
17:29 <@deen> sure
17:30 < shorefire> I've got a "No action for 100 seconds" come up twice now
17:30 <@deen> What do you mean?
17:30 < shorefire> I was just standing around, only entering commands
17:30 < shorefire> timeout
17:30 <@deen> ???
17:31 < shorefire> Because I was like...not moving for 100 seconds?
17:31 < shorefire> weird
17:31 < shorefire> Is there some kind of server setting that kicks people out when idle for too long?
17:31 <@deen> sv_max_afk_time 0
17:31 < shorefire> It's already that
17:32 < shorefire> [14-05-19 15:30:09][server]: client dropped. cid=0 addr=86.182.138.211:40560 reason='Too weak connection (not acked for 100 seconds)'
17:32 <@deen> Ah
17:32 <@deen> That's something else
17:32 < shorefire> is it my vps?
17:33 < shorefire> Because performance and everything is fine
17:33 < shorefire> I don't even get a connection problem, just happens
17:33 <@deen> Hm
17:33 <@deen> you can try if you have the same problem on ddnet test server
17:34 <@deen> if you stay in f2
17:34 < shorefire> Alright
17:34 < shorefire> I'll try that
17:38 < shorefire> Doesn't seem to be happening
17:39 <@deen> then i don't know
17:39 < shorefire> shit
17:39 < shorefire> Hopefully it's only because I'm standing around idle
17:40 < shorefire> Is it possible to add a empty space or a "------" into the mapvotes?
17:43 <@deen> yes
17:44 <@deen> but the vote has to be different every time
17:44 <@deen> so you have to add variable amouns of spaces^^
17:44 < shorefire> Ah
17:45 < shorefire> dammit
17:45 < shorefire> I keep getting "failed to load map"
17:45 < shorefire> even after moving them into data/maps
17:46 <@deen> huh?
17:46 <@deen> can you change_map?
17:46 < shorefire> apparently not
17:48 < shorefire> Ok I can do it
17:48 < shorefire> but only from f2
17:48 <@deen> makes no sense
17:48 < shorefire> using the added votes from votes.cfg
17:48 <@deen> commands are executed in the same way
17:48 < shorefire> It just fails to load maps
17:48 < shorefire> uh
17:48 <@deen> Oh, maybe because i added the .map^^
17:48 < shorefire> I know why
17:48 < shorefire> yeah
17:48 < shorefire> xD
17:48 <@deen> oops
17:49 <@deen> fixed
17:50 <@deen> sometimes i really should test stuff before releasing
17:50 < shorefire> Haha
17:50 < shorefire> Cheers
17:50 <@deen> afk
17:51 < shorefire> Alright
18:07 < shorefire> Oh I managed to add a vote like "-----"
18:07 < shorefire> just did add_vote "------" broadcast " "
18:11 < shorefire> Also with the votes.cfg, people need to move all the maps into data/maps
18:11 < shorefire> or change each vote to change_map "maps/novice/whatever"
18:47 <@deen> hm
19:20 < shorefire> 20 players and cpu/ram usage have hardly changed 
19:20 < shorefire> Awesome
