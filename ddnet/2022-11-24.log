00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> What kind of localization options?
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Infclass mod has "2 248 words to translate" with full and partial translation for many languages.
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Right now the lang selection works like this: the server uses GeoIP to guess the country and the lang. Then it starts a fake "vote" for the probable language. F3 to use it, F4 to keep the default lang (En). There is also `/lang <>` chat command as the only way to change the lang after the initial vote.
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> The "lang vote" obviously conflicts with normal votes, and in some cases it is hard to suggest the language based on country. It is also a bit annoying to have the vote on connect.
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> It would be nice to set the preferred language once in the client settings. It is not "the most wanted feature" but it is an easy way to improve the UX.
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Nice to hear that. I'll open an issue to discuss this (later on).

01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I fixed libtw2 with the new teehistorian format btw: https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/commit/86120969fe2bcc091f6160f93c1c5af91a163801
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 where do I get a realistic sample of TW traffic? by playing by myself and recording?
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or just capturing on any of our servers?
02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wanted to look at the compression ratio of zstd vs our huffman stuff
02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah yea, capturing on servers sounds like a good idea
03:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> noby i found an old dell dimension from 2003 in my attic. I want to turn it into a server but i remember you telling me that I shouldn't host from my ip. Is there a way around this?
03:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> btw saying point and click is dumb. Freezing takes way more skill than throwing in spikes.
03:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> you are more vulnerable when killing i guess
03:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> both take skill
03:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> shooting maybe more
03:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> yeah but saying something is just point and click is dumb
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i wouldnt even reward shooting in fng
03:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> tbh most cases people just take the kill back behind their teammates putting themselves at no risk. The person taking the engagement in the first place took more risk. The purple spike is risky but not hard to do.
03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Aim is a general skill, movement and throwing are more game specific
03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> there is more to freezing than just aim
03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> there is also clicking
03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> you have to have good combat movement and positioning.
03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> know about angle isolation
03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> use hook for mixups
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> same with dj
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> good crosshair placements
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> and reading them
03:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> :greenthing: yeah but rare people play like that, mostly just aim and shoot
03:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> cause 99% of people are absolutely terrible
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Yeah but most gamemodes make things for 99%, not 1%, i bet a lot of people will cry about getting assist instead of kill, also i met noobies with great aim and 0 knowledge, they freeze half of the server and can do nothing after that
03:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> person who throws in spike should still get the kill 100%
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> probably also kicked if they do it too much
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> just split the score between the shooter and killer
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 🤓 🤓 🤓 🤓
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i agree tho most the times when someone assists with a sac it's after a teamfight and either team is full freezed
03:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and sometimes in the middle of the fight, but tbh its not that hard and doenst put urself in as much more risk as if you didnt sac

09:38 <+ChillerDragon> hm can not reproduce it compiles just fine

09:39 <+ChillerDragon> idk what happens on your system
09:39 <+ChillerDragon> maybe bam5 generated bad stuff
09:39 <+ChillerDragon> try ``bam -c all``
09:39 <+ChillerDragon> and ``rm config.lua``
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <- Mahdiyar> ok
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> is that a server side only mod? Maybe the client is not really maintained this builds fine for me ``bam server_release``

10:16 <+ChillerDragon> still setfenv? :(
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> @- Mahdiyar did it work?
12:53 <+Ryozuki> @Learath2 im convinced about bunny cdn
12:53 <+Ryozuki> ill try it someday
12:53 <+Ryozuki> the api looks ez
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only used it for a small demo but yes it's simplicity is what made me use it aswell
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Simple api. Caching on the edge. Easy to link to their cloud storage if you prefer they host it
12:59 <+Ryozuki> the thing i dislike about hetzner tho is the limited 20tb traffic
12:59 <+Ryozuki> my app would need to get the file temporarely from the user and upload it to bunny
12:59 <+Ryozuki> unless i figure a way to upload to the cdn directly from the user
13:01 <+Ryozuki> now that i look at it
13:01 <+Ryozuki> some dedicated servers look much cheaper on ovh
13:01 <+Ryozuki> than on hetzner
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1045309265830756422/image.png
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Maybe with this i dont need a cdn
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2.4tb ssd lol
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Depends on why you wanted the cdn in the first place. If you don't care about reducing user latency around the world, it probably is more sensible to just get a server
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ye
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Just wanted space tbh
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you don't even need an ssd, no? I get like 6TB for that price on hetzner
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah there is a 2x8 tb on ovh
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> For same
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> keep in mind that ovh support sucks as hell though
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Unless you are rei, ovh support seems to love rei for whatever reason
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> he french
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes when you spam them for 4 months
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> also when you insult them because one tech plugs an USB mouse on ur dedicated server & shuts it down, realizing after that it was the wrong machine
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> Lmao
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Why is murpi = (1)mur pi in-game?
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Why is murpi + another murpi with one whitespace anywhere between any character = (1)murpi in-game?
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Well if u know another good host with unlimited tradfic
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hetzner limit is a no no
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> With tbs of storage
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 30€~
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Why is murpi + another murpi with one whitespace anywhere between any character = (1)murpi in-game?
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> EDIT: ah, to combat faking other players. Nevermind ^^
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hetzner has a limit?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 20tb traffic monthly
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you sure? I'm fairly certain you get unlimited traffic with any server
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, maybe it's different for their cloud servers
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 ah cloud has limit
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But root servers not
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I mean 20tb is unlikely to hit
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But idk
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, they have very subpar peering but they do let you just use as much of it as you want 😄
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> With the server auction maybe u can get some good deals
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's where I got mine. Some excellent deals there before they upped all server prices due to germany being dependent on russian ga
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's all Gerhard Schroders fault, corrupt russian puppet smh
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do I capture 1 GiB of traffic using tcpdump?
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (and why does `tcpdump udp -C 1000 -nw (date --iso-8601=second).pcap` give me `tcpdump: 2022-11-24T14:51:08+01:00.pcap: Permission denied`, but `tcpdump udp -nw (date --iso-8601=second).pcap` is fine?)
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe try an strace?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good idea
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dunno why I have to ask you for that :<
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I usually tcpdump as root so I never see permission stuff ever 😄
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well there was a chance that someone here just knows a reason for it off the top of their head, so asking first doesn't hurt
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this was as root
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but apparently it drops permissions with `-C`
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with `-C`, it opens the files only after dropping permissions
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which doesn't work because I'm trying to write to /root
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks @Learath2
15:09 <+ChillerDragon> 3en just told me he got banned for 24h on multi map for "bad client" while using chillerbot-ux can i talk to the person who banned him?
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> :Celebrate:
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: that would be @noby
15:13 <+ChillerDragon> thanks
15:13 <+ChillerDragon> @noby u here? do you remember what happend? o.O
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> because it's not -C
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> just use -c it's better and you can capture x amount of frames
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> just use -c it's better and you can capture x amount of packets
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ah u want 1GiB specially
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why is there no en_EU locale I wonder
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> en_EU?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> european union?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how would it be different?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i believe it differs between Ireland and Malta
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would use european defaults like euro as currency, 24h time, dates in DD/MM/YYYY, decimal comma
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but have english as language
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The closest thing is `en_IE@euro` for now
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or hand-tuning the LC_ variables
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even hand tuning the LC_ variables isn't great. `learath2@l2gentoo ~ $ LC_TIME="it_IT.utf8" date => gio 24 nov 2022, 17:47:17, CET`
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't want italian names for my days
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I want this so much
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm using en_IE for now
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I use en_gb on discord xd
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Whats IE
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ireland
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ah
