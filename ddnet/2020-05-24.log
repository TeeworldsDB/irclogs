02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> When I build with msbuild I am getting following:
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> "InitializeBuildStatus:
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay>   Creating "x64\Debug\ZERO_CHECK\ZERO_CHECK.tlog\unsuccessfulbuild" because "AlwaysCreate" was specified.
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> CustomBuild:
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay>   All outputs are up-to-date.
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> FinalizeBuildStatus:
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay>   Deleting file "x64\Debug\ZERO_CHECK\ZERO_CHECK.tlog\unsuccessfulbuild".
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay>   Touching "x64\Debug\ZERO_CHECK\ZERO_CHECK.tlog\ZERO_CHECK.lastbuildstate"
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> The same is for every project. Everything is up to date but this thing seem the only one reason why it takes a few seconds every time before game going to start (in case nothing changed since last build)
02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Does anybody knows is anything I can do about it here?
02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Does anybody knows if anything I can do about it here?

05:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> Why old sql doesnt work with Version 13? i updated my server but when someone finish a map it said failed
05:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> Why old sql doesnt work with Version 13? i updated my server but when someone finish a map it said failed ( its ok with 12 )
05:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> should remove mute and just ratelimit chat messages
05:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> mute for 60 sec much more annoying than ratelimit for a few secons

08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @BannZay google leads me here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27175754/what-are-all-build-and-zero-check-and-do-i-need-them
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @deen its not project specific problem. The same happens for most (if not each) project in the solution. I dont know, might be its "by design", but I doubt so
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @BannZay the stackoverflow link says you could try `set(CMAKE_SUPPRESS_REGENERATION true)`
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety < again someone saying that 70% of critical production bugs are memory safety bugs
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 why "again"?
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> firefox ftw
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @heinrich5991 how could it help me?
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BetterDarkness> Do u know what color code tw use?
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BetterDarkness> I mean what is BodyColor = 9417075
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki microsoft has said it before
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Does anyone have this logo in bigger resolution?
