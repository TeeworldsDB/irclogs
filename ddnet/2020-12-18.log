02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> mad lads
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> anyone have a definitive answer to this?
05:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789343397378785280/2020-12-18_11-58-35.mp4
05:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> üëÄ the new CLineInput is so good
06:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789361014998564894/2020-12-18_13-14-22.mp4
06:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> colemak üëÄ
06:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> exposed
06:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Does anybody understand how teehistorian INTs are saved?
06:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> There is a wierd things going on and I'm still not able to read the data. Only header works well, then goes TickSkip, which is read correctly for me and then it's just random bytes
06:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @louis try this
06:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789365980698247188/hook_attach-01-fixed.wv
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if that works, try `ffmpeg -i your_input.whatever -ar 48000 -ac 1 -sample_fmt s16p hook_attach-01-fixed.wv` to convert from any audio format
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è what have you tried? there's source code to decode ints in ddnet, in the teehistorian lib or there's docs here: https://wiki.ddnet.tw/encodings/int/
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you now also "waste" a day not using the library? I guess the library would have done that for you
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I've tried to copy unpack method from source code
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> it seems to work but return weird values sometime
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not every value in the teehistorian is encoded as a tw int
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> does it really work with `bits` instead of `bytes`
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> oh cmoooooon...
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://wiki.ddnet.tw/encodings/teehistorian/
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> thanks
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye it works heinrich
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ill test the command out later tho
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789388353979285504/whenyoucodeforadeadclient.mp4
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie do you have an estimate how easy it would be to port this to ddnet?
08:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the ime part is easy
08:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which OS btw?
08:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> both windows and mac are tested (by me)
08:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the textselection (made by robyt3) might be tricky
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the new CLineInput with text selection depends on the new CTextRender. so to just "port" it, we might need to nuke the current text.cpp.
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is the new CTextRender also better than ours?
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i actually don't know. probably not since it doesn't use hashmap but that's easily solvable i guess.
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we use a hashmap for caching?
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> feature wise it is probably better
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think so.
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think we should ask @Jupstar ‚ú™ whether he can port some of the methods of CTextRender because I actually have no idea how ddnet's text.cpp works.
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> mainly a way to count glyphs quads and return a coordinate. `TextWidth()` might run into problems with multi-line and stuff.
08:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we dont cache anything
08:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we use text containers
08:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we buffer basically
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> üëÄ i mean the glyph finding part
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> a, well its a map
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> with the character as key
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so not really a hash
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> std::map? that's a rbtree IIRC
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i see
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> still better than vanilla tho
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> vanilla need O(n) to insert a new glyph
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs vanilla blocks STL
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i know
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and reimplementing everything is annoying xD
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but still that's solvable if we want to port it
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> is every text in ddnet text container now?
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i started implementing buffered text streams tho
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's that?
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. the server browser is pretty fast now(in text part)
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> can you get quads data out of a dynamic cursor
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it just checks if the string requires to be recreated
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> which is still faster than creating it every frame
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet has text cursor and selction support visually
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its just outdated and would require some removale of code dublication
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh so we have text selection already?
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well only visual support
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nobody did the simulation part xD
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't get it.
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so you can see the selection but not replacing or copy them?
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> SetTextContainerSelection
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can do this
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and have the selection üòÑ
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but as said its outdated, and since nobody did the sim part its also dead code
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well i guess TextContainer is really different from our TextCursor
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the easiest would be to work with ints
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not with UTF8
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we already did
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah ok
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it doesnt matter for TW anyway
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> since we dont have 100000 lines or smth
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet text rendering is really designed for modern GL
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> (in mind)
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :saddog: well i guess I can redo ime support and text selection instead of porting it
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah sry, ddnet got a bit away from vanilla, before u did something vanilla was really far behind üòÑ
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so always keeping the backward compability is too much pain
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u and rybte
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :tee_thinking: maybe making everything a text container can helnp
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd just need to use the text stream a bit more, and then we can drop textex
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just create textcontainer, render it, delete it
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> sure i'll wait
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> for the rest text, which isnt performance relevant then
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i did not really plan todo this anytime soon, working with text is always annoying xD
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> one language wants this, the other that
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> üëÄ can you just do these for me so you have something else to do lol
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ‚ú™ do you think using tw code and readding our containers or porting tw stuff to our code base is easier?
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno, i tw doesnt use quad containers either
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so we'd need to recreate alot
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> what does quad containers do
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> buffering quads
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we buffer quads
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does it mean saving some information about quads between frames to ease working with the graphics card?
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean for openGL
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> lets just say GPU buffering
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> less confusing üòÑ
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> redix was doing vbo is that the same?
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I still don't know what that means
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ‚ú™ can you try to ELI5? ^^
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> a dedicated GPU has VRAM
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> VRAM is alot faster in accesing than e.g. system memory, but slower in creating etc, and also requires less bus activity
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so optimal for GPUs
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so buffering quads means uploading stuff to the GPU and reusing it in the next frame
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what information about the quad is stored in the GPU?
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the vertices
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> textures are already uploaded, before this, right?
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> position, texture coordiinates color
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, and this creates a win big enough to justify the added complexity?
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd have thought that there's not many quads
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well open the ingame chat with GL 3.3 vs 3.0
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd have thought that there aren't many quads
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the difference is insane
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> text is using quads
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well it buffers quads yeah üòÑ
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know what quads are ^^
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> vertices that are rendered as quads to be precise
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought it's the stuff in maps
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ‚ú™ sorry for my ignorance, I'm not trying to diminish your work, I'm just really ignorant about graphics so far üò¶
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> im fine, im not against the vanilla stuff in general, i just dont want to loose performance xD
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I agree with that
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the easiest would be if vanilla gets more open to VBOs(buffer objects)
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ‚ú™ if I decide to work on this, would you lend me a hand and answer questions about graphics stuff? ^^
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think I'd be overwhelmed without
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> sure
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> redix was doing some vbo stuff, but he isn't available this year sadly.
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ‚ù§Ô∏è
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this *year*?
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you mean 2020 or 2021?
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 2020
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so you want to port the vanilla thing?
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> iirc
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> afk, food
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @TsFreddie why does the IME even differ so hard?
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> cant u just call something like TextEx( ?
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> not hard. just i need to reimplement some of the textrender feature under your code which might take me a while
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> what for example?
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also simulation? or just rendering=
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> idk what you mean simulation.
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> anything that is on the CPU and not related to Visualization
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> modifying a text buffer along with string?
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well that is outside the text class isnt it?
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd imagine these things pretty modular tbh
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> probably
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> SDL sends input, your class wraps it
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> renders stuff
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> something like this
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> mine is done in CLineInput which is robyt3's active PR, which calls CTextRender's CaretPosition and CTextCursor's BoundingBox
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah i see
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u did it like that
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well i need to read text.cpp first to tell whether i can just add something, maybe it is simple enough
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> reading might be the hard part tho üòÜ
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is vanilla text rendering descender, ascender aware?
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> not really, boundingbox has a extended bottom and that's it.
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @heinrich5991 well its not so easy tbh, i invested quite a bit time to make text pretty deterministic by reading the whole freetype stuff
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. for vertical alignment üòÑ
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe its indeed easier to just add bounding boxes to our code
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> when creating the quads
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> üëÄ how do you do proper vertical alignment
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> if I bound text with descender and ascender middle text gets wonky between different languages
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/tutorial/metrics.png
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i've read that already
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i used this and used the stuff that is useful üòÑ
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i've used everything in this pic besides xM** i think
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but i guess maintaining pixel perfect ruined a lot of things
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i see, well with the aascender u can make text (especially latin text) align correctly
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789400936979496990/tEt8J.png
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> hold
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> by vertical alignment do you mean layout or just characters
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it supports vertical alignment too, but since text isnt reliably the same size it only makes sense for e.g. the icon font
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i mean the layout of the quads in this case
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it is fine in vanilla i think
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> like these?
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789401866198843423/unknown.png
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> speaking of icon font. where was the `svg2ttf` thing Learath2 was talking about. üëÄ
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> why not just using ttf directly? üòÑ
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so we can have a custom dedicated icon font designed by us plus we can keep the glyphs source in repo
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah i see, why not just use SVGs then? xd
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so you can just call the text layout engine to do stuff for you?
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> all the hard parts are done already aren't they
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> üòÜ
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòÑ
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> still sounds overcompicated to maintain üòÑ
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> svg2ttf should be a python script that builds ttf file in build time
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> googles icon font is good enough, looks like the average android phone xddd
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> not loading svgs in game lol
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok seems like the textrenderer is simpler than i thought
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess vanilla really improved lately
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it is as stupid as i can make it
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oh right i think TextDeferred can be changed a bit to be a drop in replacement for TextEx, I rewrote the text layout engine to be greedy which should be faster.
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so its more about design question if heinrich wants todo it anyway
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> binary packing vs skyline
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and increasing font textures
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> vs
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> static
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> emm
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> atlas is skyline packed
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> didnt u use binary packing?
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we use binary search for finding stored glyphs in an sorted array which is the only binary thing we have.
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i meant on the texture itself
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> unless i'm stupid and reference the wrong algorithm in atlas
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not the data structure
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> finding glyph space
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the texture is supposely skyline packed
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye that
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> just we section our texture to have different parts that can be dropped
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so as soon as the skyline is full u recreate one "page"?
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> yes
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well there definitelly is some potential overheat then
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so we have 16 skylines texture
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. if it recreates often used characters
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we drop the page with the least character shown on last frame
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but i mean. the texture part is probably replaceable
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> btw vanilla doesnt disable texture compression for alpha textures
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd really suggest creating an issue for that
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> else u get graphic glitches on GPUs that do lossy compression
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> like red spots flashing everywhere?
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> was happening with my intel laptop before. but i think that might just be me lol.
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://i.imgur.com/Xspp5kC.png
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in my personal opinion, texture compression that isnt lossless is stupid anyway
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd be in favour of removing texture compression completly
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tho i only deprecated it in ddnet
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> lol
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if ur pc cant run tw, maybe u should accept that its old xdc
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> texture compression is not lossless?! ouch
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well else it would give performance increase for GPUs
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the whole idea is to lower memory bandwidth
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and GPU cores arent strong enough to uncompress it on fly
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well else it wouldnt give performance increase for GPUs
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @TsFreddie have u benchmarked a atlas drop?
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> does it just zero the page?
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> zero the page and increment a counter, and every cached CTextCursor will try to update their quads next frame.
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and u use 2048 texture size?
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> guess windows VM isnt supported then anymore xd
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but u can just use mesa software renderer anyway
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its better anyway üòÑ
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> the performance does burn to the ground when there is a drop each frame, but i only created it with 256 texture
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and we do use 2048 texture now
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just fear a bit the frame drops, but maybe im too pessimistic üòÑ
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> alpha textures are quite cheap compared to RGBA (4 times as less obv.)
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so increasing it doesnt really increase rendering time üòÑ
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 4096x4096 can already hold nearly all chars inside the fonts
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and thats only a 2048x2048 RGBA texture
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> üòÜ
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but ur IME thing looks really good, so we need it xd
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> lol
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789411510644113439/unknown.png
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is that with texture compression?
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> no
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789411614003560468/unknown.png
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh xd
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> just tried to tank the textrender
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it happens when there are glyphs missing even after one refresh. (since pages are allowed to drop during quad refresh)
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah yeah
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> can't really reproduce it in 2048 texture tho.
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats also something that wouldn happen on ddnet ever üòÑ
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> realistically it cant happen
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it would require rendering alot of different characters in one frame
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i also logged it when it happens, so it is easier to tell if it is my fault in the future
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> imagine the whole world would just use 26 characters
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> all problems of the computer world solved
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> uint8_t is enough for everything XD
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> smaller textures
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> btw should we stop google from indexing irclogs
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> am i a culture hater for the google bot now? xd
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> idk
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> sometime i search some stuff ddnet related irclogs pops up.
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh xD
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> don't know if it is bad tho
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i thought u fear being profiled by it üòÑ
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i mean i did say kill all asians twice (including this one)
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789414357338554396/unknown.png
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> If i change colour of "friend messages" it only changes the heart colour not the actual text they are writing, just me or bug?
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789419202724495380/screenshot_2020-12-18_10-09-09.png
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> apearently only used for the heart
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> looks like either the example below is wrong or the chat is wrong
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just open an issue
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah cant tell either üòÑ
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it worked before it was probs removed by accidient
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it worked before it was probs removed by accident
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i've never seen any pink text before.
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice, no more graphic glitches with zink, and already over 2k fps
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> üíØ
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> hope someone compiles it on windows some day
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then we can use vulkan for broken opengl drivers
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> pog
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or GL on DX12, but sadly didnt see any performance benchmarks yet
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno if micrsoft just plans to make their ubuntu subsystem work, or actually performant üòÑ
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> AoC was easy with Crystal and redefining existing operators that happen to have the precedence I want. Would've been easier to just change the precedence, but not sure if I still have a language left that allows that. Int32 as default type was the most annoying part: https://github.com/def-/adventofcode-2020/blob/master/day18.cr
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And of course there is no eval in Crystal, so had to use sed for my "metaprogramming"
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Sitting in a uni meeting since one hour watching my windows using group members trying to get their IDE to compile the project. Meanwhile on my linux `./gradlew build`
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Isn't it an online meeting? Just do something more productive at the same time? üòÑ
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :twinbop:
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yep working on aoc :D
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @deen do you have some automated localization strings search to clear them? Because I often want to rename something, but always afraid of losing localization for it
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @deen do you have some automated localization strings search to clear them? Because I often want to rename something, but always afraid of losing localization for it and leaving extra localization string unused
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @deen do you have some automated localization strings search to clear them? Because I often want to rename something, but always afraid of losing localization for it and leaving extra localization string unused. In #questions there is a good point now that we should rename "Friend message" in settings, because it's not really means message
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, see scripts/languages/
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's also used in the github ci
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> When you are in free cam spec, tab out of the game and tab in again, your cam jumps to a random place
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Is this a known issue?
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> did you move your mouse while tabbing in out and in?
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> did you move your mouse while tabbing out and in?
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> i move my mouse to my second monitor yes
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it doesnt happen to me at all
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ah I see it applies the movement I do with my mouse outside of the game
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> my screen doesnt move when I dont move the mouse and just tab out with hotkeys
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> maybe it has something to do with windowed/fullscreen mode or whatever
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> probably, I dont play in fullscreen
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> happens to me as well. Extremely annoying
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789480934592217108/freecam-bug.gif
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I'll take a look at the source code now, see if I can easy fix this
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I see a problem, but don't know how to fix it without ugly shit code
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Fixed @NeXus
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> thx for motivating me by pointing out I'm not the only one getting annoyed by this shit
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> you can prevent this by pressing f1 first
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> then alt tab
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> no need now)
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> how's the new hud planned to work? is something like this good?
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789494398853185576/rect3785.png
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> üî•
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> can we change position where those are
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I'm planning an insane feature of fully customizable ingame hud
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ravie yes, looks great to me
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm not a designer, so hard for me to imagine what would look good, so I didn't want to suggest something
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it might be better to have icons appear/disappear based on what you have but then some icons are harder to make, I'll need to think about it
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> mostly I can't think of a good way to cross out hammer off or player hooking off without making it cluttered and weird
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> for me they will appear only when active
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> so "No hammer" icon if you can't hammer
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> if can - nothing appears
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> same for all
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah that's what I'd prefer also because including tele guns there would be a lot of possible icons
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> yes, there are some of tele icons
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> you may consider using the same style for all of them changing only the gun
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what about the switch weapon off options?
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> like "you cant hit anyone with grenade"
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> does anyone even use this?
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> is that a tile or tune zone?
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i dont think so
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> its a tile
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's a setting on hammer-off tile I think
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yea u use the switch hammer tile and its like the delay on it or whatever
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> what about generated icons then?
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> like layered for such shit
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> `background` > `NoHit` > `Item`
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> no hit is already one of the trickier icons üòÖ
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> its an example
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> :nobot: make it like this but with a hammer
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> or any other weapon
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and the tee icon on that means "others"
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> also thetile itself already looks like that
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> so Im talking about that. We can generate it layered if there are a lot of options needed to be shown
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @Ravie could you also make a "slider" for freeze timer that we will use instead of shields?
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> as we're working on the top left side of the UI anyway
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its already in the new gameskin
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its in 0.7
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> or alittle clock to save space
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789500235697225798/unknown.png
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> we don't have it in our version
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> update ddnet
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è yeah I already thought about using 3 ilttle snowflakes to display it but if you wanna code a slider that's even better
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> oh we do ok
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I guess this is the only way, I'm not really a fan but only this will work on other weapons
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789500578665201715/unknown.png
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> but slider is not working anyway
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> default hammer looks like shit
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> btw I can use the gameskin one xD
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> u ok?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789500791257432064/unknown.png
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> u can just scale the ones from gameskin but it will probably look bad
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> yes I think
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> u can do it for the weapon display cause those will be bigger
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> never scale something to make an icon...
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @Ravie will you make a... I don't know the english word for that... Like preview of this area?
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> mockup? ye for sure
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> yes, that's the word
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> so we can see and even discuss how it will finally look like
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @deen let me catch you while you're here and ask where do you have a players `Character` object (which contains all the info about hook time, endless jumps etc.)
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @deen let me catch you while you're here and ask where do you have a player's `Character` object (which contains all the info about hook time, endless jumps etc.) on client side
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @deen let me catch you while you're here and ask where do you have a player's `Character` object (which contains all the info about hook time, endless jumps etc.) on client side. Can't find it, only the `m_PredictedChar`
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @deen let me catch you while you're here and ask where do you have a player's `Character` object (which contains all the info about hook time, endless jumps etc.) on client side. Can't find it, only the `m_PredictedChar` what, I assume, is predicted and may not work without "antiping"?
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also there's a "you can jump x times", do we layer a text number over a jump icon?
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> if you'll figure out how to show this then we can
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> otherwise I would just... skip this one
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @Ravie keep in mind that this thing is more likely to be pixelated because of TW scaling
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The ddnet character is a part of the snap, it should have those
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> this is my best idea for now
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789502557948608552/unknown.png
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> may work
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> might look bad with long numbers tho, it can go up to 255 xD
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> never used
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> this icon should support infinity sign in it
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> or I mean some extra icon for infinity jumps
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah I was about to say we can just put a number in the corner or infinity
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789503386142900254/nouisban.jpg
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> First one should be louis, the result should be nouis. Overall I rate ur meme 2/10
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> at least he put in effort and matched up the transparency squares xd
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> oh yeah you are right
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789503994140950558/nouisban2.jpg
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Im Photoshop pro :Kappa:
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è alternatively the infinity one can 2 arrows like in entities
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789504957664591912/unknown.png
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @Ravie I don't think these icons will be big enough to see such small numbers
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> there are such numbers on switches in entities
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I barely see them if rly
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> We need something more user friendly
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I can also just make a good infinite jumps icon and not worry about this one (at least for now)
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well if we only had to support a reasonable number of jumps we could have something like the shield display to display the djs we have
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That would be very intuitive
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> too much screen space
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For 255, sure. For 10 jumps it's not much space at all
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> normally it would be only one DJ icon which on its own might be useful anyway
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you'd also know when you have dj other than feet color
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> feet color for DJ is awesome and more then enough
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah but just as a side effect
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> mb
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dj counts over 10 is also very uncommon, we could indeed try a dj bar
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it could simply not show more past 10
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It could have a number next to it or we could start putting them closer together as they increase
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With some overlap it should look decent all the way up to 20-25 dj. After that it'd start to look bad
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For dummy I was thinking a small region only for dummy features that only gets shown when the dummy is connected
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And we could use your own dummy skin as an icon for "dummy"
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> designing icons for dummy features :monkaS:
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @Ravie add a deepfly-ON icon as well
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I mean for map setting
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> if it's possible to deep-fly
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I don't think that's needed and it's impossible to design xd
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> ok, not the primary thing right now
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> do you have something already as a mockup?
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I was making a few of the basic icons, I can throw it over a screenshot and add weapons just give me a minute
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è if your screen is 1920x1080 you can open in paint and press f11 to see 1:1
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789523431560839228/image3542.png
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> haven't thought much about layout but I'm open to suggestions
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I thought about weapons on the first row
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Do the hammer and pistol as well
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> For other gamemods (fuck them btw) and to see what you're holding right now in the freeze
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> So all the weapons will be slightly transparent except for one choosen
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but you always have hammer and there's an icon when it's off :x
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> It's weapon hammer
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Not "hit allowed"
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> There is no "hit allowed" icon
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I'd try to keep it as minimal as possible and only display weapons that you can pick up and when you have them
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if you have gun or hammer in hand then all "special" weapons can be transparent
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> No no
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> the idea here is to see what you're holding now
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I'll try to make weapons working now...
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789525512313765928/image3542.png
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> that's getting cluttered really fast
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> did u understand when I said "Row"
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789525824876707900/image3542.png
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> lol
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> well kinda this
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but now seriously
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789526767215706152/image3542.png
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> not the 90 degrees ofc
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> _  _  _  _  _ would look stupid
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> `_ _ _ _ _` would look stupid
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like only showing weapons that can be picked up
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> yes it will
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> vertical like this looks like they're on a weapon rack or something
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Opinion: I don't love the vertical layout. I think a horizontal layout with the same footprint as the default health bar might look nice.
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> yes
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Default:
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789534013433839626/default.png
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Basic mock up for horizontal layout:
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789534087035093002/horizontal_layout.png
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> plus a couple extra items, but all in the footprint of the original health bar
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> oh no I don't like the grid thing
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> hmmm, guess they could all 4 just be in a ling
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> hmmm, guess they could all 4 just be in a line
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's be best to just display shotgun/grenade/laser if you have them
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I am already making the best one
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> wait for it...
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> 3 guns in a line, then maybe a couple small  icons for status like infinite hook/jump?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> the simplest/minimum viable solution will probably look the slickest
18:00 < ***> Buffer Playback...
18:00 <+bridge> [17:59:29] [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789537330707955752/unknown.png
18:00 <+bridge> [17:59:38] [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I've done it... almost.... But in-game already
18:00 <+bridge> [18:00:02] [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> so some spacing fixes and some scaling for big weapons and we're done
18:00 <+bridge> [18:00:21] [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> showing only weapons you have, transparenting all that you're not holding in hands
18:00 <+bridge> [18:00:36] [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> meaning that there will be always hammer + pistol. Rarely third
18:00 < ***> Playback Complete.
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> super rarely 4 or all five
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Never 6
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hammer & pistol don't need to be shown I think. pistol is only interesting when you have jetpack
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> why not as hotbar
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and showing the active weapon too xd
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789541202433015888/unknown.png
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Need to learn some math to align it properly
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> but you got the idea
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> it IS a hotbar
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> but it will not show weapons you don't have
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I also had the diagonal idea but thought it'd be extra work  to code and not worth it
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but still should only display sg+nade+laser
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> it always worth it when it's cooooool
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> true xd
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> every weapon you have at the moment + highlight the weapon you're holding
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> too useful for in-freeze weapon picking
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> because I always wonder what am I holding right now
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> gun is never useful xd
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> IT IS
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ninja is also obvious when you have it
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> How would you scream in deep freeze!?
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aoe> @Ravie   pistol is the most op gun in the game
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yes you can shoot very very fast
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aoe> no people use it to aim with
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and SPIN!
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and Scream in deep
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aoe> if you go on gores srv you never see someone with a hammer xD
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you can scream with any weapon
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> can you spin hammer>
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> ?
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> no, u can't with hammer
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> cause deepfly off?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> yes
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well ok but still you don't need to display it xd
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> weapons in freeze are whatever, you can press hotkeys
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also I had a cool idea to display weapon in freeze with the cursor but I guess nobody cared
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> hotkeys for noobs
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and you never know what hotkeys your dummy using
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> cool idea I may consider doing it in 30 mins
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u can def freeze cry with hammer
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> can u not
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in gores u use hammer often
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> for saving
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> some ppl do lol
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> :kogsux:
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aoe> good players will use pistol all the time and only use hammer to unfreeze
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> insane gores is about peripheric view anyway
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> jawsh is best gores and uses hammer
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u dont really need the weapon
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> changing cursor in freeze turns out to be much harder task then it looks
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> because here we go again, deeply into shit code where nobody knows what weapon you're holding right now
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Sounds like a candidate for the ddnet character net obj
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> no thx
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> it's stored on client side, but in some shitty way
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Nope, the client doesn't know which weapon it has
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> so you can't really easily access it. Well... You can... But the data is not guaranteed to be correct
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> there is a "wanted weapon"
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Not, if the server sends "ninja" because he is freezed
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> yes.
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> thats the problem here
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Wanted could be a weapon the tee doesn't have
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> seems it couldn't
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> but... It should be...
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Sure you can set your wanted weapon to anything by using the number keys 1,2,..
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Ok, nvm, will come back at it later. I guess even after HUD is done
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can definitly show the weapon
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2307
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i made this time ago
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ppl didnt want it
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> mouse fix was merged and now I still have 5 things to work on. 6 actually, there is also anti-cheat teehistorian scanner, which is not part of the fork
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/789551768781586463/unknown.png
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> better only do one thing and make that good
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and yes, there is a server-sided dummies
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and I think I'll go make some steps towards it now
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> my updates are always excellent
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hahahaha
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u always make for a laugh in this chat
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> perfect
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah they are perfect, but imagine u'd concentrate on only one
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its post perfect
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the next step
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> then there would be only 1 perfect update
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the key to the universe
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> but here we have five excellent updates
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> you can't go better then perfect
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> but you can do more of the perfect, what I'm doing exactly
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> but you can do more of the perfect, and that's what I'm doing exactly
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Ryozuki @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è Nope, in the current version of the protocol you can't tell. That's why you had to touch the protocol in your PR here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2307/commits/1163fa16854c18912080989c9ac02110ca3427a5#diff-95a9207711f0fa572be4148ea6239216afd4ff86cfbb4e8510463ad21bba2f12R30
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lovely embeds
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah true
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i wanted to say i meant its possible
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my bad
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> it hurts to make new net objects
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> why is it even on some python
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> not supporting even array wtf
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol its actually pretty darn easy
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> not supporting even arrays wtf
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è You could actually cherry pick that from @Ryozukis commit, there was no criticism of the protocol changes below that PR
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ugh
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he once said i dont know how to code
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so he should obviously not use it
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Key is to come up with a good UI which will be good for most players, adding a way to turn it back off and not introducing too many config settings on the way
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mystery?> Is there a way to do nested binding of keys?
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mystery?> for example:
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mystery?> bind 1 "+weapon1; bind q "+weapon2; exec quickswitch/toggles/gun_hammer.cfg""
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mystery?> doesnt seem to work as intended
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> `exec file.cfg`
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> ```
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> file.cfg:
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> weapon1; 
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> bind q "+weapon2; exec quickswitch/toggles/gun_hammer.cfg"
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> ```
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> `vind 1exec file.cfg`
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> ```
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> file.cfg:
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> weapon1; 
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> bind q "+weapon2; exec quickswitch/toggles/gun_hammer.cfg"
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> ```
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> `bind 1 exec file.cfg`
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> ```
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> file.cfg:
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> weapon1; 
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> bind q "+weapon2; exec quickswitch/toggles/gun_hammer.cfg"
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> ```
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mystery?> oof thats gonna make a lot more files
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> cool, isn't it?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mystery?> trying to implement quickswitch like in csgo/tf2
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro the client knows which weapons it has on ddnet servers
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Ok, must be new then
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 i think it doesnt know what weapon it holds when its frozen tho
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since the server tells its frozen by telling ninja weapon
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> it can assume
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> currently
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess that could be done at the same time
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Ok, we have around 220+ errors after attempt of unbinding Characters from players for serverside dummies
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we just dont use ddnet network char freeze status due to not all clients having this
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why my pr added capabilities stuff
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think we decided to base that on the client's version number
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you'd do >= VERSION instead
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont htink it was that clear
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but anyway the pr was closed cuz ppl didnt like to show weapons
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @deen I'm unbinding characters from players on ddnet server side. How should serverside dummies behave when something is asking for their ID

19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> can we please discuss serverside dummies
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> whats the motivation?
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I need to know as much as possible to make it correct
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> there are a lot of mappers waiting for serverside dummies
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> also, it is real shit that every character is bound to player
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> shouldn't be so
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its only logical
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> wdym by serverside dummies then
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> also, I would like (maybe) to make some scriptable AI's for maps
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i onloy know 1 ppl wanting this and its im corneum
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I guess a benefit is that sixup can play dummy maps
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> that's the character controlled by server
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> basically, for now, it just stands still. Like AFK player
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> it's true that every player has a character, but that every character has a player is wrong
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no its not, because it didnt make sense before
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I know it sounds strange to you cuz you're not familiar with logic, but anyway
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> nvm
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fck off
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Completely unrelated question, was there ever an incentive to make the ddnet client work on 0.7 servers?
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stupid windows normie
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that doesnt even know to link a fcking library
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> what do you mean? Do we need it? I think we don't
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 moderate this guy
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he is obviously baiting me every time
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Who would ever play any server except DDnet in TW
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Just curious, seems like a logical step
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Now that the server supports 0.7 clients
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> it is, but it's so much work to do
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and for what...
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro no one has done it yet, it would probably be accepted if the code is not outright horrible
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Hehe
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> You mean like my original code for the 0.7 client support
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no comment
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> just huge waste of time leading to no profit for ddnet players
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è @Ryozuki hey, you guys both chill. I acknowledge that @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è started, but continuing isn't okay either
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> it's better to make new ddnet features then struggle with 0.7 client side support
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd actually like 0.7 support
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> why
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 hear this, u did a useless work!
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because I like to play with more players
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and 0.7 has players
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love how this guy can be unironically rude and shit on others work and get a free pass
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddd
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> fair. Then maybe it worth it
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that's not okay, and I already told @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è before (I think yesterday)
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> answering some questions somebody might have: characters (which are tees) can be controlled not only by player, but also by server. Or even nobody
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Maybe by some unnatural forces as well...
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. but so far they couldn't, so the code doesn't assume that this might happen
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> and the current server architecture have a big mistake in it's root when assuming each character has a player and referencing it through the character
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> as well as not accepting the server as a player
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> everything that is not tested does not work
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> since nothing required the use of characters without players yet, it does not work
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (we also don't have tests that could ensure that, so there's that)
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> it worked, yes, just because there was no need of server-controlled characters or some others
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yep, see above
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> it doesn't make a code good, it just worked 'till it could
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> so, the time has come to fix this and open new possibilities
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> imagine RPG in teeworlds with some real NPCs lol xD
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think that exists
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> You didn't get it
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I mean real NPC, with dialogue system and so on
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://discord.gg/yugwwn5
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that exists
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> hah
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> cool
