06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki why are you so eager to label people? Such an american thing to do. Call them commies and move on...
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Try discussing things by taking the people discussing the situation out of it
07:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ??
07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You always make it about the person :P
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Yeah i am dutch
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen

10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> this is in the persion abuse post on ddnet frontpage. Maybe it should be removed if the ranks were removed c:
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I dunno
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh are they really still ther? .-.
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> @Dev my dummy is bugged on 95.172.92.151:8320
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> if i connect him, he connects after 10 seconds
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> if i switch i get connection problems
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> on other servers it works normally
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> but others can connect dummy and use it normal on th eserver
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> idk what the problem is
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I cant check rn could you give Server Details @Syltoox Mod and map for Example
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> biome master
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> ddrace
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Normal ddnet Servers ?
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I also had this Bug once
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> For me it worked to restart client or Change Server and then Change back
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Is your bot Client based on an older DDNet Client or could it be an new unknown Bug? @Syltoox
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> ?XD
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> i deinstalled bot
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> but i had never problems with ddnet and bot client
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> i only swapped servers and then it worked. but on the biome master server it never worked today
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ye sure i mean your totally not bot only aimassistant client
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Did you Test the Same map on another Server? Or Other map in the Same Server?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> dude i dont even have aim assistant shit
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> i dont want help of you ty
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Syltoox I don't know what the problem is. I'll restart the server
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> ok
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Syltoox usually that means your  firewall, isp or some network inbetween is doing weird stuff to packets on some ports. You can try restarting DDNet client
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/AALW3/9de5f263f3.png
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye c:
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kyosuke> wow XD0
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen @Learath2 adding an HTTP request to the server would result in a dependency of the server on libcurl
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that fine?
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> how do i access the screenshots folder again? always had a shortcut but got a new pc
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kyosuke> idk sry
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> win?
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>

16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yes
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/454286516106166274/tw-screenshots.bat
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or this takes you directly
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `%APPDATA%\Teeworlds\`
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it worked; thanks
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 could be a compile flag, ideally we would have a better way to extend the server code then to tack on stuff
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you mean?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "ideally we would have a better way to extend the server code then to tack on stuff"
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> HTTP sounds like an okay way to extend the server code
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 ^
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like a proper way to write/structure extensions so we can keep ddnet code clean of stuff we only use for official servers
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can make that an interface
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I guess it would be better to only do it after the second thing we want to do with it
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> YAGNI and all
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah true, guess just keep it as easy to seperate out later as possible and the dependency should be k
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it bothers someone we can ifdef it
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mh... who might be bothered by this *cough* fstd *cough*
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I also dont like having a billion dependencies :P
16:27 <+fstd> tl;dr?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> libucrl depencencies
16:27 <+fstd> teeworlds/systemd integration?
16:27 <+fstd> ah
16:28 <+fstd> could be worse than libcurl, i guess
16:28 <+fstd> i think in ddwar we linked against that too
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For client only in ddwar iirc
16:29 <+fstd> yeah right
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually never figured out how to link things with bam so I stole your commit from ddwar for ddnet btw :P
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> o.O
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bam best
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/AAN6E/0d268f90bc.png
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> n joke im actually currently working at bam rn xd
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> developer is best
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kyosuke> vali server on ?
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 yeah
23:13 <+Gabee> fstd ∷ teeworlds/systemd integration?
23:13 <+Gabee> that would be pretty simple to do right?
23:13 <+Gabee> (if you're not a fan of gentoo/alpine/void)
23:14 <+fstd> given that the systemd code absorption process seems to be pretty streamlined, systemd-teeworldsd and systemd-teeworldsctl should be a piece of cake, yeah
23:15 <+fstd> i'm not sure if systemd is fine with the zlib license though
23:17 <+Gabee> fstd: I was more talking about a unit file for teeworlds
23:17 <+Gabee> (obvsly the serv)
23:20 <+fstd> i guess that too is simple after figuring out how systemd works by reading the documentation that i expect to be high quality, top notch and up to date, given the quality developers behind it
23:20 <+fstd> not my cup of tea though, and i'm running my teeworlds servers on netbsd anyway
23:21 <+Gabee> wow fstd
23:21 <+Gabee> You really are showing bad faith :)
23:21 <+fstd> how?
23:21 <+Gabee> the documentation for systemd is very well done, redhat is doing a very good work of it
23:21 <+Gabee> I've made some unit files very easily and it makes SENSE
23:22 <+Gabee> systemctl status teeworlds:
23:22 <+Gabee> You know if it runs, or not, the command, everything
23:22 <+Gabee> I can even give my daemon a certain amount of RAM/CPU to use and not more than that (with the "slices" in systemd)
23:22 <+Gabee> netbsd sure but I never had any experience with that
23:22 <+fstd> i've had to make it a habit to manually double check my every systemd action, because sometimes they'll just silently do nothing (which may or may not be due to debian's default unit files, but i ultimately don't care which part exactly introduced the brokenness)
23:23 <+fstd> when i stop a service, i pgrep if it has actually stopped
23:23 <+Gabee> that's debian/ubuntu
23:23 <+Gabee> on the other distros it doesn't do that
23:23 <+fstd> when i restart a service, i pgrep before and after to see if it's actually a new process
23:23 <+fstd> because systemd will always report success
23:23 <+Gabee> because they do this transparent compatibility with the old /Etc/init.d + ubuntu & upstart etc…
23:23 <+Gabee> On Arch/Fedora/Anything else really, if it is green, it works, if it is red, it doesn't work
23:24 <+fstd> for most of the servers i run (at work), each one has one particular service that doesn't come up at boot, as of systemd
23:24 <+fstd> it's a huge pain in the ass
23:24 <+fstd> and i have yet to see at least ONE actual benefit
23:24 <+Gabee> I'm proding Ubuntu 18.04 so far it's a disaster
23:24 <+fstd> everything has become shittier, more complicated adn less reliable
23:24 <+Gabee> Been running fedora in test & opensuse as well, it's clean
23:24 <+Gabee> Basically
23:24 <+Gabee> on debian/ubuntu
23:24 <+Gabee> systemctl is just an alias
23:25 <+Gabee> which is /etc/init.d/old_shit_bash_script_from_1998
23:25 <+fstd> not really
23:25 <+Gabee> root@NLDW2-EY19:~# systemctl disable ssh
23:25 <+Gabee> Synchronizing state of ssh.service with SysV service script with /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
23:25 <+Gabee> Executing: /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install disable ssh
23:25 <+Gabee> Removed /etc/systemd/system/sshd.service.
23:25 <+Gabee> disable/enable is only a symlink on systemd, nothing more
23:25 <+fstd> there's unit files that refer to init scripts, yeah.  and there's init scripts that run systemctl.  and i've seen one service fail because control actually got handed back and forth between init script and systemctl, each deferring to the other
23:26 <+Gabee> great
23:26 <+fstd> and i don't understand what purpose introducing all this brokenness serves
23:26 <+fstd> the linux servers i set up don't run systemd, so at least there's that...
23:27 <+fstd> we'd be super fucked without nagios currently
23:28 <+Gabee> oh gosh nagios
