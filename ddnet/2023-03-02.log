06:07 < bridge> <Vecop.> i have a really weird bad problem 
06:07 < bridge> <Vecop.> my gpu is rx 570 rgb xfx edition and when i run the game my gpu crash for no reason and i need to close the pc and open it again to make the screen work then i need to install the driven again  , and i don't think it's the gpu crash because i'm playing league of legends 60 fps

07:28 < bridge> <Vecop.> @Jupeyy_Keks
07:29 < bridge> <Vecop.> I'm not using an intel gpu , it's an amd readon rx 570 , and also i don't even get time to do it , it's like i open the game i go to the settings , then the screen switch to black
07:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I never said u use Intel
07:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just update Ur drivers
07:31 < bridge> <Vecop.> oh wait i should open the link from the pc to see more, mb sorry , but i already updated the driver and the same problem@Jupeyy_Keks
07:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If your really updated your drivers. Tell me which version
07:32 < bridge> <Vecop.> one moment
07:33 < bridge> <Vecop.> @Jupeyy_Keks23.2.2
07:33 < bridge> <Vecop.> adrenaline
07:34 < bridge> <Vecop.> i tried to install 22.1.1 , it worked for a little bit but suddenly it's stopped working
08:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe it's a hardware problem
08:10 < bridge> <Vecop.> how can i fix it ?
08:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Unplug GPU. Clean it. Plug it in again
08:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Might work
08:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or if PSU is too bad lower refresh rate
09:29 < bridge> <Vecop.> i did it before üò¶ , if i install a new windows and download the driver and everything again, is it might work?
09:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Might, not guaranteed, would always try all other methods before reinstalling my system ^^
09:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Hard to say. If u don't have anything important on Ur system u can try it. Issues like this are always random to me. Especially since I have a rtx 580 without any problems
09:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Hard to say. If u don't have anything important on Ur system u can try it. Issues like this are always random to me. Especially since I have a rx 580 without any problems
09:40 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs very interesting that the game is sending your whole system crashing down
09:41 < bridge> <Ewan> if reseating it & cleaning it doesn‚Äôt fix it then it might be time to test on a fresh install of windows (which you can do on another drive, by the way; use rufus to make a windows to go install)
09:41 < bridge> <Ewan> and if that doesn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶ get a new gpu or try reflowing it xd
10:08 < bridge> <Vecop.> I'll try to do it and tell u ,ty for helping
10:22 < bridge> <M é…π „Ç∑> @Vecop. possible your pc have a virus. My friend's game crashed after he joined as spectator, after scanning hes system with antivirus, he found miner and deleted it, after it game not crasing in spec

17:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what's annoying about the python requests library?
17:25 < bridge> <Learath2> Doesn't have a good way to hook in
17:25 < bridge> <Learath2> Axios in javascript is about what I expect from a http client library nowadays
18:46 < bridge> <Teero> not on arch xd
19:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, that's more advanced than what I did before
19:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> mind sharing what you do? üôÇ
19:30 < bridge> <Learath2> I just wanted to hook in on requests to record the original url and check if a redirect occured on the response
19:30 < bridge> <Learath2> I can wrap it to get that behaviour probably but I just hacked something else together. This was just a small scraper that wont be used again anyway

21:04 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Yoooo look at this guys
21:04 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1080943654904017046/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_841621a0-b879-46b1-9879-f70989921920.jpg
21:04 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> this is how hard I bricked my pc :kek:
21:04 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> this ssd wont live long frfr
21:06 < bridge> <Robyt3> Is this showing the "disk" fragmentation? Defragging SSDs is pointless, unless you want to decrease it's lifespan
21:07 < bridge> <Robyt3> Is this showing the "disk" fragmentation? Defragging SSDs is pointless, unless you want to decrease its lifespan
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> that‚Äôs what it looks like
21:07 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> at this point does it matter? :kekW: :kekW:
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> SSDs have excellent random access so defragmenting is just moving shit around pointlessly
21:07 < bridge> <Robyt3> Even for modern HDDs it's not really relevant to defrag them manually anymore
21:08 < bridge> <Robyt3> modern HDD + modern OS
21:08 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Still tho, this shit is storing my backups
21:08 < bridge> <Robyt3> Even worse to decrease the lifespan of your backup SSD for no reason :monkaS:
21:09 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> this is my very first time defraging it
21:09 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Its gonna be fine I think
21:09 < bridge> <Robyt3> Well, yeah, but you'll just wear it out for absolutely no reason
21:09 < bridge> <Robyt3> So it will break sooner than if you never defragged it
21:10 < bridge> <Robyt3> and it will be 0% faster by defragging it
21:10 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I guess, then I'll just move my backup to my main ssd, then wipe the other one
21:10 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> if wiping helps
21:10 < bridge> <Robyt3> Deleting things from the SSD is what wears it out
21:10 < bridge> <Robyt3> Defragging also means you delete things because it moves the blocks around
21:10 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> ok, then what doesn't?
21:11 < bridge> <Robyt3> Reading doesn't as far as I know
21:11 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> So, either way I have to shorten it in order to not brick
21:12 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> oh yeah, the 34% wasnt the final score
21:12 < bridge> <Robyt3> Less writing is better, but you obviously need to write something or it will stay empty üòÑ
21:12 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> well yes, since its my backup ssd
21:12 < bridge> <Robyt3> Defragging just moves the blocks around for not reason so it's just bad for your SSD lifespan
21:13 < bridge> <Robyt3> For backups an HDD (or rather a raid) would probably be better
21:13 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> But I want to wipe the ssd after I moved the backup
21:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u dont wipe
21:13 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I only need to defrag incase I move corrupted files
21:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u just remove the gpt table and done kek
21:13 < bridge> <Robyt3> If you do a fast format then it doesn't wipe anything except the file table
21:13 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> its MBR
21:14 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> the other is gpt
21:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats not disk dependent
21:14 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:  ik
21:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no u dont
21:14 < bridge> <Robyt3> Same applies, fast format doesn't wipe everything
21:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> otherwise u wouldnt mention it
21:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> r u on windows 10?
21:14 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> well i mentioned it cuz u dont know which one is which
21:14 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> if it ever makes difference
21:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> mbr is for pre uefi era
21:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but it has nothing to do with the disk
21:15 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> 11
21:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its about booting
21:15 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> 11 needs gpt format
21:15 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> the one ssd with the os on it is fine, but the backup ssd with mbr is not
21:16 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> well ok, i shorten the lifespan either way, but im forced to do that arent I?
21:17 < bridge> <Robyt3> If you want to wipe it so it's clean, then yeah, but it doesn't shorten it as much as defragging
21:17 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I see
21:17 < bridge> <Robyt3> And defragging is completely pointless for SSDs, because they have fast access speed
21:18 < bridge> <Robyt3> Defragging is only somewhat useful for HDDs, because the disk and the read head need to move into alignment, so it's faster if entire files are in the blocks adjacent to each other
21:19 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> So it optimizes the route of the files to be as accurate as it needs? and it's usually good for hdds, cuz they are slower?
21:19 < bridge> <Robyt3> With modern OS with lots of RAM it's not really necessary to manually defrag either
21:20 < bridge> <Robyt3> Important files are loaded into RAM if you have enough
21:20 < bridge> <Robyt3> And Windows probably defrags files a bit in the background as well
21:20 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> ye, with windows defrag
21:21 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Ok, so I wipe the data now, I didn't start defraging yet, cuz I wondered if this is worse
21:21 < bridge> <Robyt3> Yeah, wipe is fine if you just do the fast format and not the complete format or a secure delete that takes hours
21:22 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> i dont have that time
21:22 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :kek:
21:22 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> and for me, it takes days, not hours
21:23 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> but ty for the info, appreciate it
21:23 < bridge> <Ewan> how big is this ssd
21:24 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> the os ssd is 1tb, the backup ssd is 110gb
21:24 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
21:24 < bridge> <Robyt3> smol backup
21:24 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> before you ask why the 1tb ssd for os
21:24 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> that ssd is way faster and new
21:27 < bridge> <Chairn> no, writting things to SSD wears it out
21:28 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I think its both
21:28 < bridge> <Robyt3> Isn't that basically the same thing? To write to a sector you first must clear it.
21:28 < bridge> <Robyt3> Though deleting in Windows doesn't really delete the file from the SSD I guess
21:29 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> thats why I use AOMEI partition assistant
21:29 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :gigachad:
21:29 < bridge> <Chairn> is it with NAND Flash, however when deleting, you only update file table
21:30 < bridge> <Chairn> reading a quite huge number of times the same data, may also end up wearing the read block
21:31 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Isn't it only worse, when the drive starts to fail noticably?
21:31 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> like being slower of fails writing stuff?
21:31 < bridge> <Chairn> it gets worse the older the SSD is
21:31 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Oh, the backup ssd is around 2020, so it should be fine
21:32 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> and the os ssd I have is brand new
21:32 < bridge> <Chairn> when SSD gets old (ie too many writes cycle), it has to move data from stale block to functionning block
21:32 < bridge> <Robyt3> The first rule of data storage is to always have a backup, are you sure you have a backup while you wipe your backup SSD? :justatest:
21:32 < bridge> <Chairn> so the older it gets, the more move it has to perform and tries to even the wearing out on all available blocks
21:32 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I uploaded the moat important stuff to Onedrive
21:33 < bridge> <Chairn> hence a 1TB SSD is usually 1.2TB but extra data is hidden by SSD controller
21:33 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I uploaded the most important stuff to Onedrive
21:33 < bridge> <Robyt3> Guess I should think about cloning my old system SSD to a new one at some point
21:33 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1080951059234689134/image.png
21:34 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> seems ok to me
21:34 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I saw way worse, like my laptop's ssd
21:34 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> 150k cycles :justatest: :justatest:
21:35 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> it was like an 8 yrs old piece of shit xd
21:35 < bridge> <Robyt3> Mine should be 8 years this year as well
21:35 < bridge> <Robyt3> It's been powered on for 4 years in total
21:36 < bridge> <Ewan> üíÄ
21:36 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> looks ok tho, not a sign that it should be wearing out
21:36 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :gigachad:
21:36 < bridge> <Robyt3> Wear Leveling Count is at 92, which is still okay
21:37 < bridge> <Robyt3> If it's at 0 then it's gone, but it can technically fail at any point before that also
21:38 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> new one for me is at 98%
21:38 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> that bastard ssd is already dying on me :kek:
21:47 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Oh one more thing, is dividing the SDD into different partition layers affects the lifespan or performance?
21:47 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> @Robyt3
21:49 < bridge> <Robyt3> Some google searches suggest it doesn't make a difference
21:50 < bridge> <Robyt3> Wear leveling probably works anyway
22:10 < bridge> <Alexander> I recently bought a 1TB ssd and the next day found out .y motherboard supports m.2
22:10 < bridge> <Alexander> I recently bought a 1TB ssd and the next day found out my motherboard supports m.2
22:10 < bridge> <Ewan> that sucks but you should have done your research lol
22:10 < bridge> <Ewan> also unless it was on the back or something it's kinda hard to miss
22:11 < bridge> <Alexander> I just wasn't looking at my motherboard and believed my brother who said that I don't have an m.2 slot
22:11 < bridge> <Alexander> He somehow missed it
22:11 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
22:12 < bridge> <Alexander> But there is a possibility that he takes the ssd and buys me an m.2 since he already has an m.2 and 2 bad hard drives
22:12 < bridge> <Ewan> i kinda want to get a better m.2 drive
22:13 < bridge> <Ewan> mine is 512 which isn't bad by any means but with size comes speed on these ssds (usually)
22:13 < bridge> <Ewan> and if i get a better one then i can put that one in my laptop
22:13 < bridge> <Ewan> theoretically
22:13 < bridge> <Alexander> Honestly a normal ssd is enough speed for me
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> you say that and then you actually try the good stuff
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> logging into windows takes no time at all
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i might do some stuff
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> rearrange my drives so my windows is on  the m.2 and my linux install is on the sata ssd that windows is on rn
22:15 < bridge> <Alexander> I have to backup my data and switch my current 120 gb ssd with the new 1tb one
22:15 < bridge> <Ewan> which ssd did you get
22:15 < bridge> <Alexander> Patriot
22:15 < bridge> <Alexander> P220 i think
22:16 < bridge> <Alexander> Was on sale so i got it for cheap
22:16 < bridge> <Ewan> interesting
22:18 < bridge> <Alexander> https://linustechtips.com/topic/1092033-ssd-tier-list/
22:18 < bridge> <Alexander> Might be useful
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> all the top ones seem to be pcie gen 5 lol
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> which i won't gain anything from
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> cuz old ish mobo
22:39 < bridge> <Learath2> I always just get whatever samsung has. Too much thinking required to research ssds
22:41 < bridge> <Teero> Learned something new today...
22:41 < bridge> <Teero> Ive been doin sudo shred -f -z -n 1 /dev/sdxx all my life long. üíÄ
22:58 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
23:23 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Yup, but those are priced heavily
23:23 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> but tbh worth the cost
23:24 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Also, is there a chance in Steam DDNet to cloud save Appdata's DDNet folder as well?
23:24 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I lost my data recently and never bothered backing up my ddnet folder, so I lost like 70% of my stuff
23:38 < bridge> <Learath2> We wanted to do that but the problem is we didn't want to only offer it to steam users
