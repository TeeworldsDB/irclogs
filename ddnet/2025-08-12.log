00:24 < bridge> <Assa> pong üòÑ
00:27 < bridge> <Assa> why did it fucking push to ddnet
00:27 < bridge> <Assa> I didn't compare across forks man
00:28 < bridge> <Assa> ...
00:29 < bridge> <Assa> can you check if this client improves loading times further? from PR 10677

06:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
07:11 < bridge> <Ewan> gm
07:11 < bridge> <Ewan> im scared about ddnet long term
07:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> why
07:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> not much lives forever
07:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet already has 12+ years iirc
07:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think it will still last some time
07:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i would say it lives mostly cuz deen keeps it up
07:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> time to bury the game
07:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> :justatest:
08:16 < bridge> <Assa> I also think it'll last longer, we still have some neat new tiles in the line
08:16 < bridge> <Assa> and yesterday I saw a new amazing mod in the making ^.^
08:32 < bridge> <learath2> Every other year we get someone scared about ddnet long term, then they disappear and ddnet doesnt. No need to stress about it
08:34 < bridge> <jxsl13> Ewan, beware of bad luck
08:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> we don't want you to disappear
08:35 < bridge> <learath2> They show back up a couple years after dw
08:54 < bridge> <Ewan> it almost reads like an invitation

09:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> pog memory tracking
09:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> (i gave qemu 512 mb)
09:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah dont read ntoo much into it xd its cool to have u here
09:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @robyt3 calling CCharacter::Die is safe within a character tick but CPlayer::KillCharacter causes use after free. I think this is non obvious and tricky to debug.
09:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @robyt3 what do you think about some weird assert that sets a in character bool on character tick start and unsets it on tick end. This bool can then be checked in an assert in CPlayer::KillCharacter
09:22 < bridge> <Assa> No need to test, I optimized it a bit more and now even I can measure/feel a difference üòÑ
09:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> sounded more like a threat to me üëÄüíß
09:26 < bridge> <Ewan> they're gonna whack me
09:30 < bridge> <Assa> when is this issue closable? I feel like we shoudl maybe add a treshhold or should I make an integration test measuring loading time?

09:31 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10663
09:31 < bridge> <Assa> like even if I would theoretically get this down to 1 second, is it still considered too slow?
09:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** sos i am close to mental breakdown
09:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet/commit/9f1466bfecd82defbaae0c710e150486a5931e7b
09:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** why can i not join team, lock team, kill character?
09:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it pops me out of the team again somehow :c 
09:46 < bridge> <Ewan> odd
09:48 < bridge> <Assa> does any of this functions have a success return value?
10:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> stay with us, chiller
10:19 < bridge> <learath2> Well it can be closed when there is nothing more to optimize that is obv
10:31 < bridge> <Assa> okay one more thing is obvious üôà but one after the other ig
10:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa u talkin to me? ye they have return values but it does work. If i delete the KillCharacter i am in a team
10:39 < bridge> <Assa> maybe kill character unteams your team?
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got mmap and munmap done
10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess now i can really go with filesystem
11:48 < bridge> <Assa> time to play code golf in order to come under jupeys 20 LOC limit
12:27 < bridge> <qxdfox> KillCharacter deletes the current character and I think the team is stored in character
12:35 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon I have a question about https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#globalstatic-variables-should-be-avoided
12:35 < bridge> <Assa> 
12:35 < bridge> <Assa> Shouldn't it be `s_ANSWER`? for the constexpr? Or is this an exception from the static rule?
12:38 < bridge> <Assa> also is it `static constexpr` or `constexpr static` because both work and I don't know if this is equal
12:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @essigautomat: I assume that‚Äôs global so static means something else there
12:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> s\_ is for when it is in a scope
12:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @qxdfox: yea something like that. But you can die in a locked team so idk it has to work somehow
12:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Even Die did not work
12:52 < bridge> <qxdfox> odd
12:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But yes team stuff should be removed from character but that‚Äôs a different project
12:59 < bridge> <learath2> It is equal, doesn't matter but `static constexpr` is more common
12:59 < bridge> <Assa> so if I have a global variable like `constexpr static <type> TEX_COORDS_LOOKUP_MAP = ...;` the name is fine?
13:00 < bridge> <Assa> I mean I can swap the keywords here
13:00 < bridge> <Assa> I mean I can swap the keywords here @learath2
13:03 < bridge> <learath2> Yes you can, but it's just more common to have your storage class specifier first
13:05 < bridge> <Assa> we have both in the code, even in base/
13:06 < bridge> <Assa> guess I'll just shrug it off ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üòÑ
13:07 < bridge> <learath2> Well as far as the standard cares they are equivalent, so doesn't matter all that much
13:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 where can i find the fat32 spec?
13:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/networking_communications/SD/FAT.pdf
13:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://elm-chan.org/docs/fat_e.html

13:59 < bridge> <Assa> the envelope synchronize feature is fully patched away btw
14:00 < bridge> <Assa> should I fix that? I found out why
14:02 < bridge> <Assa> From chillerdragon
14:02 < bridge> <Assa> > -    while on the start line the animation was bugged
14:02 < bridge> <Assa> > -   the animations have different state for different players
14:02 < bridge> <Assa> From chillerdragon:
14:02 < bridge> <Assa> > -    while on the start line the animation was bugged
14:02 < bridge> <Assa> > -   the animations have different state for different players
14:03 < bridge> <Assa> - last is **intended behavior**
14:03 < bridge> <Assa> - maybe just stop the animation for that time?
14:11 < bridge> <qxdfox> e
14:12 < bridge> <qxdfox> envelope sync doesnt work?
14:12 < bridge> <Assa> no fully broken and useless
14:12 < bridge> <Assa> m_RoundStartTick is always 0, i wonder how the hud handles that
14:13 < bridge> <qxdfox> i thought it syncs it to the server time
14:13 < bridge> <Assa> the server time resets on start, but the envelope doesn't
14:13 < bridge> <qxdfox> thats not intended?
14:14 < bridge> <qxdfox> i feel like it works just fine that way
14:14 < bridge> <Assa> what do you believe the synchronize feature is for?
14:15 < bridge> <qxdfox> to sync it to server time so everyone sees the same thing
14:15 < bridge> <Assa> what should be default behavior?
14:15 < bridge> <Assa> what should be default behavior (no sync)??
14:16 < bridge> <qxdfox> whether to have sync on for new envelopes or not?
14:16 < bridge> <qxdfox> im a little confused
14:18 < bridge> <Assa> one is synced, the other one isn't, guess which is which
14:18 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1404801176654053427/envelope-start-test_2025-08-12_14-17-25.mp4?ex=689c828c&is=689b310c&hm=6d3ade0f791c613a275cd5d1c10fc4f2d95af0ba397478f5954b216aa35f9759&
14:19 < bridge> <qxdfox> no clue
14:19 < bridge> <Assa> I even joined with a second client
14:19 < bridge> <Assa> there is none, this feature is broken.
14:22 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i thought the feature was disabled cuz some maps broke
14:22 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> that one map where you join the server and everything is perma pitch black
14:22 < bridge> <qxdfox> wait, is it always server time or client time its using right now?
14:24 < bridge> <qxdfox> i thought the unsynced version just uses the client time
14:24 < bridge> <Assa> one is local time and one is server time since joining, but there is just no difference
14:24 < bridge> <qxdfox> i see
14:25 < bridge> <Assa> sounds like a client bug to me fixed in the wrong way
14:25 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> no need to fix a feature if you just remove it :troll:
14:26 < bridge> <Assa> it's even more bugged then I think
14:26 < bridge> <Assa> like even the unsynced variant syncs now in my test branch
14:28 < bridge> <qxdfox> same for me
14:28 < bridge> <qxdfox> i just tested it
14:28 < bridge> <Assa> here is the kicker
14:28 < bridge> <Assa> the actual round timer is a negative warmup timer
14:28 < bridge> <Assa> (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞)‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
14:29 < bridge> <Assa> gonna git blame
14:37 < bridge> <Assa> both use the same nanosecond static timer ...
14:38 < bridge> <Assa> that's why they sync ...
14:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> hi
14:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got a height adjustable table
14:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> epic
14:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> with 4 memories
14:39 < bridge> <Assa> hi
14:39 < bridge> <Assa> nice
14:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> now i can develop the kernel standing up
14:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> like linus
14:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> insult other devs
14:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> and be funny
14:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> then you can stand tall >:D
14:45 < bridge> <Assa> if you mean me, all I feal rn is despair
14:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> I meant ryo üò¢
14:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> be like Linus
14:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> why despair
14:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> life is good
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would say motivation about ddnet is nice, but dont let it be all what u do, do more so u can juggle between projects (if the despair is about ddnet)
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> also having projects you fully own and decide about is fun
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> even if u dont finish em
14:52 < bridge> <Assa> oh it is fun, otherwise I woudldn't do it
14:52 < bridge> <Assa> also I have a load of other hobbies
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah i didnt say it isnt fun
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
14:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> what i meant is when u focus too much on a single thing u will probs burn out
14:52 < bridge> <Assa> You may wonder why I do so much for ddnet, currently I have a lot of free time at work, because I have a million projects, but all of them got rescheduled in the future
14:53 < bridge> <Assa> also I am a service owner and handle user tickets, but currently everything is just working ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
14:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> soon I won't have enough fingers to count how many project I'm juggling between üò¨
14:54 < bridge> <Assa> If I unfix synchronized envlopes, would you prefer to stop them before the start line or would you prefer to reset them before the start line?
14:54 < bridge> <Assa> If I unbreak synchronized envlopes, would you prefer to stop them before the start line or would you prefer to reset them before the start line?

14:57 < bridge> <pluskz> im kinda confused about the license for the DDNet mapres, it uses the code license or is it CC BY-SA?
14:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> the latter, most likely
14:59 < bridge> <pluskz> seems that they are not CC BY-SA, since license does not say the mapres folder is CC BY-SA
15:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1404811901950627890/Screenshot_20250812-150051.png?ex=689c8c89&is=689b3b09&hm=4cbee5b56452e1ba8ace8750f5ecafbed690bddd07ae6762b893d64c79d3db53&
15:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> teeworlds license
15:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> mapres is in datasrc
15:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> might wanna check out a 0.6.x tag to be sure
15:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> but probably the same
15:02 < bridge> <pluskz> yeah also seems that im misunderstanding
15:02 < bridge> <pluskz> mapres seems to be CC BY-SA but things like skins are not
15:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> there might be a difference in ddnet, which may use more skins that the teeworlds base.
15:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> there might be a difference in ddnet, which may use more skins than the teeworlds base.

22:37 < bridge> <Assa> maps like abyss are still slow because lots of quads
22:43 < bridge> <robyt3> You could also cache the value of `GetDataSwapped` for quad layers in `CRenderLayerQuads`. Wouldn't save much, but then you could also add validation for the quad data size then. Divide the data size by `sizeof(CQuad)` to determine the actual number of quads, than use the minimum of that value and the `m_NumQuads` value of the quad layer.

23:02 < bridge> <Assa> I'll look into it, I am currently doing a PR stop until some get merged (so I don't do too much in parallel)
23:05 < bridge> <robyt3> #10630 has conflicts
23:05 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10630
23:06 < bridge> <robyt3> #10677 can be merged after fixing the variable name.  The prefix `a` is also used for `std::array`.
