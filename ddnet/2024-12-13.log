01:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'd generally expect non-native users to be better at spelling, not worse
01:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> learning to speak before learning to write is a handicap for remembering bullshit spellings

02:52 < bridge> <woidless> Who can create a script for fifo?
02:57 < bridge> <kebscs> ddnet uses just a simple `CreateNamedPipeW`, just do `CreateFileW` with `GENERIC_WRITE` `OPEN_EXISTING` and `WriteFile` to write to it
02:57 < bridge> <kebscs> whats so difficult youre stuck for 1 month on it
03:55 < bridge> <Solly> (dont need to modify ddnet)
03:55 < bridge> <Solly> ive already written them a script to do tune randomization and a very loosely written guide on how to use it
03:57 < bridge> <Solly> @woidless read this
04:12 < bridge> <kebscs> Yes you can do standalone with just these 2 functions
05:25 < bridge> <woidless> I READ, I WROTE ABOUT THIS NEURAL NETWORK , I DID EVERYTHING WITH THIS TEXT
05:26 < bridge> <woidless> But I don't understand Python.
05:26 < bridge> <woidless> I can't
05:33 < bridge> <pioooooo> Why in the first place do you think asking the same people the same question would get different answers
05:35 < bridge> <woidless> I don 't know , maybe they are different

08:04 < bridge> <jxsl13> python is shit
08:04 < bridge> <jxsl13> hot take
08:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i never loved it
08:07 < bridge> <teero777> Not a hot take
08:08 < bridge> <teero777> Well, it is good for scripting smth quick
08:08 < bridge> <teero777> But id rather use lua
08:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> for small scripts it's great
08:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> write once
08:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> never read
08:10 < bridge> <teero777> python is a scripting language and was meant to be one by the dev but people smh use it as their main language
08:10 < bridge> <teero777> that's the problem imo

08:33 < bridge> <Solly> imagine if there was a system for making reports more valuable from people who report things well (negative reports like for spam or something)
08:33 < bridge> <Solly> so a karma system
08:33 < bridge> <Solly> and... then you make it so if the person has enuf karma you can insta ban them, wasnt indended but its just a thing and it isnt exploited
08:33 < bridge> <Solly> ..... most of the time. the rest of the time people are spending full time jobs just dilligently reporting shit to get good karma accounts so they can sell them so people can ban other people they dont like
08:34 < bridge> <totar> What is this about?
08:34 < bridge> <Solly> my mind wonders
08:34 < bridge> <Solly> and sometimes it produces coherant ideas
08:35 < bridge> <Solly> this is not one of those coherant ideas

08:40 < bridge> <Ewan> how many
08:41 < bridge> <Solly> and what if u wanted to play after a while it would take too long to get up to the pt threshold

08:53 < bridge> <Solly> what behaviour do you want to have, ive always thought tees to be rubbery balls, they would either not slide (insane balance) or roll
08:53 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> lets add logic blocks in ddnet and turn it into a game engine
08:53 < bridge> <totar> Well they don't bounce on the walls currently without tune
08:53 < bridge> <teero777> They will climb slower than when going down

08:58 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> saddo >>>
08:58 < bridge> <Solly> honestly i could do it rta
08:58 < bridge> <teero777> I didn't commit yet tho you're missing some stuff
08:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> Fnokurka >>>
08:58 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> :saddo:
08:58 < bridge> <totar> The good commits are in my brain you'll never get those
08:59 < bridge> <teero777> okay chill even I wouldn't use my brain even in a competition
08:59 < bridge> <teero777> That would be unfair
08:59 < bridge> <totar> The good commits are my brand new 7950x cpu
09:00 < bridge> <teero777> real?
09:00 < bridge> <teero777> Would be nice
09:00 < bridge> <totar> No üò≠
09:00 < bridge> <teero777> What kind of tps are you getting?
09:00 < bridge> <teero777> ;(
09:00 < bridge> <teero777> I wanna buy new pc
09:01 < bridge> <totar> But Juustart posted good info earlier
09:01 < bridge> <totar> He gets more tps with more tees
09:01 < bridge> <teero777> yea I also thought of some ideas to get multitee tas working
09:01 < bridge> <teero777> It is actually not hard
09:01 < bridge> <totar> Only another 1.5k loc to the file
09:02 < bridge> <totar> And 1k to kitchen
09:02 < bridge> <teero777> hmmm not really maybe 100loc
09:02 < bridge> <totar> Rly?
09:02 < bridge> <teero777> I already support multi tee in kitchen
09:02 < bridge> <totar> oh ok
09:02 < bridge> <teero777> For dragging
09:02 < bridge> <totar> sure
09:02 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> multitee tas would be awesome
09:02 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i wanna do a fng one where theres like 37432 trickshots
09:02 < bridge> <teero777> I need to adjust the saving format tho
09:02 < bridge> <totar> That's a lot of trick shots
09:03 < bridge> <teero777> Like we need a more complex thing that it is now. Also backwards compat
09:03 < bridge> <totar> Just convert all your files
09:03 < bridge> <teero777> We could do a json where one field are the raw inputs in bin
09:03 < bridge> <teero777> yeeee
09:04 < bridge> <teero777> My headache is fading too
09:04 < bridge> <teero777> This is nice
09:04 < bridge> <totar> Did you drink water
09:06 < bridge> <teero777> Last night I drank water but my stomach didn't like it and then nausea
09:06 < bridge> <woidless> Who can make a fifo script alone?
09:06 < bridge> <01000111g> you!
09:08 < bridge> <01000111g> Next year I might host servers aswell, if i stumvle across sth called "fifo" script, I'll get back to u
09:10 < bridge> <woidless> You are a hero
09:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @woidless: is that what you wanted? https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/video.php?t=fifo_script.mp4&u=chiller
09:14 < bridge> <woidless> Yes
09:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay so how much money will you donate to ddnet for the contents of this advanced script? @woidless 
09:14 < bridge> <woidless> just so that it works without my participation , also not say , but a broadcast
09:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> coding slavery is illegal in some countries, I guess
09:15 < bridge> <woidless> I don't know, I've already spent $40 on 1 coder. He said the project would take a week
09:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay i can give you the code for free but if you want changes you better stop paying random coders and start donating to ddnet
09:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the code of the advanced script is:
09:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``echo "say hello" >> uwu.fifo``
09:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> did I just see I AM LIBAN
09:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
09:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> my brother
09:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> and I am TA
09:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> and together we used to be TA & LIBAN
09:18 < bridge> <woidless> In any case, this is not what I wanted, it needs to be run on the hosting and manually every time, it does not output a command once at a certain time
09:19 < bridge> <jxsl13> google: linux cronjobs
09:19 < bridge> <jxsl13> or are you on windows?
09:19 < bridge> <jxsl13> then rip
09:19 < bridge> <jxsl13> try a loop
09:19 < bridge> <jxsl13> and a sleep
09:19 < bridge> <woidless> Why should I sleep right now
09:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> a sleep
09:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> command
09:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sleep.1.html
09:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> good luck

09:24 < bridge> <pioooooo> Lmao we should add custom curves into DDNet so it becomes turning complete
09:25 < bridge> <melo∆û> Evelyn how much money do you have on hand right now
09:25 < bridge> <melo∆û> Free to give away for whatever
09:25 < bridge> <woidless> 3$
09:25 < bridge> <melo∆û> Im willing to give you what you want as a runnable executable if you donate it to DDnet free and open source
09:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> on windows there is a task scheduler which uses some xml format for configuration, but that's about as much as I know. And priority should be set above 7 iirc otherwise your command might not always be executed
09:26 < bridge> <melo∆û> Im willing to give you what you want as a runnable executable if you donate it to DDnet. free and open source
09:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> on windows there is a task scheduler which uses some xml format for configuration, but that's about as much as I know. And priority should be set at least to 7 iirc otherwise your command might not always be executed
09:27 < bridge> <woidless> I have already paid 1 coder, he should create this script on Python for $ 40 and it will take a week
09:27 < bridge> <jxsl13> money is basically gone
09:27 < bridge> <jxsl13> üí∏
09:28 < bridge> <woidless> Why, he said it's a difficult project
09:28 < bridge> <jxsl13> what exactly, opening a file and writing to it?
09:29 < bridge> <woidless> It's new
09:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> Your project takes ~30 lines in python and is a simple File I/O in a while loop. It's absolutely not worth 40$
09:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> next time if you need to write to a file, donate to ddnet $40 and we will do it for you
09:30 < bridge> <aegisub> :madocheck:
09:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> ^
09:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> either completely beginner programmer
09:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> or you got scammed
09:30 < bridge> <aegisub> or both
09:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> indeed
09:32 < bridge> <woidless> Well, I can't write it myself.
09:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> open chatgpt
09:33 < bridge> <woidless> So ddnet is a game, not a coder
09:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> and write: please create apyrhon script that opens a file and writes 'broadcast message' to it every 10 seconds.
09:33 < bridge> <01000111g> Stop hating on Evelyn, its not that easy if u are a beginner. And the 40$ is fair considering random coder does not know anyrhing about ddnet and its codebase, no?
09:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> it's a python script
09:33 < bridge> <01000111g> and?
09:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> that writes to a file
09:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> while(true):
09:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> Sendsomethingtofifo
09:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> Sleep(x)
09:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
09:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> Where x is a changeable value at runtime
09:34 < bridge> <woidless> import time
09:34 < bridge> <woidless> 
09:34 < bridge> <woidless> file_name = "broadcast_log.txt"
09:34 < bridge> <woidless> 
09:34 < bridge> <woidless> try:
09:34 < bridge> <woidless>     while True:
09:34 < bridge> <woidless>         with open(file_name, "a") as file:
09:34 < bridge> <woidless>             file.write("broadcast message\n")
09:34 < bridge> <woidless>         print("–°–æ–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–æ –≤ —Ñ–∞–π–ª.")
09:35 < bridge> <woidless>         time.sleep(10)
09:35 < bridge> <woidless> except KeyboardInterrupt:
09:35 < bridge> <woidless>     print("\n–°–∫—Ä–∏–ø—Ç –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω.")
09:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> it is a fair point that when the programmer does not know nothing, he or she would need time for understanding stuff
09:36 < bridge> <jxsl13> now use that and put your fifo file instead of "broadcast_log.txt"
09:37 < bridge> <jxsl13> python your_script.py
09:38 < bridge> <jxsl13> `python your_script.py`
09:38 < bridge> <Ewan> LMFAO you're making this guy spend his last dime for some code
09:38 < bridge> <01000111g> why do u need a script for that Evelyn. Cant u just do nano fifo.txt, then write ur msg and save it
09:38 < bridge> <jxsl13> fifo file
09:39 < bridge> <01000111g> i guess bash script would be also fine
09:39 < bridge> <jxsl13> sends broadcasts to ddnet server
09:39 < bridge> <jxsl13> true
09:39 < bridge> <01000111g> and server checks each x seconds for new lines in that file?
09:39 < bridge> <01000111g> thats pretty cool
09:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> That's why j Said free to give away for whatever :greenthing:
09:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> there is already a fifo file that the server creates
09:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> all you need to do is write to it
09:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> Marzzzello wrote a python script to translate in-game chat via log file and fifo that echos messages back translated. Really cool indeed

09:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's pretty sick actually
09:44 < bridge> <01000111g> people in my uni are in their masters, then they sit in course, upload the exercise sheet pdf to chatgpt and legit think they learned something. Its fr over
09:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> they are over
09:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> not it
09:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> hehe
09:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :greenthing: too bad gpt wasn't really there when i was in college
09:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i do use copilot-ish autocomplete tho, but this is first time i just let a gpt model make something from scratch
09:45 < bridge> <01000111g> I dunno, it helps with some code, but currently it seems that people are even too bad to write the right prompt. If u dont know anything, you cant properly ask for it
09:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and i feel like i can just make blender addons now after looking at what it has done
09:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> nah, they are just training the next generation of project managers
09:47 < bridge> <01000111g> I am tutor for some undergraduate Introduction to R course. And they had to hand in some tasks, which i'd be able to do with gpt in 10mins, they had two weeks time and the code didnt seem gpt written (they werent able to instruct it or did it themselves for practice (big ups))
09:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i hate R
09:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> not in the sense i don't like R, cuz i never have used it. i hate it everytime someone studies fin they just ask me to do their homework even tho i don't even know their stuff.
09:50 < bridge> <Solly> (idk the specifics of fifo, but i think that should be a "w" not "a")
09:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh the fifo thing is still going on?
09:53 < bridge> <Solly> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
09:54 < bridge> <Solly> atleast the way i use chatgpt youd never be able to tell its chatgpt code
09:54 < bridge> <Solly> since often i dont really bother specifying specifics since its quicker to just edit waht i know it can give me
09:55 < bridge> <Solly> and also i make it into my own style, (copy and pate from wikipedia style)
09:55 < bridge> <Solly> and also i make it into my own style, (copy and pate from wikipedia sorta stuff)
09:55 < bridge> <Solly> also remove the large amount of comments it likes producing
10:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> a is append, I guess
10:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> should work as well, maybe
10:02 < bridge> <Solly> when you open a file with "w" you overwrite previous content. this doesnt apply with fifo (first in first out), i guess it does "append" when you write to a fifo pipe, but ive never seen anyone do it before (now i have) and opening as "w" (which is what echo ... > ... will do) works for me

10:13 < bridge> <woidless> I just checked this script on Windows on a regular local server, entered fifo.fifo in the script and on the server sv_input_fifo fifo.fifo, the script told me that the message was written to a file, and I actually checked and it is there
10:14 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1317057031147880538/image.png?ex=675d4c71&is=675bfaf1&hm=a9790e5a6f0a2547ba734a5a9794e88d36cfe4b80186efc88e1814bebe8085be&
10:15 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don‚Äôt understand what that means specifically
10:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless ``cd /root/DDNetPP/build && curl https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/J2 > woidless.sh && chmod +x woidless.sh`` then start the server with ``./DDNetPP "sv_input_fifo server.fifo"`` and then run the script with ``./woidless.sh`` it will broadcast and send chat every 10 seconds
10:21 < bridge> <kebscs> :pepeW:
10:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> :pepeW:
10:22 < bridge> <woidless> and can I not start the server for this , but just register it in the rcon
10:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> :cat_sad:
10:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ChillerDragon you're supposed to be a dragon! There's a limit to chillness! Be menacing!

11:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://github.com/TsFreddie/blender-acos
11:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> done lol
12:06 < bridge> <jxsl13> this
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless sadly you have to restart your server first. Seems like ``sv_input_fifo`` can not be updated after server start. I can't believe you don't have a fifo file in your config after all this time trying to do fifo ._.
12:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> If someone wants an easy pr to ddnet putting ``m_Fifo.Init(Console(), Config()->m_SvInputFifo, CFGFLAG_SERVER);`` into a chain hook should be a quick win to allow setting ``sv_input_fifo`` without server restarts
12:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Hehe
12:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> go risu!
13:05 < bridge> <robyt3> Fifo doesn't work the same Windows. It creates a named pipe on Windows that you send commands to, e.g. with `scripts/send_named_pipe.ps1`
13:05 < bridge> <robyt3> Fifo doesn't work the same on Windows. It creates a named pipe on Windows that you send commands to, e.g. with `scripts/send_named_pipe.ps1`
14:35 < bridge> <woidless> How can I specify 2 parameters at once to start ddnetpp, for example, so that the server starts using my config, and fifo also works
14:37 < bridge> <learath2> `"sv_input_fifo fifofilename; sv_map Kobra 4"`
14:38 < bridge> <learath2> Or a config file you put all these in
14:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 do you usually use `&buf[i]` or `buf + i` if `buf` was `uint8_t buf[...];`?
14:42 < bridge> <learath2> Usually `buf + i`. Sometimes I'm in the mood for `&buf[i]` though
14:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I wanted to rewrite little bit of my compiler to add ir to it and at this point I touched every part except lexer
14:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Recommend üëç
15:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> @0xdeen @pioooooo says he's getting pretty bad lag daily. can we reduce the server count on each server a bit?
15:37 < bridge> <0xdeen> Which servers?
15:38 < bridge> <pioooooo> i usually play on chn 6&9 and could experience lagging when there're many players in the evening
15:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> he can probably tell you. i'm not exactly sure
15:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> chn 9 is ddosed and currently down btw
15:39 < bridge> <0xdeen> CHN servers are always annoying because they don't have enough bandwidth
15:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> did we removed the 32 cap?
15:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> on smaller servers
15:39 < bridge> <pioooooo> yeah so i think if we could provide less server with better bandwidth
15:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> or that
15:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 32 cap is more efficient tho imo
15:40 < bridge> <pioooooo> what's that cap
15:40 < bridge> <pioooooo> max tee in a server>
15:40 < bridge> <pioooooo> max tee in a server?
15:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> yes
15:40 < bridge> <pioooooo> oh yeah that should also do
15:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cuz with that bandwidth we can hit max bandwidth even just with two or three 64 player servers
15:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> reducing to 4 servers per host is probably not a good idea
15:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> How compressed is Teeworlds traffic? Time to make life into backwards compatibility hell and design a new low bandwidth protocol :P
15:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm trying to do a LOD thing to reduce bandwidth on tee that you don't interact with.
15:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the protocol itself is varint deltaed & huffmaned and should be pretty good already
15:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> not many games have delta compression too the level that teeworlds has
15:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> My demos directory is 3GB :justatest:
15:44 < bridge> <pioooooo> wondering how cn bandwidth price end like this
15:45 < bridge> <pioooooo> i've deleted like 20G demos already
15:45 < bridge> <pioooooo> since i started playing the game less than 1 year ago
15:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> demo is not delta compressed iirc?
15:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i might be wrong
15:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I recently upped my max demos from 100 to 1000
15:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and replay recording is on too
15:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> demo is full snapshots stitched together
15:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> again i might be wrong
15:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Let me see, what if I simply zipped some of them...
15:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Let me see, what if I simply gzipped some of them...
15:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> demo can compress 50% usually. but you can't really do that kind of compression live on rolling data tho (like most of the data is in the future and haven't arrived yet)
15:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
15:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok gzip got a particularly big demo from 117M to 9.3M
15:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```
15:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> risu@canopy:auto$ du -h Patchwork_2024-11-29_04-14-01.demo

15:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```
15:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's too big to begin with
15:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
15:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> well it is hours of straight failure :)
15:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh wait it might include like five hours of sitting afk in freeze
15:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> probably lots of compressable repetitions too üëÄ
15:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah definitely a particularly compressible file
15:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but like, compressing demo files by default doesn't seem like a bad idea...
15:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> am particularly worried about that 128 player pr tho
15:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> chn can't run that
15:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
15:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Well you can totally do stream compression but it probably won't compress as well as a static file and will increase latency
15:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> idk how much it'd add though, and obviously hardware dependent so...
15:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> gotta be careful to not piss people off with degraded performance
15:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like to replace huffman or add it after huffman
15:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I think huffman is part of gzip...
15:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> tw have its own huffman implementation builtin
15:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> a combination of LZ77 and Huffman
15:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also varint delta compressions tend to have a lot of 0s and lots of varint coded bytes. so huffman should be pretty good at it already tbh
15:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> In many other games you'd assume client prediction on at all times
15:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so if you know client prediction would predict correctly based on the already sent data you send nothing
15:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> only send packets when someone's inputs change
15:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's part of what delta compression does
15:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I should really look at the protocol before I talk about it...
15:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the delta drops non changing snapshots completely.
15:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and only sends delta based on client's acked snapshot
16:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> How much is sent in terms of inputs and how much is sent in terms of positions and velocities?
16:02 < bridge> <tsfreddie> not sure about input. but the pos and vel is delta encoded. so if server knows the client received info about a tee at x = 4378 and it is x = 4380 this tick, it sends one byte containing x = 2 and let the client math it out
16:03 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah I was thinking more that since the client knows the position and velocity and the player's inputs, they need to be sent nothing about position changes for as long as their inputs stay the same
16:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think tw also does that
16:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but this requires prediction
16:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and the mere fact that `cl_predict 0` works and doesn't make the game completely unplayable means that too much is being sent by the server
16:05 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> unless setting `cl_predict 0` tells the server to send more info
16:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe it is supposed to do that but our prediction is broken since that part is still kept compatible with original teeworlds
16:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also i think it just sends less frequently instead of just not sending it untill something changes? idk. haven't check that part out in ages
16:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah sending less frequently makes sense
16:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i remember it being a part of character core tho
16:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I feel like with `cl_predict 0`, pressing jump and holding it should result in (visually on my end) my tee flying up into the sky and getting occasionally teleported back to the ground
16:09 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> like that would tell me that networking is efficient
16:09 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> or actually no, flying up into the sky and then after a moment getting teleported to the ground and staying there
16:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> though with this, small network lags would be more dangerous
16:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If something gets dropped it won't be almost immediately fixed by the next snapshot
16:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> not like small lags weren't already deadly
16:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> actually nvm we listen to ACK for that very reason
16:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
16:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye i think teeworlds protocol is pretty thought through
16:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i just mean vanilla teeworlds by itself in a vacuum without any mods of course
16:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ~~before any modders yell at me for missing info in the vanilla protocol.~~
16:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the fact that I can play like normal on FIN servers with `cl_predict 0` because my ping might as well be 0
16:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
16:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> bro playing sitting on top the physical server
16:32 < bridge> <pluskz> Hi, Is there a way for the server to know if the client has antiping enabled?
16:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> no
16:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> afaik
16:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I just finished Just Fly 1 with `cl_predict 0`, `cl_predict_dummy 0`, `cl_antiping 0` (because I don't know how these three settings interact)
16:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 
16:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> this should not be possible
16:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm *pretty sure* we could slim down the networking a fair bit
16:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I just finished Just Fly 1 with `cl_predict 0`, `cl_predict_dummy 0`, `cl_antiping 0` (because I don't know how these three settings interact)
16:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 
16:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> this should not be possible
16:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm *pretty sure* we could slim down the amount of data sent over network a fair bit
16:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if you fully break teeworlds compat, we could do a lot of things
16:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
16:39 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The client and server would have to agree to enable low bandwidth mode
16:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and it's *yet another thing* to maintain so I definitely understand why we wouldn't want to do that
16:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:catbite:1080459483345584160>
16:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and you probably would have to double check every ddnet prediction AND moving them to the core prediction AND add a compat route for it
16:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah, prediction would have to be *SOLID*
16:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if prediction is wrong for a moment it's going to feel very bad
16:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> AND mods would have to strip them to not get screwed
16:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> i just tested, these settings makes pseudoflying super easy
16:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> whatatimetobealive
16:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
16:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> filthy low ping enjoyers
16:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i get 60+ on every server
16:43 < bridge> <melo∆û> ~30ms stable
16:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> china is too huge and the three ISPs don't like to route between each other
16:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> huge PITA
16:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I love the slightly cruncy feeling of 25 network ticks per second
16:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :feelsbadman:
16:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if you cut the bandwidth by more than 50%, we could up that to 50 without any damage
16:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Are you telling me to do it?
16:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> idk. sounds like you wanted to
16:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
16:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I *kinda* want to
16:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> I also **kinda** want you to
16:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You'd love me forever for making CHN less of a pain?
16:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> nah, chn will run into bandwidth problem in other ways
16:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I mean at least it'll be cheaper per player
16:46 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i doubt you can fully make a 5mbps link feel like the current 100mbps+ links on other servers
16:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah I'd be surprised
16:47 < bridge> <isowner> how can i get speed in the client? i.e. not even speed exactly, but how many blocks will i fly further if i unpress the walk button
16:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You want to make cheats that will tell you where you land? :P
16:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :greenthing: my dream is to just make enough money so i can just rent a datacenter and lend a rack to ddnet
16:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> See this is why we need hats and lootboxes!
16:49 < bridge> <isowner> no, just for debug üôÇ
16:49 < bridge> <isowner> no, just for debug üôÇ
16:49 < bridge> <isowner> no, just for debug üôÇ
16:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> isn't velocity info display a config
16:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> or is that not it
16:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Make a 0.1% chance drop for a golden tee, make it raytraced, drop everyone's fps to double or single digits when a whale enters render range
16:50 < bridge> <isowner> no
16:51 < bridge> <isowner> how many more blocks will I have to treat
16:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 0.5 fng has a thing like that
16:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i forgot what it was called
16:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I just tried and setting my game to 25fps *definitely* feels worse
16:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I just tried and setting my game to 25fps *definitely* feels worse than turning of prediction
16:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
16:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I just tried and setting my game to 25fps *definitely* feels worse than turning off prediction
16:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> lol
16:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I can still hf tho
16:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 50fps is downright tolerable
16:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> we do have people who can't stand fps lower than 1000 you know
16:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I normally play 288fps cap on 144Hz display
16:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> there are definitely players staying on older versions cuz our update made it not possible to hit 1000fps on their machine anymore
16:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> HmMmmm
16:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> idk how good I'd be at working on that, I've only really worked with fps targets in the hundreds
16:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> (a game ran like crap on my potat iGPU so I rewrote all the shaders to look better and run like 4x faster)
16:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> (the secret was avoiding texture samples like the plague because iGPU has like no memory bandwidth)
16:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest: pro shader dev
16:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> not really pro
16:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I just wrote the graphics in shaders, not using textures at all lol
16:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> hmm let me see if I have screenshots
16:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's pro-er than sampling tho
16:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
16:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> unless you are just doing a single dot product and solid colors
17:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> in my mind i just imagine those 64kb demo scenes with fully procedural shader texturing and tracker musics
17:01 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i would love to get into those but i'm a bit too old to pickup a shader hobby.
17:03 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> let me get a couple screenies
17:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh no i googled demoscene 2024 and the first thing that pops up are people are disappointed with ai generated content
17:03 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but how do you ai generate demoscenes....
17:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Don't mind the judgement line, I didn't get to writing nice shaders for that part

17:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> dude just casually dropping usc screenshots
17:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> HELL YEAH

17:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do you have a controller
17:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I knew you were based
17:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> No, I play keyboard üòî
17:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'll get a controller some day
17:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> dude i make private network for bemani games
17:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
17:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Waddya think? Looks nicer than almost all USC skins I've seen imo but that's just me tooting my own horn
17:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> HOLY BASED
17:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it does look cool
17:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> (and yes my old laptop was so potato that default skin was unplayably slow)
17:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> There are no textures in that entire screenshot lol
17:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i had a sound voltex phase
17:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but it was gone tho
17:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> except the arrows on the judgement line, I didn't get to those as I said
17:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah I don't play much anymore either
17:09 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> got to like barely clearing some 18s at my best
17:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i still have this tho
17:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1317161436778336266/IMG_20241123_215619.jpg?ex=675dadae&is=675c5c2e&hm=36cb5ab479e14a81220652f79a1c1ee373a80b37212052308277e78c4ed892f9&
17:09 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Aww cute
17:09 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> See the reason I don't have a controller is that I wanted a fancy one
17:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> how fancy
17:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> gamo2's controller isnt terribly expensive i think
17:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i had one but i sold it
17:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's too kig
17:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's too big
17:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Yeah I looked at that one
17:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it had a wacky name that I forget
17:11 < bridge> <isowner> help pls üòî
17:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> #off-topic btw
17:11 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it would've been fancy enough for me
19:32 < bridge> <pathos3005> Why private? Why not just play local?
19:32 < bridge> <pathos3005> Also hey, it's been a while :)
19:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cuz arcade need to connect to a network to function at all. local servers are private servers
19:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> or maybe unofficial servers i guess
19:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> im just saying you need to make a server or find one to play those "games" and i made one.
