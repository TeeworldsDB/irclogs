07:11 <+bridge> <reitw> Do u live in the past
07:11 <+bridge> <reitw> It was in april
07:47 <+bridge> <cauldron1> Change the asset mapres or whatever itâ€™s called to a transparent image? Like hiw itâ€™s done in this video with skins: https://youtu.be/e4l1lZ5uw6M

08:30 <+bridge> <botondus> if you cant see it it still exist
09:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (answering to the tweet) him not getting promoted for protobuf seems in no relationship to its quality
09:22 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> he was hired by intel

09:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> i got the first 4 right apparently
09:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> ðŸ˜´
09:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Is the sum so slow because the int is overflowing the whole time?
09:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> BCS why would it be slower than waiting bytes to memory
09:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> BCS why would it be so much slower than writing bytes to memory
10:09 <+bridge> <scar17off> how to edit the ddnet client's discord rpc correcty? i tried to just change the values to my application id and edited the details text, but it didn't work (i don't see any rpc on my profile)
10:09 <+bridge> <scar17off> my os is windows 11, i can try it on 10 if it's the issue

12:28 <+ChillerDragon> fyi jopsti im stuck in a failed upgrade to debian 12 and my apache2 died so no webchat for a few days min
12:31 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> It still would suffer without it as in the search function is not upgraded whatsoever
12:31 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Windows will never decide to upgrade it, unless it broke something
12:32 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: did you ever rejoin ws-client?
12:32 <@heinrich5991> or is that the reason why you didn't
13:04 <+ChillerDragon> rejoin when what happend
13:04 <+ChillerDragon> oh its not here where did it go
13:05 <+ChillerDragon> yea ws client doesnt make muich sense w out apache anyways
13:05 <+ChillerDragon> yo could i get some admin on 176.9.114.238:8302 to fix my gnome issue
13:05 <+ChillerDragon> i got 4 tees connected and my gnome introduced the tabbing bug i need to reboot my pc
13:05 <+ChillerDragon> but timeout protection doesnt work with 4 tees
13:06 <+ChillerDragon> could we get 5 clients per ip for a second?
13:06 <+ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut when pr timeout max client ip fix to ddnet?
13:08 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> you can simply connect using the same ports?
13:08 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> there is a rejoin logic
13:09 <@heinrich5991> connecting with 4 tees per person isn't really supported 
13:09 <+ChillerDragon> :c
13:09 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> if you manually set cl_port you can always easily rejoin
13:09 <+ChillerDragon> wait so i can rejoin on ddnet too?
13:09 <+ChillerDragon> pog 
13:10 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
13:13 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> chillerdragon
13:13 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> just learn to play without 4 tees
13:15 <+ChillerDragon> :c
13:15 <+ChillerDragon> more is always better
13:19 <+bridge> <botondus> if it were possible i would imagine chiller playing with at least 10 tees
13:24 <+ChillerDragon> i imagine switching between more than 2 clients becomes too hard but if there was a single client with good multi dummy support yes gimme 10 tees
14:24 <+bridge> <learath2> Every. Single. Thing. Chiller does is unsupported. I have never in an entire decade of being here seen this man request one thing that is standard
14:25 <+bridge> <learath2> He is that one guy who would ask if he could sit in the cockpit jumpseat like it's the most normal thing ever.

14:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Special man needs special features
14:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what would you think about disallowing floats and integers larger than 2**53 in server info?
15:32 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think this would increase portability. floats because of float parsing, and integers because JS's default json parsing loses integer precision beyond 2**53
15:50 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> @jupeyy_keks new fps boost dropped? i just realised i get 50% more fps while the chat bug is on
15:50 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> :troll:
15:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i can tell you where in the client we clear the framebuffer, then u have it permanently

16:26 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> why is it centered :justatest:
17:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if that wouldn't be python i'd say "cursed"
17:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
17:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but i guess not much worse than the original xd
18:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> who broke ddnet.org
18:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> why is it down so often lately ðŸ˜®
18:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> nice its back
19:45 <+ChillerDragon> da hegg is ddnet volleyball
19:45 <+ChillerDragon> is that a map or server mod i dont get i
20:07 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> its a map where you play volleyball
20:07 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> against a friend
21:20 <+ChillerDragon> no mod?
21:20 <+ChillerDragon> are you telling me this is vanilla ddnet? could you explain how it works then :D 
21:22 <+bridge> <Alexander> yeah vanilla ddnet where you play to beat maps
21:23 <+bridge> <Alexander> just a custom map i guess
21:23 <+ChillerDragon> how can a custom map keep track of volleyball score?
21:23 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yeah, basically someone helped the mapper make a counter using switches, and the entire map abuses the totele block
21:23 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> doors and switches
21:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> someone :troll:
21:24 <+ChillerDragon> holy moly
21:24 <+bridge> <Alexander> you've never seen a counter in ddnet?
21:24 <+ChillerDragon> no
21:24 <+ChillerDragon> i am super amazed stuff like that is possible
21:24 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> forgot who
21:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> same
21:24 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i wanna add logic in ddnet so that we can condense stuff
21:25 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> and maybe make a calculator in ddnet :kek:
21:25 <+ChillerDragon> i can see heinrich having concerns with turing complete maps already
21:25 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> same
21:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> which logic gates have been implemented in ddrace
21:26 <+ChillerDragon> all of them
21:26 <+ChillerDragon> you can basically mine bitcoin using a map
21:26 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> really?
21:26 <+ChillerDragon> no idk im joking
21:26 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> xd
21:26 <+ChillerDragon> i thought switches only go on and off im super confused now what is possible and since when
21:27 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> you can create pretty much every logic gate with only an and + an not
21:27 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> in different patters and connections
21:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think the mini race time thing u see on the scoreboard is bugged
21:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> i'm spectating someone else who's in a race and it's not showing
22:22 <+bridge> <stnwtr> Thats hot ngl
22:40 <+bridge> <coke1465> i remember back then when someone forgot to add a background
