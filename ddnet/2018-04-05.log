13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Maybe fix the bug I described two days ago
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Happened 4 times since the update
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> It never occurred before
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Pipou what was it again?
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> @Learath2  "Hi, I got a bug using the editor after updating my client. I pressed the windows key and when I returned to the client my mouse was invisible, I saw it moving thanks to the x,y position and both right and left clicks were ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù. Couldn‚Äôt access to the menu (save...) by random clicks but could still ctrl shift e and play without problems."
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> I can record it next time it happens

16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Some1 reported me that his Settings got reset with the Update ?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Is this even possible?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It shouldn't happen, but I've heard it before as well
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but never seen it myself
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Hm weird
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Me neither
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I don't Even understand how it could Happen
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> People seem to loose their Settings sometimes should we autobackup them a bit?
16:18 <@deen> From what I understand we don't do much error handling
16:18 <@deen> So we'll remove the old config and try to write a new one
16:18 <@deen> If removing the old one works, but writing the new one doesn't, you end up like that
16:19 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/shared/config.cpp#L59
16:20 <@deen> io_close can also fail and we don't check
16:20 <@deen> and same for all the io_writes in that file
16:21 <@deen> Alternative approach: Create a new file, write everything into that, only if everything succeeded copy it over the old one, if that succeeded remove the temporary file
16:21 <@deen> Anyone up for it?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes f3
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> even better than backups
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> @Im 'corneum BTW, we talked a few days ago about server-provided dummies for certain maps; do you think that an issue should be opened about it on the repo, so that it can be discussed further?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> idk what that means.  it was just a cool idea to have. its not necessary but it could lead to new mapping styles
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> just say yez
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we all want tees in maps c:
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skyrx> not all
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yes then

17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thnks deen
18:04 <@deen> Other idea why it might be a problem, especially during update: We start a new client and then at the same time close the old one. So the new one might read an empty config, because the old one has just opened it or written to it partially. That should also be fixed by my change though
18:04 <@deen> see src/engine/client/client.cpp:1007
18:13 <@deen> Opinions? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1103
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Hmm interesting, I agree with you about losing people without making mistake is sad. If implemented make it only possible after 40 minutes+ or something like that. I think the best way and only way is to give your own progress away to someone who is interested. If it is claimable or decided by your team. Someone could continue on your progress while you preferred a kill instead of that guy who 'st <message clipped>
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 11.0.3 crashed on dummy connect
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> "use 11.1.3" if you reverse the font change what you wont do xd
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> do you expect a fix specifially for 11.0.3 or what lol
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> do you expect a fix specifically for 11.0.3 or what lol
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> id like to
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i know it wont happen
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if they fix it, the version will obviously include 11.1 stuff
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> as i mentioned before, a 11.0 version (so without the font update) and a normal one (with the font update) would be cool
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but they already said they dont want 2 versions which is really sad
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why maintain 2 versions
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> a lot more work
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> im not the only one who liked the old one more
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> about crashes, the new update takes longer to start the client and the maps arent shown well and just unplayealbe (with or without gfx_opengl3.0. if i try to connect with servers with a lot of tees it crashes.
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> who cares about the font
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> don't spam here so they can't read real feedback
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they did it for "insane performance improvement" and japanese support..."
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they did it for "insane performance improvement" and japanese support...
19:23 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> huh... japanese support?
19:24 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> insane performance improvement... hmmm. bitmap font?
19:24 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> those are definitely faster
19:24 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> but usually text rendering is not a critical path unless one is doing something really dumb
19:24 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> like rerendering the same text once per frame or something ‚ò∫
19:24 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> s/once per frame/at all/
19:25 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> we added a bitmap font at a chinese player's request but 'cause it was ugly, we only use it if we detect CJK
19:25 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> I bring up the rendering same text once per frame 'cause I've done that stupidity myself, through sheer carelessness ‚ò∫
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> many dont like the new rendering. text is bigger and symbols/icons are worse
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the 11.0.3 client was perfect except some crashbugs
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like it a lot
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what was wrong with the old one
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is nothing wrong with this new one
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only ur personal preference complainings
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which u repeat every day
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the old one was caused a bottcleneck from what i overread
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nemo: this: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1081
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @fokkonaut building your own client or don't complain

20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> " <nemo> I bring up the rendering same text once per frame 'cause I've done that stupidity myself, through sheer carelessness ‚ò∫"
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not necessarily, you might think of web browsers, that rarely render anything.(and also render alot of text)
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> But keeping the text in textures or render buffers and render them on the frame buffer can be really slow aswell. sampling a texture(the font texture) from cache instead can be really fast
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Sonix mh yeah probs same issue like with the text, if it annoys you hard, you can enable opengl3.3 for now
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thanks for the report
