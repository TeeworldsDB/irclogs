17:52 <+kettu> Hello. I'd like to donate 15€ to DDNet GER, however Paypal wants to know much too much about me, and I don't know how to buy and send bitcoin. Are there any other ways of donating, for example direct monetary transaction from bank to bank?
17:55 <@heinrich5991> deen: ^
18:03 <+kettu> I will make it 20€ so the Extrawurst is more worth it ;)
18:04 <+kettu> 10€ for DDNet GER, 10€ for DDNet RUS.
18:09 <@heinrich5991> kettu: you might need to wait a little while until deen sees this
18:09 <+nameless-tee> You can buy bitcoins on cryptocurrency exchange sites like btc-e.com, cex.io, coindesk.com, etc and withdraw them to ddnet address. But maybe deen may offer better solution.
18:17 <+kettu> nameless-tee: do you know whether the fees for buying BTC exceeds that for buying a different currency? Either way, in my opinion there's still too much fluctuation in BTC to make it a safe investment.
18:18 <+kettu> heinrich5991: I will wait until I go to sleep (I presume putting the computer to standby will disconnect me from the chat). If deen doesn't show up until then, I'll ask again tomorrow.
18:19 <@heinrich5991> putting the computer in standby will indeed disconnect you
18:26 <+kettu> As far as I know, when an IBAN is provided, the recipient's bank account is unambiguously identified, so no other personal information must be provided apart from the recipients name maybe (I'm not sure about this); but that can already be seen in his paypal account.
18:33 <+kettu> I will use flattr otherwise. As far as I know, flattr's purpose is to spread an amount of money over various recipients monthly, but I presume it can also be used to make a single donation. It keeps 10% to itself however, which is higher than Paypal's fees for donations exceeding 5€.
18:38 <+nameless-tee> kettu: I donated via paypal (I had some money on my account). The fee was about 8%. btc-e.com fee is 1-2% for buying and 0.001 btc (~0.55€) for withdraw.
18:43 <+kettu> nameless-tee: Thank you for the information. I'll reside to BTC then. Withdrawing on time or speculating on the future course will be on deen's part then ;) I hope that btc-e.com doesn't want to know all about my livelyhood though.

20:48 <+eeeee> kettu: trying out BTC is a good idea, you might use it later for other things. just don't forget it's not really anonymous unless you take extra effort to make it so (e.g. do mixing).
21:06 <+kettu> eeeee: They say: Fee: 1% min 15eur fee (we will deduct it from amount which we got.... So If I deposit 20€, they'll take away 15€?
21:07 <+kettu> the BTC trader I'm referring to is btc-e.com.
21:08 <+kettu> "Before send a first transfer upload your verification documents (passport and utility bill) to ticket https://support.btc-e.com Without your documents bank may refuse your first transfer" LOL
21:16 <+eeeee> i'm using coinbase and it required a bank account (no passport upload though)
21:19 <+eeeee> it you don't have a bank account then you might be able to find some website where you can buy bitcoins with a prepaid credit card. i'm not sure if there are any websites like that which are not a scam though.
21:21 <+kettu> I do have a bank account, but I'm resilient uploading pictures of my passport. And the 15€ min fee is quite high for the purpose of donating to DDNet. 
21:46 <@deen> kettu: hi
21:49 <@deen> I expected that some people want to do direct bank transfer, but I'm still hesitant about giving out my private banking info
22:37 <+eeeee> kettu: did you try https://www.coinbase.com ? not sure if it works for you, but it didn't ask me for pictures of passport.
22:59 <+kettu> eeeee: I will check out coinbase tomorrow. Thank you for the hint. I'll examine their fees and requirements of disclosure of personal information. But right now I'll go to sleep ;)
