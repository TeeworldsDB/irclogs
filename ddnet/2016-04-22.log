01:34 <@deen> hi
01:34 <@deen> our website hoster stopped the server permanently without any warning because of ddos attacks, setting up new server now
02:53 < nameless1> Ouch. It is sad that the hoster could not resolve this problem more adequately.
10:34 < asd> is ddnet.tw down? D:
10:46 <@heinrich5991> yes
15:04 <@deen> should be back up
