01:26 < goo_> #	add_path $USERDIR #	add_path $DATADIR #	add_path $CURRENTDIR
01:27 < goo_> add_path $CURRENTDIR add_path $DATADIR add_path $CURRENTDIR
01:27 < goo_> change it like this
01:27 <@deen> but why?
01:27 <@deen> ah
01:27 <@deen> that makes you not use your normal settings.cfg
01:27 <@deen> and you probably have something like gfx_finish on in there
01:28 < goo_> you dont use windows, so i dont know how it affects you, but on windows, its better for client to load map from same folder than from appdata/teeworlds
01:28 <@deen> aha?
01:28 <@deen> that's weird
01:53 < goo_> rcon pass?
01:54 < goo_> i have a feeling might get targeted by a certain group and votekicked off :/
01:55 < goo_> deen: is the rcon in the config, or loaded from database? will check on server?
01:57 <@deen> it's in the config
01:58 <@deen> ddrace.cfg
02:00 < goo_> do i just type the full name of the file and it opens?
02:01 <@deen> less ddrace.cfg
02:03 < goo_> and you created the servers in other screens? so i can close the putty?
02:03 <@deen> sure you can close it
02:03 <@deen> everything runs in background
02:04 < goo_> and exit the open txt?
02:04 <@deen> q
02:04 < goo_> just exit?
02:04 < goo_> ok
02:06 < goo_> well thanks, going to go sleep, cheers
02:07 <@deen> Good night
