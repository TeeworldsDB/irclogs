00:35 < deen> [00:35:23] I guess it's this bug
00:35 < deen> [00:35:30] ah ddnet GER is back
00:35 < Savander> lol
00:35 < Savander> xD
00:36 < Savander> deen from ger server?
00:36 <@deen_> Hm?
00:36 < Savander> nvm, but yes
00:36 < Savander> smth like that
00:36 < Savander> but i had state of other people.
00:37 < Savander> it was weird ;]
00:37 <@deen> I guess I have to debug it 
00:37 <@deen> but so much other stuff to do
00:46 < Savander> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So57pNBv0Ks
00:46 <@deen> no
00:46 < Savander> yes
00:46 < Savander> fucking awesome goat
00:46 < Savander> XD
01:11 < Savander> goodnight :P :D
01:12 <@deen> good night
09:18 < EastBite> deen: is the ddos always caused by dns amplification?
11:45 <@deen> EastBite: no
11:46 <@deen> EastBite: also ntp amplification, syn flooding, and some things I don't recognize
11:46 <@deen> and sometimes everything at once with 8 Gbit/s
11:53 <@deen> Well, probably more, but website becomes unrepsonsive at 8 gbit/s
11:58 <@deen> I think the guy's botnet account just ran out
11:58 <@deen> This is the first time since a week that no DNS amplification traffic is incoming
12:00 <@deen> hi gojegreen 
12:01 <@deen> I want persian ddnet back
12:01 < gojegreen> hi
12:01 < gojegreen> i havent vps
12:01 < gojegreen> deen
12:01 <@deen> =(
12:02 < gojegreen> my friend server show bug i think
12:02 <@deen> yes?
12:02 <@deen> what bug?
12:03 < gojegreen> w8 upload screenshot
12:03 < gojegreen> http://uppit.com/ojntqzn8s0n7/screenshot_2014-08-15_14-21-32.png
12:03 < gojegreen> see
12:03 < gojegreen> in consol
12:03 < gojegreen> spam 
12:04 < gojegreen> why server try to kick invalid client ?
12:04 <@deen> and he is not kicking anyone?
12:04 < gojegreen> no
12:04 <@deen> what does status say?
12:04 < gojegreen> its spam only
12:05 <@deen> someone else logged in?
12:05 < gojegreen> no
12:05 < gojegreen> just me
12:05 <@deen> are you on the server right now?
12:05 <@deen> what's it called?
12:05 < gojegreen> its spam kick client invalid id 
12:05 < gojegreen> no im not
12:06 <@deen> Is it the Persian Pro server?
12:06 <@deen> or the  Persian Gulf?
12:06 <@deen> maybe it's something with your client? You can try deleting your config
12:07 < gojegreen> persian pro block
12:08 <@deen> i get an error when connecting to that server
12:08 <@deen> "Kicked for inactivity
12:10 < gojegreen> :-/
12:10 <@deen> Something very weird going on on that server
12:12 <@deen> but he never kicks someone successfully?
12:12 < gojegreen> yes i get kick for inacivity i cant join the server with another client
12:12 <@deen> ok
12:12 < gojegreen> yes
12:13 <@deen> then i think it's a bug, not an attack
12:13 <@deen> try setting sv_inactivekick 0
12:13 <@deen> and sv_inactivekick_time 0
12:14 < gojegreen> k
12:15 <@deen> i tried it on my own server and i don't get kicked, hm
12:15 <@deen> is this still a Windows server?
12:15 <@deen> because I really want a server in Iran =/
12:15 < gojegreen> are
12:15 < gojegreen> yes
12:15 <@deen> official ddnet server
12:15 <@deen> with all ranks, you know?
12:15 <@deen> and tournaments
12:16 <@deen> I still hope someone can switch from a Windows to Linux server
12:16 <@deen> hi Savander 
12:16 < Savander> hi :)
12:17 < gojegreen> i know but you must talk with sjhz10 in forum about that
12:17 <@deen> I think I talked with him before about that
12:17 <@deen> and he didn't understand why I need linux^^
12:17 <@deen> but i will ask again, thanks
12:18 < gojegreen> hmm ok i try to talk with him
12:21 <@deen> Thanks =)
12:39 < evil_saeid> hello
12:39 <@deen> hi evil_saeid 
12:39 < evil_saeid> there is problem in clien , it seems !
12:39 < evil_saeid> players can not enter dummy from ddnet client !
12:40 <@deen> On which server?
12:40 <@deen> ah, i see
12:40 < evil_saeid> peersian pro harddd
12:40 <@deen> it's a problem with your config
12:40 < evil_saeid> persian pro block
12:40 < evil_saeid> come for persian pro block 
14:16 < EastBite> I guess it won't be possible to fight the ddos
14:17 < EastBite> teeworlds has a really weak point because you can hardly cluster the servers
14:19 < EastBite> also attackers don't even need to flood the whole band width, they only need to cause packetloss once per minute to get the players quit
14:23 < EastBite> deen: consider for hookrace: distributed servers with the possibility to play together serverwide
14:24 <@deen> EastBite: and how would that work?
14:24 < EastBite> well, the physics can't work togehter like that^^
14:24 < EastBite> but you could switch between server automaticaly
14:25 < EastBite> you only have to be together with your team
14:25 < EastBite> and other ones are like projections from other servers
14:28 < EastBite> stuff like that
14:45 <@deen> Yeah, I wish that could work
14:46 <@deen> Ideally so everyone can run their own server
14:46 <@deen> and they're all connected in a big network
14:46 <@deen> but that would probably have to work with trust and therefore be cheatable
14:46 < EastBite> ^ you have certificates & signing and stuff :D
14:47 <@deen> Not for other servers
14:47 < EastBite> "Ideally so everyone can run their own server" are you talking about every player?
14:47 <@deen> No, just everyone who feels like running one
14:47 <@deen> Like there are 1000 servers in TW right now
14:47 < EastBite> yes
14:48 < EastBite> hm
14:49 < EastBite> with signing between servers I meant that you can choose trustable users to host a server which is allowed to send ranks to the master
14:50 < EastBite> okay signing might be not needed there
14:50 <@deen> No idea how I would find out who's trustable
14:51 < EastBite> people of the tournament team? xd
14:51 <@deen> What's a tournament team?
14:51 < EastBite> just enough to prevent ddos
14:51 < EastBite> the guys who are planning and hosting tournaments
14:51 <@deen> that's me
14:51 <@deen> i don't understand
14:51 < EastBite> and you cannot pay for multiple servers
14:52 < EastBite> I'm refering to how tournaments could work out better in hookrace as in teeworlds today
15:09 < EastBite> deen: I cannot connect to ddnet brutal :8311
15:10 < EastBite> seems like I'm not getting snapshots from the server
15:13 <@deen> Yeah, I see this issue on many servers
15:13 < EastBite> and I get game messages which doesn't belong to me
15:14 < EastBite> that might be a problem :D
15:14 <@deen> broken spoof protection i think
15:14 <@deen> i enabled it by accident
15:14 < EastBite> :/
15:15 <@deen> oh, and ddos
15:52 < Savander> [15:51:51] Wiw,, ddnet ger die and ddracemax die too
15:52 < Savander> [15:51:53] ;o
15:52 < EastBite> we can't do anything about it
15:52 <@deen> ddnet GER is back
15:52 <@deen> I can do something about it
15:52 <@deen> I'm just not sure what
15:53 <@deen> I can wait until my hoster gives us ddos protection
15:53 < EastBite> do you know G@mer?
15:53 <@deen> or get a server @ OVH with ddos protection
15:53 <@deen> no
15:54 < Savander> datacenter in france
15:54 < Savander> it's not cool for ppls :/
15:54 < Savander> btw..
15:54 <@deen> Savander: i know
15:54 < Savander> ddmax is die :P :D
15:54 < Savander> LOL
15:54 <@deen> ddnet GER is back
15:54 < Savander> but ddmax not.. its weird ;o
15:54 <@deen> i guess we're back because i told my hoster to put us back online^^
15:54 < Savander> :)
15:54 < EastBite> deen: he tried to sell teeworlds servers and paid a lot for his servers
15:54 < EastBite> and he ended up like this: http://teeserver.de/
15:55 <@deen> but he still isn't answering when we will get ddos protection
15:55 <@deen> EastBite: yeah, it's like that in all online games, not just teeworlds
15:56 <@deen> you just pay a few dollars and you can ddos a server for a month
15:56 < Qwzor> deen: datafabrik has ddos protection for free?
15:56 <@deen> Qwzor: they don't have it at all
15:56 <@deen> but they're working on it and we will get it for free
15:56 <@deen> and they have a few 100 Gbit/s so it may just be fine
15:56 < Qwzor> not bad, usually hosters dont make it
15:57 <@deen> they also don't have virtual servers, but i still have one^^
15:57 <@deen> for 10 €, 6 ivy bridge cores
15:57 <@deen> 10 gbit/s connection
15:58 < Qwzor> how many traffic do u get when ddos is active?
15:58 <@deen> i don't know
15:58 <@deen> website becomes unresponsive at about 8 gbit/s, but i guess it increased quite a bit
15:59 < Qwzor> ah..i thought that hoster just banned or shutted down ur server when ddos is starting
15:59 <@deen> not when it starts
15:59 <@deen> but when the traffic gets too high
16:00 <@deen> i guess that means > 10 gbit/s
16:00 <@deen> last 11 days had DDoS attacks
16:00 <@deen> hm
16:00 <@deen> before that we were 1 month DDoS free
16:01 < EastBite> hm I guess the strength of ovh plans is that you have a nearly unlimited number of fallback ips (for dedicated servers)
16:02 <@deen> EastBite: they have good ddos protection from what i heard
16:02 < EastBite> it has been included to every plan last year
16:02 <@deen> yeah, I'd get a VPS classic 3
16:02 <@deen> with 3 cores
16:02 <@deen> but I'm not sure if i should do that now
16:03 < EastBite> I got one of those cheap dedicated servers for 5eur/month :)
16:03 <@deen> 10 TB traffic for 2,40 € is pretty nice too
16:03 <@deen> ddnet RUS has unlimited traffic for 5 €
16:03 < EastBite> hm I don't have a traffic limit
16:04 <@deen> EastBite: on OVH?
16:04 < EastBite> yes
16:04 <@deen> it says "guaranteed 100 Mbit/s up to 10 TB, afterwards 1 Mbit/s"
16:04 < EastBite> hmm did they change it?
16:04 <@deen> maybe
16:04 <@deen> maybe they just don't enforce it
16:05 < EastBite> I need to check what I have there xd
16:06 < Qwzor> if talking about maney then DO is nice
16:06 <@deen> DO?
16:07 < Qwzor> digital ocean
16:11 < EastBite> deen: https://eastbit.net/priv/dedi.png
16:12 <@deen> ah, dedicated
16:12 <@deen> I thought you have a VPS
16:12 < Qwzor> it's interesting how datafabrik wants to make ddos protection. If they will get a lot of traffic, then their network just can be banned by DC-provider
16:12 < EastBite> okay
16:12 <@deen> EastBite: kimsufi?
16:12 < EastBite> well, I wouldn't own it if it wouldn't cost 5eur/month
16:12 < EastBite> ya
16:12 < EastBite> I'm a lucky guy
16:13 <@deen> Yeah, I nearly bought a kimsufi for ddnet
16:13 <@deen> but i can't choose the location
16:13 < EastBite> that's the only reason for a vps?
16:13 <@deen> Qwzor: dc-provider?
16:13 <@deen> EastBite: yes
16:13 < Qwzor> datacnter
16:13 <@deen> EastBite: better ping is pretty important for me
16:13 < EastBite> but on a vps youo can't even expect to have enough cpu time
16:14 <@deen> depends
16:14 <@deen> on KVM vps systems I never had a problem
16:14 < EastBite> hn
16:14 <@deen> which is why i run KVM exclusively now
16:14 < EastBite> everyone wants kvm :D
16:14 <@deen> yeah, it runs like a dedicated, but is cheaper
16:14 < EastBite> because providers can hardly cheat there
16:14 <@deen> but i noticed a problem with kvm
16:15 <@deen> you can't spread the network interrupts on multiple cores
16:15 <@deen> they always interrupt only at one core
16:15 <@deen> pretty bad for a ddos
16:15 < EastBite> oh
16:15 <@deen> expensive network cards can spread the load on all cores
16:16 < Qwzor> yes, you can;t because of virtion network card doesnt support it
16:16 < Qwzor> tvirtio*
16:16 < EastBite> well, but also noone would suggst you a vps for such a big event
16:16 < Qwzor> virtio*
16:16 <@deen> EastBite: what event?
16:16 < EastBite> tournaments
16:16 < EastBite> you tw hosting
16:16 <@deen> without ddos the tournaments would be 0 problem
16:16 <@deen> we could do 2000 players without lags on GER
16:16 < EastBite> right
16:17 < EastBite> but still it's a virtual private server
16:17 <@deen> dedicated is way too expensive
16:17 <@deen> especially in Frankfurt with DDoS protection
16:18 < EastBite> you colocate raspberry pis for free :P
16:18 < EastBite> can*
16:18 <@deen> i know
16:18 <@deen> edis.at
16:18 <@deen> i was with them in RUS and Chile
16:18 <@deen> but they lag way too much
16:18 <@deen> even with KVM
16:19 < EastBite> jep it was a joke
16:19 <@deen> and even better, they just stop my server when i have too much traffic going over the border...
16:19 <@deen> and too much means 1 Mbit/s
16:19 < EastBite> and that's is better then what?
16:20 <@deen> hm?
16:20 < EastBite> they are stopping your server instead of what?
16:21 <@deen> instead of limitting the traffic
16:21 < EastBite> ah okay
16:22 < EastBite> I'm really interested in how such a ddos protection works
16:22 < EastBite> from ovh for example
16:22 <@deen> not so well from what i heard^^
16:23 < EastBite> because you cannot detect that easily? :D
16:23 <@deen> I don't know
16:24 < EastBite> they need to do deep packet inspection on early nodes
16:25 <@deen> https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/anti-ddos/ddos-attack-management.xml
16:26 < EastBite> too much information
16:27 <@deen> ^^
16:34 < EastBite> so the traffic is being analysed seperately and at an attack a mitigation is triggered
16:34 < EastBite> and the vac thingie is doing that
16:35 <@deen> seems so
16:53 <@deen> meh
16:53 <@deen> the normal ddos protection takes 90 seconds to even start up @ OVH
17:07 < GoJEGrEEN> hi deen its back again
17:07 < Chicken_> hey
17:07 < GoJEGrEEN> i think its from spoof i dont know
17:08 <@deen> what's back?
17:08 <@deen> hi
17:08 <@deen> yeah, spoof protection is buggy
17:08 <@deen> i guess you have to disable it =/
17:09 < GoJEGrEEN> sv_max_clients is 64 but 
17:09 < GoJEGrEEN> only 10 tee can join server
17:09 < GoJEGrEEN> chicken tozih bede ke chi mishe
17:09 <@deen> disable sv_spoof_protection
17:09 < GoJEGrEEN> i think spoof must disable from cfg not in consol 
17:09 <@deen> both
17:09 <@deen> both works
17:10 < Chicken_> well, GoJE GrEEN ! Suddenly became invisible and he will be disconnected from the game
17:10 < Chicken_> but the tee is still there
17:10 < Chicken_> invisible tho
17:12 < GoJEGrEEN> omg
17:12 < GoJEGrEEN> after disconnect
17:12 < GoJEGrEEN> i try to join again
17:13 < GoJEGrEEN> but its impossible and The cpu usage got up into 100%
17:15 < GoJEGrEEN> deen
17:16 < Chicken_> GoJE asks you to come and see what's going on
17:17 < GoJEGrEEN> deen sv_spoof_protection 0 now but its still not work and  still spam and sv_max_clints change to 10 i confused
17:18 < GoJEGrEEN> i think sv_spoof_protection must be disable from cfg then run server
17:18 <@deen> Yes, I have seen this to
17:18 <@deen> Hm, ok =/
17:18 <@deen> you can try disabling it and restarting
17:18 <@deen> i hope it works
17:25 < Chicken_> there are some ghosts in the server xD
17:29 < GoJEGrEEN> deen
17:29 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/eyMbb3fp7752
17:30 < GoJEGrEEN> sv_rcon_password deen
17:30 < Savander> wow
17:30 < GoJEGrEEN> test it
17:30 <@deen> Savander: hm?
17:30 < Savander> persian blocker server
17:30 < Savander> Persion pro Blocker 
17:30 <@deen> i can't connect to it
17:30 < Savander> when trying to join
17:31 < GoJEGrEEN> only 10 tee can join the server :/
17:31 < GoJEGrEEN> deen
17:31 < GoJEGrEEN> see ur cpu
17:31 < GoJEGrEEN> usage
17:31 < Savander> weird ;o
17:31 < GoJEGrEEN> when try to connect 
17:31 <@deen> Yeah, it's broken spoof protection i think
17:32 <@deen> same happened on GER earlier
17:32 <@deen> then i disabled spoof protection
17:32 <@deen> and now it's fine i think
17:32 <@deen> but you need to restart server to get rid of ghosts
17:32 < GoJEGrEEN> spoof is 0 now but i think its need reset 
17:32 <@deen> yes
17:32 < GoJEGrEEN> :)
17:32 < GoJEGrEEN> yes
17:32 < GoJEGrEEN> k tnx 
17:32 < GoJEGrEEN> try to fix it
17:32 < GoJEGrEEN> great
17:33 <@deen> ?
17:34 < GoJEGrEEN> i mean spoof bug
17:34 <@deen> i don't like the spoof protection =/
17:34 < GoJEGrEEN> me 2
17:34 < GoJEGrEEN> :/ removed it
17:36 < GoJEGrEEN> i do reload server and its work now
17:37 <@deen> ok, good
17:39 <@deen> Hm, no
17:39 <@deen> it's also a bug in timeout protection i think...
17:40 < EastBite> hm
17:46 <@deen> ok, fixed it i think
17:47 <@deen> pretty big bug
17:47 < EastBite> I wanna check myself :D
17:47 <@deen> =
17:47 <@deen> ?
17:47 < EastBite> hm you didn't do the commit yet
17:47 <@deen> i did now
17:47 <@deen> i mean the bug had big implications
17:48 <@deen> not that it was many lines to fix
17:49 < EastBite> what do you need iostream for?
17:49 < EastBite> or did it fix a warning?
17:49 <@deen> eh
17:49 <@deen> forgot to save file^^
17:49 <@deen> i removed it
17:49 < EastBite> oh
17:50 < EastBite> :P
17:50 <@deen> happens to me all the time
17:50 < EastBite> in vim you see a small '+' which indicates it's not saved :D
17:50 <@deen> you think i look at it?^^
17:50 < EastBite> ya sure
17:50 <@deen> no time, have to restart servers quickly!
17:51 < EastBite> ^^
17:51 <@deen> the sv_shutdown_when_empty is great
17:52 < EastBite> yep
17:53 <@deen> now to restart servers i just need to do echo sv_shutdown_when_empty 1 > servers/*.fifo
17:53 < EastBite> you have a pipe for command input?
17:53 <@deen> yes
17:53 < EastBite> cool
17:53 <@deen> didn't like the econ
17:54 <@deen> so i made my own fifo
17:54 <@deen> without it most stuff on ddnet couldn't work
17:54 < EastBite> what else does use it?
17:55 <@deen> for example when i add new maps
17:55 <@deen> the votes are reloaded using the fifo
17:55 < EastBite> ah
17:55 <@deen> or tournaments are started like that
17:55 <@deen> international broadcasts
17:57 < EastBite> I always wondered about how the broadcasting works^^
17:58 <@deen> =)
17:58 <@deen> Or stuff like the 3d animated cube
17:58 <@deen> fishes flying across the screen
17:58 < EastBite> damn
18:23 < GoJEGrEEN> why minimum and maximum is 1 >? MACRO_CONFIG_INT(SvSpoofProtection, sv_spoof_protection, 0, 1, 1, CFGFLAG_SERVER, "Enable spoof protection")
18:23 <@deen> it's a bug
18:23 <@deen> you need to download new server version
18:23 <@deen> i fixed it
18:23 <@deen> sorry =/
18:24 < GoJEGrEEN> ok tnx deen
18:31 < GoJEGrEEN> now sv_spoof_protection work ok ? can i change it to still must be 0 ?
18:32 < GoJEGrEEN> change it to 1
18:32 < GoJEGrEEN> *
18:32 < GoJEGrEEN> or still must be 0 ?
18:36 <@deen> I'm not sure
18:36 <@deen> i have it on 0
18:36 <@deen> you can try 1
20:27 < EastBite> I'm starting to like nimrod
20:27 < EastBite> but that's actually normal when learning a new language
20:28 < EastBite> I just remembered that once I wanted to write a python like meta language for C
20:29 < EastBite> if I would have heard about nimrod back then :(
20:29 < EastBite> oh Teetime, didn't realize you are here :D
20:38 <@deen> =)
21:30 < Teetime> In theory I'm here but I'm busy with learning :)
21:43 < Savander> i want to be better
21:43 < Savander> :(
21:43 < Savander> ;c
21:43 < Savander> xD
