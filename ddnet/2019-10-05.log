11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 how dare you suggest @ChillerDragon try something before asking?
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ?xd
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is this some sort of joke im not getting
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's meant to refer to you always asking before you try anything or research
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nice github finally added troll emote
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/629969186994782209/unknown.png
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh thats so true @Learath2 but usually before opening a issue i do research
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> to make sure not a simple include is missing
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm guessing your compiler defaults to some old c++ standard
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and cmake has to tell it to use c++11 or sumsin
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i was searching ddnet6 cmake for that but didnt find it
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh btw @Learath2 send help on client coding. I am looking for a spot to do reset/initialize stuff. I want to requst gameinfo and cache the gametype until reload or reconnect or some other action that might change the gametype.
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe i shouldnt have done ``brew install gcc`` :troll:
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what version of gcc do you have?
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0xc000f> @ChillerDragon  i'm noob i know but i try to do my part xD, i try to talk with fanta today but it's disconected
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon why bother caching it?
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im not sure about requesting it every tick
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> for is zoom allowed check it worked fine but ddrace scoreboard was struggeling a lot
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> gcc --version
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> gcc (Homebrew gcc 5.5.0_4) 5.5.0

12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i wonder if any1 has ever written a working c compiler in shell :troll:
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Rant: I hate people who are late to things
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Friend says lets meet at 1300, still hasnt arrived and its 1500
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I spent 2 hours looking at reddit
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> </rant>
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This guy has the audacity to come 2 hours late and sit in front of me browsing his laptop
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> </followup-rant>
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> true friend
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> much wow dev rant btw xd
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> very relevant
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> Hi, why won't we add login/register and save user race maps on logged in username to prevent people from finishing maps for other people by changing their names?
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> First of all you'd already have thousands and thousands of "cheated" times alread
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> y
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> First of all you'd already have thousands and thousands of "cheated" times already
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> Idk about other reasons ask @jao
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> I'd want the same but I guess I will just be glad that I did everything myself
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> Yeah true, we can do a check for location and if IP of map finishes are in 2 or more different locations then we know it's a possibility of a cheated time
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> Haha imagine the work that d be
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> Unless the people stay in the same house
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> No way anybody would do that
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> Just right a bash script ðŸ™‚
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> So what about ppl who changed provider?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> What about ppl who finished on vacation
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> Doesnt work as ez as that
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> Tough luck ðŸ™‚
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> You'd need a fixed account system and ppl would still share
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> See you could do both a script and a fixed account system
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> Yet nobody would do that work
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> Nobody cares I guess
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> Some people are already famous for getting finishes so I guess you gotta live with that and accept it
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @upgradedspicy its not that we have a bunch of bored devs who want to implement a account system. And also how do you handle the existing username to new account matching?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> Yeah true , was just wondering
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if you want to remove finishing for other it sounds like blocking names. I dont see how that would be possible.
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Explain the 500 users who use nameless tee as their username that the cant play anymore
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> There will be more benefits to implementing account system, but I guess it's not required just a nice to have
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> It would ve been nice to have
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bacon> but I am afraid its too late for that
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> I understand ðŸ™‚
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @ChillerDragon lol obviously if we blocked name we wouldnt block nameless tee
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @upgradedspicy also we dont store ips for more than 24-48h so thats literally not possible
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so it would be excusive for a few players only? @snail and why store ips?
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there are 27 players who play active under the name NeXus Nexus etc. I know two Blue's and two ChillerDragons etc etc the list goes on.
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> two chillerdragons ðŸ˜‚
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you and your dummy
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> XDDD
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> me and the real one
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> he started playing a few years before i did and plays mainly nade based gametypes
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> Haha in the real world there can only be one ChillerDragon whoever registered first ðŸ™‚
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> your dummy is the real one?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @upgradedspicy yeah
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> thats how things work usually
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i dont see why that wouldnt work here
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rip Nexus
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> if ur name is taken just add a later or a character
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or you have a system like discord
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> chillerdragon#01
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yikes
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @jao ye too but imo tw is too small for that
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> It would work well, just  means everyone will start over with times
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> if we had accounts it would just straight up be better to have distinct names for everyone
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> kinda annoying for basic names tho
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> well thats how it worked in thousands of games
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and online stuff
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> tell me when the registration is open ima register them all and sell accs like Waschlappen/jail_did_snail_eleven/deen for much wowo big money
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> blizzard has battletags too
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> now yes
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but i.e in warcraft 3 they didnt
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> We can still allow basic names, there scores just won't be recorded, it will be like a guest user?
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> or WoW player names
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thats shit too
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> @ChillerDragon Hahaha
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you lose competitivity
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is this the account debate again?
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> classic
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> once a year someone has this great new idea of acc system
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> Why don't we use the accounts of the ddnet forum?
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nobody uses forum lol
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> @ChillerDragon Maybe it's time to pull up ours socks and start something
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fixed names: People can claim your name before you, you keep your points
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Non-fixed names: You get whatever name you want, we need to clear the ladder
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> some people in this community actually only play the game
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We talked about this like a billion times
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> @Learath2 What was the conclusion?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> People don't want to reset the ladder, nor do they want to risk losing their name
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @Learath2 bridge discord <=> ddnet account whe
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> when
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was implementing a non-fixed name account system, but people were so pissed about the ranks getting reset, I just got bored
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> How do we genuinely know who's name is the real name? Since a name doesn't belong to anyone with no account system
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's exactly the problem, it'd be first come first claim with fixed names
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and I don't want to do that
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What I was making was like steam, where your name doesn't matter but you can know who your friends are
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> also bridge steam acc into ddnet for acc system pls
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> lea
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And points obv belong to accounts
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> What about using email as unique instead of username
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but in top5 u see the screen name
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> rather than the account name?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i.e if account1 gets rank1 as Learath2 and account23 gets rank2 as Learath2 aswell, would ranks 1 and 2 both have same screen name?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> when u type /top5
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> If email is unique in registration and screen name and username could be the same or different that scenario would happen but not often @snail
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> What if we have two ladders? One for current system and one for new account system ðŸ™‚
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yeah thats always what i had in mind
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> legacy points
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and new system
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> Yes and we can display legacy points times in game, but have a nice website to display new system points and ranks etc
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but we already have so many point systems
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> top5 I didn't really think about, but the usual idea is to show the account name not the display name
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can't really beat fixed name systems in that regard
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but then you need to accept the risk of losing your name to someone like konsti
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> Don't think it will be the end of the world if you lose your name since you can always add a number
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @Learath2 because when u have an account name and an actual display name, ppl usually put random shit as account name
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> coz they only care about the display name
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we can put the
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> last remembered display name
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> [5:23 PM] upgradedspicy: Don't think it will be the end of the world if you lose your name since you can always add a number
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lol thats really lame
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tbh there is no great solution
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <upgradedspicy> Yeah true
18:46 <+Ryozuki> gimme ur acc
18:46 <+Ryozuki> or i haxx u
18:46 <+Ryozuki> numbers in name are ugly
18:46 <+Ryozuki> Learath2 why did u add a 2
18:53 <+Learath2> I always had the 2
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> so thats what this is all about
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> u still have the trauma when Learath was taken and u had to put a 2
