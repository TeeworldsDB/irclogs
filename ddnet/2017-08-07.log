01:07 <+laxa> deen: there is a mistake I can't look into to pull request, but windows build requests libopusfile.lib and the repo has opefile.lib
02:28 <+Henningstone> <Learath2> how is nimda supposed to stop anything if it +v's everyone so quickly? :P
02:28 <+Henningstone> apparently she does actually know whom to +v, because Condiment was ignored where Edible did get +v
02:28 <@Learath2> Henningstone: we had this conversation with heinrich5991 a couple of days ago
02:29 <@Learath2> guess Nimda has some kind of algorithm by which it determines who is worth
02:29 <@Learath2> y
02:30 <+Edible> first come first served then
02:30 <@Learath2> guessing ip close enough or exact matching user@host or simply all nicks that were here before the lockdown
02:30 <+Edible> same ip too
02:30 <@Learath2> or maybe it keeps a list of regulars
02:30 <+Edible> or maybe its about who's authed?
02:30 <@Learath2> no i saw it +v people who werent authed
02:31 <+Edible> oh, i'm not authed currently
12:48 <@Learath2> !ping
12:48 <@Nimda> Pong!

16:01 <+Ryozuki> hi
16:06 <@heinrich5991> hi
18:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> some guy is trying to connect to tw servers but it doesn't downloads the maps, his english is not so good, basically what happens to him is that map download doesnt starts https://youtu.be/h19cQW8NeqA?t=65 he made a video  xD
18:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @10100110101Hacker101101101011 you should try to speak this here, maybe they solve ur problem
18:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> or https://forum.ddnet.tw/

18:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> simple algo
18:34 <@deen> Learath2: ^ downloader problems
18:34 <@deen> Ryozuki: as a workaround the guy can disable http map download in settings -> ddnet
18:35 <@deen> he has a libcurl.dll.old lying around, maybe libcurl problems
18:36 <@deen> or permissions problem
18:38 <+Ryozuki> idk it would be to hard to explain this to him, maybe some russian can help him more
18:40 <+Ryozuki> hmm disabling http download doesn't work for him either
18:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜®

18:53 <@deen> how to enable the cmd window on windows again?
18:54 <@deen> cl_show_console 1
18:54 <@deen> restart client
18:54 <@deen> download map
18:54 <@deen> screenshot of look at black window
18:58 <@deen> but i think it's a general problem with saving anything, since it can't even save settings_ddnet.cfg?
18:59 <@deen> one of his bot clients might have made the entire teeworlds config directory read only
19:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> that's possible
19:09 <@deen> close steam
19:09 <@deen> i remember something about steam locking directories
19:09 <@deen> @10100110101Hacker101101101011
19:10 <+ddnet-discord> <10100110101Hacker101101101011> ok

19:10 <@deen> Send 5 Bitcoin to 1DwyLZZhrAXAm7bF1DYDL94pPR6cTSzSts
19:11 <@deen> close every other program you have, disable all autostart, reboot computer, reboot into recovery mode, reinstall windows, buy new computer, etc
19:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :<
19:13 <@deen> and don't install bots and "cool hacker tools" next time
19:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> police incoming
19:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ijo ijo
19:16 <+Ryozuki> woah bitcoin price is really high
19:16 <+Ryozuki>  $3,390.22 4.15%
19:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> imagine that you bought 100 bitcoins 6-7 years ago
19:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜®
19:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> RICH
19:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> sad i didn't
19:17 <@deen> imagine we live in the other universes where bitcoin failed within the last 6-7 years, POOR
19:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> xD
19:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> 5 bitcoin = 16950â‚¬, deen why would you need so much money? ^^
19:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 7 years ago, bitcoin was for few cents
19:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i don't think, That i would go bankrupt
19:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> 0.06â‚¬
19:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> right
19:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> that was bitcoin price
19:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> even 1000 bitcoins, don't seems to be so much ðŸ˜„
19:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> meh. I should be smarter! :<
19:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but i was 14
19:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> time to look at new cryptocoins and buy them ðŸ‘Œ
19:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> etherum is the thing now
19:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i saw
19:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> People says
19:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> "IT GONNA BEAT BITCOIN"
19:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe
19:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> mm etheurm is 266â‚¬
19:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> someday bitcoin will die because of its dificulty
19:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> (i think?)
19:23 <@deen> predicting the future is even more difficult
19:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yea
19:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> you think digital currencies are better than real money?
19:24 <@deen> me?
19:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yea
19:24 <@deen> I think they are a waste of energy and I won't support them
19:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i see :o
19:25 <@deen> people mostly use them for speculation right now, no one cares that you can only have very few transactions within a timespan and it takes long to verify
19:28 <@deen> (being a waste of energy is not bad in itself, consider trees that generate millions of pollen, thousands of seeds and still only generate a single other tree from that.)
19:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i'm not really into cryptocurrency, in fact i never did a transaction so i didn't know they were that slow
19:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 15 minutes i guess?
19:34 <@deen> yeah, something like that
19:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Like now, you are going to the shop
19:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> touch, DONE
19:34 <@deen> and Ethereum is REALLY funny
19:34 <@deen> where you can code a contract in something that looks like javascript
19:35 <@deen> because javascript is "cool"
19:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i see etherum heists in online news very frequently
19:35 <@deen> instead of just having a simple decision table that everyone could understand
19:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> "Ether Thief Remains Mystery Year After $55 Million Digital Heist" xD
19:35 <@deen> see obfuscated c contest for why this will be fun
19:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> that contest has nice ascii art
19:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> http://www.ioccc.org/
19:36 <@deen> wait, sorry, wrong contest
19:36 <@deen> I meant underhanded: http://www.underhanded-c.org/
19:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> :(
19:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> http://www.ioccc.org/2015/burton/prog.c
19:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> @deen  @Ryozuki checked his permissions he is owner of %APPDATA%\Teeworlds, deleting did not help, autoexec is being ignored, settings also the directory remains emtpy
20:13 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> Anyone want to write the map name here and maybe even add a picture? https://ddnet.tw/tournaments/
20:14 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> It's pretty easy: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/blob/master/www/tournaments/index.html
20:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> the name of the tournmap?
20:17 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> yes
20:17 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> and the small image from /ranks/maps/*.png
20:17 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> I think that would make it much easier to find the tournament you're looking for
20:24 <+Ryozuki> ill try to add names web scraping with python
20:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Guys, can you tell me how Teeworlds know that server have password or not?
20:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> where i can spot the code
20:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Who is responsible for that
20:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I remember that, heinrich has some kind of documentation about teeworlds protocol? no?
20:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> grep
20:40 <@deen> SERVER_FLAG_PASSWORD
20:40 <@deen> I guess
20:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/0.6/src/engine/shared/protocol.h#L79
20:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> this?
20:40 <@deen> yes
20:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> thanks
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i found it a second ago
20:41 <@deen> I just grepped for PASSWORD
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i can't grepp
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> never used it
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :/
20:41 <@deen> grep -r PASSWORD src
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no idea if i can on windows
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :/
20:41 <@deen> or "git grep PASSWORD"
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> git
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> oh
20:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> hmm
20:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> thank you ðŸ˜ƒ
20:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe i should learn a bit of that stuff
20:42 <@deen> 99% of cases where people ask "how to do X?" I just grep for X
20:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜®

20:42 <+Ryozuki> http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/grep.htm
20:43 <@deen> Ryozuki: meh, next you need sed and all the other unix shell tools
20:43 <@deen> IDEs can also search for patterns I guess
20:44 <+Ryozuki> you can download all gnu tools here https://sourceforge.net/projects/getgnuwin32/files/

20:45 <+Ryozuki> i got it :)
20:45 <@deen> with pipes?
20:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> tbh, i don't have teeworlds source at now
20:45 <@deen> also "last modified 2011-05-31"
20:45 <@deen> also "sourceforge"
20:46 <+Ryozuki> https://sourceforge.net/projects/getgnuwin32/
20:46 <+Ryozuki> this one is more recent
20:46 <+Ryozuki> 2016
20:47 <@deen> What about the linux-in-windows thingy? isn't that better?
20:47 <+Ryozuki> bash on ubuntu on windows
20:47 <@deen> mingw with pacman also looked reasonable for being on windows
20:47 <+Ryozuki> i prefer linux ofc
20:47 <+Ryozuki> but i like having things handy
20:48 <+Ryozuki> yes it supports piping
20:48 <+Ryozuki> im using cmder tho
20:50 <@deen> anyone built ddnet on the bsds recently?
20:51 <@deen> I hope we didn't add anything linux specific
20:51 <@deen> bsd people don't have many games to choose, someone should submit ddnet to their packages
20:51 <+Ryozuki> :/
20:52 <+Ryozuki> is there someone using bsd here?
20:52 <@deen> eeeee or fstd I think
20:52 <@deen> I used to run the ddnet server on my OpenBSD server a few years ago, used to work just fine
20:53 <@deen> libressl might require some #ifdefs
20:53 <@deen> or not, since curl will be fixed already on openbsd
20:59 <+fstd> Ryozuki: i run netbsd
20:59 <+eeeee> have heard you don't have many games to choose
21:00 <+eeeee> how do you live like that
21:00 <+Ryozuki> teeworlds is enough fun :)
21:01 <+eeeee> i once tried to use gentoo portage in cygwin on windows
21:02 <+eeeee> it was a really shit experience because portage chmods files all the time and that's a really expensive operation on ntfs
21:02 <+eeeee> other than that it worked suprisingly somewhat, actually managed to emerge some things
21:06 <+fstd> the cygwin terminal is soo slow
21:07 <+fstd> i bet that tripled the emerge time
21:07 <+fstd> slow wrt outputting text, i mean
21:12 <@deen> fstd: does the current cmake build of ddnet work?
21:14 <+fstd> no idea, i haven't built ddnet in a while (and when i did, i used bam)
21:14 <+fstd> i can test it when i have time
21:14 <+fstd> need to build cmake first, though.  i wonder what build system cmake uses
21:18 <@deen> the previous version of cmake until 10 years back which uses makefiles
21:18 <@deen> obviously
21:20  * fstd wants autotools teeworlds
21:20 <+fstd> </unpopular opinion>
21:22 <@deen> I don't like cmake, but I liked autotools even less
21:35 <+laxadedi> How to build sql release with cmake/make ?
21:35 <+laxadedi> bam build is broken on my end for sql, dunno why and what changed, too lazy to look into that especially since bam is going to be removed
21:41 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Laxa opened pull request #839: fix bam windows build (master...fixwinbuild) https://git.io/v76vB
21:47 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #839: fix bam windows build (master...fixwinbuild) https://git.io/v76vB
21:47 <@deen> laxadedi: cmake . -DMYSQL=ON
21:48 <+laxa> btw, this should probably be on README
21:48 <@deen> sure, add it
22:02 <+laxa> rcon password config changed on ddnet ? I mean, the option to setup rcon password in config files ?
22:02 <@deen> yes
22:03 <@deen> python scripts/hash_passwords.py
22:03 <@deen> create a separate account for each person
22:03 <@deen> and write down those things for README, everything that's unclear
22:03 <+laxa> yeah...
22:04 <@deen> then we can just link other people to that instead of explaining again and again
22:04 <+laxa> I'll probably stop hosting an empty ddnet server :(
22:04 <+laxa> I don't wanna spend 30/60 minutes finding out what changed everytime I update my server sadly
22:05 <+laxa> Don't know people actually having an instance of SQL ddnet running
22:08 <+laxa> There is no way to have an rcon password oldschool way ?
22:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yes in the autoexec
22:10 <+laxa> "old way" is 'sv_rcon_password password'
22:10 <+laxa> that doesn't seems to work anymore
22:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> login: empty
22:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then password
22:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no?
22:39 <+laxa> there is not even a login prompt, just a password one
22:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> sv_rcon_password "mypass"
22:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> works for me
22:54 <+laxa> ah I know why x)
23:14 <@deen> laxa: so we have to stop development so that no one has to update anything? or what's the solution here?
23:15 <+laxa> Well, I know you always try to "not break things" and try to keep ddnet as close as how teeworlds is
23:15 <+laxa> I don't know the proper way beside having warnings when something change I guess
23:16 <+laxa> but right now I dunno if it's my scripts/setup that makes it fail or not
23:17 <+laxa> Like you use a software for years, you just update it from time to time, you don't take the time to read the changelog (that's my bad I guess), and something doesnt work anymore, it's kind of frustrating to spend time trying out to figure why.
23:19 <+laxa> yeah, I know what changed

23:20 <+laxa> ddnet probably setting cwd as ../binary/ instead of the actual one
23:21 <+laxa> that's why it's failing loading my common.cfg that holds the rcon_password
23:21 <@deen> no, we forbid ..
23:21 <@deen> security risk
23:22 <+laxa> alright, I kind of disagress about that, it should be the admin/hoster responsibility
23:22 <@deen> how so?
23:22 <+laxa> well, if I fuck up my host/path/rights, then it's my own fault, not the software faults
23:23 <@deen> meh, so I need to make sure that every ddnet server that we run runs as its own user or in a sandbox?
23:23 <@deen> if you want to include .., you can add it as a path in storage.cfg
23:23 <+laxa> Hum, I don't see how this is a security risk exactly
23:23 <+laxa> because of admins ?
23:24 <@deen> yes, ingame admin can use exec or change_map with any path
23:24 <+laxa> I'll use absolute path, I guess it's overall better security, I agree
23:24 <+laxa> Hum right, then okay, I see your point :)
23:24 <@deen> exec /etc/passwd is fun too
23:24 <@deen> i don't think ingame admins should have that kind of access by default
23:25 <@deen> it's like a limited remote shell
23:25 <+laxa> but they still can do exec /etc/passwd without ..
23:25 <@deen> Especially since we host trashmap where everyone can be admin
23:25 <@deen> we also forbid absolute paths
23:25 <+laxa> so, exec does'nt work anymore ?
23:25 <@deen> only paths listed in storage.cfg are allowed
23:26 <+laxa> ah, nice
23:26 <@deen> so if you want your admins to access /, then add_path / and use relative paths from there
23:27 <@deen> accessing nuclear servers with our future tournament servers with change_map was also fun
23:27 <@deen> tournament maps*
23:28 <@deen> and of course going on test server, but execing the regular cfg to find out the mod password there
23:29 <+laxa> ok fixed finally
23:29 <@deen> next time you update and something doesn't work, check the log file
23:29 <@deen> it should tell you where it failed
23:29 <+laxa> I did, but later on
23:30 <+laxa> Well, thanks for your time and sorry for being annoying :)
