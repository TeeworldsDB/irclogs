00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I set the SpawnPos in TryRespawn() to `vec2()` and then removed the gamecontroller checking xD Now I respawn somewhere around here

00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Really funny that the tee doesnt get rendered correctly at this point xD
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xxxd
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Wp fokko
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Does someone know who made fng? And where to find the source code
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=7868
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> fstd i think
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> OpenFNG is more or less a free clone of FNG, a modification of teeworlds, apparently written by some "TOM".
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fstd/teeworlds/blob/openfng/readme.txt
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> However, OpenFNG does not contain any of the original FNG source, neither was it used as a template for writing this.
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So yes, loltext is by fstd
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but the fng2 lasertext seems to be different than loltext, so maybe that one is by juppey?
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> haha @onbgy is violating openFNG terms :troll:
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i never wondered why it is open fng seems to be related to open source
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> "Whoever modifies the OpenFNG code , is required to make his changes to the source code available to others" @onby
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i guess ill credit fstd for the loltext array anyways
04:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> noby doesnt use openfng
04:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also his mod is more or less own made, he only used golden spike ideas from fng2
04:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and yes i used fstds lol text and upgraded it a bit
04:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and yes i used fstds lol text and upgraded it a bit(i got inspired ;DD)
04:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i also took the smooth freeze mode from fng2
04:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and fng2 doesnt have that rule, so its fine ;P
04:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> :feelsamazingman:
04:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And I took juppeys great loltext
04:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and i credited u and fstd
04:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Can someone tell me why I cannot use a pointer to `m_apPlayers[DummyID]` in this function? It will crash. https://github.com/fokkonaut/BlockDDrace/blob/master/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L4001
05:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, It will crash if I create the pointer before I create the new CPlayer, but still, why doesnt that work? It should override it, shouldnt it?
05:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `CPlayer* pDummy = m_apPlayers[DummyID] = new(DummyID) CPlayer(this, DummyID, TEAM_RED);`
05:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this works^
05:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```CPlayer *pDummy = m_apPlayers[DummyID];
05:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>     m_apPlayers[DummyID] = new(DummyID) CPlayer(this, DummyID, TEAM_RED);```
05:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this doesnt
07:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @Jupstar ✪ whos right me or foko
07:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/610348821183987722/Screen_Shot_2019-08-12_at_12.46.34_AM.png
07:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> smooth freeze mode is for antiping players to hook their frozen tees
07:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> so the frozen guy cant shake
07:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ?
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I know that this is the case, the only thing I said is that it works on DDrace, even without such a smooth option, so fng does something different than DDrace. Nothing more.
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Very funny that you insult me and say I shall not insult you and then I get a ban, because you are too stupid to understand, that I only made a statement.

08:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> pretty valid response when someone comes to my server and insults me
08:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
08:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/610352737460158464/unknown.png
08:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> for no reason
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You started this lol
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u joined my server just to shit talk
08:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what did i say lol
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I said, "oh unsmooth freeze", and then i said "probably just because of my ping"
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u tell me im doing something wrong
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wrong
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i said fng does something different
08:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> grow up noby
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in the end you abused rcon because childs do that
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> cry more
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i tried to show u what smooth freeze does on the other server
08:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i proved it did exactly what i said and u r wrong
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> then u start shittalk
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So just giving a statement is shittalk, good job noby
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/610353129707536395
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u kept calling me ignorant for telling u how my own server works
08:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I called you ignorant 1 time
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> for no reason tho
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, because you just responded wtf shut up i know how my server works
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> even tho i said fng does something different with freeze
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and then i said try it out, go on ddrace, ddrace is better anyways
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and you banned me
08:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So I guess, you are immature at this point. You couldnt hold this conversation without insulting, wtf, or other childish words
08:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lmao
08:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> stop wasting my time
08:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah correct, lmao was another one, or lmfao
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> now i waste your time, because you see that i am right
08:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and you think i should have not posted this on discord, because everybody sees i am a retard now
08:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> eh i posted it to ask the creator of this feature what it was for
08:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> since we both thought the other person was wrong
08:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> then u started being toxic and ye idc now
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I know that I was wrong in the beginning, but after that I just said on ddrace it works without a smooth option, and YOU started being toxic
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I can copy the whole conversation for you if you want
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> your caps lock messages and lmao, wtf and stuff is pissing me off at that point, aswell as stfu and dont insult me even tho i did nothing
08:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> why you both cut out timestamp
08:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i guess it is shorter
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> but then its harder to crop
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ? no
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> to purposely cut out the time :thonkery:
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> my client doesnt show timestamps in f1
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> bot
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u didnt admit u were wrong u just said "oh well looks like fng is just gay"
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lool
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> before that you said "you are just retarded"
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ofc i will answer toxic then
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> well have u tried not being retarded
08:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, have you tried being mature
08:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yeah it didnt work
08:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> cus u woudnt listen
08:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, you havent
08:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ok then
08:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ew closed source

09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Lmao. Thanks for the entertainment here😂
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 🍿
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Rip @onbgy starts to ban free speech
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Since when is insulting staff a ban reason
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its not my main server
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Was it ddnet ?
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its usa solo
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Wat? xd
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Solo fng!
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oh true how didn’t I notice the screenshots
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> xd
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if it was main serv i wouldve just muted him ig
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> still a: buse
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but hes annoying
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [3:55 AM] ChillerDragon: Was it ddnet ?
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> actualy huh good point well if the usa fng is listed on ddnet and theres a problem i wouldnt mind it being removed since its not the main server, i use it for testing antibot with ppl and testing maps with other ppl, and other reasons
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut it's probably @onby not sending the new objects that improve freeze prediction a lot
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thought that too
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its old fng2 code that sends fake tuning
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> so that players who shake with a+d while frozen wont shake on the screens of unfrozen antiping players
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I were you i'd have kept it easy to merge ddnet back in
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby the new objects take care of all of that and you don't have to bother with the faketune
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> what is the advantage to doing it this way rather than the fng2 way
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well at the very least fokkonaut felt the difference
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> he just didnt understand what it was supposed to do
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> stop talking bullshit
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i guess in ddrace it does something different
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Stop arguing about it?
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yes
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> noby just stop thanks
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby with the object all the characters know the freeze state of all the other characters
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So everything is predicted properly
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> oh cool
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It also takes care of most of the other character variables
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i think it was only added for the purpose of preventing the shaking in fng
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you branched from ddnet after the protocol extension it should be relatively easy to add in the new netobjects
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> what version was the extension in
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 644b0ae61d4bce27e888c4df18b8edb029bde6dc
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> eh i meant like 10.x
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm I don't remember what was out in 2017
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 10.6
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 10.6 got released on 15th may 17
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That commit is 22 May
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 10.6.1 got released on 1 july
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but i doubt this was added in a minor patch version
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> probably the pull request was merged later
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> my server is based on ddnet 10.8.6
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but idk if ive accidentally broke anything that would make merging that difficult
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so it does have the extension, you just need to add the ddnet character or try to make that auto patch
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I like new ddnet char and explayer
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ez too extend

15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <skua> could we have a help screen in editor or smth. It turns out that many expereinced mappers don't know about this extremely useful feature (ofc because it's not documented anywhere)

16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @skua it's a lot of work with the teeworlds interface code
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not like we have an interface designer to quickly whip sth like that up 😄
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bob_fasul> @skua note that you can also press shift + click on the group to select all layers of that group.... Also, open issue about the ux on GitHub?
