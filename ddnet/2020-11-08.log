00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That explains why it left 4 bytes (G,L,O,\0) on 32bit and 8 bytes on 64bit. It was the size of the pointer that we got with sizeof(aBuf)
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> true
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> clang-tidy 12 reports alot of stuff more xd
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but seems like they are mostly useless
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```

00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> had to add
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>   -bugprone-reserved-identifier*,
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>   -misc-no-recursion,`
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, that's normal, they add new checks, we have to look into them.
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's why I prefer to enable all and disable a select few
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```

00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> only annoying thing is that clang-format 12 always does things different
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, we'd have to enforce same version for everyone
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well its happening appearently bcs we don't set a column limit
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and clang 12 just assumes a smaller limit
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen are you typing the whole changes by hand?
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wow
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sometimes I just take the PR title, sometimes I change it a bit to make it clearer
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah Use pointer direectly for tile layer building ðŸ˜„
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and try to order them by importance, roughly
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah "Use pointer direectly for tile layer building" ðŸ˜„
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> didnt even notice the version got such big
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> felt like 99% was just fixing asan stuff xD
02:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao's hairy kebab> downloading ddnet-info.json failed and cfg wiped to default
02:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao's hairy kebab> how fix
03:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 are you online?
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> barely
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just about to go sleep
03:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 do the servers restart automatically at some point?
03:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes, when they are empty after midnight
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so eventually they already restarted?
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs i think we have a major bug
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> empty ones should have
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh no
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> spawnpoints aren't loaded anymore
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm so tired, this what I don't need
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its not a critical security wise
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also, do they even recompile themself?
03:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno if deen already compiled them to the newest version
03:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> will make a pr quickly so u see the problem
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if the servers are on a later version it doesnt matter
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then deen can fix it
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if the servers are on a older version it doesnt matter
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª yes, luckily I wasn't running latest version on server
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok ðŸ˜„
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Hi, is there any way to fix Quads? (white line at top)
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/774941154210349056/screenshot_2020-11-05_12-02-30.png
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Sadly no
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> That's one of the vanilla thingies
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> You can fix it by hand
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @mind is your plan to repeat them?
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> You can increase the upper UV coordinates and lower the bottom ones
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Ok thx for Info. I know about some workarounds, but they may create visual bugs on other positions of the quad.
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Like if you move the image in the quad up, you can't properly align another quad at the bottom anymore, so instead of having a line at the top it will be on the bottom.
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Yeah not possible
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Quads are also not MIP map aware
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> If we would have a flag for clamping coordinates it would be easy
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> You can ask in vanilla discord if they add it, then we could too I guess
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 0.6 vanilla client is probably pretty dead anyway
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Else u have to use a tile layer xd
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @mind hold shift, mark both upper red dots and drag it a little bit down
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> there won't be any line at the bottom
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @mind right click on the upper dots and set Tex V to 1
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Omg thank you very much @Lady Saavik
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Also removes lines at the bottom by decreasing Tex V by 1 at bottom corners.
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's always these changes that seem so obvious that contain the bugs :<
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> > help i cant spawn in my map on my lan srv even tho there are spawns and nothing is blocking them
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> seems to be only on new ddnet server version
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think its a bug
16:13 <+ChillerDragon> feature
16:13 <+ChillerDragon> do other maps work?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> fixed already
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 is it possible to display the github messages on irc as well?
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not that I'm aware of
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just watch the repos on github and you get email notifs
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> at least that's what I use and just skip the github messages in here
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> same
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <PopCorn181> When you press windows key in the editor, then when you click onto the game again the mouse completely disappears!  It is a rly annoying bug.

22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah always when i tried to debug in couldnt get he bug xD
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah always when i tried to debug in couldnt get the bug xD
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> There is an #bugs channel btw
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <PopCorn181> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/775109404126216212/343689783987666945.png
