16:19 < o_be_two> hello :)
16:20 <@EastByte> hiho
16:20 < o_be_two> well i think it will be hard to get an anti-ddos game profile for TW :/
16:21 < o_be_two> but in arbor, should be possible, i'm waiting my grants ^^
16:21 <@EastByte> what did the devs say?
16:21 < o_be_two> btw i havent got enough time to work on my game dedi, i'm really busy /
16:22 < o_be_two> well it's cause for tilera it needs dev, but devs are busy on other projects and a game with only like 4 to 10 customers is not enough to care about it
16:51 <@deen> so i have an offer for a server in iran that will not be ddosed
16:52 <@deen> or so the guy claims, but wants money for it
16:52 <@deen> sounds suspicious to me
16:52 < Learath2> well why would he give a free server away ?
16:52 <@deen> "sponsoring"
16:53 <@deen> I'm just suspicious when someone I've never seen has an intricate knowledge of how we get DDoSed and offers a solution for some payment
16:58 < Learath2> oh he probably is the guy ddosing us
17:00 < o_be_two> stay careful :/
17:03 < Learath2> how is it sponsoring if we are paying for it :P
