19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how do you search for someone with special character?
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> type in the special character
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> how you do that?
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> find their name
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> tab them in ddnet
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or just tell them to change name cuz special characters are pain in the ass
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 can you please try to debug the replays? @Neb seems to get 0 byte ones, I don't really see what's going wrong
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I think it's that bug I identified a week ago, couldn't get to fixing it yet ðŸ˜¦
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> hmm
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> yep me too
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> that's weird tho
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> i'll try to see what's happenin
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's the demorecorder doing the map lookiup wrong iirc
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why does it lead to a 0 bytes demo?
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> because we aren't handling the error correctly
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> slice starts the demorecorder but if it fails it just returns, but at that point the demorecorder has already created the new demo, 0bytes
