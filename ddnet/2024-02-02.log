09:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I can put user input into my sql statement if this regex matches without having to worry about bobby tables right? ``/^[a-z]+$/``

10:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> you can put any user input into your database using a proper library/driver that is able to correctly escape your input. what you should not do is constructing the sql with the user input by hand.
10:23 < bridge> <jxsl13> using positional parameters `$1, $2` or non positional `?` (not supported by PostgreSQL)
10:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> sometimes it's still ok to construct sql but with highly validated inputs like integers or strings that can only be one of a predefined set of strings, etc.
10:27 < bridge> <jxsl13> imo that regex would not fall under that latter category.
10:29 < bridge> <Ewan> hi ryo
10:29 < bridge> <Ewan> is the rust book a modern resource i should use to learn rust
10:29 < bridge> <Ewan> or old
10:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> it's the bible, I guess
10:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> asking if there is anything else is already blasphemy
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> If you ask me it's not worth it too much. Maybe to get a basic feeling, but generally learning by doing is still the best.
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> You should be open to redactor your code multiple times to improve it and/or try different ways to solve the same problem
10:38 < bridge> <Ewan> ya

12:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>  I'm thinking about stop sponsoring chn servers recently
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> You don't have to. Does it have a different reason than money?
12:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> money isn't really a issue tbh lmao
12:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> there are just way too many people with way too much free time here to block to fake to apply mod just to mess with me
12:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and those chinese ip changers/proxies are actively ignoring our request to stop supporting ddnet. made everything more difficult
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> So you are unhappy being a mod?
12:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> scratch all that, i think i'm just depressed lmao
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ah
12:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm not even modding
12:13 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> U mean actively hosting the server
12:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> well i'm not really doing anything other than providing the server
12:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it started to feel like everyone just playing for griefing now
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Rip
12:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> its the best
12:14 < bridge> <TsFreddie> or maybe only checking report channel is not good for mental
12:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft dont listen to jupstar, he thinks the rust book is like the old rusty books of coding
12:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its just a big big tutorial on rust
12:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> its literally the best resource to learn rust
12:15 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean it is called rust book
12:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> also next time ping me or i miss ur msg xd
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft more resources, but book is ur primary:
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> - https://cheats.rs/ cheatsheet, its epic
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> - https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> - https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> the cheatsheet looks like this

12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> sweet
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> i will check it out tomorrow
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> do it now
12:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I disagree it doesn't teach you lot of best practices
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust cant wait
12:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It's an introduction nothing now
12:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> More
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> and he needs that as first
12:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> And I wrote that
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> then we are all in agreement
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> lets all dance

12:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But good day to start rust
12:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ffr
12:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @mpft learn proc macros. Important
12:26 < bridge> <remakepower> Why don't we include NETMSGTYPE_SKINCHANGE from 0.7.3 to make sixup better
12:26 < bridge> <remakepower> Why don't we include NETMSGTYPE_SV_SKINCHANGE from 0.7.3 to make sixup better
12:26 < bridge> <remakepower> Why don't we include NETMSGTYPE_SV_SKINCHANGE and NETMSGTYPE_CL_SKINCHANGE from 0.7.3 to make sixup better
12:33 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think sixup haven't been a priority for a very long time
12:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also you can always pr

13:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> ye i'll stop sponsoring ddnet chn starting in june
13:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i already sent out a post asking more people to donate servers

13:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u know about this kernel option
13:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah this sucks
13:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is it possible to run ddnet using i3-dmenu-desktop? :thonk:
13:49 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I hope you'll still be around sharing cool stuff (unless that burns you out too)
13:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I'm not familiar with that (I am with dmenu)
13:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> when have i ever shared anything cool lol
13:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but ye, i'll be around
13:51 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :)
13:51 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'll still handle mod and community
13:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> maybe get someone else to watch over, but it is hard to find someone you trust to just hand everything over
13:52 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not that I technically own anything but still
13:53 < bridge> <meloÆž> my pc just got delayed for another week
13:53 < bridge> <meloÆž> im gonna cry
13:53 < bridge> <meloÆž> what am i even paying 2.4Kâ‚¬ for, if it takes 2 week to arrive
13:53 < bridge> <ikeed> u can only have chinese mods, right?
13:53 < bridge> <meloÆž> i want that shit to be airdropped within 2 hours at my doorstep man, its 2024 for nothing >:(
13:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I handle chinese mod application, but I personally have mod just like other mods
13:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't use them tho, cuz i don't really play ddnet since i started working
13:54 < bridge> <ikeed> nah i meant fng
13:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't think noby host fng on our servers anymore
13:55 < bridge> <ikeed> lets go pm
13:56 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> @milkeeycat is like a i3 .desktop launcher with dmenu as interface?
13:56 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> @milkeeycat is it like a i3 .desktop launcher with dmenu as interface?
13:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yea
13:57 < bridge> <remakepower> This bad news make almost all of the CHN players surprised, i think so
13:57 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ig you should make a .desktop file for ddnet then
13:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have it xD
13:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but it doesnt launch ddnet ðŸ˜¦
13:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i yoinked it from ddnet website
13:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ```

14:00 < bridge> <remakepower> I remember that there is a DDNet.desktop in the "other" directory
14:00 < bridge> <meloÆž> the good old "urmom" user
14:00 < bridge> <meloÆž> the good old "urmom" directory
14:01 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> does it throw an error or smt?
14:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> nothing
14:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i can run it by typing ddnet:// in firefox tho Xd
14:02 < bridge> <learath2> It's new. I just enabled it with my last kernel upgrade, but idk if anything uses it yet
14:02 < bridge> <furo321> You can do `sudo make install` in your build directory, and it will install the .desktop file.
14:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it works :p
14:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and it install shit tons of files
14:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and it installed shit tons of files
14:07 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ig the problem was it couldn't find the `DDNet` programm in path
14:08 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> but shouldn't the `Path=` do that (set the cwd to the one specified)
14:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it was using the same path for custom protocol whatever that thing is called
14:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and it worked
14:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is there sudo make uninstall? :justatest:
14:10 < bridge> <furo321> Nope :^)
14:11 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> maybe you could see the logs (it it outputs that) to what and where it was installed
14:11 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> (the ouput of `sudo make install`)

14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xd
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> not so hard xd
14:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> can u resize it?
14:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> cant u resize it?
14:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can resize it in the bottom right corner. but why is it not usable by default?
14:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think sometimes it resizes itself
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yep for me it doesnt remember the resize
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so every time i edit i get small ugly editbox
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in this comment its not even as bad.. if u have wall of text, it's horrible
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> wtf?
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> where did u buy
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> is some piece of hardware not in stock or what

14:45 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
14:45 < bridge> <meloÆž> and yes they delayed it because of the case - even tho i said idgaf send me one where everything fits
14:45 < bridge> <meloÆž> they didnt
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u can ask them to cancel only the case and buy a new one
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or switch to a cheaper or equal expensive one
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but i guess cancel would mean u dont get free shipping right? ðŸ˜„
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that sucks ofc
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i think only 150â‚¬+ is free at mindfactory
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and only from 0-6 o'clock xDD
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> weirdest rule

14:53 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hello there
14:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i change a player color? i know i need to change this 
14:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
14:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> pPlayer->m_TeeInfos.m_ColorFeet = someint
14:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
14:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but i don't know how to convert a hsla to int
14:55 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i change a player feet color? i know i need to change this 
14:55 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
14:55 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> pPlayer->m_TeeInfos.m_ColorFeet = someint
14:55 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
14:55 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but i don't know how to convert a hsla to int
15:38 < bridge> <murpi> The combination of VSCode and an extension that formats my code automatically when saving and pushing commits to GitHub doesn't work so well ðŸ‘€
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> what part exactly does not work
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u have to set the formatter and also activate format on save
15:39 < bridge> <murpi> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/pull/285
15:39 < bridge> <murpi> S Tier indenting
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> rip
15:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> glorious
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> do you use prettier?
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i wonder if that even works for native html
15:41 < bridge> <murpi> Yes
15:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it does
15:42 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oops i was late
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mhh
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that should normally work well on vscode
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but never used it with html tho
15:44 < bridge> <meloÆž> big fan
15:50 < bridge> <murpi> I mean it does work, I'd even say it's easier to read now, buuut if I'd were to change even more files, finding my changes would be like finding a needle in a haystack ðŸ˜„
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u could format all in one commit, add your changes ontop of those
15:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea. that's bad. please don't mix reformatting with actual changes
15:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't see a good way to see what changed
15:57 < bridge> <murpi> Can you help me fix that? ^^
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> is your diff big?
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> your actual diff
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> your changes
16:03 < bridge> <murpi> I'd say no, maybe 500 lines
16:03 < bridge> <murpi> it's mostly just text
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mh you could try make a second branch, only do the formatting and try to merge your other branch on it
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but no idea how likely collisions are
16:05 < bridge> <murpi> I don't want to format the code at all xd
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well that's too late xd
16:06 < bridge> <murpi> I'd checkout the earlier commit and then redo the changes, without reformatting and just force push
16:06 < bridge> <murpi> the changes -> my changes
16:06 < bridge> <murpi> Does that not work?
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes but sounds like lot of work
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's basically as starting from new or not
16:07 < bridge> <murpi> No, the PR has multiple commits, and the last one can be redone fairly quickly
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ah ok
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> git rebase --interactive HEAD~2
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then put e for edit into the last one or d for drop
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> when u done:
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> git commit --amend
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> git rebase --continue
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in case of edit xd
16:33 < bridge> <murpi> oh my gawd why is this so hard
17:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> some get melons, others get potatoes.
17:07 < bridge> <jxsl13> it might be possible to do but you will not like the verbosity of the sql statement. Alternatively, you could have a single table that has a column that you use for switching between contexts.
17:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> format on save is evil

17:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @murpi I can fix it later
17:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, you're already on it
17:32 < bridge> <murpi> already done ðŸ‘€
17:32 < bridge> <murpi> (I think)
17:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-396
18:03 < bridge> <furo321> Why do some config variables have zero for both min and max? Like `sv_port` for example.
18:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that declares a config variable without limits
18:05 < bridge> <furo321> Seems kinda confusing, also shouldn't `sv_port` have a limit in this case? e.g. 1-65535
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> do pr, get fame
18:08 < bridge> <robyt3> Would be cleaner to use `INT_MIN` and `INT_MAX` instead of `0` for variables without limits
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> would be cleaner to have proper type support ðŸ˜¬
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> NonZerou16
18:10 < bridge> <robyt3> Also, the server doesn't seem reachable when you use `sv_port -1000`, no idea what port it tries to bind to
18:12 < bridge> <reitw> Lol wut
18:12 < bridge> <reitw> Tbh sound is already great in factorio
18:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> what xd
18:12 < bridge> <robyt3> Ah, obviously I should just literally connect to `localhost:-1000` and that works?? :monkalaugh:
18:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
18:12 < bridge> <robyt3> `resolved connect address 'localhost:-1000' to [::1]:64536` facinating
18:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if its in rust source but rust defines u64::MAX to -1
18:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> atleasdt its what rust-analyzer hover showed lol
18:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> try one that overflows u16 to 0
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or to a used port
18:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's just cast to a u16
18:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust

18:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
18:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder what the macro does
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> uff the rust png crate compresses extremly bad
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1203025719798796378/image.png?ex=65cf9802&is=65bd2302&hm=3274a5414bf91da3cc57b7bcfafce1a546e179d9c7d6a442ea5659554357462f&
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> someone expert?
18:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so 0 will let the OS select a port
18:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and every other port is just that modulo 65536
18:15 < bridge> <robyt3> `E server: couldn't open socket. port 64536 might already be in use` looks like it does module
18:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> that font color kills me
18:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's the type cast that does the implicit modulo
18:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we're putting it into a u16 somewhere
18:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> our int
18:16 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, `NETADDR` uses `short`
18:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> a C style cast from uint to int is not ub right?
18:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats ub is overflows
18:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> man where is voxel when u need him xd
18:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder if we can find any under or overflows
18:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks try https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng
18:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> uint to int is fine, I think
18:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> -o max
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @pipou_tw do you remember what optimizations you ran on top of arctic frost?
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> like any optimizer that uses a higher compression level?
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> // Used because the `?` operator is not allowed in a const context.
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> macro_rules! try_opt {
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki>     ($e:expr) => {
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki>         match $e {
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki>             Some(x) => x,
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki>             None => return None,
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki>         }
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki>     };
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> }
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> is it blazingly fast?
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i am just impressed that an embedded deflate compression beats the png encoder of rust's png crate xD
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> allegedly the fastest i could find in rust
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so either that map resources were compressed with some expensive optimization or the compression sucks hard
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe png is made to be fast and processing pngs? not compressing idk
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> make a pr
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> (embedded tw map images)
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> normally png has some optimizations for better results, e.g. transforming the image in a lossless way, and using zopfli i get insane size diffs
18:21 < bridge> <pipou_tw> I have no idea what you are talking about
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ```
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Optimizing Santa_Factory1.png
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Input size: 528347 (515K)
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Result size: 74757 (73K). Percentage of original: 14.149%
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ```
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 14% of original xd
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> do you use some kind of map optimizer tool?
18:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> serde also uses a try macro because it was faster ðŸ˜¦
18:21 < bridge> <pipou_tw> No, why ðŸ˜®
18:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> because it compiles faster* or it is faster at runtime?
18:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc serde does the impossible to compile fast
18:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> faster at runtime
18:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (but also at compile-time)
18:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's the asterisk doing there? ðŸ™‚
18:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks oxipng uses zopfli
18:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> `oxipng = { version = "9.0", features = ["parallel", "zopfli", "filetime"], default-features = false }`
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i am experimenting with how a map format would look like if it could have other compression algorithms and other benefits like not storing images inside the map itself.
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I was just wondering why arctic frost is pretty good compression wise
18:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> nice, but zopfli is very very slow, i'd like to have a good default one
18:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but still maybe nice as a "optimized" save or smth
18:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> u want good compression or fast xd
18:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i want one that is fast, but not as bad as the png crate xD
18:23 < bridge> <pipou_tw> I reduce the image size the most I can
18:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> [dependencies]
18:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> zopfli = { version = "0.8.0", optional = true, default-features = false, features = ["std", "zlib"] }
18:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> rgb = "0.8.36"
18:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> indexmap = "2.0.0"
18:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> libdeflater = "1.19.0"
18:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> log = "0.4.19"
18:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> bitvec = "1.0.1"
18:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> rustc-hash = "1.1.0"
18:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> which cant even beat tw's embedded images
18:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> zopfli is optional
18:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> which uses normal zlib
18:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> with zopfli i get:
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> old:
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 1,7 MiB (1.759.726)
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> new:
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 1,1 MiB (1.116.559)
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> less impressive than i thought tbh
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> :lol:
18:26 < bridge> <pipou_tw> Maybe it depends on how the image is rendered (in graphics softwares)
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that's file size
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @pipou_tw but thanks anyway
18:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> with oxipng?
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i will try that now
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> without zopfli tho
18:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> gogogo
18:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe its meant to be fast
18:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz mt
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i try png with compression best now first
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 1,4 MiB (1.460.418)
18:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> measure runtime
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well at least better than default
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ah yeah should add that too, true
18:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> btw does it have hidden c libs? xd
18:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> zopfli would probably add one
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @ryozuki 
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ```
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ### original teeworlds map file:
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 1.7 MiB (1.759.726)
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ### crate png:
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - best compression
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> encoding images to png took 0.80s / 798ms / 798ms global
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 1.4 MiB (1.460.418)
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - non specified:

18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ### png non specified + oxipng:
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> encoding images to png took 5.40s / 5403ms / 5403ms global
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 1,0 MiB (1.074.655)
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ```
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the result is insane, better than zopfli with --keepcolortype
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so i guess it might change the color types of the pngs
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but runtime is bad XD
18:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> maybe i should try a different format than png
18:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> webp
18:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe jpeg xl?
18:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it has a lossless mode
18:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Mh but it has no browser support
18:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
18:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Wouldn't be horrible, but for tw probably not nice xd

18:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> this makes me nervous tho
18:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> webp wins there ^^
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> oxipng is already very slow for me xd, how could it win here
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i probably need one with default settings xd
19:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> can someone help me ?
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i like if size is small as optional optimization
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but default should be fast
19:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you could look around in the code for other places that do it
19:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i founded this, but i don't get how it's working
19:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
19:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> int ColorFeet = ColorHSLA(m_ColorFeet).UnclampLighting().Pack(ms_DarkestLGT7);
19:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
19:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and why the color is not an unsigned int ?
19:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/02/01/german-kebab-10-euros-cost-of-living-crisis/

19:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 10â‚¬ ðŸ˜®
19:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> here most are 5-6
19:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think my last kebabs were also 5-6â‚¬
19:57 < bridge> <learath2> 10 euro kebab??? blasphemous
19:57 < bridge> <learath2> Germany is a failed state
19:59 < bridge> <chairn> please draw time vs size to find optimal one
20:01 < bridge> <learath2> Teeworlds has an allergy to unsigned types
20:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> not so easy to find a good one in internet xd
20:04 < bridge> <learath2> You want something like this indeed, you just don't need to unclamp
20:06 < bridge> <learath2> For 0.7 clients you'll need to pack with `ms_DarkestLGT7` for 0.6 ones you need to pack with a different value I don't remember
20:07 < bridge> <learath2> I'm still not a huge fan of the colors even after my very own rewrite. I should have created a new class `ColorTee` and `ColorTeeSixup` for clamped ones
20:47 < bridge> <cyberfighter> Ehh
20:47 < bridge> <cyberfighter> dont know how useful that would actually be
20:48 < bridge> <patiga> @jupeyy_keks store layers as images as well :D
20:48 < bridge> <cyberfighter> ok this is just stupid now
20:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah would be cool^^
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> hello dear jan38
21:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> in a town its indeed 5â‚¬, whoever charges that much on kebab should be sentenced
22:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> minimum i had a kebab for was 3â‚¬

22:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> first one was about custom browser protocol
22:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
22:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> github said "first-time contributor"
22:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it wasnt merged
22:59 < bridge> <meloÆž> i think since the PR was closed without merging?
22:59 < bridge> <meloÆž> ye
22:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> oh fuck, i didnt check checkboxes
22:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :feelsbadman:
23:00 < bridge> <meloÆž> could've get it merged if you checked them ;(
23:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yea
23:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> thats probably why it was closed
23:00 < bridge> <meloÆž> surely!
23:07 < bridge> <teero777> will increase compile times though. dont think its worth.
