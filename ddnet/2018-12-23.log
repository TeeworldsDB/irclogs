01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @deen ok thats a good reason
02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> https://github.com/jxsl13/zcatchPlus
02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> have fun, do whatever you want
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> @onby how did you add properly formatted text to you remote console?
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> wdym
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> zoom told me that you had something like normal console-like formatting in your f2 consoel?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> or was it sth else?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/526420494027587584/Screen_Shot_2018-12-23_at_9.26.58_AM.png
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u mean like
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> the anti bot stuff shows up nicely as fixed width in f2 ?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i think thats just how it always is lol
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kero> May I disturb?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> seems like you did not fix it, it's just data that keeps on having the same width
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yes xd
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> ok, I thought it was something like fixing the whitespacing
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it would be a client side thing anyway i think
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> that's literally broken in f2
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> wdym
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> foramtting with teminal-like whitespace , with stuff like the iomanip header doesn't work :/
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> maybe some other font could fix this ðŸ˜¦
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> formatting what? like whats an example of something that doesnt work correctly
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> I don't have an example to show, but if you have just a name and clan in your table in f2, it does not handle the whitespace correctly, so that it's properly filled with whitespace of the same width as any other character to have nicknames and the clantags properly aligned in a table.
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ohh
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> right cus of special chars and stuff
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @jxsl13 numbers have the same width in most fonts so that they align nicely, even if the font is not monospaced otherwis
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> y rcon u no monospaced?!
18:12 <@deen> because it uses the same font
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> as tw?
18:12 <@deen> yes
18:12 <@deen> don't think it's worth it to add another font
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> so switching to some free monospaced font could fix this?
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> hm. I think it is worth it having properly formatted data as it seems that server admins will have to deal with more data :| especially with all the bots and what not.
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> I suggest fixing the issues and making some pull requests instead of trying to copy stuff x)
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> you will not have fun with that
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @jxsl13 i'm running your zcatch+ server on ger.ddnet.tw:8403 btw
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> did you remove the master password :O?
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> how to do that? ðŸ˜„
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I used the same config
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> xD just kidding XD
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> the buffer overflow issue is kinda urgent, would be thankful for a fix ðŸ˜®
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> All I have to say is: I saw your `=<` ðŸ˜„
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> otherwise the server would need to be restarted about daily
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> or the rcon will have issues not showing any input/output
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We restart DDNet and zCatch servers daily
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> go @ZoÃ˜oM.7z and show them ðŸ˜„
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> @deen  give poor zoom more commands
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> which ones?
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> ls
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> and all the show_... ones
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZoÃ˜oM.7z> hey! u poor
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZoÃ˜oM.7z> also i can't see client id's there
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZoÃ˜oM.7z> rls game is also dead cus custom votes need to create
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZoÃ˜oM.7z> there is standart ddnet votes only ðŸ˜„
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what's wrong with the votes?
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> bot_data, forgot what it shows, but guess it could be helpful
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZoÃ˜oM.7z> jxsl configured rls game by votes perfectly, idk how to explain ðŸ˜„
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZoÃ˜oM.7z> jxsl tell him!
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> merge_records              merge_records_id
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> if you think he needs the rights
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> track, untrack, untrack_all
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> tracks all players until specific id leaves the game. saves into teehistorian file format and appends the supposedly bot id to the end of the file name
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> list/ls     extended status screen
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> tracked
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> show_banned_nicks
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> unban_nick
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> ban_nick_by_id
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> ban_nick_by_name
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> show_irregular_flags
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> show_flags_current
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> show_long_term_data
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> show_current_data
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> ban_range_level
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZoÃ˜oM.7z> ðŸ˜® why so much commands that need to remember everything?
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> show_weird_client_messages  <- don't know if this was implemengted xD
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> tab-auto completion
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> HA 13 inch!
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> *cough*
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> btw compared to normal zcatch, you can use one db file for any mod, meaning grenade, laser, hammer, whatever it'll have each their own ranking table.
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZoÃ˜oM.7z> @jxsl13 how exactly ur rls game by votes was created? what commands
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> https://github.com/jxsl13/zcatchPlus/blob/zCatch/autoexec.cfg
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> suggest never to use any of these commands: """sv_sqlite_historian 0
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> sv_sqlite_historian_file ""
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> 
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> sv_input_fifo "fifofile"
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> 
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> sv_bot_detection 0""" as they like to eat your recources and do nothing at all.
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZoÃ˜oM.7z> @deen add please:
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZoÃ˜oM.7z> add_vote "Enable Release Game" "sv_last_standing_deathmatch 1"
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZoÃ˜oM.7z> add_vote "Disable Release Game" "sv_last_standing_deathmatch 0"
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZoÃ˜oM.7z> people are going crazy when it's going to rls modes, much insults and fun votes, rages
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> xD I'm responsible for that fun
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> partly
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZoÃ˜oM.7z> the best way is manage it by votes, most players wanna rls - then vote to turn on rls
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZoÃ˜oM.7z> that trash in chat everyday is making me sick
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> sv_input_fifo "fifofile" <-- can be used ._.
