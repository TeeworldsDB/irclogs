11:23 < ChillerDragon> What does str_utf8_stats count? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/391c127cb3adacfdc0084b060009f7ec5de524e9/src/test/str.cpp#L591-L625
11:23 < ChillerDragon> i can not reall use it to count the letters can i?
11:25 < ChillerDragon> I need a thing that counts this ``–ª—é–±–æ–≤—å`` as 6. Does ddnet code base offer something for that? Basically counting how many times my cursor would jump. To calculate the width in a fixed width font scenario
11:26 < ChillerDragon> it seems to do so the first time in the test but the 2nd time it counts 3? does it keep state? when i str cmp those two it seems to be the same

11:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> chiller i think u want to count unicode graphemes
11:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in rust thats not hard
11:28 < ChillerDragon> ttps://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1681982876.png
11:28 < ChillerDragon> bra did i fail the link? xd
11:28 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1681982876.png
11:28 < ChillerDragon> how are these two strings different? why does the count vary? does it keep state?
11:31 < bridge> <Learath2> Can't super react on phone, so take this :hypervomit:
11:37 < bridge> <Learath2> Did you even bother to read the documentation we have on `str_utf8_stats` or even just the parameter names?
11:38 < ChillerDragon> no i no read doc
11:38 < ChillerDragon> everytime i wonder if there is doc there is none :D 
11:39 < bridge> <Learath2> Almost every system.h function is documented atleast to some degree if they are not completely obvious
11:39 < ChillerDragon> ah the max size caps it
11:39 < ChillerDragon> ok then it seems to be the function i need weirdly it doesnt work as epxected for me ill furtehr investigate
11:58 < bridge> <Learath2> Just set max_size to the size of the buffer, max_count to INT_MAX
13:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is there a well known algorithm to reduce padding or just put the biggest elements first?
13:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wonder what rust does
13:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (rust is free to reorder fields for maximum efficiency)
13:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> since all alignment is power-of-two (in rust, c++) and object sizes are always a multiple of alignment (rust, c++), putting the elements with largest alignment first minimizes padding
13:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> rust does this
13:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> afaik
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is your goal using less memory?
14:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i mean less padding is always better right
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If u access the variable from 2 threads maybe not
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or 2 fields
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> From 2 threads
14:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no threads here
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ü•≤
14:09 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, maybe worse in performance due to your access pattern, e.g. if you always check a field right after another, they might end up in the same cache line
14:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also SoA is better than AoS
14:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but I don't know any language that supports it natively
14:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA)
14:10 < bridge> <Learath2> There is that one research language people point out. I don‚Äôt remember the name
14:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah i forgor
14:11 < bridge> <Learath2> But iirc it can do both with just a flag on the struct
14:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> SoA has no padding üòâ
14:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I wanna know the name
14:12 < bridge> <Learath2> Uff, I think I remember it being mentioned in the data oriented design cppcon talk by that guy who hates cpp
14:12 < bridge> <Learath2> Though not sure, ymmv
14:12 < bridge> <Learath2> I take no responsibility if you watch it and it‚Äôs not there üòõ
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> More input about this topic
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Its getting interesting
14:13 < bridge> <ReiTW> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK76q13Aqt0  bruh this guy alone did this
14:13 < bridge> <ReiTW> amazing dev
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Runs on your rtx4090 super Cluster xdD
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But nice if that's actual gameplay footage
14:16 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Nice, someone knows some secrets to cinematic game dev
14:17 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> The game almost looked like swat, but better graphics and insane camera movement
14:24 < bridge> <ReiTW> That's gameplay
14:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So is this game completely recorded as video?
14:24 < bridge> <ReiTW> Well it's VR so
14:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Hard to see on mobile
14:24 < bridge> <ReiTW> There's a beta coming soon
14:24 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Yeah, not like any interactive gameplays, unreal 5 rocks
14:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But it's not rendered is it?
14:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> based
14:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> it is
14:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> must be
14:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> but the dev most likely used IRL textures
14:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> the lightning looked unreal
14:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> camera movement looks real because that's a VR game it moves with your own head
14:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> camera movement looks real because that's a VR game it moves together with your own head
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well from what I see on mobile this is way too realistic
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I guess it's a video
14:29 < bridge> <DefaultO> this isnt a mobile game is it
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Wtf r u talkn about xd
14:29 < bridge> <DefaultO> why do you think that shit runs on mobile
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I watched the video
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> On mobile
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And see a game with prerecorded video
14:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lmao
14:30 < bridge> <DefaultO> the game isn't built with videos tho
14:30 < bridge> <DefaultO> that's how I understood you
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We'll see
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or do u have any proof
14:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hard to believe its 1 guy
14:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> making animations is extremly time consuming
14:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and the graphics look way too real
14:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also the video feels laggy somehow but maybe jut me xd
14:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but well the game is jut 1 guy with a gun
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah it's him and some friends recording a video and then put a game on top of it
14:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
14:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks i think so to, but i hope to be wrong
14:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> there is a limit to what 1 guy can do
14:34 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> tbh the fog effect on the gun when he shoots gives it away, that it was made in an engine
14:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also this project isnt rly old, cuz i saw it on twitter some time ago
14:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U can create filters
14:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or put some effects on top of the videi
14:34 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> but that would be cheesy towards IGN
14:34 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> must be gameplay element
14:34 < bridge> <DefaultO> try to render a shadow that behaves like a normal one on a 2d image
14:34 < bridge> <DefaultO> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1098587602493374464/0qaCYRs.png
14:35 < bridge> <DefaultO> of course it's not a video
14:35 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> yeah, but if the fog wouldn't be there, I would've easily said it's real xd
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> When will the beta come?
14:36 < bridge> <DefaultO> there are no dates as far as I looked
14:36 < bridge> <DefaultO> I could see this being used by military
14:36 < bridge> <DefaultO> their simulators are dogshit
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'll later look on desktop
14:37 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> unreal simulations, I cannot wait to have Among us simulation on UE5
14:37 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :lol:
14:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is not a simulation of physics tho
14:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just a environment one
14:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what half life did simulating physics first was a real break through
14:38 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> and with the half life vr game too
14:39 < bridge> <DefaultO> you think?
14:39 < bridge> <DefaultO> they used an engine they had to buy a license for
14:40 < bridge> <DefaultO> Alyx and CS2 run their own one
14:40 < bridge> <DefaultO> I think
14:40 < bridge> <DefaultO> Alyx and CS2 run their own inhouse one
14:41 < bridge> <DefaultO> gets explained in this video probs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqekPzzCZGk
14:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```C
14:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> str_utf8_stats("„Äå‰∏≠ÂõΩÁ§æÂå∫Êúç„Äç", 10, 10, &Size, &Count);
14:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> EXPECT_EQ(Size, 9);
14:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> EXPECT_EQ(Count, 3);
14:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```
14:43 < ChillerDragon> hmm this test is passing ._. how does it count it as 3 letters? 
14:44 < bridge> <DefaultO> they used an engine they had to buy a license for
14:44 < bridge> <DefaultO> Edit: Havoc
14:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> The max size does not cover the entire string
14:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> So it only counts until 10 bytes
14:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```py
14:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> >>> len("„Äå‰∏≠ÂõΩÁ§æÂå∫Êúç„Äç".encode("utf-8"))
14:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 21
14:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
14:51 < ChillerDragon> i see so i need to make sure the size is big enough
14:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> just use `str_length`
14:54 < bridge> <ReiTW> no clue, but if the game is rly like that then VR will become amazing, if u have the budget
14:55 < bridge> <ReiTW> after nanite & lumen makes things like that accessible
14:56 < bridge> <Shadowsun> the game is not vr sadly
14:56 < bridge> <Shadowsun> https://twitter.com/unrecordgame/status/1649028019741155332/photo/1 if you want more info
14:57 < ChillerDragon> ``str_length("ÊúçÊúçÊúçÊúç") // => 12``
14:57 < ChillerDragon> so that wont work
14:57 < bridge> <ReiTW> hoo thought it wa vr
14:57 < bridge> <ReiTW> hoo thought it was vr
14:58 < ChillerDragon> or you mean strlenth as max bytes?
14:58 < bridge> <ReiTW> so it's gameplay footage
14:59 < bridge> <Shadowsun> the animation of the hands is far too precise to be vr I think
15:00 < bridge> <Shadowsun> normally yes
15:01 < bridge> <Learath2> Actually I think utf8_stats would also fail on this üòÑ
15:01 < bridge> <Robyt3> ChillerDragon: pass str_length("...") + 1 for max size
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why doesnt he then simply drop a video where he uses a fly cam
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or wireframes
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Would be the easiest proof
15:03 < bridge> <Robyt3> Zero-termination is checked in `str_utf8_stats`, so you could also pass `INT_MAX` for max size I guess
15:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: as max_bytes
15:04 < bridge> <Learath2> Chiller: What are you looking to do btw? Count glyphs? Graphemes?
15:04 < bridge> <Learath2> Characters?
15:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> "characters"
15:07 < bridge> <Learath2> I don't think we even have code to count graphemes in ddnet now that I think about it
15:07 < bridge> <ReiTW> Unreal engine is insane, after the camera movement etc... does alot too
15:07 < bridge> <Shadowsun> personally I agree with you, for me the images are 100% 3d but is this the real gameplay of the game ü§î
15:10 < bridge> <Robyt3> Why would you ever need to count graphemes for a game though? This would be impossible unless you know which language it is, right?
15:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we kinda need it for left-right movement of the cursor, no?
15:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you have "√©" as "e, combining acute accent", then we don't want to place the cursor between those "characters"
15:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/12so3j9/is_rust_serde_unique/
15:11 < bridge> <Robyt3> Those are glyphs though, aren't they?
15:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, graphemes are language-independent AFAIK
15:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> glyphs might be something related to rendering, I don't think unicode has a concept of glyphs
15:13 < ChillerDragon> i think i have a different problem anyways
15:13 < ChillerDragon> seems like my assumption about fixed width was wrong
15:13 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1681996377.png
15:13 < ChillerDragon> at least vscode does not match the line lengths
15:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah. We'll i hope it's real BCS then the big game studios were beaten by some hobby artists xdd
15:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think there arent many games unsing unreal engine 5
15:14 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 align server names
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Not even matrix tech demo looks realistic enough
15:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe my beloved kingdom hearts 4 will use it though
15:14 < bridge> <Learath2> I think there is a huge table of rules to count them. I can see them being maybe useful for spacing issues
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah. But still insane then
15:14 < bridge> <ReiTW> big game studios are only good to do crunching & release a game after 2weeks
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Xd
15:15 < bridge> <ReiTW> so normal to see a game like that when people take their time to do things properly
15:15 < bridge> <ReiTW> and not rush cuz they only like money
15:15 < ChillerDragon> a table?
15:15 < ChillerDragon> seems like my terminal also ignores fixed width when it comes to those 
15:15 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1681996484.png
15:15 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, I think there is a single codepoint version of the more common combinations
15:16 < ChillerDragon> so i should replace letters?
15:20 < bridge> <Robyt3> For CJK languages there are separate half-width and full-width characters. If you want correct monospaced text you need the half-width characters
15:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there is, but we're not guaranteed to get it
15:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: fixed-width terminal font length of graphemes is a deep rabbithole
15:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I read a lot of blog posts about that ^^
15:28 < bridge> <Learath2> I think if we don't get it I bet we fail. I'm fairly certain we don't have the grapheme rules table
15:36 < ChillerDragon> yikes okay where can i buy half width?
15:40 < bridge> <Robyt3> Those are separate unicode codepoints, so you'll have to manually translate the full-width to the half-width codepoints
15:41 < ChillerDragon> was that done already?
15:41 < ChillerDragon> or do i have to get a table into my code and do some unicode str replace?
15:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35639673
15:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 we live in a society
16:00 < bridge> <Learath2> Thanks Tech CEO very cool
16:12 < ChillerDragon> i tries rust xd ryo
16:12 < ChillerDragon> also that fails me
16:13 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1681999975.png
16:16 < bridge> <Robyt3> > Half-width kanji is not usable on modern computers
16:16 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-width_kana
16:17 < ChillerDragon> xd ffs
16:18 < ChillerDragon> wait but is full width exactly twice as large? then i can use that to calc
16:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> rust is not failing here
16:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://crates.io/crates/unicode-width
16:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is used by all cli tools written in rust
16:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it tells the width of a utf8 str
16:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://unicode-rs.github.io/unicode-width/unicode_width/index.html
16:52 < ChillerDragon> yea i also just saw that
16:53 < ChillerDragon> made me realize they are actualy two columns wide so i can properly offset even wide characters in a terminal
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so at desktop i'd say it defs doesnt look as perfect as i thought on mobile
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd still say there is a high chance, even if its 100% in unreal engine 5, that this isn't real time.
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there are photorealistic videos in UE5 that look insanely good (also with this weird camera movements), eg:
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://youtu.be/2paNFnw1wRs
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it has a much smaller viewport and the creator said in the comment it was prerendered ^^
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So would defs be insane and a game changer üòÑ

18:31 < bridge> <ReiTW> well on twitter he said it was actual gameplay
18:31 < bridge> <ReiTW> IGN is not the creator
18:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> on twitter he posted the worst answer
18:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he only said it was recorded from an executable
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he is either hard troll, or noby is not a troll at all
18:33 < bridge> <ReiTW> well with keyboard etc..
18:33 < bridge> <ReiTW> ig he meant not from UE directly
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its still weird xD
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he could simply toggle wireframes
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> takes 5 seconds
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he could go live and play that scene xD
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> would create even more hype xD
18:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just hope i can soon play minecraft 8k on my 4090 rigs using 10kWh electricity and feel like i am in the matrix
18:42 < bridge> <Voxel> i remember wanting to code smth else but i completely forgot what i wanted to code
20:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> meh im having a hard time defining a rust function in the ddnet code all the existing rust code seems so hollow no idea where to slap something like this so i can call it from the c++ code```rust
20:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> #[no_mangle]
20:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> pub extern "C" fn hello_from_rust() {
20:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon>     println!("Hello from Rust!");
20:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> }
20:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ```
20:24 < ChillerDragon> i was hoping this would just work xd

22:40 < bridge> <susan93412719> Hi! I am a pretty shy person, and have no idea what I can tell you about me right away. I am Susan Cummings and I would like us to continue our communication through my Email(cummingssusan71@gmail.com) just send me a few lines to make sure I got the right email address.
22:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nice susan
22:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> kek surname
22:51 < bridge> <DefaultO> I think that is the Cum guy from here
22:51 < bridge> <DefaultO> Don't get catfished
22:54 < bridge> <gerdoe> eh guys do you know why `fix_style.py` hardcoded to use only linux clang-format?
22:54 < bridge> <gerdoe> im struggling with my windows setup and 15.0.2 clang-format
22:56 < bridge> <Learath2> Why would you delete ms. cummings msg?
23:12 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
23:27 < bridge> <deen> It doesn't support .exe files I guess
23:27 < bridge> <deen> @gerdoe Just push without caring about clang-format. We can fix it.
23:27 < bridge> <deen> Not worth putting in effort for that, it's something trivial
23:28 < bridge> <Robyt3> If you have visual studio you can use that to call clang-format with Ctrl+K+D
