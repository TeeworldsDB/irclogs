00:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 can you translate?
00:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if in doubt, try reinstalling ddnet ðŸ˜›
00:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Error when updating ddnet, (disk writing error)]
00:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd guess disk full
00:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> or dying hard drive
00:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or no hard drive

12:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <alien1344> The latest update has made ddnet laggy for me ðŸ˜¦
13:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <alien1344> I made a recording of it and the recording doesnt show the same lag (i.e. screen jerks) so does that mean its the game as opposed to a server / internet?
13:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <alien1344> I made a recording of it and the recording doesnt show the same lag (i.e. screen jerks) so does that mean its the game & game settings as opposed to a server / internet?

16:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> ok ez
17:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 do you know another (preferably free-to-play) game that uses libcurl?
17:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3909#issuecomment-860753353
17:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm, nope none come to mind, sorry
17:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wasnt someone from a worms game here?
17:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe they do
17:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he used to hang around in this irc channel
17:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.hedgewars.org/
17:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> heh they moved to libera chat too
17:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I have a function that writes out to something that implements `std::io::Write` I need to write to a `String` what is the best way to do that?
17:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking of just outputting to a `Vec<u8>` and then going ot a string from there
17:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yup
17:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's the best way, I think
17:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Cursor.html
17:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a cursor around a vec is the best i think
17:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that seems to just extra code when a `Vec` also works
17:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
17:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 remember that if u dont wrap the writer around a bufwriter the writes are unbuffered
17:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see leddit ppl saying hehe rust is slower than java due to this
17:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't really matter for a vec, I think
17:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Seems like the serverlist can't be accessed in a netcafe consistently.
17:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Still can't get the log out of players. So I can't tell why.
17:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I mean consistently can not be accessed.
18:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you just go to a netcafe and check? ^^
18:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ðŸ˜…
18:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> My social anxiety won't let me
18:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Never been to those places
18:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I directed him to use a custom cfg that has a cn domain plus a Chinese cdn
18:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Still didn't work
18:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Huh, maybe some firewall blocking it?
18:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> maybe. But I don't know what firewall would block a traffic from tencent
18:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Also in these places I would imagine they don't have a admin windows account. Might be worth checking.
18:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Although not sure what would be different about it
18:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> or it might be a policy thing where they can only serve Chinese games
18:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Scratch that, they can connect to servers just fine
18:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ðŸ˜‡
18:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie might they be MITM every connection?
18:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Possible
18:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you ask them to show a certificate in the browser for https://master1.ddnet.tw/ddnet/15/servers.json?
18:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you ask them to show a certificate in the browser for https://master1.ddnet.tw/ddnet/15/servers.json ?
18:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Will do
18:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Although most of them struggled to paste a string into their file explorer
18:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I'll do my bestðŸ˜…
18:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Ah this one isn't replying. I'll wait for the next "victim"

18:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <afterfx> i cant add the ddnet bot to my server, why?

18:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think the bot is in 100 different discords, and the developer would need to send their ID card to discord to allow the bot in more servers
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> other servers have the ddnet bot?
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can they rename it or is it advertisement
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> people can rename bots, but I think only ddnet-related discords would have an incentive to use the bot ^^
18:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <afterfx> @deen its now your turn ðŸ˜„
18:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <afterfx> @deen its now your turn, to verify your bot
18:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not deen's bot
18:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's jao's AFAIK
18:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and as said, you have to send your ID to discord AFAIK, not everyone will want to do that
18:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> blame discord
18:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki do you know if collecting the stream from `.fetch()` has a performance penalty over `.fetch_all()` in sqlx?
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i think fetch returns a stream
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which i guess is like a iterator
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fetch all is probs the collected items of that
19:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i think fetch is better
19:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stream is an async iter
19:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess if u have to map or filter it its better fetch
19:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Does anyone know where and what files are are created by ddnet on macOS which should be removed on uninstallation? @Learath2 ?
19:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Does anyone know where and what files are created by ddnet on macOS which should be removed on uninstallation? @Learath2 ?
19:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @b3z the only thing outside of it's dir that ddnet touches is the teeworlds folder in Application Support
20:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Okay @Learath2 so I would roll with these?
20:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> ```rb
20:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin>   "~/Library/Preferences/DDNet-Server-Launcher.plist",
20:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin>   "~/Library/Saved Application State/org.DDNetClient.app.savedState",
20:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin>   "~/Library/Application Support/Teeworlds/"
20:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> ```
20:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Okay @Learath2 so I would roll with these?!
20:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> ```rb
20:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin>   "~/Library/Preferences/DDNet-Server-Launcher.plist",
20:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin>   "~/Library/Saved Application State/org.DDNetClient.app.savedState",
20:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin>   "~/Library/Application Support/Teeworlds/"
20:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> ```
20:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this will also remove the files created by Teeworlds
20:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> both ddnet and teeworlds write into that folder
20:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what are you coding? ðŸ™‚
20:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Yes that is true.
20:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> homebrew uninstaller
20:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is it customary for homebrew uninstallers to remove user settings?
20:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine wanting to uninstall ddnet :feelsbadman:
20:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> it is not
20:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> That is why I am asking
20:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> So i guess it would be better to not delete the teeworlds dir
20:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> @heinrich5991 good you mentioned it. I didn't think about that. I would have kept it in ðŸ™‚
20:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> np
20:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> also about this: The zap stanza describes a more complete uninstallation of files associated with ddnet. The zap procedures will never be performed by default, but only if the user uses --zap on uninstall. So you probably could also remove the teeworlds dir. On the other hand most users know this dir exists (because of skins, binds, entities, ...) so they might as well delete it by hand.
20:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, it's not by default
20:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> zap does then work of a cleaner app.
20:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that makes it less of an issue
20:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> yeah but I guess better delete less than too much?!
20:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> I mean I would be pretty sad if my config would get lost this way.
20:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea
20:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Also, from now on, ddnet on the Mac will be updated automatically if it was originally installed with Homebrew. If this turns out to be a problem for any reason, please let me know.
20:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wdym, updated automatically?
20:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think our autoupdater doesn't work on macos
20:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> if a new version is available
20:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> will it be updated by brew?
20:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> yes
20:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah. sounds good. don't think it'll be a problem
20:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks for working on packaging ddnet ðŸ™‚
20:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> No worries. I need ways to procrastinate ðŸ™‚
20:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now brew is one of two package managers that have an up-to-date version
20:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://repology.org/project/ddnet/versions
20:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> it has been since 15.1.3
20:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> it's the only thing I am contributing to ddnet xD besides some translations
20:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is the serverlist script online somewhere
20:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which serverlist script?
20:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the program that generates the json
20:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is it in libtw2?
20:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
20:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> stats_browser
20:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok ty
20:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I re-used an old project
20:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you need --format json
20:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you need `--format json`
20:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> be careful running the script, you're incurring traffic for every server hoster in teeworlds
20:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
20:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but the cloudflare is really slow for me
20:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sometimes takes 4-5 seconds to load
20:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> isn't that a huge vulnerability?
20:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar âœª do you want to host master3?
20:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please don't run it for private purposes only, that doesn't scale
20:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> has ddnet still some server?
20:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i doubt my vps can handle alot of request
20:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i doubt my vps can handle alot of requests
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> atleast not 2k players are requesting the info ðŸ˜„
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but only the first connection?
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its random
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> when i switch tabs
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is the load high btw? or is it getting ddos'd?
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could fix the tab switching instead of scraping the servers another time ðŸ˜‰
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in what way, caching the current list and silently update?
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not throwing the http master serverlist away when switching tabs
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://ddnet.tw/status/
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> CPU is 100% often
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if thats the server same
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the http master server class has all the data
21:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nice english
21:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean is master1  == ddnet.tw
21:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can simply not throw the server info away on tab change @Jupstar âœª
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then there will be no reloads when switching tabs
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes, i generally think it should always show the list
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> even if its outdated
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that would require caching
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the normal user doesnt understand it anyway "fetching master list"
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but not throwing the old info before obtaining the new one sounds good
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well caching = writing it and load it at client start
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> from that one its always just updating that file
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> since it doesnt throw away
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, enter permission problems etc.
21:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and concurrency issues with multiple clients
21:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but maybe you can put it into the sqlite3 db
21:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> isnt read write safe?
21:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's certainly not atomic
21:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well i guess and start and closing client its as safe as the ddnet_settings.cfg
21:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> at*
21:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which is also not safe and we get reports for that
21:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also that is already doing the rename trick IIRC
21:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> requieres a quick ahdn xd
21:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> hand
21:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah the rename trick could be done too ofc
21:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> anyway, i'll see what i'll do
21:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lockfiles :monkalaugh:
21:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 || @Ryozuki https://paste.pr0.tips/6S do you see a way to make this work?
21:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Issue is that `sqlx::error::Error` isn't `Copy` so I don't really see how I can get it out of the closure
21:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's the error?
21:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this looks like it could compile in my brain
21:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://paste.pr0.tips/0c
21:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ERROR: No such paste.
21:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://paste.pr0.tips/Oc
21:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mixed the O with 0
21:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder what r u doing
21:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never had to use pin in my life
21:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> streams and async in general is very new in rust, it's tough to use
21:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does adding a move fix it?
21:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Need to pin that stream because the new stream created by filter_map is no longer Unpin and you can't .next on it
21:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would take err by value meaning I can't get it outside
21:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> seems like you're not allowed to take a reference to the outside variable somehow?
21:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could circumvent this particular problem with an Arc<AtomicPtr<>>, probably
21:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, I don't understand the error message, I think
21:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm allowed to take a reference to the outside, I think I just am not allowed to let `e` escape
21:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62557219/error-on-future-generator-closure-captured-variable-cannot-escape-fnmut-closu
21:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm a fold is an interesting idea
21:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but I can just avoid this construct anyway, I just wanted to check if any of you encountered this
21:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll just map the stream items to Result<Row, Error> and handle the error later
21:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i havent rly used much streams
21:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> couldn't ger2 host a master? seems like a complete OP machine compared to the others anyway
21:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess we could try, yes

21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> looks like the main reason it sometimes is so slow is bcs info2.ddnet.tw doesnt respond?
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
21:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or just generally slow connection to that server
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its also insanly slow over browser
21:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so the problem isn't even the server list rn?
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it waits for info2.ddnet.tw for some reason?
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cloudflare timeout
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in browser
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so yes
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dunno how that could be different
21:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but its the same IP
21:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe its still the connection after all
21:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but yeah in brwoser the info is much slower
21:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> often takes 5-10 seconds or timeouts
21:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it uses http/2 to cloudflare
21:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so it can multiplex over one connection
21:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah sry, but master1 is indeed a different ip
21:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or is it just as soon as it routes to cloudflare?
21:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probably
21:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, master1 and info2 are the same server
21:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I think db is different
21:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i guess cloudflare checks per URL?
21:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs master1 always fast and info2 always slow for me ðŸ˜„
21:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probably bcs info2 has a ddos incomming or smth
22:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <pamonha1487777> hi good afternoon i want to know how do i become adm on ddnet on fng map
22:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> admin? i don't think you can apply to be an fng admin?
22:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> admin? i don't think you can apply to be an fng admin
22:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <pamonha1487777> but why
22:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @noby who's the admin of DDNet FNG
22:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or is that just all ddnet admins
22:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> also @pamonha1487777 let's move to questions, not rly a dev topic
22:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <noby> me
22:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i don't see a reason for another admin lol
23:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 no, info2 is db.ddnet.tw
23:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª yes, it's because of a DoS against info2. I don't know how the attackers found out its ip address
23:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> Is there any way for me to test changes to the ddnet-discordbot without running it myself?
23:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I'm trying to set up the bot right now, but it seems hard and I'm running into problems
23:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i wanna confirm, is that why refresh is slightly longer than it was previously? (1-2 seconds)
23:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that only affects the ddnet tab, I think
23:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> gotcha
23:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i noticed after 15.5 refresh takes 1-2 seconds longer, any tab
23:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are you sure it takes longer? ðŸ˜›
23:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but theoretically it should be shorter, since it doesn't communicate with any server to get ping
23:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yes
23:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not only taking longer to the first server shown?
23:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 I can reproduce that. Refresh takes multiple seconds for me at the moment
23:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> let me check right now, using internet tab
23:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, only ddnet tab
23:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then yeah, the info2 problem
23:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> initial load was 6 seconds
23:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> got it ok
23:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> subsequent reloads are not that bad, 2 seconds
23:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> reloads take <0.5s for me
23:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the initial load does indeed take long
23:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that's weird
23:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it must favor connections close to EU?
23:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> how many master servers are located there?
23:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 1
23:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and elsewhere?
23:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 1, in china
23:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> huh, im kinda in the middle xd
23:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're likely connecting to the one in europe
23:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well, if I can't have USA2, can I have USA master server ðŸ˜„ @deen
23:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i would again sponsor it
23:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or even host it if it came to that
23:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but obviously not idealk
23:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but obviously not ideal
23:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess not throwing away the old list when refreshing would help with these problems ðŸ˜›
23:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lol
23:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <deiform> :qtroll:
23:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and maybe caching the serverlist across restarts
23:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea makes sense
23:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> at the very least caching
23:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @lynn can you create a file called `ddnet-serverlist-urls.cfg` next to your `settings_ddnet.cfg` and make the only line https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/temp/servers-2021-06-14.json
23:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and report the performance
23:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yes one moment
23:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so this will override?
23:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
23:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> jesus christ
23:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that is so much better
23:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> thanks lol
23:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> argh
23:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> literally 0.5 like u said earlier
23:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ehm, this is just a snapshot
23:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can't keep using it ðŸ˜›
23:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sadness
23:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I'll go set up a similar master soonâ„¢
23:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So why is it faster than the one we have?
