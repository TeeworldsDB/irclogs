21:05 < Khale> oh hey
21:06 < Khale> i have a problem, my pc autoshutdown after playing tw for like 5 minuts anyone faced that problem? :D
21:07 <@deen> your cpu or gpu are overheating
21:07 <@deen> check their temperatures
21:07 < necropotame> Maybe a cooling problem? It's the same with other games?
21:07 < Khale> actully playing lol and everything else is fine
21:07 < necropotame> damn, you are faster
21:07 < Khale> just teeworlds
21:07 <@deen> well, teeworlds runs at 100% cpu 100% gpu if you change no settings
21:07 < Khale> + sometimes it goes to sleep mode instead of shutdown
21:07 <@deen> enable vsync, set cl_cpu_throttle 5
21:08 <@deen> and check if it's "fixed"
21:08 < Khale> what to check if it fixed?
21:08 <@deen> just play and see if it shuts down?
21:09 <@deen> laptop or desktop computer?
21:09 <@deen> clean out the fans, remove dust
21:09 <@deen> make sure fans rotate
21:09 < Khale> laptop
21:09 < Khale> fans rotate and everything fine
21:09 < Khale> i play league of legends and others games and everything fine too
21:09 < Khale> just teeworlds :O
