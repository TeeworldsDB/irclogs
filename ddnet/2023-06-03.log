00:01 <+bridge> <deen> @Davide ^
00:01 <+bridge> <deen> Apparently you have to connect to ger10 to get access to usa3 😄
00:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> I don't think that has anything to do with it but I'm not sure
00:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> oh it did work it just took a while
00:02 <+bridge> <Davide> The challenge needs 7-10 seconds at the first join, then it's instant the next times
00:04 <+bridge> <Davide> The anti-DDoS challenge needs 7-10 seconds at the first join, then it's instant the next times
00:05 <+bridge> <gerdoe> huh
00:05 <+bridge> <gerdoe> wrap me one pls :p
01:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> uck maybe it is tclient related
02:56 <+bridge> <BlackWolf> @deen
02:56 <+bridge> <BlackWolf> usa has new location?
06:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
08:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jupsti
08:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fak we need a who is online section here
08:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i forgot which setting makes my game not use 100% gpu :justatest:
08:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> lol
08:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> gfx_refresh_rate
08:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> any nonzero value
08:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> that’s bot super high
08:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but whats jupsti approved value?
08:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> *not
08:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> isk
08:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> idk
08:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> Holy shit i can’t type
08:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> na idk
08:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> even 1000 locked feels weird
08:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i want back my wonky 480 fps
08:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah got it
08:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk which settings i just loaded my config tracked in git xd
08:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it has refresh rate 0
08:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but still capps me below 500 somehow
08:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it feels like 17k fps
08:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but only uses 0% GPU
08:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its infinite performance glitch settings
08:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Probably cl refresh rate
08:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nah it set to 0
08:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk what it is
08:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but it good
08:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Notice cl not gfx
08:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a
08:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> There are two settings
08:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> both 0
08:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Cl makes your mouse input feel like trash lol xd
08:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if non 0?
08:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye it 0
08:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mhh maybe Fullscreen off?
08:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> desktop fullscreen
08:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wait
08:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i was in wrong client xd
08:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe gnome takes control xd
08:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes its cl refresh rate
08:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i play with that since forver
08:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u say it bad for mouse?
08:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> how is a lower cl_refresh_rate better for gpu than a lower gfx_refresh_rate
08:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not better for gpu
08:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> better for my perceived game feel
08:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> aa
08:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> i have my gfx_refresh_rate on 478 since i was tired of hearing my gpu scream all the time
08:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> why is that better
08:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i guess my cpu now bottle necks my gpu
08:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah there are cycles where no frame is generated now
08:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Setting gfx only is usually the better option, but feel free to set it as you like
08:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u make me nervouse with the mouse thing
08:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> what's the math
08:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i have been gaming like that for the last few years
08:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what gfx refresh u set jupsti?
08:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and why is max 10000 ? xd
08:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> too low
08:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> if u want higher just set 0
08:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i wanna cap at 15k
08:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> axaxaxax
08:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> o
08:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> hmm
08:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jkjk
08:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1685774009.png
08:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lel nice
08:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> btw ryo thank for nvtop its so cool
08:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Because your GPU works less? Xd
08:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> guess when i switched from cpu cap to gpu cap xd
08:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> that number specifically?
08:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No
08:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If it's that number, it's luck
08:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> someone told me to set exactly 478
08:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jupsti
08:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat gfx rate
08:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ima switch now
08:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then he troll
08:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for better mouse gaming
08:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> ig
08:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> 478 = stars align to give u 0 latency
08:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd claim a value over 1000 makes it feel so smooth that any value above won't improve it
08:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I have 240 Hz monitor tho
08:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok i also went for 1000 and like it
08:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but its noticiibly more fan noise than my previous 480 fps xd
08:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Change fan curve
08:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dont i need the fan?
08:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think I generally target like 60°C
08:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or 65
08:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Passiv cooling is good enough for me then
08:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if nvtop is to be trusted i am at 47
08:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> what hz monitor chiller
08:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk metrics are always rigged arent they
08:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am back to my 8yr old 60hz one
08:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Teeworlds uses like 30watt on my GPU and 7 watt on cpu
08:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because my new one has weird washing effect xd
08:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah yeah yeah fuck screens
08:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> u dont need 1000 then i bet
08:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
08:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 666 then?
08:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea also feels good
08:39 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i have both on 1k
08:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Epic
08:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Rip
08:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Setting cl to anything then 0 sucks imo
08:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's just broken af
08:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks do u think making a shader adding ilumination to the laser rifle shot is hard
08:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I blame sdl for providing relative mouse mode coordinates without fraction
08:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sometimes i wish tw was keyboard only
08:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> they give u x/y and xrel/yrel
08:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Mh depends how realistic the illumination should look like
08:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> controlling the mouse is such a pain sometimes
08:41 <+bridge> <Ewan> what more do u need
08:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> A bloom like glow is maybe ok
08:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> rtx laser
08:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
08:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
08:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sounds nice
08:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and rtx gun muffles
08:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> As said, fraction
08:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Adding 0,5 to 0,5 is 0
08:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I don't trust sdl
08:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> sdl isn't doing math on this number it's just directing it to you
08:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> the wm is never keeping mouse pos in a fractional format
08:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> movement deltas same
08:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I doubt that
08:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> that's just math on existing values
08:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> See: let's say u moved your mouse so much that it moves 1.5 pixels
08:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What now?
08:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So u keep the 0.5
08:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> Wm rounds
08:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Drop it?
08:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> and that's the end
08:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> See, so it rounds more and more
08:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> For every movement it gets
08:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> Not SDL's fault tho lol
08:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Bro but everyone uses looser windows xd
08:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> On Linux it's ofc fixed
08:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Because it's gamer os
08:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> I don't think either window system there does anything floaty with mouse
08:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> floatatious, if you will
08:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> bouyant
08:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It does tho
08:45 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Linux uses libinput to get the event from the kernel. Xorg then passes them to windows. I suppose on windows something similar is happening
08:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe windows direct input also has an api
08:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Problem is always if they use some fancy as XP routines. Or new ones..
08:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Not like no mouse hardware manufacturer never faced such a problem
08:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> While making the sensors better and better
08:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> Nowadays directx libraries aren't using WinRT which would be an issue for you, they are using plain COM
08:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> Same old
08:47 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I don't know how it works on wayland but if you want to get mouse movement from 2 mice and each mice to be captured on a different window you need to get the input from libinput and not from the window (on X atleast)
08:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyway, never use floats to store results
08:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> winit uses 64-bit floats for relative mouse mode btw
08:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so they must have thought about why they do so
08:49 <+bridge> <Ewan> 🧠
08:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sdl2 does not, sdl3 will probably do
08:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and i hope they use doubles too and not floats xd
08:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> Why u need more than float
08:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> because 32-bit floats are inaccurate
08:51 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it's fine
08:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> winit = rust = good
08:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> <a:ferrisVibe:791783267023585290>
08:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> try it out, float a = 0.0f
08:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
08:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> now add 0.001f or smth for 1 minute, 
08:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do the same with an int (scaled by 1000)
08:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i bet the result is completely broken xd
08:52 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it is fine tho
08:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no
08:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> floats are evil
08:53 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> but it is fine
08:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> floats are evil
08:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> depends on your goal
08:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> floats are also often slower
08:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> except like dividing
08:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think most GPUs use fixed point floats
08:53 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i'll only say it is fine regarding mouse movement
08:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @TsFreddie do u know what a subnormal float is
08:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah, then absolutely not xD
08:54 <+bridge> <Ewan> That’s an oxymoron
08:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :ddnet:
08:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mouse movement that is different if your FPS change sucks
08:54 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> no but it is fine
08:55 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/everything-is-fine-itsfine-burning-flame-my-life-going-so-far-gif-5182223
08:56 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> company network blocked tenor apparently
08:56 <+bridge> <Ewan> xd
08:56 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> company network blocked tenor apparently, but it is fin
08:56 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> company network blocked tenor apparently, but it is fine
08:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> why
08:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> tenor has no nsfw
08:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its the most tame shit
08:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> boomers use it in all apps
08:57 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> probably china, but it is fine
08:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> whats up with u
08:57 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> are u fine
08:57 <+bridge> <Ewan> he is in china
08:57 <+bridge> <Ewan> ofc not
08:57 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I can not use proxies at work. but it is fine tho
08:58 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm not fine, but it is fine
08:59 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> we can use google and youtube just (it is) fine at work, it is generous enough.
08:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> why they have such strict network
08:59 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> also don't ask me why i'm at work on a saturday
09:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> is it saturday
09:00 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> china or company
09:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> i didn't notice
09:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> company
09:00 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> are they strict tho? if google youtube reddit telegram and discord all worked fine
09:01 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I think it is a GFW network still but whitelisted
09:01 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> but they whitelisted a lot of stuff apparently
09:01 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> and they missed tenor i guess
09:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> damn
09:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> easy site to miss
09:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> very unremarkable
09:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> giphy's weird cousin
09:02 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> ye giphy works for me
09:02 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
09:02 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> btw 32 bit floating numbers are fine
09:03 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> bcs i have to work with 16 bit floats all the time
09:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> lol
09:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> you are floating
09:03 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm gonna take a nap
09:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> i miss the bemani cn
09:04 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> which part of it
09:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/commit/cefbeb582f4b41f5e4e0eca0ae6d7b652c92e1d1
09:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
09:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sdl went with 32 floats
09:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> the ppl
09:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so u are right
09:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> nice
09:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> winit = rust = best
09:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> i was wrong
09:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> i apologize
09:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> time to switch
09:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> SDL is not good enough for ddnet anymore
09:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> sdl 3 not even out yet >_>
09:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> oh actually winit for windowing would be awesome though
09:04 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> paula and tempo etc?
09:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> ye
09:05 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> or nibs
09:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> all
09:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> fish
09:05 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean....
09:05 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> we still talk in telegram
09:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> ayy i dont have that tho
09:05 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> idk where fsh went tho
09:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> im not a drug dealer
09:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> so i dont have telegram
09:05 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i am tho
09:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think some GPUs use fixed point floats
09:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> idk, just get telegram and don't scam ppl
09:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it's ez
09:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> lol
09:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> maybe
09:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> also what's stopping you or anyone from creating a new discord server
09:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> does it have to be nibs'
09:07 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
09:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> he is the guy who knows the guys
09:07 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> well i know three of them who might also know the other ones
09:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> u dont like nibs or what
09:08 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> nibs is not in my radar
09:08 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't know where he is that's all
09:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> u want him
09:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> i have him
09:09 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> do a depth first search on in our DM network and we'll have everyone
09:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> xd

09:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> was wondering why my implentation confused a connless packet with a control packet
09:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and duh... control flag is set but TIL connless flag is stronger? lul

11:40 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> does anyone know a good chain map crate
11:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://crates.io/crates/chain-map
11:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> looks old
11:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i want to handle variable  shadowing in my lang
11:42 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what's `chain-map`
11:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and for type inference
11:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i need to keep the variable in outer scope
11:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but if im in the inner scope
11:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i want to get the proper type
11:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> smth like that
11:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> > The ChainMap type groups a chain of HashMaps together in precedence order and provides a single, unified view into the values. The semantics for keys are the same as for a HashMap, however the value associated with a given key is the value of that key in the highest-precedence map that contains the key.
11:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm oh well
11:44 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe simply cloning the hashmap on each scope
11:50 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm interested in the use case
11:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe a alt name is overlayed hash map?
11:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe DHT uses that
11:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> idk
12:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> i want to like usa3 and its ddos protection but i'm lagging chugging balls rn and me and my dummy are the only players on, across all of usa3
12:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jupsti u got webchat open?
12:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh nvm idk what this was
12:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> anyways webchat got new feature!
12:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and probably new css bugs xd
12:23 < ws-client> <Jupstar> yo nice, online feature

13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or do you want to host your own backend?
13:18 < ws-client> <Jupstar> sadly no work
13:18 < ws-client> <Jupstar> no
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i usually test with offline backend
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe the prod doesnt work locally
13:18 < ws-client> <Jupstar> yeah nvm, just merge pr
13:18 < ws-client> <Jupstar> if not work, i do another
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> local backend is one more git clone and npm start
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we live

13:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> ``cp env.example .env``
13:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> ``npm run start``
13:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> 3 cmds for local backend
13:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> ``npm install`` too i guess
13:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> ah
13:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> didnt see it says env.examle

13:27 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> webhook can set bot name per message i think?
13:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have to scroll 10 pages to get the input field
13:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea tsfreddie but i dont have a webhook
13:28 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Oh is this really a bot
13:28 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> now its broken bcs img too big
13:28 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> discord resizes images
13:29 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> guess a max-width should be applied
13:29 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> but now i'm afk, good luck
13:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> AAAAAAAAa
13:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
13:29 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> 👀
13:29 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1114516310085349436/mmexport1685724897269.mp4
13:29 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Does video work
13:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nah
13:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> would be ez tho
13:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> Dope video
13:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> show VR gameplay 😄
13:42 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> no
13:42 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> cuz it is bad
13:48 <+bridge> <Patiga> @TsFreddie wait what did I miss? are you working on vr risk-of-rain? 👀
13:48 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> legally no
13:48 <+bridge> <Patiga> xd
13:49 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> also it is pretty bad
13:49 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it looks like two people made it
13:49 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> woah new teeworlds update looking good
13:49 <+bridge> <Patiga> like are you hired to recreate the whole game?
13:49 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> nope
13:49 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> game designer liked ror and just take a part of it
13:50 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> our enemy is dumber
13:50 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> progression is shorter
13:50 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> inventory can be dropped
13:50 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> expected playtime is like 20 minutes
13:50 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> cuz it was for location based business
13:50 <+bridge> <Patiga> 20 mins for one run, right?
13:50 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> not a comercial game
13:51 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> 20 min total
13:51 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> after you are done you can replay but there aren't anything to unlock
13:51 <+bridge> <Patiga> ah, alright
13:51 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> 20 MINUTES TOTAL
13:51 <+bridge> <Patiga> so they just liked the assets and maybe the abilities from ror and yoinked them
13:52 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> nah
13:52 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> they remade assets that looks like ror
13:52 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> lol
13:52 <+bridge> <Patiga> oh I wasn't sure
13:52 <+bridge> <Voxel> risk of rain moment
13:53 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it was for the stores and paid per run so 20mins are plenty
13:53 <+bridge> <Patiga> teh guitar looked a bit off but since its quite some time since I last played the other stuff like the mushroom looked right
13:53 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> scratch that, it was paid per minute
13:53 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> just arcade stuff
13:53 <+bridge> <Patiga> how big is your team?
13:53 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> two people
13:54 <+bridge> <Patiga> well this makes sense then :p
13:54 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> indeed
13:54 <+bridge> <Patiga> which game engine are you using?
13:54 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1114522618159185970/image.png
13:55 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> the good old U
13:56 <+bridge> <Patiga> that kind of development sounds kinda fun, although I would assume that its also stressful and maybe not super rewarding
13:57 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> 16-hour work days
13:57 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> basically
13:57 <+bridge> <Patiga> crazy.
13:58 <+bridge> <Patiga> do you have any free time left? I hope your work week is at least 5 days not 6?
13:59 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> 7
14:00 <+bridge> <Patiga> insane, how do you cope with that?
14:00 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Just this two months
14:00 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I'll ask management for the next project and down scope a ton
14:00 <+bridge> <Patiga> you literally don't have time to sleep properly, I'm scared to ask how many hours of sleep you get ^^
14:00 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I'll ask for a management role for the next project and down scope a ton
14:01 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Also we don't work 16 hours during the weekend
14:01 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Well during saturday
14:02 <+bridge> <Patiga> iirc you didn't really have a problem finding a job, right? is the payout really big enough to justify the mental and physical burden
14:02 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> we have been doing 30-hour on sunday straight into monday for the past three weeks
14:03 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> No but i get to decide what we do
14:03 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> You don't get that in big companies with plenty of money
14:07 <+bridge> <Patiga> I can see how that is nice, but it really does sound mental to me. I am shocked what you put yourself through, and how your mental state and body manage to cope with that draining schedule. the creative freedom sounds nice, but for me that doesn't make it much less insane ^^
14:07 <+bridge> <Patiga> hf on your project, does look nice from the screenshots :)
14:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u create namek
14:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice

14:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :frozen:
14:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what is even the sense of this?
14:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean working more hours doesn't mean you are more productive
14:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess u always live near to burn outs don't you?
14:24 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :brownbear:
14:25 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> It's better than doing 8
14:25 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Also i didn't want this if it is not obvious
14:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, but do they have control over your body?
14:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would they fire you?
14:26 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> No but i would be sad
14:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf? lmao
14:27 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Also we just want this one to be over sooner
14:27 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Next project just gonna be more fun
15:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> copium
15:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the fun in a project always is a steady decline
15:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ur initially rly excited
15:01 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :poggers2:
15:02 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :greenthing: but no way I'm doing overtime on the next one
15:03 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> Cuz I'll be in charge of the total amount of content
15:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i just hope u have at least a bit of fun
15:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else u'll hate yourself for wasting so much time
15:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or payment is top notch xd
15:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
15:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> he is trying to convince himself its ok
15:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ans thats ok
15:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I earn more than I thought I would be less than I deserve apparently
15:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> copium
15:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> no
15:06 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> this should be it is fine
15:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd

15:07 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> idk what count as cheap tho
15:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> food lmao
15:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd say under 200€ is cheap in europe
15:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u dont only need noodles and ketchup xd
15:08 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I think i have 42% of my salary going into rent and food  and bills usually
15:09 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> 8% into ddnet servers
15:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mhh sounds okish, depending on the salary xd
15:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
15:09 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> if i don't buy any new toys then i save about 5000cny per month i think?
15:10 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> usually less than that tho
15:10 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> cuz I still buy games and stuff which i don't actually play lmao

15:11 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> never overflow:scroll
15:12 < ws-client> <chromeuser> oh boi
15:16 < ws-client> <chromeuser> okay i got no sideway scroll on chromium now
15:17 < ws-client> <chromeuser> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1685798238.png
15:17 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> that will also create one on firefox tho
15:17 < ws-client> <chromeuser> unless my windows size is so smoll it cant word wrap the long git remote
15:18 < ws-client> <yeeti222222222222222> @Jupstar2 for u all good now?
15:18 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> its ez fix tho
15:18 < ws-client> <yeeti222222222222222> i fixed too big images
15:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ops wrong tab xd

15:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> didnt u do that?
15:18 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> we can remove it for a
15:18 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> i only did for URLs
15:19 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> but ofc it should work for all text that is unlimited lenght without space
15:19 < ws-client> <chromeuser> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1685798392.png
15:19 < ws-client> <chromeuser> nice
15:20 < ws-client> <chromeuser> ok next is yeeti22222222222 username wrapping xd
15:20 < ws-client> <WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW> UwU
15:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> xdd
15:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wrap/cap/chop usernames?
15:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> well do for message-author too
15:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wrap?
15:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> or just do it globally
15:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> * { overflow-wrap: anywhere }
15:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> eeee
15:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dunno xd
15:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u sure?
15:22 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> why not
15:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because it might have funny side effects that break my brain later
15:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok ill try
15:23 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> well keep this in mind: "overflow-wrap will only create a break if an entire word cannot be placed on its own line without overflowing."
15:23 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> if u ever see text wrapping unintuitively, it's probably this setting
15:23 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> well ok
15:23 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> it has the sideeffect that it will break text :D
15:23 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> if u dont want this somewhere it sucks ofc
15:24 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> are you guys working with plain css
15:24 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> yeah we coool 1999 gang

15:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> it scroll
15:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> due to images i think
15:26 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> without F12, i cannot even make it so small
15:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> ok then fine enough i guess
15:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> u satisfied mr chromium user?
15:26 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> yes
15:26 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> thanks for caring
15:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> pog
15:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> thank for using
15:26 <+bridge> <Voxel> chromium 🤢
15:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wot u usin voxel?
15:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> opera?
15:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> safari?
15:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ladybird?
15:27 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> he uses firefox
15:27 <+bridge> <Voxel> FIREFOX
15:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> FOREFIX
15:27 <+bridge> <Voxel> I WOULD NEVER TOUCH OPERA HELL NO
15:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
15:27 < ws-client> <Jupstar2> fire_needs_fix
15:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rude
15:27 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> what about IE9
15:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jupsti imoster confirmed
15:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> real jupsti has no 2
15:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
15:28 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i use lynx
15:28 < ws-client> <Jupstar> yeah, dont trust this imposter
15:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the user list so nice
15:28 <+bridge> <Voxel> opera gx worst browser
15:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can see u pop in and out
15:28 < ws-client> <Jupstar> gotta test is servo can render this website xD
15:28 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> isn't opera chromium now?
15:28 < ws-client> <Jupstar> then i can say, i use rust
15:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wats servo
15:28 <+bridge> <Voxel> yes
15:28 < ws-client> <Jupstar> its browser engine in rust chilller
15:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oo
15:29 < ws-client> <Jupstar> https://servo.org/download/
15:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> virus
15:29 < ws-client> <Jupstar> probably
15:29 < ws-client> <Jupstar> it's bianry only
15:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> servo in ddnet
15:29 < ws-client> <Jupstar> bcs static linking
15:29 <+bridge> <Voxel> firefox is so goated you can import all your chrome settings into it and then uninstall chrome forever
15:29 < ws-client> <Jupstar> bcs rust best
15:29 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
15:29 <+bridge> <Voxel> that description just looks like a bunch of buzzwords
15:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but if nobody is sending their data to google with chrome browser google goes bankrupt
15:30 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> man i shouldn't have gone home
15:30 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it's so hoooooooot
15:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if google bankrupt who gonna fund firefox xd
15:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```

15:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
15:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> stable af
15:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its legit
15:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and actually
15:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> servo stuff was added to firefox
15:30 <+bridge> <Voxel> fair
15:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah it's legit
15:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> rust is a thing thanks to mozzilla and firefox
15:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it's insanely unstable
15:30 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> rust exists cuz servo
15:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and the layout system is still far from correct 😄
15:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> servo used to point out missing stuff in rust
15:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and it had prio
15:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i really hope there will be a rust only browser engine some day
15:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then ppl begin to make it usable as lib
15:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then u can include it without javascript
15:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> servo was initially a mozilla project
15:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anywhere
15:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then world is perfect
15:31 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but mozilla is a bit dumb and fired ppl
15:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ryo smorter than mozilla ceo
15:32 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
15:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> some times, during night, mozilla ceo calls ryo and asks for help
15:32 <+bridge> <Voxel> mozilla is goated
15:33 <+bridge> <Voxel> imo
15:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's good, but still google sponsored
15:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> actually
15:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and somehow even on linux, firefox can show ads in firefox on the default page
15:33 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> microsoft wants to dig
15:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> they offered mony to make bing first
15:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i just hope firefox just uses this to get more money with the google deal
15:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> google pays to be the default search
15:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and firefox is too backward focused too often
15:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's like with gimp
15:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> everyone respects them, but it sucks
15:35 <+bridge> <power> @fokkonaut has improved his server!
15:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> firefox cant be first market share cuz ur fighting google corporate

16:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> first time ever i got this
16:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> too bad it's a release build
16:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2023-06-03 16:20:52 I textrender: Found non empty text container with index 198 with 6 quads 'Team 1'
16:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there was a team 1 on the server
16:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and they killed quite often refering the demo
16:23 <+bridge> <Voxel> :justatest:
16:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but the kill message was not visible at the end of the demo
16:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so either it just got in, or it was the previous one
16:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 3-4 seconds before
16:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf xD
16:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think i just found an unrelated bug
16:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if i join team 2 and then team 1 directly after it, it says "you cant change team so quickly"
16:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> all fine
16:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i try /team 1 for like 5 times again, until the message timeout is over
16:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then it says "you are already in this team"
16:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but the client thinks i'm not
16:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also you can invite yourself to the same team
16:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
16:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> high quality
16:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why is this fcking bug so impossible to reproduce 😭
16:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> IMPOSSIBLE
16:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1114564701934850068/test.mp4
16:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sweeting hard, bcs reproduce tryhard
16:46 <+bridge> <Voxel> LOL WHY IS THAT SO FUNNY
16:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> WTF
16:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when i resize for a long time i loose FPS
16:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but we dont have a memory leak
16:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its not increasing any RAM
16:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> WTF going on here xd
16:51 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
16:51 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> wtf
16:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> vram also looks fine
16:51 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> conditional window resize via OS?
16:51 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> maybe snapping?
16:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no i mean
16:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i resize very often like in the video
16:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then i stop and my fps decreased
16:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> permanetely xD
16:52 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Ahm, is it tied to the mouse being on one of the size options? does it trigger whenever the mouse it over it?
16:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i cannot imagine this for a different reason than memory leaks
16:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> makes 0 sense in my head xD
16:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the video is intended btw
16:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i tried to reproduce a bug 😄
16:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i control the resolution with keyboard
16:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 explain logic to me
16:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no RAM or VRAM leak, 100%
16:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is this some weird af processor cache thing or smth?
16:54 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Ok, what I see in the video is:
16:54 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> You gain focus on windowed client
16:54 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> You click on a resize option
16:54 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> You probably lose focus because of that, but the client uses global position on mouse
16:54 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> When clicked on resize option, the mouse probably didn't confirm that you let go off of the left mouse button, since you lost focus
16:54 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> And every time the global mouse position based cursor passed through a resized option, it resizes it, making it more broken
16:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it wont stop until i restart ddnet
16:54 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I can be wrong and it's not related to focus at all
16:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bro
16:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as said
16:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the resize is not a bug
16:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i do it with keyboard xD
16:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i try to reproduce a bug
16:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that happens on resize
16:55 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> This, with keyboard? bruh
16:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i was full tryhard
16:56 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Ah. did you use the up and down button to nagivate in the resize options?
16:57 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> If so, then using that kind of navigation automatically rechange the size and doesn't require Enter or any sort of confirmation
16:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> LMAO³³³³
16:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i resized it now by clicking the edge of the window for a few seconds, now my mouse won't snap into the windows anymore
16:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> KDE bad af
16:57 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
16:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> very disappointed
16:58 <+bridge> <Voxel> big bugfix pr by jup incoming
17:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's funny how buggy a WM/driver/whatever can be, if u don't use it intended
17:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 btw i think its just some x11,kde,driver bug
17:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anything else makes no sense xd
17:02 <+bridge> <Learath2> Hm, well I don't have a good theory for it except leaking stuff, so if that's out of the question, I'd profile it before the resize and after the resize
17:05 <+bridge> <Learath2> I mean some call has to be taking longer, no other way to get less fps
17:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'll report to KDE, lets see what they'll answer
17:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just annoying that they all have their own gitlab instance
17:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and i forget about accounts
17:06 <+bridge> <Learath2> It's probably obvious enough in even a sampling profiler so might not be the hardest thing to try
17:06 <+bridge> <Learath2> Just get a debug build and grab some samples with perf
17:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh true
17:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but if its outside of ddnet?
17:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what profiler should i use then
17:08 <+bridge> <Learath2> Still it should be a call we do taking longer, no? I can't think of any other way an external thing can pace us
17:08 <+bridge> <Learath2> Somewhere we call into maybe the driver or sdl and it hangs, leading to less fps
17:09 <+bridge> <Learath2> Then you know which vendor to shout at 😄
17:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sad that there are no good profiling tools that can do anything
17:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least i dont know any xd
17:09 <+bridge> <Learath2> Wym by can do anything?
17:10 <+bridge> <Learath2> I've had a lot of luck with perf on linux. Lots of control over the sampling and what is sampled
17:10 <+bridge> <Learath2> You can sample the stack, you can sample cpu counters
17:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'll try, i think i used it once
17:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it doesnt generate fancy ass reports like valgrind's callgrind
17:11 <+bridge> <Learath2> It has it's own tool to browse around in the report, which can indeed get a bit janky
17:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 but u can use perf so it samples exactly when i tell it too?
17:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> like there is some control tool, like callgrind_control?
17:13 <+bridge> <Learath2> You can attach to a pid, make it probe at say 97hz for 10s for 9700 samples and it'll detach
17:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah nice
17:13 <+bridge> <Learath2> Since it doesn't instrument the code it doesn't need special stuff to control
17:16 <+bridge> <Chairn> probably some state somewhere that changes after resizing leading to a different code path
17:16 <+bridge> <Chairn> could also be hardware related at the gpu level
17:17 <+bridge> <Chairn> once you resize, it changes some stuff at the hardware level and doesn't fall back until the gpu is released
17:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> who codes like that 😂
17:19 <+bridge> <Voxel> uhhhhhhhh
17:20 <+bridge> <Voxel> wait this is gpu stuff nvm
17:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh more kernel calls xd

17:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> voxel i blame u
17:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its defs killmsgs
17:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
18:00 <+bridge> <Voxel> listen im a graphic designer not a low level programmer ‼️
18:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah yeah chill, if it's so hard to reproduce then it's design flaw somewhere else 😄
18:00 <+bridge> <Voxel> all i know is how to do if statements and what i see in the same code file

18:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😂
18:05 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> bruh
18:05 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> he set the fish on fire
18:15 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> It happened to me though in fng which doesn't have the new killsmsgs
18:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> jup, but maybe u were on ddnet server before
18:21 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> only fng ;) but could be because I was on dfng ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
18:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its also just reproducable with team kill msgs
18:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they are not alone the cause
18:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sadly our cmake is so bloated with different linkers that i currently struggle to compile the game so that it doesnt suck to use with `backtrace` linux calls
18:29 <+bridge> <Voxel> make it less bloat :troll:
18:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/757720336274948198/1114591545488851196
18:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> past me helped me out
18:29 <+bridge> <Voxel> gg
18:29 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> past self = best self ;)
18:30 <+bridge> <Voxel> tru
18:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> LOL
18:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the bug is so fck obvious
18:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so obvious af
18:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 0 IQ
18:47 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 0 best number ;)
18:48 <+bridge> <Voxel> what was the obvious bug
18:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'll show soon, wanna check whom to blame
18:48 <+bridge> <Voxel> :justatest:
18:49 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I'll try to find it cause 0 best number 👻 🎩
18:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
18:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Jupeyy_Keks you fucking loser
18:50 <+bridge> <Voxel> you're blaming YOURSELF?
18:50 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> @Jupeyy_Keks noob
18:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3430
18:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this is the reason
18:50 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> learn2code
18:50 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> :troll:
18:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so its potentially broken since 2020
18:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but its triggered mostly bcs of voxels code
18:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😂
18:51 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> @Voxel your fish is fine
18:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Voxel if u wouldnt have copy pasted u'd have noticed
18:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😂
18:51 <+bridge> <Voxel> but im too dumb not to
18:52 <+bridge> <Voxel> it made sense when i looked at it ‼️
19:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well at least this nightmare is over now
19:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😂
19:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> found new x11 bugs in the meantime
19:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omagawd @Jupstar ✪
19:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i made !jup obsolete pog
19:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u can now do @j<tab>
19:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> EPIC
19:03 <+bridge> <Voxel> YAY
19:03 <+bridge> <Voxel> but also no more ! rust :(
19:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> !rust really?
19:04 < chillerbot1> @Ryozuki
19:05 <+bridge> <Learath2> Is this before and after resize or before and during resize?
19:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the one with many calls to kernel is after resize
19:06 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> chillerdragon
19:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> before and after
19:06 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> do u know if fokkos server doesnt allow vanilla 0.6 clients to connect
19:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> basically
19:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cyberFighter
19:06 <+bridge> <Learath2> Intriguing I think I'll do a couple of my own, see if it happens on my system too
19:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can ping back now!
19:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> epic
19:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cyberFighter yes i know and no it does not

19:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
19:16 <+bridge> <Voxel> :justatest:
19:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but either he is awake at 4am always or he is in asia
19:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> it takes not big brain
19:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :brain:
19:16 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> or maybe america?
19:16 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> i kinda forgot how much ass vanilla 0.6 is
19:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rude
19:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its nice
19:16 <+bridge> <Voxel> uh ih

19:17 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the emote doesnt work
19:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> works for me :p
19:17 <+bridge> <Voxel> im a good tee 😇 i would never
19:17 <+bridge> <Voxel> (ok)
19:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bu ye @Ryozuki i should use the discord magic thingies to send it to u
19:18 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> chillertroll
19:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can u send me the magic emote string again?
19:18 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> chillerdragon when next map rls
19:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> blchill?
19:18 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> on ddnet
19:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> o
19:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when ddnet moves map testing to non discord again
19:18 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> fun map to explore until u realise like 90% of the map is useless
19:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wait wat
19:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u want to release BlmapChill on ddnet?!
19:19 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> no
19:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
19:19 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> i mean im not saying im against it
19:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what is a fun map then?
19:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
19:19 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> :justatest:
19:20 <+bridge> <Voxel> yk i wonder
19:20 <+bridge> <Voxel> why are there blocker maps but no way to submit new ones
19:20 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> look at the maps that get insta declined in submit maps
19:20 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> then think of that but amplified x10
19:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a
19:20 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> and that would be block map submits
19:21 <+bridge> <Voxel> i saw someone try and submit one lolol
19:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there are less block map mappers tho
19:21 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> turkish people:
19:21 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> russian people:
19:21 <+bridge> <Voxel> i want to make a blocker map thats actually fun to play
19:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> @Voxel there is one block map that is more than fun to play
19:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> its literal crack
19:22 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> fun is subjective :feelsbadman:
19:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon222> objectivley the best map in all history of gaming
19:22 <+bridge> <Voxel> if it starts with a fokkos and ends with a playground then im not interested
19:22 <+bridge> <Voxel> :troll:
19:22 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> chillerdragon when the map doesnt have poop shidfard mega 5 jumps and taser
19:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats neither a map nor what i am talking about
19:23 <+bridge> <Voxel> ok then what
19:23 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> hes talking about the drug
19:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its the map Unstable by Tee 3D
19:23 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> oh
19:23 <+bridge> <Voxel> huh
19:23 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> unstable like fokkonauts code i get it
19:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1685813045.png
19:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> inhuman perfection
19:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> chiller will u use edlang once its usable
19:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
19:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :p
19:24 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> oh yuck
19:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i need a mascot
19:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ideas
19:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> rust is a crab
19:24 <+bridge> <Voxel> wha

19:24 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> no
19:25 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> WHAT IS THAT
19:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe i should name it iron
19:25 <+bridge> <Voxel> use your shitty ai gemerated rust chan image LOL
19:25 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> my lang is not rust
19:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but iron
19:25 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> chillerdragon tee 3d sure was cooking... i AINT eating THO!
19:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it good map trust me
19:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nothing better will ever come
19:25 <+bridge> <Voxel> harvard called.. it said wrong number 🌊🌊🌊🌊
19:26 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> can u host it
19:26 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> lmfao

19:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it trap
19:27 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
19:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> go leak greenthing emote
19:35 <+bridge> <Voxel> this is your new mascot @Ryozuki 
19:35 <+bridge> <Voxel> his name is edwig
19:35 <+bridge> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1114608311787081839/Screenshot_20230603_133506_ibisPaint_X.jpg
19:36 <+bridge> <Voxel> he is Trustworthy and Very Skilled at Edlang
19:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> man this is so funny. After knowing the bug and doing refactoring what you did to reproduce the bug, I now notice how often I was close to getting the idea behind the bug. Yet my brain decided to try a different thing first, ignoring the almost obvious xD
19:38 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> chillerdragon: whats chidraqul
19:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - I wondered what happens if invalid killmsgs are generated
19:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - I wondered why we use a temporary object (which caused the bug)
19:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and so on D:
19:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cyberFighter text based 2d platformer
19:38 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> huh
19:38 <+bridge> <Voxel> unrelated but what is codecov
19:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/chidraqul/chidraqul4/raw/master/img/chidraqul4.png
19:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ChillerDragon, does it show all Discord ppl that ever wrote?
19:39 <+bridge> <Learath2> code coverage, checks how much of the codebase our tests cover
19:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> Can it also show the #tag
19:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar no
19:39 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> at that point just make doom with text in ur server chillerdragon:
19:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it only adds the ones it has in backlog
19:39 <+bridge> <Voxel> ohh so only 27 of the code is tested? LOL
19:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they are added in the frontend so all messages you see its authors get tracked
19:40 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but at least <tab> works for discord ppl
19:40 < ws-client> <Jupstar> nice
19:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes 
19:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> very pog
19:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i even doubt that tbh
19:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tests can be bad too xD
19:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what do you mean by hastag?
19:40 <+bridge> <Learath2> Yes, higher the better, I find the 100% target by modern projects a little too anal, but yes. Since we added tests afterwards our coverage is fairly low
19:41 <+bridge> <Learath2> Newfangled projects will do "test driven development", that means every PR must come with a test for it
19:41 <+bridge> <Learath2> Well technically you'll first write the test, then develop the feature. So the PR thing is more a result, but whatever, same difference
19:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xdd
19:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> >  Can it also show the #tag 
19:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar
19:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat does that mean?
19:44 < ws-client> <Jupstar> discord tag
19:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> whats that
19:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a
19:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> aaa
19:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the number
19:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ryozuki#2188
19:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
19:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this info doesnt arrive on irc
19:44 <+bridge> <Voxel> discords gonna remove the numbers soon
19:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah right
19:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> finally
19:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> trash system
19:45 <+bridge> <Voxel> i didnt think so tbh
19:45 <+bridge> <Voxel> easier to scam people
19:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
19:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> deen#6969
19:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> legit
19:46 <+bridge> <Voxel> cant wait for my name to be taken so i have to be @/voxeldoesart2763
19:46 <+bridge> <Voxel> also cant wait for the discord username black market
19:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ChillerDragon: quick merge
19:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okok
19:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> deployed
19:52 < ws-client> <Jupstar> puh almost died bcs of the white ones
19:52 < ws-client> <Jupstar> xd
19:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes fair
19:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they ugly af in chromium
19:53 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ikr
19:53 < ws-client> <Jupstar> windows 98
19:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
19:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok soon this shit is as bloated and slow and bugged as discord
19:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> amazing
19:54 < ws-client> <Jupstar> tru
19:54 < ws-client> <Jupstar> increase compression ratio in webpack
19:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does that help?
19:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i dunno if that even exists
19:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but lets rewrite it in rust
19:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
19:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> eee
19:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> uff
19:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar> wasm is fast af
19:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar> when loading
19:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i was told wasm is slow af
19:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if only thing u do is query selector stuff i do
19:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar> from benchmarks its bit faster than JS
19:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because its just overhead to js
19:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but sadly interacting with DOM requires JS anyway
19:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
19:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that
19:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar> yeah, but its still the fastest in the west
19:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so we would have to properly not use the dom
19:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and no html and css
19:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just draw some webgl stuff idk
19:57 < ws-client> <Jupstar> https://takahirox.github.io/WebAssembly-benchmark/
19:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i dont know shit about it
19:57 < ws-client> <Jupstar> your gaming pc
19:57 < ws-client> <Jupstar> vs my 1999 PC
19:57 < ws-client> <Jupstar> lets see who wins
19:57 < ws-client> <Jupstar> collision:  JavaScript: 293.8800 WebAssembly: 285.7200
19:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1685815065.png
19:58 < ws-client> <Jupstar> fibo:  JavaScript: 617.9400 WebAssembly: 271.3800
19:58 < ws-client> <Jupstar> lmao
19:58 < ws-client> <Jupstar> wtf javascript doing
19:58 < ws-client> <Jupstar> imagconvolute:  JavaScript: 34.0000 WebAssembly: 25.1600
19:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> takes so long
19:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i rq

19:58 < ws-client> <Jupstar> in most wasm wins
19:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon>   Fibonacci Result (average [ms]) JavaScript: 844.8000 WebAssembly: 185.6000 JavaScript/WebAssembly: 4.5517
19:58 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but there were a few where JS wins
19:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> :joy:
19:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> FIREFOX
19:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> doing dom stuff i guess
19:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: 
19:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> slower than my PC
19:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> how does it feel chiller?
19:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> normal
19:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
19:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but wasm great results
19:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i think ff and chrome uses both the same wasm runtime?
19:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i cant remember
19:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> isnt every browser using v8 under the hood these days?
19:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but they were similary fast
20:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why is ff js slower?!
20:00 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i dunno, firefox does its own, doesnt it
20:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this "benchmark" is random number generator anyways
20:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and mining bitcoin under the hood
20:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar> hehehe

20:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> now i just need my own cdn to get rid of discord ip grabber links and allow file uploads
20:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
20:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this video tag might be an actual game changer
20:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do u know <object> ?
20:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i never watched any videos in this channel because it always downloaded them if i click the link unlike images that just show
20:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no?
20:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it allows to put basically anything the browser supports into it
20:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> PDFs
20:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and shit xD
20:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> woah

20:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nah xd
20:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> browser must support it
20:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah
20:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> browser supports binary
20:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sry missread
20:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> BASE64
20:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or URL
20:20 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> possible good update?
20:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ u know which settings affect tabbing? seems like i broke it once again xd
20:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> alt+tab does nothing only atlt+tab and alt+tab again
20:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and alt+^ doesnt work at all
21:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wat
21:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if i press alt+tab once it just opens the tabin menu if i release nothing happens
21:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if i want to switch between two instances with altr+^ nothing happens either
21:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sry bro, i have 0 iq
21:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what instances xD
21:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean swicth between two ddnet clients
21:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its gnome feature i think
21:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> alt+tab is tab between applications like tab to browser
21:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can do that too
21:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and alt+^ is tab from 1 ddnet cleint to other ddnet client
21:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but my tabbin is cursed rn im sure its a cfg
21:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i did a git diff to old pc didnt find anything
21:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok but sory i cant help with gnomium
21:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> robit, stop having RL and make new release
21:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
21:40 <+bridge> <hus3h> ChillerDragon: I had this alt-tab bug for a while and it happened randomly, either the upgrade to gnome 44 / some package update fixed it or I didn't alt-tab enough yet for it to appear again. I remember finding out that it happens even without any extension enabled
21:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh no da scr0llz
21:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1685821549.png
21:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> da fakin hilite didnt wrap jupsti
21:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @hus3h i mean alt+tab technically works but not as i want it. What i want is press alt+tab and reach my browser. What now happens is i press alt+tab twice and i reach my terminal if i press it thrice i reach my browser
21:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u sure thats a gnome bug not a client setting?
21:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar hilit with long message xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
21:50 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ChillerDragon: add      box-sizing: border-box;  to .highlight
21:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar> every time u use padding, use this, except u know what you doing
21:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk wat i do
21:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can we add this to * ?
21:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
21:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar> np, that's why i'm here
21:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar> yeah should work too
21:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar> there are ppl that claim css should default to this
21:52 < ws-client> <Jupstar> u know css very bloated, but very powerful
21:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea seems sane
21:52 < ws-client> <Jupstar> we just need CSS-next
21:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wot
21:52 < ws-client> <Jupstar> bloat free new version
21:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont think css is very bloated
21:53 <+bridge> <hus3h> ChillerDragon: yes to me one alt-tab would open the popup but highlight the current focused window instead of the other one, so I'd have to press twice to get the next window
21:53 <+bridge> <hus3h> seems like a bug to me as it changes the normal behaviour and it would happen all of sudden without changes in settings and a shell restart usually fixed it
21:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon222> oh nice to know @hus3h thanks
21:56 < ws-client> <pinger> @ChillerDragon xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

21:57 <+bridge> <hus3h> ChillerDragon: no problem! I suspected having nautilus or vscode open being the cause of it but nothing confirmed, maybe some update will fix it for you
21:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1114644046862884924/image.png

22:29 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> No xD 0 IQ = pog
22:30 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> What went wrong and why it crashed
22:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> basically, we created the text container in a temp variable
22:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and conditionally didnt save the result of it
22:31 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Ok thanks. welp I had no chance of figure it out guess !0 iq for me then 😅
