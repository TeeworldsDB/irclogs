02:14 < bridge_> <patiga> I'm in a virtual machine and my mouse in DDNet is inverse (I move it up, in-game it moves down)
02:14 < bridge_> <patiga> is there already some inverse mouse mode in the client? iirc other games have that
02:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> might want to try experimenting with mouse capture modes @patiga
02:48 < bridge_> <patiga> how would I do that?
02:48 < bridge_> <patiga> ah, mosue capture modes from the vm?
02:48 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, vm
09:03 < bridge_> <wartoz_> Well, it looks like this map is one level above my computer administrator, and I can't delete it.

14:22 < bridge_> <furooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo> It shows what files they changed to add the Galician Language.

14:59 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Is there any good way to get a pointer to `CGameClient` from `CEditor::Init`? I cant even just pass it as an argument because I dont think its available in `CClient::Run` either.
15:19 < bridge_> <robyt3> `CGameClient *pGameClient = (CGameClient *)Kernel()->RequestInterface<IGameClient>()`
15:19 < bridge_> <robyt3> Although this should probably be avoided. What are you trying to do?
15:29 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Im trying to initialize a `CComponent`. Im also not quite sure how to do that yet, but the first step would be getting a pointer to the `CGameClient` class
15:31 < bridge_> <robyt3> And you want to create `CComponent`s for editor components?
15:31 < bridge_> <robyt3> I'm not sure if it's a good idea to use `CComponent` for the individual editor components or if it would be better to add separate `CEditorComponent`.
15:32 < bridge_> <learath2> You definitely want a CEditorComponent. The editor is just too far cut off from the rest
15:33 < bridge_> <robyt3> I think there are two separate steps, but you are mostly only looking for one:
15:33 < bridge_> <robyt3> 1. Wrap the editor using a gameclient component so it's not a special thing in the engine
15:33 < bridge_> <robyt3> 2. Individual editor components that work like the gameclient components but are part of the editor
15:34 < bridge_> <robyt3> The first is mostly engine cleanup but it would be a pain because gameclient and editor also use separate `CUI` so this could cause various bugs
15:36 < bridge_> <marmare_314> So step 1 would be making `CEditor` inherit `CComponent` instead of `IInterface`?
15:36 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yeah, but the steps are mostly independent I'd say
15:37 < bridge_> <robyt3> I think you were mostly interested in the second part, making the editor more modular
15:39 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Yes although the first one doesnt sound like too much work either
15:39 < bridge_> <robyt3> That's before you get the bug reports :justatest:

15:54 < bridge_> <solayer> I understand.

16:15 < bridge_> <teero777> @patiga nice solution. I can already see my pc on fire trying to zoom out on 2000x2000 maps xd

17:05 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> @patiga Have you considered using indexed png? It allows max 256 colors so you could fit them all in a single tileset -1 :justatest: and there are tools that do a great job at converting full color images to indexed
17:06 < bridge_> <patiga> not yet, I'll have a look at how they work
17:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```css
17:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> html {
17:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki>   max-width: 70ch;
17:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki>   padding: 3em 1em;
17:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki>   margin: auto;
17:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki>   line-height: 1.75;
17:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki>   font-size: 1.25em;
17:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> }
17:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
17:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i like the bare html cuz its hacker, but just adding this makes it better imh oxd
17:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> on another note
17:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i added player searching on the master
17:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://ddstats.org/players
17:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> with fuzzy search
17:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1140301060020375592/image.png
17:09 < bridge_> <patiga> I do like the look of the text with this, though the images take up a lot of space. do you have some idea for that?
17:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u want the smaller?
17:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or take consistenly the same width as the text
17:11 < bridge_> <patiga> the thing is, I don't know here, because they'll either be small or take more space vertically. would it be possible for the images to ignore the sidebars?
17:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> sidebars is padding
17:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> thats hard
17:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think u should just make em take full width
17:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1140302166788157460/image.png
17:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or if u want to edit the html
17:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u can put group of images inside a div
17:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and use flex to put em nicely
17:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but that wont be simple html anymore
17:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
17:15 < bridge_> <solayer> how do you make the code colors blue, red, orange, etc?

17:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> \`\`\`html
17:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
17:15 < bridge_> <solayer> a
17:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well css
17:16 < bridge_> <solayer> ```a```
17:17 < bridge_> <solayer> ```ini

17:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> n🍦
17:56 < bridge_> <patiga> this sounds like a good way to compress the image if you want a single tilemap. but the limit of 256 colors is the main limit I wanted to overcome
18:01 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> Yeah your way looks cool if you really want full color, but a palette is more than good enough for pixelart
18:02 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> it could be as simple as a script that uses color index as tile index
18:05 < bridge_> <solayer> https://tenor.com/view/ddnet-pain-gif-20029058
18:05 < bridge_> <patiga> I think the solution is quite fun, regardless of how much real use it will/should get :)
