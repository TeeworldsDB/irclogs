14:54 <@deen> If anyone wants to do some fun analysis on DDNet ranks: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1852
15:01 < laxadedi> if I would someday do something with that, I would have prefered json over csv
15:02 < laxadedi> But csv is better than nothing :)
15:03 < Sadale> deen, zip :<
15:03 < Sadale> deen, gz > zip
15:04 <@deen> i thought csv would be simpler to use than json
15:05 <@deen> Sadale: i prefer gzip too, but then i'd have to provide 2 versions, because windows people often can't open tar.gz
15:06 <@deen> it's flat data anyway, so no need for json's nesting
15:08 < Sadale> deen, I agree on csv > json. Especially if you have to use some programming language that has weak library like C or C++
15:09 < Sadale> The standard library of these PL are very weak in parsing stuffs. :<
15:10 < Sadale> wow. Just googled. I didn't know the existence of strtok. It's essentially a split :p
15:10 < Sadale> :o
15:11 <@EastByte> it does creepy stuff though
15:20 < laxadedi> What language doesn't have a good json lib oO ?
15:20 < laxadedi> most windows people use 7zip and winrar, they both support gzip I think
15:21 <@deen> laxadedi: excel for example doesn't, i think
15:32 < o_be_one> hi all :)
15:35 <@deen> hi
16:26 < o_be_one> just to let you know that OVH is working on a better anti-ddos for gaming, release is for end of 2015 (and it will be included in all hostings if i remember well)
16:40 <@deen> nice
17:27 < Learath2> Apart from the name thing the bot is ready to deploy :D
17:27 < Learath2> its really hard to name stuff
17:32 <@deen> stuff?
17:32 < Edible> justsaywhatitdoesnomatterhowlongittakesvariable
17:32 <@deen> var1, var2, var3, ...
17:32 <@deen> race server is really hard
17:33 < Edible> stuff1, stuff2, stuff3
17:37 < Savander> hard?
17:37 <@deen> Savander: yeah
17:39 < Savander> what you mean
17:39 < Savander> maps are difficulty?
17:39 < Savander> or?:D
17:39 <@deen> hard to finish the maps, yes
17:39 < Savander> aaah
17:39 < Savander> get50 is hard
17:39 <@deen> at least for me
17:42 < Learath2> what do you name an irc bot
18:05 <@deen> nimda2
18:08 < Learath2> nimda is such a good name wasted on a php bot :D
18:26 < Edible> depends on the use
18:26 < Edible> why is nimda a good name? is it a pun?
18:38 <@deen> Edible: it's admin reverted and nim is the language Learath2 uses
18:38 <@deen> backwards*
18:38 < Edible> ahh
18:38 < Edible> brilliant
18:38 < Edible> try an anagram then
18:47 < Learath2> i think i'll limit it to being in one channel at a time
19:15 < o_be_one> hello
19:16 < o_be_one> hey deen just to let you know the CAN hosting will move to other host
19:35 <@deen> o_be_one: ok, thanks for the info
19:37 < o_be_one> no problem, tell me when you will be ready for the transfert, today or tomorrow
19:37 < Nimda> Take it noobly by Ñı©Ø just released on Novice at 2015-07-20 19:32
19:41 <@deen> I'm ready
19:41 <@deen> since CAN is currently down, should do it as quickly as possible I guess, o_be_one 
19:41 < o_be_one> oh really ? ok i do it now
19:44 < o_be_one> deen, have you a public ssh key ?
19:45 <@deen> see PM
19:49 < Learath2> and i just git reset --hard HEAD about an hour of work \o/
19:49 <@deen> ouch
19:49 < Learath2> good thing i work slow
19:50 < Learath2> now need to maintain some kind of a plugin name to constructor mapping so I can load/unload plugins on the fly
19:51 < Learath2> deen: any data structure that comes to mind ?
19:51 < Learath2> is there something like hashtable in nim ?
19:52 < Learath2> oh yep its called a table :P
20:34 <@deen> Meskalin using his client to ban whoever he wants: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1856
20:35 <@deen> or tplink01, not sure if that actually is a person
20:36 < Learath2> isnt there one ip one vote policy ?
20:36 <@deen> he remote-controls everyone using his client
20:36 < Learath2> or is he just using his client as a botnet
20:36 <@deen> so he lets their dummies join on a server and vote
20:36 <@deen> or this is some ip spoofing
20:38 <@EastByte> nah it's his 'botnet'
20:39 < Learath2> why do people even use his client knowing its a botnet :P
20:39 <@EastByte> I can see the commands live "got vote: 37.120.169.241:1111 1"
20:39 <@EastByte> define backdoor/malware/botnet to newbies
20:39 <@deen> EastByte: ok
20:39 <@deen> Learath2: they don't know, that's the thing
20:40 <@EastByte> people often come into his chat and ask about baumalein having a virus
20:41 <@deen> yeah, because i broadcasted that when they join^^
20:41 <@deen> now he changed the version number i think
20:42 <@EastByte> the dummys he connects also do not a proper tw handshake
20:43 <@deen> how does he send the commands?
20:43 <@deen> udp?
20:43 <@EastByte> I guess simply statically in one row, yes
20:43 <@EastByte> so eeeee's anti spoof patch would fix it
20:45 <@deen> ok, good
20:45 <@deen> can he send chat messages?
20:45 <@EastByte> he could, why?
20:46 <@EastByte> I mean not right now I think
20:46 <@deen> we should just buy a spoofing server and spoof some messages so that the client users write in chat: "I'm part of a botnet and don't know it. Make fun of me"
20:46 <@EastByte> well that's evil
20:47 <@deen> how else can we prevent it?
20:47 <@deen> he can just fix the client to do proper connections, then it will work no matter the spoofing protection
20:47 <@EastByte> right
20:48 <@EastByte> not sure
20:48 < o_be_one> oh some day ago i did a broadcast on V3R cause of players saying there ip, so ive told them to use DDNet.TW instead of other client
20:48 <@deen> o_be_one: right, i see that sometimes as well
20:48 < o_be_one> nazar use often a way to do a bot attak like in the thread
20:49 <@EastByte> "(id: 32, num2: 124, name: o_tee_one (Outdated), clientAddr: 0.0.0.0, serverAddr: 5.39.0.70:8606)"
20:49 <@EastByte> o_be_one: is this you? :P
20:49 < o_be_one> what kind of spoofing server is it ?
20:49 < o_be_one> EastByte, im not connecter to pepe
20:49 < o_be_one> !help
20:49 < o_be_one> !twp o_tee_one
20:49 < Nimda> o_tee_one is currently playing blmapPepe on server : ! [BLOCKER 64p] r0x.fr S6 - old blmapPepe.
20:49 < o_be_one> im on blmap pepe
20:50 <@EastByte> so that's a faker?
20:50 < o_be_one> how you can see this information EastByte ?
20:50 < o_be_one> yes its a faker EastByte 
20:50 < o_be_one> you can check Ping or IP to see
20:50 < Savander> !twp Savander
20:50 < Nimda> No Savander found online.
20:50 < Savander> !twp iG_Savander
20:50 < Nimda> No iG_Savander found online.
20:50 <@EastByte> this information is delivered by the versionsrv of baumalein
20:50 < o_be_one> my ping is 140 to 160 on DDNet EUR
20:51 < o_be_one> and my ip resolve to Canada
20:51 < o_be_one> (videotron)
20:52 <@deen> I've been going around telling people not to use that client, but that clearly is no long-term solution
20:52 <@deen> hm
20:52 <@EastByte> 37 users already
20:52 <@deen> ouch
20:53 <@deen> in just a few seconds he could kick everyone from all servers
20:56 < Chairn> !help
20:56 <@deen> EastByte: can you tell me another name of a baumalein client user and server?
20:56 <@deen> (one that's on ddnet)
20:56 <@deen> want to check something
20:56 < eeeee> i wonder if we could somehow report the binary to microsoft or sth, so that they mark it as malware in their "windows defender" antivirus
20:56 <@EastByte> (id: 29, num2: -1, name: Rapsor, clientAddr: 0.0.0.0, serverAddr: 74.91.114.132:8305)
20:56 < eeeee> would be a good troll
20:57 <@EastByte> eeeee: if it would be that easy, people could do the same with ddnet
20:57 <@deen> eeeee: not just troll, i consider it malware
20:57 < eeeee> but we actually have a case of it being a botnet program
20:57 <@deen> but explaining how it's malware to them might not be easy
20:57 <@deen> and ddnet would probably be detected as well then^^
20:57 <@deen> right, maybe we should check how to contact AV companies
20:58 <@deen> EastByte: especially you, you found out how to read all the info it sends
20:58 <@EastByte> meh
20:58 <@EastByte> I think it would be pretty easy to block such votes
20:59 < o_be_one> virus bulletin can do this no ?
20:59 < Learath2> TIL you cant pass other modules functions even if they are exported :(
20:59 <@EastByte> baumalein also has the problem that people aren't updating their clients
20:59 <@EastByte> so by blocking the name 'tplink' the problem would be gone for weeks
21:00 <@deen> Learath2: {.procvar.}
21:01 <@EastByte> although doing such patches without private repo is a bad idea
21:01 <@deen> I don't want to run a private repo for ddnet =/
21:01 <@deen> then other servers don't have the same protection for example
21:02 < Learath2> <3 deen
21:03 < Learath2> well now that you said it out in the public lets use it anyways
21:03 <@deen> it would be the easiest solution, but in the end it's just security by obscurity
21:03 <@deen> haha
21:04 < Learath2> he wont be able to update it for a time
21:05 < eeeee> security by obscurity would work great in this case where attackers do it for fun
21:05 < eeeee> because digging through obscure shit is no fun at all
21:05 <@EastByte> but ddnet is opensource...
21:09 <@EastByte> have you overheard the discussion in #teeworlds regarding teeworlds' license?
21:09 <@EastByte> matricks clearly is angry
21:10 < Learath2> matricks went mad the day teeworlds got greenlit
21:10 < eeeee> did he really?
21:11 < Learath2> well he got clearly upset then he got clearly angry because of his weird hate towards centralized anything
21:11 <@EastByte> "@matricks | should have made teeworlds gpl :/"
21:12 <@heinrich5991> to be fair, none of the open-source licensing would have prevented TW from appearing on steam
21:12 <@heinrich5991> (not even gpl)
21:12 < eeeee> should've made it proprietary quality software
21:12 <@heinrich5991> that'd have worked
21:12 < eeeee> would get rid of all the hated mods too
21:12 < WolfAlex> yea
21:12 < Learath2> GPL would have prevented TW from having any steam integration and thats about it
21:13 < WolfAlex> and all players :D
21:13 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: not even that
21:13 <@heinrich5991> well, maybe
21:13 < Learath2> uhm isnt steam api stuff under nda so cant appear in open source code ?
21:13 <@heinrich5991> I don't know how that stuff works re dynamic linking
21:14 <@heinrich5991> according to them, it can. I mailed them a year ago or so
21:14 < eeeee> prolly can't haz dynamic linking unless it's lgpl, but afaik steam has some dynamic injection stuff
21:14 <@heinrich5991> (them = stema guys)
21:14 <@heinrich5991> *steam
21:14 < Learath2> well it would be nice if we could get some steam integration
21:14 <@deen> well, i don't like steam much either =/
21:15 < Learath2> well not a fan but i do like having somewhere to buy games and not care about any semantics
21:15 < eeeee> steam integration is only useful when most players have steam
21:15 < Savander> most players has steam
21:16 < Learath2> I know 90% that when i buy a game on steam it will install and work regardless of which shitty ass studio made it
21:16 <@heinrich5991> yea
21:16 <@heinrich5991> and doing away with cds and stuff is great too
21:16 <@heinrich5991> (and you can actually reinstall it on a different computer)
21:17 < eeeee> maybe we can also show you where your friends are playing with notifications and other bells and whistles
21:17 < Learath2> thats what i meant by some basic integration
21:17 <@EastByte> and we all love Valve since it did a lot improving linux gaming
21:17 < Learath2> like the rightclick join game
21:18 < eeeee> i wonder how assraep are the legal terms for all of that
21:18 < Learath2> I should give linux as my main os again sometime
21:18 < Learath2> give linux a try*
21:19 <@deen> but i guess steam makes sense, since extracting a zip file to install a game is way too complicated for many
21:19 <@deen> when i ask people why they don't use ddnet client i sometimes get the answer that they didn't know how to install it
21:20 < Learath2> the main reason I want tw on steam is just to have more people really
21:20 <@deen> (no idea who installed TW for them though^^)
21:20 <@EastByte> there are installers I think
21:20 <@heinrich5991> tw had an installer for some version
21:20 <@EastByte> or in package managers for linux
21:20 < Learath2> there is also package managers on linux
21:20 < Chairn> deen: the main reason is that people are way too lazy
21:20 < Learath2> which is where i found the game actually :D
21:20 <@deen> Chairn: nono, i actually had to explain the steps of extracting a few times
21:21 <@heinrich5991> yea, it's non-trivial
21:21 < Chairn> on windows, just right click
21:21 <@heinrich5991> especially because windows does not display zips differently from folders
21:21 < Chairn> and that's it
21:21 <@heinrich5991> it looks just like a folder, but double-clicking the exe does not work
21:21 <@deen> Chairn: nah, they think it's just a folder, they open it and run the DDNet.exe and it doesn't work
21:21 < Chairn> hum, the picture is a lil bit different
21:22 <@heinrich5991> yea
21:22 < Chairn> there is a zipper on the folder for .zip files
21:22 <@deen> maybe we just need an installer that just extracts it and makes some shortcuts
21:22 < Chairn> and folders are always shown at top
21:22 <@heinrich5991> deen: since you have auto-update, have you thought about just loading all the other stuff using the game client?
21:22 <@deen> heinrich5991: nope, but fun idea
21:22 <@heinrich5991> Chairn: not sure what you're trying to do here
21:22 <@heinrich5991> I'm sure you can distinguish a zip file from a folder
21:22 <@heinrich5991> don't need to convince me
21:23 <@heinrich5991> I mean, you even foudn the IRC button on your computer
21:23 < Chairn> ...
21:23 <@deen> heinrich5991: that would create a mess though. People download the DDNet.exe, then run it and suddenly they have 20 files lying around
21:23 <@deen> and being on steam is probably free publicity as well
21:23 <@heinrich5991> that's true
21:24 < Learath2> I could get the self downloading client done but i dont think i want to create another update crisis with people stuck on versions :D
21:24 < fstd> how long has tw been available on steam now?
21:24 <@heinrich5991> fstd: -2 weeks
21:24 < fstd> oh:)
21:25 <@deen> heinrich5991: i hope it comes on steam before 0.7 appears
21:25 <@deen> then ddnet might get a few of the new steam players :P
21:25 <@EastByte> deen: baumalein client seems to have more AV detections than ddnet
21:25 <@heinrich5991> I hope 0.7 doesn't get published in the current state
21:25 <@heinrich5991> way to unpolished
21:25 <@deen> EastByte: more AVs detect it as malware?
21:25 <@EastByte> yes
21:25 <@EastByte> this is quite strange
21:26 <@deen> cool, didn't expect their heuristics to work that well
21:26 <@EastByte> haha, for sure^^
21:26 <@deen> or someone reported it
21:26 <@EastByte> maybe
21:26 <@deen> https://www.google.com/safebrowsing/report_badware/ http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/how-report-malware-or-false-positives-multiple-antivirus-vendors.htm
21:26 <@deen> if anyone is bored ^
21:27 < Learath2> I hope 0.7 doesn't come out at all before some serious discussion
21:27 <@heinrich5991> hah
21:27 < Learath2> but its oy we might all go to sleep one night and the next day its suddenly here with 10000 commits
21:27 < Learath2> iirc 0.6 also was a mass of commits all pushed at once
21:28 <@deen> yeah, currently 0.7 isn't really usable for me with the SDL2 issues
21:28 <@EastByte> we know why ddnet isn't on sdl2
21:28 <@heinrich5991> because it doesn't work for deen :P
21:28 <@EastByte> right^^
21:29 <@deen> of course :P
21:29 <@deen> and we have no way to update dlls :P
21:30 <@EastByte> atleast we have openssl shipped
21:30 <@heinrich5991> mh… the download isn't agnostic to file type?
21:30 <@deen> it is, but DLLs need special handling for 2 reasons:
21:30 <@deen> 1. they can't be replaced while the program is running on Win XP
21:31 <@deen> 2. we need to use a different DLL dependent on 32/64 bit
21:31 <@heinrich5991> win xp?
21:31 < Learath2> on Win Xp idk what to do
21:31 <@deen> yes, we need win xp support
21:31 <@heinrich5991> must be my vm playing teeworlds :P
21:31 <@deen> many still use it
21:31  * EastByte throws the word 'launcher' into the room and hides
21:31 < Learath2> b/c after the app is killed the dlls arent necessarily unloaded immediately
21:31 < Learath2> and the timing is inconsistent
21:32 < Learath2> we might have to get that launcher after all :P
21:32 <@deen> no thanks
21:32 <@deen> :P
21:32 < Learath2> well i think you can replace dlls by renaming them even on winxp
21:33 <@deen> great!
21:33 < Learath2> dont have winxp to test it on tho
21:33 < Learath2> and also ddnet.exe is the only executable that cant replace itself on win xp
21:34 < Learath2> i think its hardcoded in the kernel
21:34 <@EastByte> right
21:34 < Learath2> I made multiple self renaming/replacing executables that work on winxp but not ddnet.exe
21:35 <@deen> maybe because we use dlls
21:35 < Learath2> It just grabs a file handle to itself for no reason at all
21:48 <@deen> SO much better to watch TW gameplay on YT in 60fps
21:48 < Savander> true
21:48 <@deen> like the video currently on http://ddnet.tw/
21:50 < Learath2> Savander: what was that cheaty hammerfly map which you sent a video of ?
21:50 <@deen> And Meskalin responded, EastByte : http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1856&p=19358#p19358
21:50 < Savander> hard way 1.0
21:50 <@heinrich5991> deen: than what?
21:50 <@deen> heinrich5991: so much better than 30fps
21:51 < Learath2> oh my god he actually responded wont use this tool on ddnet again
21:51 < Learath2> like its totally ethical to use it outside ddnet
21:53 <@EastByte> that's him
22:15 <@EastByte> oh matricks is alive
22:26 <@deen> and meskalin responded, weird guy
22:28 <@EastByte> yes I'm chatting with him
22:33 <@deen> i don't get this. a rank wasn't saved today
22:33 <@deen> but i see it in the mysql log
22:35 <@deen> oh, some replication problem...
22:42 <@deen> damn, why does the replication miss a few ranks?
22:44 < Savander> timeout
22:52 < Learath2> this guy is so weird
22:53 < Learath2> we no longer need this abusive feature because we have other means to abuse now :)
23:13 <@deen> sigh, stupid mysql
23:13 <@deen> 1 server banned another one for doing too many connections, then the other one tried reconnecting quickly, while the first one kept banning it
23:13 <@deen> really great default config
23:46 < eeeee> reminds me of how i was trying to help a friend who got a virus on his computer like 10 years ago. i remember i started the antivirus scan and then the antivirus determined that its own binary is infected and deleted it and then crashed.
23:48 <@heinrich5991> lol
23:49 < WolfAlex> for windows users: "Vulnerability in Microsoft Font Driver Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3079904)" https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS15-078
23:52 < Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/nimircbot/tree/experimental \o/ finally in a working state except that it crashes if you use a wrong plugin name :P
23:53 < eeeee> -_- why can't windoze just use freetype
