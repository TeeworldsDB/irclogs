09:37 <+ChillerDragon> @c0d3d3v it is probably other para groups messing it up. I can reproduce.
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> Ok i rq debugging that fakin mouse world positions are no fun
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1650445902.png
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> @danielkempf u here? -.- please do not starr my valueless fork. But starr the upstream project instead -.-
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ChillerDragon I think you're adding group offset to mouse world position for no reason
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I noticed it on the tutorial map, during initial testing
16:06 <+ChillerDragon> @Ravie that adds support for group offsets its tested to be useful. It is just missing parallax
16:06 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 what did you notice?
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ChillerDragon you don't need to care about offset or parallax, I think those get handled by rendering and don't affect positions in editor
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ```cpp
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> int x = (int)UI()->MouseWorldX() / 32;
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> int y = (int)UI()->MouseWorldY() / 32;```this selects the layer correctly for me even if the group has offset and parallax
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> or no it doesn't work when you're in another group :/
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> Yea this works fine in the Update() method. But I feel like you said the issue arrises when you are switching groups. Or like checking tiles from a different group.
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> So you probably have to revert the current groups offset/para/clipping and add the other one
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just made a interview with a german company that offered a rust job
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES2_Pray: lets pray i get it
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> having german pay on spain also sounds good :BASED:
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> remote job?

16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mesa drivers are the best already
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i add compability layer for windows xd
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Ryozuki what kind of job is it
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> something econemy related, some startup?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its like a startup
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> about security for companies
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nais
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "behaviour based security"
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddd
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they have some machine learning in the stack or smth
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> where i live, there are no startups xD

17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> netflix said it lost users for first time in 10 years
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean nothing holds forever xd
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah disney is too big player
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> except herpes, this shit sticks to you
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no chance for netflix xd
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bittorrent is a big player
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no chance for netflix xd
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES2_Pirate:
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> with the annoyance of having to buy 10 subs for movies again, it will defs rise again
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even if i have netflix, i still download them, the quality is just better
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when ur not conditioned by a stupid algorithm that checks ur current resolution
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to set the display quality
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eeetadam> :bluekitty: 'ш
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno if that exists in spain but we have videobuster, they send u 4k blurays per post
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eeetadam> :bluekitty:
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> even if u only get like 4-5 movies per month, i think its worth it more, bsc u can take the good ones xd
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Netflix has lost 200,000 subscribers in Q1 and expects to lose another 2 million in Q2.
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats like 2.4 million monthly revenue
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 200k
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> penauts

17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks have u ever written a language?
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to learn to make one with llvm
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ryolang
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ryo-os + ryolang = boom
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i tried to make a integer forced logic module with c++ templates
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that automatically forces you to range check all integer based math
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but was too much work to write stuff in xd
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> even tho i have some ideas for languages, e.g. better type safety by not allowing stuff like int generally but requiring to explicitly cast (nice to prevent logic errors like Function(i, i) instead of Function(i, n)
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i am not really motivated to think about all the edge cases u can fall into xD
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> when i look how insanly huge rust and c++ are
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki there is a tutorial for that in case you didn't know: https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have it bookmarted
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bookmarked*
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> hear me out
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> a ddnet os would be called DummyDrag OS
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> purposefully shortened to DDOS since thats what ddnet has basically come to now
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> finish #4791
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and i setup a proxy for ppl i trust

17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno why he left xd
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> hopefully not bcs stress
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he takes his vacations i think
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> honestly idk how he does it
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i find it hard to not look at discord
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess im addicted
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> social media
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> meet with more friends and discord gets less interesting xd
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i do meet with friends xd
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i mean
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk

17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in germany u can finally go outside without your winter jacket
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the interviewer mentioned the sun in spain
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess spain is just that
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the sun
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the climatei s a bit weird tho
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz its not usually cold in april
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and here it is rn
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the world is fucked

18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I collected the maps that are affected by PR 4980
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> oh noes physic changes
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @c0d3d3v can this be fixed by making the affected maps always be on?
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or is something more complicated
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by fixed i mean implementing this fix and modifying the maps
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD you want the maps to stay vroken?
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD you want the maps to stay broken?
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye there is no other solution
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can actually use
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> our bug interface
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that allows a bug on certain maps

18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we already do this for the double grenade
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Increase Your Speed
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> and Fall into the Future
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> got released before the bug
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but maybe there are ranks
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> after the bug appeared
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> TurboSeks was allways borken
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think in Time Shop noone used the bug because you would have to do the team map solo
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> just delete or keep the ranks xD on oco there are also a lot of cheated ranks... noone seems to cate
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> just delete or keep the ranks xD on oco there are also a lot of cheated ranks... noone seems to care
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we cant delete ranks
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its hard to know
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and we keep the ranks but it has to be fair for future runners
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why mapbugs.cpp exists
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just move the start and finish tiles closer to each other xd
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some skips may be to big for that
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I would defnitly rerelease Increase Your Speed because this map makes no fun with the bug. It is a complete diffrent map with the bug
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> And in "Fall into the Future" we could just always activate the turret... its just a troll part, everyone who knows can skip it
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I would defnitly re-release "Increase Your Speed" because this map makes no fun with the bug. It is a complete diffrent map with the bug
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I would definitely re-release "Increase Your Speed" because this map makes no fun with the bug. It is a complete diffrent map with the bug
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> "TurboSeks" can just stay as it is, pro players do the part first try anyway
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how does it affect solo again
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> currently in solo turrets are always active
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and the turrent part in turbosecks is random
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh not the turrent
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> with the patch they get swtiched correctly
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but the puller is random
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ohh makes sense actually xd
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> actually now that you mention it it's the same for 0 jumps
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> er no
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not particles, but you see the jump key above their head
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe intended
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD definitely not intended I also saw this... its annoying. You do not press the key so it should not display it in my opinion
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ya i agree 100%
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe show it if they truly are pressing it when they have no jumps but what's the use anyway
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> <https://github.com/kaitlynia/xpanic/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue>
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there are some pretty easy issues to fix here, if anyone has the time
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I'm not great at C++ but I don't have time today to look into them regardless
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ive added labels to all the new issues and modified the others to be more accurate
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and further, is this an acceptable place to talk about xpanic dev? i assume if there was any other modes we were maintaining the discussion would happen here instead of somewhere less topical, like #off-topic
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and further, is this an acceptable place to talk about xpanic dev? i assume if there were any other modes we were maintaining the discussion would happen here instead of somewhere less topical, like #off-topic
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh good idea, could be added in the new HUD xD
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> definitelye
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> definitely
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is it planned to have no hit shown as well as if you have the weapon? imo it would be like, show the sprite if u have it, use the same sprite for no hit, with a line through it
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but dont put like two of the same sprite
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> seems weird
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> what xd
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes no hit is shown
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you can customise it
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ye i mean to say, if you have grenade and its disabled, it would not show a clean sprite and a line through another one, just one with a line through it
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and back to a clean one if hit is enabled
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> this is the deafult image: https://github.com/C0D3D3V/ddnet/blob/New_HUD/data/hud.png
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ohhh it doesnt show what weps you have?
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> might be useful
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> it does
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> it uses game.png
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> in addition to this
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ravie did not like the idea
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i guess that's something
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> just my idea was to use the nade sprite as a clean version
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if you have nade
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> line through if it's disabled
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> dont show two separate icons, takes up space
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD ah
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but meh
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and i think the asset should not be grabbed from game.png... we already have tons of shit like this
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> x_ninja
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> default tee
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> stuff that you just have to know about instead of a setting to change it
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I can send you a the latest video I made with the hud, then you can tell me if its ok, wait I look it up
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> make a new file with the wep states and let people make them with their game.png if they really want it
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> You can change hud.png in assets settings
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> imo it would be easier to read even if someone is used to their game.png
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's easily recognizable
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sure yea
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> send it over :D
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well, since xpanic does not compile on Windows, i guess ill just try to make a change and someone can test it
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://streamable.com/1el5z1
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> is a bit old but most of it is still the same
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> as this is my repo im just making a lynn branch, you cant tell me not to :D
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> timer for ninja is pretty cool
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do u actually have this weird flickering ingame?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or is your recording software just broken xD
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh you already have this in-game
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> with the line through it
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> obs can not record teeworlds at all, it has big laggs. SimpleScreenRecorder can record in 1080p without problem but creates this flickering
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but im not sure what all the greyed out weapons are for
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what you're currently using
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mhh are u on wayland?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ah yes
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> obs runs smooth af for me xd
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I have intel cpu
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD without gpu
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this doesnt seem like a hardware issue xd
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> my notebook laggs also with more than 1 teeowrlds open
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i was gonna say its software
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> intel gpus are my favorite
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they never have bugs
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> and the recording was also with opengl, I rebased last week 😄 maybe next recording with vulkan gets better
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets hope so^^
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I should be on X11, but I check it, one moment...
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes its X11
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> i5-6200U CPU @ 2.30GHz
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice so smth like intel hd graphics 630
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> deen also has it
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and also always 0 problems xd
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> the transparent weapons are the weapons you can select
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea makes sense
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I currently have flickering with Vulkan on that CPU though
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> but what do you use for recording?
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> It is btw Intel® HD-Grafik 520
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but u are on arch right=?
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> actually the one thing intel is actually good at is VAAPI
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> which intel itself developped
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> weird it runs so bad

20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> @deenhi dude pleas accept my friend request ❤️
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> sorry for german, but this is the only encoder I can select. But I just install obs-hevc-vaapi-git maybe that helps
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/966403216688443412/unknown.png

20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but u also need vaapi from your driver package
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> @murpi
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> smth like i965-va-driver
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> yes?
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> its iHD
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> and I already have intel-media-driver  installed
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> @murpidude accept my friend request
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Why? You can just dm me without sending a friend request
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> great.... now Github changed their Ubuntu runner again
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/966404117620723793/unknown.png
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> @murpiI have something to do with the game
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> how to select the right version with apt?
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ill share the config

20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this is possibly an out of date way to write the command now
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> No I can not
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> most mods do not have messages restricted to friends
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> @murpisorry for tag pleas open dm
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> my dm's are open

20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> @murpi
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> possibly your own user settings prevent this? i dont think that's it though

20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> doubt
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> once a simp always a simp
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> :doubt:
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you guys saw hetzner has a USA location now? :poggers:
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://www.hetzner.com/cloud
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here is my referral hetzner link https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=c5CYKx0H7EoL
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it gives u free 20€ if u register
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> someone tell me im not an idiot and this is all i have to remove
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://github.com/kaitlynia/xpanic/pull/16
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> for a simple C++ method
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> header file, declaration, calls to ti
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> header file, declaration, calls to it
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the runner is broken so i cant test
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> doesn't that just remove it from the client? does xpanic require a custom client for the gamemode? idk
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no, this removes it from the server
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's entirely server-side
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i did my best to look for instances of it
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> am I stupid? it says game/client/components
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ctrl-shift-F for the main method
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im not sure, you dont need another client
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> but you're changing the client render code? how would that affect the server
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> hmm good point maybe there's more code that i havent found yet
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @lynn bruh this is the client ur modifying
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think there's more i need to change
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im not sure why the client was even edited like this then xd
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe there used to be an xpanic client
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ill keep digging
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @lynn put this in config
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "sv_teambalance_time 999999"
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no code changes
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ah well regardless
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe 0 disables it
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> `MACRO_CONFIG_INT(ClWarningTeambalance, cl_warning_teambalance, 1, 0, 1, CFGFLAG_CLIENT|CFGFLAG_SAVE, "Warn about team balance")`
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there's just a flag
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> for it
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use it
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i am not an admin
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah no
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats for the client
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats useles
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> alright
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> wait yea, cl
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> FUCK
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> who wrote this
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> it should disable it but people need to do it manually
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> curse kurosio
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u cant disable team balance warning
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it depends on the client
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so this is not something they added to the client
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this is just a teeworlds client thing
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is from vanilla
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea i see
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> you could miss report the team sizes to client xD
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well, can't be avoided then
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah true
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually the best way would be
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> doesn't that affect server stats
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if the ddnet client adds a server cabality flag for unbalanced teams or smth
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but thats just for ddnet client
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is "sv_teambalance_time" something the server will recognize?
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im not finding it anywhere
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if it's a part of vanilla then this mode really needs to be rebased
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its in vanilal settings
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vanilla*
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea this thing is ancient then, it's not in the code
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or maybe
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what is this gamemode about?
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it was specifically removed
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's a zombie infection mode
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> with level up skills
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah level up
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not the one i played
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's a panic mode
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> they were very very popular
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> old infection on the mario map was epic
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the hammer wall skillz
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i had
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there was the plague mode
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> anyway, i think we need to close this issue or mark it as part of the rebase issue
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> for now i wont touch it xd
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u should rewrite the mod
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> using this https://github.com/teeframe/ddnet-skeleton-readme
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is a stripped down ddnet
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> used as a base for modding
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is gods work
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u will get 64p + all the fixes in ddnet
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur xpanic mod probs cant handle utf8 names
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> gotcha
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> to be clear its not my mode, i just made like 1-2 fixes for it
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think this is a rewrite kurosio did
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> based on what i could find online
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u know if it is big
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> code wise
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe il ltake a look someday
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it doesn't seem that bad
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its a bit useless, since nobody plays mods
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's just not super well coded i guess
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my teesmash sits there
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> people really like xpanic though
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES2_HeadScratch:542536825617645568>
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/966421515816017960/unknown.png
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> literally GER is always full
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i havent been able to play once there
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> is it possible to rebase without the original commits?
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> reset or what
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> talking about this code https://github.com/kaitlynia/xpanic
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah we need to use the skeleton as posted above
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is the databse shared across ger and usa for accounts
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that's already an issue in github, i can add it as a commit
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no, see issue https://github.com/kaitlynia/xpanic/issues/9
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that's already an issue in github, i can add it as a comment
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not commit wtf, comment
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> but how can you distinguish ddnet code from xpanic code if it was added at the same time?
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's pretty easy to tell
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> just take the stuff that's absolutely required like the new doors, stationary nades, level up related mechanics
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> turrets
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> mintes
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> mines
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think that's it
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I mean for the purposes of doing a rebase automatically
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> any localized strings not in vanilla
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i dont know about automatic, probably shouldnt
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> yeah maybe so
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @lynn maybe ill do it
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i can also add database support for stats
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> always fun
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well the ddnet skeleton probs has it
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think imma fix some other stuff right now in the meantime
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not allowing new map votes for zombies
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> oh xpanic 🥺
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> thanks to him, I started learning programming in 2011, I remember then for 30 rubles I bought the Xpanic source code from Spok and ReDFoX43Rus and started poking around in it just changing the numbers)
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> you had to pay for it? lol
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> can we compare? maybe your version is better
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> yes, the sources were private, but they were sold to me by a friend who betrayed them 🤣
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i want to find the most "complete" version people remember
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> whatever is nostalgic for people
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im adding an issue for removing all the pay2win strings
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there used to be ranks, there are commands for this and logic even
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> original mod is wPanic (without accounts system)
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea i know wPanic
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but xPanic apparently has more
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there is also zPanic
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> which supposedly had more features but is somewhat broke (?)
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> never got to test it properly
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> which supposedly had more features but is somewhat broken (?)
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> history of *Panic mods:
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> wPanic -> xPanic -> mPanic (m just Matodor xD) -> oPanic (new version byReDFoX43Rus ) ->  xPanic (remake by kurisio)
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> thank you so much for this
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what features specific did m/o add?
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and are they still contained in this remake?
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @Matodor ping sry
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> 🤣 They just worked steadily, the main advantage was that they did not shutdown)
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> history of *Panic mods:
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> wPanic -> xPanic (by ReDFoX43Rus & $pokXXL) -> mPanic (m just Matodor xD) -> oPanic (new version byReDFoX43Rus ) ->  xPanic (remake by kurisio)
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> huh
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so no real features, just support
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i would guess xPanic is still the most stable version
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what is xPanic based off of? if i can ask
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> 0.6?
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> forgot ping again @Matodor
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> by kurosio? 0.6.3?
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yes
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> thank you
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/966428970625167390/unknown.png
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh xd
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> didnt change
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> wait to make sure that's the right repo
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> show the latest commit
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> name
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> fuck i keep forgetting ping @Matodor
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> https://github.com/kurosio/xpanic-remake ?
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ehh yea i think this is what i forked
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> thanks again
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> this is why I started programming
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/966433839037698078/unknown.png
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is it normal for teeworlds codebase to be riddled with all these php-equivalent commands :monkaS: @Ryozuki
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or does kurosio just really like php commands
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or does kurosio just really like php method
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or does kurosio just really like php methods
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> show example
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> php copied c and bash
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not the other way around
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/966441797905698826/unknown.png
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its php who copied tho
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> -> is used when the type ur dealing with is a pointer
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ic
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> instead of ur usual .
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dot
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ok i see now
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u hover
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gamserver()
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u have a good ide
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u will see the type has *
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it means its a pointer
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if it says "__cdecl" ?
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/966442139988951050/unknown.png
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what part of this should suggest it
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i meant gameserver()
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not scanff
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> o
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/966442220125311036/unknown.png
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Msg too
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also if the variable name has m_
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and then a p
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> m_p
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so the result from -> is the object
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a pointer
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but initially it's a pointer
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Normally TW code doesn't use C standard lib much directly, mostly through system.c
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just treat -> as a dot
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its the same
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea ik
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so like pointer dot
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> xd
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> theorically it means like "access the method this pointer points to"
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth like that
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it makes sense to me
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its normal to not get pointers
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are an abstract thing
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that take time to learn
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> huh, kind of clever way
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ```if(!strncmp(Msg->m_pMessage, "/", 1))
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn>     {
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn>         LastChat();
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn>         GameServer()->SendChatTarget(m_pPlayer->GetCID(), "Wrong command. Use /cmdlist");
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn>     }```
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> makes sense though
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> at the end of chain
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> actually why is this not `else if` xd
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> SMH THEY AHVE `return` IN EVERY ELSE IF
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im changing this for sure
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> strncmp is special
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it returns 0
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if it matches iirc
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so by doing !0
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it means 1
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which is true
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so it evalutes  that branch
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its more readable to do strncmp == 0
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not wrong to have returns inside if or else if
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also, to have an else if you first need an if
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why u just use a negated if
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no they have explicit `return;` in every `else if` when it's only because the last `if` is not `else if`
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if the `return` doesn't have a value
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sometimes it does
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> read  DeMorgan's Law
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doing the else if in ifs
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for*
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> eh
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> show code
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea i dont think u get what i mean
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://github.com/kaitlynia/xpanic/blob/main/src/game/server/entities/cmds.cpp
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> Ctrl-F "return;"
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> then check the last `if`
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can click on the line number btw
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it links thee
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there's tons of places to look xd
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://github.com/kaitlynia/xpanic/blob/main/src/game/server/entities/cmds.cpp#L665
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> <https://github.com/kaitlynia/xpanic/blob/main/src/game/server/entities/cmds.cpp#L665>
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its the chat command handling
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yes they can just write `else if` there and reduce the `return;` usage everywhere
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if it's it's at the very end of the else if
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if it's a short-circuit, fine
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but 99% are not
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i dont think it matters the return
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and why is it half `if` half `else if` here xd
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/966444460714127440/unknown.png
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> code is wacky
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i find it funny the commands is under the entities folder
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yep
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no idea whyt
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no idea why
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but anyway this stuff bothers me personally so im fixing it xd
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the correct way is to remove all those commands there
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> put them here <https://github.com/kaitlynia/xpanic/blob/main/src/game/ddracecommands.h>
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if you're really going to use an `else if` chain at least write it in a sane way
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and implement them <https://github.com/kaitlynia/xpanic/blob/main/src/game/server/ddracecommands.cpp>
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea i know, but i dont wanna touch too much, im noob
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ill leave that to someone else
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt look like it supports it anyway
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> where are these checked anyway?
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> for ddrace
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/ddracechat.h>
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the actual string comps
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> got it
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in ddnet we use this macro
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it handles it
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> cool
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ya i like it
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not the coolest way but not sure if there are things like dicts in C :greenthing:
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a dict is a hashmap kinda
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> we can also remove all these LastChat() calls into a call at the top
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or remove the call and put the code there
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no idea why it exists
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im fixing stuff that doesnt need fixing, as expected
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @Ryozuki u think this is the only place new votes are considered? <https://github.com/kaitlynia/xpanic/blob/main/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L226>
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i wanna prevent zombies from making their own votes
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or at least prevent |map| ones
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the only thing i have available in the method it's called in is `int ClientID`
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe i can get to the zombie flag from that
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh it's just `m_Team`
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's actually here: https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/tree/27d660282d8e40a477ef6990ebd8208a9447416a/stats_browser
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh we're actually using the Rust stuff in prod? that's cool
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> at least some
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @heinrich5991 ah lolthen someone sent me the wrong git repo, was on twmaster-collect
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> would be great for you to have such a "ban" feature aswell on https master
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ok i think i got it
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/966457338666024960/unknown.png
