00:29 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
00:30 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
03:27 <@deen> hm, it's much harder to detect the fly bot reliably than i thought
03:28 < eeeee> fly bot is a thing which rapidly hooks the ceiling?
03:29 <@deen> yes
03:29 <@deen> but it's actually not that rapid
03:29 <@deen> with manual hooking i can hook just as fast
03:29 <@deen> and when i try to measure how little change in y-velocity there is, then it collides with many ddrace features
03:29 < eeeee> would you ban it if you figure out how to reliably detect?
03:29 <@deen> yes, that's the plan
03:30 < eeeee> did you already ban any of the other bots?
03:30 <@deen> what other bots?
03:30 < eeeee> like spinbot
03:30 <@deen> they don't give you an advante
03:30 <@deen> advantage*
03:30 < eeeee> well yeah not in ddrace
03:30 < eeeee> give advantage in blocking though
03:30 < eeeee> also pretty annoying
03:31 <@deen> yeah, but people are actually cheating maps with flybot
03:32 < eeeee> hmm i see
03:32 < eeeee> is the source for it public?
03:32 <@deen> no
03:32 <@deen> i have a binary
03:32 <@deen> there are many implementations, it's about 2 lines to write I've heard
03:33 <@deen> if the speed downwards is bigger than 0 hook, otherwise don't hook
03:33 <@deen> that's all
03:34 < eeeee> but you'd have to hook upwards while you might not actually be looking upwards at the moment
03:34 <@deen> yeah, they always hook exactly up
03:34 <@deen> at least the simple implementations
03:34 <@deen> some hook sideways and move a bit to correct for it
03:34 < eeeee> iirc server actually gets the coordinates
03:34 < eeeee> as opposed the just the angle
03:35 < eeeee> we used that to ban spinbots coz all of them were stupid enough to keep a constant radius
03:35 <@deen> yeah, that would work for a few days
03:36 <@deen> but since there are multiple active programmers working on their flybot implementations, they would just fix it
03:36 <@deen> we need a detection that's not easily tricked
03:36 < eeeee> if you get a couple heuristics like that it would at least make their life very difficult
03:36 < eeeee> you can not tell them immediately that you detected flybot
03:37 < eeeee> but just discard their score later
03:37 <@deen> hm, don't like that
03:38 <@deen> they will still show off and advertise their botting client like that
03:39 <@deen> but i'm afraid i'd miss something and then normal players get punished
03:40 < eeeee> could run it in log-only mode for a couple days
03:40 <@deen> how would i check if it was actually a bot?
03:41 < eeeee> look in serverside recorded demo :/
03:41 <@deen> which we don't record since it makes the servers lag^^
03:41 < eeeee> crap, i though that was already solved
03:41 <@deen> nope, i just disabled demo recording
03:41 <@deen> i don't think it's solvable
03:42 <@deen> except with bigger servers
03:42 <@deen> or multithreading and weird stuff
03:44 < eeeee> or you can record demos with a specating client, but you'd have to somehow disable coords clipping on server
03:45 < eeeee> long ago i really wanted to implement a service which would connect such a spectating client to your server and detect bots
03:46 <@deen> ^^
03:46 <@deen> I'm going to sleep. good night
03:46 < eeeee> however never actually found a way to get around clipping
03:46 < eeeee> nite
12:22 < Nimda> Banta by Ama just released on Novice at 2014-10-24 12:18
12:23 < cris272> hey guys, anyone wanna test my map with me a suppe ?
12:23 < cris272> need a third player
12:25 < cris272> if someone want, follow cris :)
14:01 < captalan> deen
14:09 <@deen> hi captalan p
14:26 < captalan> I need the pasword for the test server
14:26 < captalan> The testers told me to ask you
14:27 < captalan> PM it to me on the website. I gtg
14:38 <@deen> Oh, I just got a nice mail from voxility.com
14:38 <@deen> they actually looked at our website and noticed where our servers are
14:42 <@deen> "I took a look at your website and I see you have servers in Germany, USA, Russia, Iran, China, Chile and South Africa. We can offer you the option to protect these servers against DDoS attacks without moving your infrastructure through an anti-DDoS tunnel."
14:55 < laxadedi> How is that possible ? And at what price ?
14:57 <@deen> Yeah, I just asked her that
14:57 <@deen> and explained our situation, let's see what they have to offer
14:58 <@deen> oh, and i noticed that she sent a mail before but i thought it was generic spam^^
15:02 <@deen> nfoservers (GER2) always has higher ping at the evening, i guess they're just overloaded
15:17 <@deen> well, voxility also starts at 400 € / month
15:17 <@deen> seems to be the normal prize for proper protection in germany
15:19 <@deen> Here's the mails if anyone's interested: http://ddnet.tw/voxility.txt
16:53 < o_be_two> hi
16:53 <@deen> hi
17:13 < laxadedi> I feel like swimming in a sea of bugs right now
17:13 < laxadedi> when I try to fix something, I find bugs and bugs, and I take hours to fix something that wasn't so long to do at start
17:14 < laxadedi> I wanna be on a new project now !
17:26 < laxadedi> Time to come back at home :)
17:29 < captalan> deen, where do I report if I found a mistake or have a suggestion about a map in testing
17:33 <@deen> in the corresponding thread in the forum
17:34 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewforum.php?f=9
18:16 < EastByte> deen: hm, from what I understand the ddos mitigation of voxility works pretty much the same as at ovh
18:17 < EastByte> but they are using normal linux computers instead of specialized hardware?
18:51 <@deen> i don't know
19:34 < KinG_> hi guys
19:34 < KinG_> deen:  u here?
19:34 <@deen> hi
19:34 < KinG_> hey
20:00 < KinG_> deen: when i ping a ip from vps it says time to live exceeded what does it mean?!
20:00 <@deen> it means there were too many hops inbetween
20:00 < KinG_> because of -t 2?
20:00 < EastByte> -t ttl ping only.  Set the IP Time to Live.
20:00 < EastByte> yes
20:01 < EastByte> I guess there are atleast 6 hops between you and your vps
20:04 < KinG_> !
20:08 < EastByte> !
20:26 <@deen> i can't figure out a way to do the bot detection that isn't easy to circumvent =/
20:26 <@deen> and i think i'm releasing ddnet client 6.0 now
20:35 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went down!
20:39 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went back online!
21:00 <@deen> Released. I hope I didn't forget anything
21:48 <@deen> hm, there are 10 players missing in ddnet.tw/status that i find ingame
21:48 <@deen> weird
21:49 <@deen> 20*
21:50 < KinG_> ?!
21:50 <@deen> ingame i see 355 players, on ddnet.tw/status only 319
21:53 < NooBxGockeL> Heya there ;D I'm here with a feature idea again ^^ Wanted to hear your opinion... So i played Killstreak 2 Solo today, and there was this one part near the end that i had trouble with, so i had to do the rather long way until that point just to fail... Might it be possible to start a Testserver from the client and connect to it, to e.g. practice 1 specific part ? ^^
21:53 <@deen> you can do that, but not from client directly
21:54 <@deen> just run a local server
21:54 < NooBxGockeL> ye but would be neat to directly do that from client, auto connect rcon and stuffs
21:55 < NooBxGockeL> alt tabbing is too much to demand from a lazy person like me xD
21:55 < KinG_> EastByte: how can i ping a ip with the maximum packets and maximum "Per Second" time?!
21:56 < KinG_> deen: u know how?!
21:56 <@deen> no
21:58 <@deen> found the reason for the status problem. i forgot 3 chilean servers
21:59 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
21:59 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 358
21:59 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 532 users online at 2014-09-28 20:14:41
21:59 <@deen> correct status
22:00 < NooBxGockeL> so is that a no-go or is that rather a too lazy to code it deen ^^
22:01 <@deen> NooBxGockeL: i'm not going to code it. i think it's a lot of work for something that's simpler outside of client
22:03 <@deen> did anyone test map sounds on windows?
22:03 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
22:03 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 369
22:03 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 532 users online at 2014-09-28 20:14:41
22:04 <@deen> nice player number considering that Europe is spread on weird servers
22:04 < EastByte> wut? :D
22:04 <@deen> shit
22:04 <@deen> map sounds don't work on windows^^
22:05 < EastByte> eh
22:05 < EastByte> meh*
22:05 < KinG_> EastByte: isn't -i func on "ping" making the (per second) ping thing?!
22:05 <@deen> Can't even add them
22:05 <@deen> and i thought BeaR was developing on Windwos 
22:05 < KinG_> deen: most of tee players have windows ^^
22:05 < EastByte> deen: so anti cheat isn't going to be added to ddnet
22:06 <@deen> EastByte: it should be added, but i'm not creative enough
22:06 < EastByte> do we know which parts are affected most by this kind of cheating?
22:06 <@deen> gores parts
22:07 < KinG_> EastByte:  hello :|
22:08 < EastByte> -i interval
22:08 < EastByte>               Wait  interval seconds between sending each packet.  The default is to wait for one second between each
22:08 < EastByte>               packet normally, or not to wait in flood mode. Only super-user may set interval to values less 0.2 sec‐
22:08 < EastByte>               onds.
22:13 <@deen> ok, now i get a crash on linux as well

22:17 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/80
22:17 <@deen> now crashing on linux as well
22:19 < EastByte> :/
22:20 <@deen> i don't understand why
22:22 < EastByte> when does it crash?
22:22 <@deen> when adding the sound
22:23 <@deen> adding the file into the editor
22:23 < EastByte> what audio format do I need?
22:23 <@deen> wavpack
22:23 <@deen> foley_body_splat-01.wv
22:23 <@deen> from data/audio
22:24 <@deen> hi xRoThx 
22:24 < xRoThx> deen: 
22:24 < xRoThx> Yo ;:)
22:24 < xRoThx> Everything okay with the server? 
22:24 <@deen> the server is running really well except for the high ping (always at evening)
22:25 < xRoThx> Probably because of the amount of players online around those houres
22:26 < EastByte> deen: for me there is no "current path" in the sound file browser
22:26 <@deen> EastByte: copy the files to mapres directory
22:27 < EastByte> yep crashes
22:28 < EastByte>  CSound::ReadData (pBuffer=0x7fffffffdc20, Size=32)
22:28 < EastByte>     at src/engine/client/sound.cpp:346
22:29 < EastByte> where is BeaR D:
22:29 <@deen> ms_WVBufferSize is -1
22:29 <@deen> that's definitely not good
22:29 < EastByte> yep
22:30 <@deen> CSound::DecodeWV (SampleID=117, pData=0x7ffecbfff030, DataSize=4294967295)
22:30 <@deen> 4294967295 looks a lot like -1
22:30 < EastByte> yes
22:31 <@deen> io_length returns -1 for the soud file
22:32 < EastByte> that's strange
22:32 <@deen> i'd guess the path is wrong
22:32 < EastByte> well but the IOHANDLE exists
22:33 <@deen> sometimes it works, sometimes the crash comes and sometimes you click on Add and nothing happens
22:33 <@deen> that's really weird
22:34 <@deen> i can't believe it was always like that
22:35 <@deen> hm, no. happens even with the first pull request
22:36 < EastByte> ehm
22:36 < EastByte>  CEditor::AddSound (pFileName=0xa97a18 "mapres/", StorageType=0, pUser=0xa97720)
22:37 <@deen> ah, is it because you don't select anything?
22:37 <@deen> and just use the first selection?
22:37 <@deen> the same happens with Images, haha
22:38 < EastByte> lol
22:38 < EastByte> okay
22:38 <@deen> i guess no one ever noticed^^

23:29 <@deen> MB
23:29 < KinG_> so 10mil is 10 MegaBytes?!
23:29 <@deen> 10M is 10 MegaBytes
23:29 <@deen> there is no "mil" anywhere
23:29 < KinG_> ok thanks <3
23:30 <@deen> also, megabits is Mb, not mb
23:30 < KinG_> ik :P
23:30 <@deen> mb is millibits
