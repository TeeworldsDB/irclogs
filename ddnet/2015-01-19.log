08:35  * eeeee spent half a day debugging periodic lags in js client
08:35 < eeeee> turned out c++ client has same lags and it's in fact a problem with my router
08:35 < eeeee> fml
08:36 < eeeee> but at least js is a bit more optimized now
11:55 <@EastByte> eeeee: :)
14:41 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
14:42 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
15:03 < laxadedi> Just saying, I got a spam mail, maybe it's true, that ddrace.com will be available soon again.
15:03 < laxadedi> I am talking about the domain name
15:03 <@heinrich5991> laxadedi: got the same spam mail
15:03 <@heinrich5991> how does that work?
15:04 < laxadedi> I would not trust this website personally
15:04 < laxadedi> you need to "bid" to get the domain name
15:04 < laxadedi> no idea of they got my mail, don't remember ever putting this mail anywhere
15:05 < laxadedi> I received it at support@ddracepro.net
15:05 < laxadedi> and gmail report it as spam
15:05 < laxadedi> maybe we should send a mail to greyfox ?
15:22 <@heinrich5991> nah, I guess not
15:25 < laxadedi> seems like you wanna get that domain name heinrich5991 :D
15:25 <@heinrich5991> ...
15:26 < laxadedi> I am just joking :)
15:26 < laxadedi> I think no one care about it anyway
15:26 <@heinrich5991> just yesterday, "are you the ddoser?" ^^
15:26 < CookieMichal> Guys
15:26 < CookieMichal> How do I change password on IRC? :-;
15:33 <@heinrich5991> CookieMichal: what password?
15:33 <@heinrich5991> Q password?
15:33 < CookieMichal> Yep
15:35 <@heinrich5991> try /msg Q help
15:43 < CookieMichal> Oh, It's newpass :D
15:43 < CookieMichal> Thanks :)
18:24 <@deen> i got the ddrace.com mail too
18:24 <@deen> I'll just ignore it
18:32 < CookieMichal> deen: Why when I save on GER2, I can't load on GER?
18:32 <@deen> CookieMichal: because they are using the cheat again...
18:33 <@deen> to duplicate saves
18:33 <@deen> it's pretty stupid, but i don't know any other way to prevent it, sorry 0/
18:33 <@deen> =/
18:33 < CookieMichal> eh ;-;
18:33 < CookieMichal> okay
18:33 <@deen> Hm, someone wants to sponsor a server in Poland
18:34 <@deen> Somehow I still think 1 server is enough in Europe
18:34 <@deen> especially with the save problem now where you can't just load on another server...
18:35 <@deen> Any other opinions?
18:54 < timeless> any1 online?
18:58 < CookieMichal> deen: What provider would you recommend for hosting in Poland? :>
19:20 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went down!
19:21 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went back online!
19:21 <@deen> CookieMichal: i don't know, the guy says he has a server already
19:31 <@deen> has anyone seen the lizardstresser database yet? want to see if our attackers used it as well
19:32 <@deen> since they were in a few previous databases
19:32 <@deen> and apparently the database also includes targets
19:41 <@deen> timeless: hi
19:43 < timeless> deen: hi, can you recommend a good irc client for quakenet?
19:43 <@deen> i use irssi, but it's command line stuff
19:44 < timeless> need something with forms :3
19:45 <@deen> no idea
19:45 < timeless> ok thank u anyway
20:17 < eeeee> how does /save work anyway, does it kill or disconnect you from the server?
20:17 <@deen> yes, kills you
20:17 <@deen> and stores the state of your team in the database
20:18 < eeeee> yeah if it's a whole team i see how can it get overwhelmingly complicated
20:26 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
20:27 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
20:27 < timeless_> eeeee: how is going your ddnet javascript project?:)
20:50 <@deen> timeless_: it looks pretty good I'd say
20:50 <@deen> http://tw.qwe123.info/DDNet_x86_d.html
20:50 <@deen> oh well, exception thrown
20:50 <@deen> worked yesterday :P

21:12 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 26 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/v_MBZA
21:12 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 095d172 fisted: Link against libcurl....
21:12 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 5483155 Learath: Added fetcher interface.
21:12 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 8f941aa Learath: Make fetcher client only and move Task class from interface.
21:12 <@deen> Learath2: let's make this work :P
21:44 < Learath2> deen: it does work :D
21:45 < Learath2> just needs some cleanup but im way too busy around this time
21:46 <@deen> Learath2: then why did it say WIP on the pull request? :P
21:46 <@deen> I'm currently creating my CA and certificates
21:47 < Learath2> it was WIP when i created it i guess :P
21:56 < eeeee> deen: it's d.html not DDNet_x86_d.html :P
21:57 < Learath2> deen: you might want to squash my history up while merging as there are way too many commits there where i just go back and remove stuff
21:57 <@deen> eeeee: oops
21:58 <@deen> Learath2: meh
21:58 < Learath2> other than that you just need to include cacert.pem with the client and change the address in client.cpp:1556
21:59 <@deen> yeah, done both already
21:59 <@deen> when the webserver redirects, it fails
21:59 <@deen> ah wait
21:59 <@deen> i know why
21:59 <@deen> i guess the http downloader should maybe check the crc after download
22:00 <@deen> and not save file if it's wrong
22:00 < Learath2> It downloads the file as blabla_crc.map anyways
22:00 < Learath2> and tcp should ensure that download went smoothly
22:01 < Learath2> any server side error fails the download anyways so it should be fine
22:01 < Learath2> deen: it doesnt follow redirects but i can make it happen if you want
22:02 < eeeee> we should check crc
22:02 < eeeee> w/o that we e.g. cannot use cloudflare because it can potentially return some stupid html instead of the map
22:03 < Learath2> i think cloudflare error pages return http response =>400
22:03 <@deen> Not only cloudflare can do that. Even I can!
22:03 < eeeee> h4x
22:03 < Learath2> oh yeah sure you can name some weird file map_crc.map and it will download it just fine
22:04 <@deen> and i can setup a redirect and nothing will download at all
22:04 < eeeee> and then you will get stuck with it forever
22:04 < Learath2> i can make it follow 3xx redirects if you need that
22:05 <@deen> Learath2: would be nice, yes. crc check is more important
22:05 <@deen> my CA works
22:06 <@deen> now i'll squash your commits and setup the maps server
22:06 < Learath2> if crc doesnt match after download fallback to server download ?
22:07 <@deen> yes
22:08 < eeeee> ideally we should have telemetry on that but we don't have any infra unfrotunately
22:09 < Learath2> uhm simple english please ?
22:10 < eeeee> i mean there's no way for us to know how often the crc fail would happen
22:10 < eeeee> if crc fail happens often that would be a huge waste of time and traffic and we should debug it, but the problem is that we cannot know if it happens or not
22:12 < Learath2> if as i remember tcp does ensure that we have the same file as the server then the only way crc fail would happen is us putting the wrong file
22:14 < eeeee> there's too many components involved
22:14 < eeeee> whole system is too complicated to be error-free
22:14 < Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/ddnet/commit/acb6aca096a03fff11dad08fabc916022019e949
22:15 < Learath2> does this seem like an adequate fix 
22:15 < Learath2> ?
22:15 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- force-pushed DDRace64 from f9353f7 to 340e799: http://git.io/-BwJ2w

22:15 < Learath2> Ewww
22:15 < Learath2> what have you done 
22:16 < eeeee> does it work? we should test it
22:16 < Learath2> oh you squashed it 
22:16 < Learath2> theoratically i just put a fallback where a crc fail would hit
22:17 < Learath2> but sure does need testing
22:17 <@deen> Learath2: hm, what about the location of the ca cert? it doesn't use TW's location system, does it?
22:17 < Learath2> It looks at the same directory with the executable
22:18 <@deen> well, that fails on many systems
22:18 <@deen> if you use symbolic links or stuff, i think
22:18 <@deen> some people can't update their client because of this
22:18 < Learath2> could use pstorage getcompletepath
22:18 < Learath2> for it
22:18 <@deen> not sure if that's better
22:19 < Learath2> well no idea how the complete path taken from tw location system could fail
22:19 < Learath2> tw itself should fail
22:19 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/6yaD9g
22:19 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 883cd3d def: Adaptation to work with DDNet
22:19 <@deen> yeah, I've wondered how TW finds the proper path in that case
22:19 <@deen> couldn't find it in source, so no idea
22:22 < Learath2> deen: GetCompletePath with type 1 should return the file inside datadir
22:23 <@deen> there is no type 1, is there?
22:23 <@deen> i only see TYPE_SAVE = 0 and TYPE_ALL = -1
22:23 < Learath2> yeah i had to dig thru the code several million times to understand it
22:24 <@deen> ah, i see
22:24 < Learath2> first added path is USERDIR which is type 0 = TYPE_SAVE
22:24 <@deen> there's a list of storage paths
22:24 < Learath2> the rest has no name
22:24 < Learath2> but datadir is always 1 and currentdir is always 2
22:24 <@deen> but that stops working if people change their storage.cfg, right?
22:25 < Learath2> storage.cpp::AddDefaultPaths()
22:25 <@deen> great
22:25 < Learath2> oh wait 
22:25 <@deen> it's only executed if there are no other paths?
22:25 < Learath2> yep
22:25 <@deen> so it doesn't work
22:25 <@deen> let's just keep it as it is
22:26 <@deen> the download is really much faster with http now
22:26 <@deen> btw, why do we need https for maps?^^
22:26 <@deen> wouldn't http be faster and fine as well?
22:26 < Learath2> you do
22:26 < Learath2> you dont*
22:27 < Learath2> my webserver just happened to have https so i had to use it or reconfigure my webserver
22:27 <@deen> hm, so should we go with http?
22:28 < Learath2> well you said there are many problems with the way maps are read
22:29 < Learath2> paranoid me says we should use https and the rational me says noone would use maps as an attack vector
22:29 < Learath2> and they probably cant be used as one
22:30 <@deen> alright, let's stay with https
22:30 <@deen> i just want one more quick test how it affects download speed :P
22:30 <@deen> especially the initialization phase
22:31 <@deen> looks fine, even with ping 300
22:32 <@deen> Learath2: will you make a pull request for the crc check stuff?
22:32 < Learath2> yeah let me rebase it as you squashed it 
22:32 <@deen> ^^
22:32 <@deen> You told me to squash!
22:33 < Learath2> To hide my derps obv :D
22:34 <@deen> well, my 404 page causes a "302 Moved Temporarily" first, so following redirects would be nice
22:35 < Learath2> eeh my gfx card is causing some artifacting :((
22:35 < Learath2> really do hope its caused by the driver
22:36 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #133: Fallback to gameserver if LoadMap fails (DDRace64...pr_CrcCheck) http://git.io/1IlajA
22:36 <@deen> oh, that's the entire change^^
22:36 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #133: Fallback to gameserver if LoadMap fails (DDRace64...pr_CrcCheck) http://git.io/1IlajA
22:36 <@deen> nope, still doesn't work with redirects
22:37 <@deen> [15-01-19 22:36:43][client/network]: download complete, loading map
22:37 <@deen> [15-01-19 22:36:43][datafile]: loading. filename='downloadedmaps/MAXED OUT_1b2efe4b.map'
22:37 <@deen> [15-01-19 22:36:43][datafile]: wrong signature. 3c 68 74 6d
22:38 < Learath2> well that wasnt supposed to follow redirects but should have fixed the situation by falling back to gameserver
22:38 <@deen> yeah i know, but didn't work
22:38 <@heinrich5991> <htm
22:38 <@heinrich5991> (3c 68 74 6d)
22:39 < Learath2> yeah do need to debug that :/
22:40 < Learath2> deen: does it disconnect after the fail ?
22:40 <@deen> yes
22:40 <@deen> [15-01-19 22:36:43][client]: disconnecting. reason='map 'downloadedmaps/MAXED OUT_1b2efe4b.map' not found'
22:41 < Learath2> which server can i join ?>
22:41 <@deen> any ddnet?^^
22:41 < Learath2> you have all maps in place ? :D
22:41 <@deen> none :P
22:41 <@deen> so it should always fall back
22:41 <@deen> i only have AIB Quest 2 in place
22:41 <@deen> because it's 2 MB
22:42 <@deen> you can use /map AIB Quest 2 to change map
22:42 < Learath2> yeah you know whats even better ? it just SIGSEGV's on windows
22:44 <@deen> ouch
22:46 < Learath2> found why i just delete the task object before it calls the callback
22:46 <@deen> huh, how do i get TW's crc32 from the command line again?
22:47 <@deen> I think I knew, but I forgot^^
22:52 <@deen> well, i can do it in nim, guess i'll write my script in nim :P
22:53 <@heinrich5991> deen: want my py script?
22:53 <@deen> ah yeah, last time i did it in python
22:53 <@heinrich5991> deen: http://ix.io/fRH
22:53 <@heinrich5991> to be named "tw-crc32sum"
23:01 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] eeeee opened pull request #134: fix fetcher codez formatting (DDRace64...fmt) http://git.io/xcF32A
23:02 <@heinrich5991> deen: what about disabling threaded logging in debug mode?
23:02 <@deen> heinrich5991: why?
23:02 < eeeee> not flushed on crash?
23:03 <@deen> ah
23:03 <@deen> could do that i guess
23:10 < Learath2> it does make stepping over hard too
23:10 < eeeee> Learath2: would you consider my formatting fix plx
23:10 < Learath2> your formatting fix ?
23:11 < eeeee> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/pull/134/files
23:12 < eeeee> if you're making changes, could you merge it into your local copy if possible?
23:15 < Learath2> sure but what happens if deen merges your pullreq
23:16 <@deen> explosion
23:17 < eeeee> don't think anyone else is gonna edit fetcher.cpp so you should merge it if you're working on it
23:18 < Learath2> added
23:19 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] eeeee closed pull request #134: fix fetcher codez formatting (DDRace64...fmt) http://git.io/xcF32A
23:20 < Learath2> oh noez
23:20 < eeeee> lol
23:20 < eeeee> what
23:20 < Learath2> nvm i thought you merged it
23:29 < Learath2> eeeee: you deleted the branch ? :/
23:30 < Learath2> I was wondering why the cherry pick kept failing
23:30 < eeeee> huh you need it back?
23:30 <@deen> you guys^^
23:30 < eeeee> thought you already added it?
23:31 < Learath2> yeah then orphaned it with my last git command
23:31 < eeeee> pushed it bacl
23:32 < Learath2> merged it pushed it

23:39 <@deen> eh^^
23:39 <@deen> so i should not pull or what?
23:39 < Learath2> that pull request is fine it just fixes things with fetcher
23:40 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #135: Fetcher Fix (DDRace64...pr_FetcherFix) http://git.io/Ypk7WA
23:42 <@deen> anyone want to see the beautiful nim script to create the map downloads? https://gist.github.com/def-/20ad9a792e16a192b8a6
23:42 < Learath2> It workssss
23:42 <@deen> what works?
23:43 < Learath2> the ffallback after the crc fail
23:43 <@deen> ehm, now i have all maps^^
23:43 < Learath2> oh no
23:43 <@deen> just wrote the script
23:43 < Learath2> can you delete Houll so i can see if it works ?
23:43 <@deen> done
23:43 < Learath2> and here i was celebrating :/
23:43 <@deen> sorry^^
23:47 <@heinrich5991> deen: is that the correct CRC function?
23:48 <@deen> heinrich5991: yes, i wrote it myself :P
23:48 <@heinrich5991> k :)
23:48 <@deen> pretty simple
23:48 <@heinrich5991> yea. correct crc, but start with the wrong start value
23:49 <@heinrich5991> good night
23:49 <@heinrich5991> :)
23:49 <@deen> there you go, implementation: https://gist.github.com/def-/20ad9a792e16a192b8a6
23:49 <@deen> good night
23:49 < Learath2> does work but might be the worst looking thing i've ever produced :D
23:53 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #136: Fix for the crc fail fallback. (DDRace64...pr_CrcFail) http://git.io/-MPVTg
23:53 < Learath2> deen: do go over the code before merging that one because it does look a bit bad
23:54 <@deen> the bracket at the last else is wrong :P
23:54 <@deen> shouldbe one line down
23:54 <@deen> can you explain what you did?^^
23:55 < Learath2> So the problem was the fallback was fine but i wasnt closing the file after the download
23:55 < Learath2> and as http download does not require the close i moved it out of the general reset
23:56 < Learath2> and to fix the progressbar I just saved the totalsize in a temporary int
23:56 <@deen> doesn't sound that bad
23:56 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/7wZUnQ

23:56 <@deen> works =)
23:57 <@deen> but the download bar is wrong
23:57 < Learath2> ?
23:57 <@deen> it goes over the border for me
23:58 <@deen> with https download
23:58 <@deen> at least it just did
23:58 <@deen> now it doesn't 
23:58 <@deen> ah
23:58 <@deen> connect once with fallback
23:59 <@deen> then with https
23:59 <@deen> then you see it
23:59 < laxa> can I share my happiness with you guys ? ;D
