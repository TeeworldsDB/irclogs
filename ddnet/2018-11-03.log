00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> is the fifo only server related ?
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think there is also for client
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux only
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> ow linux only that's it thx
00:29 <@heinrich5991> IIRC it executes in a separate thread and was completely thread-unsafe
00:29 <@heinrich5991> *is
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well can't really open a fifo on windows ðŸ˜›
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> Is there a reason for not having a limit for zooming in & out ?  If you zoom in too much you get to see only the background even if you zoom on your tee, zooming out too much gets the game to hang, i mean it doesn't crash but i need to kill it at one point
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> I don't really care about zooming in, but zooming out too much is problematic if you're in the middle of a map
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :GWfroggyPeepoDetective: zooz
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then don't zoom out as much? why prevent such stuff in code if you can just choose to not do it xd
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> I mean you can also turn on a light connecting two wires by hand but it's nice to have a switch that prevents you from getting zapped  ðŸ˜€
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> huh
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but it's not like it's at a low zoom out where it would be reasonable to prevent it
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you have to zoom out pretty far till it starts lagging
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and who randomly does that in the middle of maps
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> yeah that's true, btw since last release on windows you get "a strange windows sound" every time you change the map.

02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm is it the BEEP I wonder
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/985
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> beep beep
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got some warning compiling 11.4.6 on debian: ```
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> /usr/bin/ld: warning: libcrypto.so.1.0.2, needed by /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/6/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/libcurl.so, may conflict with libcrypto.so.1.1```
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> did somebody change something about quad scaling or rendering? some quads that used to be pixellated look good now
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> The debian installation told me that i lack some non-free firmware:
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ath10k/pre-cal-pci-0000:01:00.0.bin
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ath10k/cal-pci-0000:01:00.0.bin
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/firmware-5.bin
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ``` 
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does someone know where to get it?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Try linux-firmware-nonfree package
16:26 <@heinrich5991> this sounds relevant: https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/ch06s04.html.en
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ravie quads or tiles ?
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar âœª what exactly do you mean?
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I put all those firmwares in my boot usb http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/firmware/stretch/20180714/
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Jupstar âœª normally quads would get pixellated at most sizes but now it's actually hard to make them do that
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Thats nice
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Ravie sdl got updated i doubt thats the cause but may be
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @ChillerDragon OK no plan for USB OS. @Ravie made an GPU update recently?
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Or is that just installer @ChillerDragon ?
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Just use sudo apt install linux-firmware-nonfree
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @Ryozuki  u can ez fix the warning kek
18:15 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: bridge is one way right now btw
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nope I didn't change anything I don't think I even updated the client when I noticed that, weird but nice
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar âœª i am unable to find that packet but i think i have all of the contents anyways because i downloaded a bunch of firmwares manually
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> @ChillerDragon https://packages.debian.org/stretch/firmware-atheros
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @â™ªâ™« looking good but none of my tree missing firmwares is listed in the list .-.
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://packages.debian.org/stretch/all/firmware-atheros/filelist
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i need those 3
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ath10k/pre-cal-pci-0000:01:00.0.bin
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ath10k/cal-pci-0000:01:00.0.bin
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/firmware-5.bin
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> Yeah firmware-4 looks close enough to me i'd try cp firmware 4 to firmware 5 ðŸ˜„
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> non-free drivers are always annoying, if that doesn't work dig into https://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware/pull/2 & https://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware/pull/3
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> There is no hw3.0/firmware-5.bin in any packages there is one under /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw2.1/firmware-5.bin from firmware-atheros
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> anyway that's only useful to dig into that if your wifi isn't working out of the box with firmware-atheros, sometimes warning messages are just warning messages
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ravie most GPU driver have a quality - performance switch setting.. It changes the texture lookup filter, maybe you changed it somehow
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> Not sure what I did but I'm not complaining about nicer quads ðŸ˜›
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @â™ªâ™« i found that aswell... but it is an open pullrequest in a random repo. Thats why i am asking in this discord because i am not sure if you should trust random binarys found in the interwebs and smash them in your operating system
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> @ChillerDragon this repo looks fine to me, i mean if you could say the same exact thing about every non-free drivers, that's why they're packaged separately.  Keep trying to use this hardware after each change you're making, sometimes things works and still output that kind of messages
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> @ChillerDragon this repo looks fine to me, i mean you could say the same exact thing about every non-free drivers, that's why they're packaged separately.  Keep trying to use this hardware after each change you're making, sometimes things works and still output that kind of messages
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye the bunch of firmware from debian allowed me to finish the installation move my mouse and establish an network connection. I didn't encounter any bugs but the error message feels wrong.
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i still see it in ``dmesg`` and on system boot
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> establish a network connection ? using this specific hardware ? If so i don't get it is there anything that isn't working properly ?
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> No everything is working i guess.
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> So you suggest to ignore the errors? .-.
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> Yeah if everything related to the specific hardware is working fine you won't have any issues, take it as a warning message
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont know what the related specific hardawre is xd
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> I assumed it was a wifi thingy. You can have a look and see wich driver is actually being used.
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ye without the firmware wifi wasnt working and the comments on the pr were wifi related i think
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye ok what ever i will just ignore it c:
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thanks for the information @â™ªâ™«
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> who are you even? xd i dont know you? Or do i know you under a different name?
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> Yeah that's wifi, might do bluetooth too who knows, anyway you'll still have limitations with drivers like that like packet injection is often unsupported and so on. Best thing is to use hardware that have fully opensource drivers.
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> I don't know you either, i'm a 24yo french dude who started playing recently ðŸ˜„
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oh nice to meet you. What does recently mean? And what maps/mods etc do you play in tw or are you full ddnet.
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oh and whats your ingame name ? c:
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> Recently means i played a few month here and there for years i think i started in 2015 or something, never really  played much and i've reinstalled about a month ago i guess. I essentially plays ddnet, mainly novice maps because i'm noob ðŸ˜„ IG i'm "â™ª" or "â™«" for my dummy
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cool cool c:
