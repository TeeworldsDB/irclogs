19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I apparently passed that physics exam but I really want to reject that mark. I did so badly, but I also don't want to risk it but I also don't want a 17/30. Can someone help me decide what do?
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats done is done
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean the issue here is that it's not done, I can literally reject the mark and give it another try
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> shoot the guy that was watching you the entire exam
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jkjk> reform the uni system so that mark wont matter anymore
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsin> jkjk that boring, mine option atleast gives him some years in prison to rethink the option if the mark was good or bad ^^
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kayrabot/00> That is a very good advice ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ‘Œ
