02:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Bawki> I need assistance, I do not have that much internet lag and don't have fps lag, however, whenever i play every tee is really choppy and laggy except mine, my emotes are also really choppy/laggy and idk why
02:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Bawki> help
02:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> cl_predict 1
02:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?
02:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Bawki> Diddn't do anything
02:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but
02:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> change it to that value i said
02:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and test
02:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Bawki> I did
02:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and
02:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> cl_predict_ddrace 1
02:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Bawki> It made it even worse
02:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> `cl_predict_ddrace`? didn't know that value
02:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but exists
02:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i have both on 1
02:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> that's why i suggested it

12:31 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> im trying to compile ddnet client lul. Clients suck but i wanted to fix some stuff
12:32 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i cloned the ddent-libs repo into the ddnet repo but it still seems to fail
12:32 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> btw im on windows
12:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> didn't you have the same problem before?  xD
12:37 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ye i had it some time ago
12:37 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i suck at client compiling
12:37 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i made it once ago on my main machine but i grilled it .-.
12:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> make sure that you have in good places all files
12:38 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i have cloned ddnet repo
12:38 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> and ddnet-libs inside it
12:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like that ? git clone --recursive https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
12:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like that ? `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet`
12:39 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> eh
12:39 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> without th recurssive
12:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I would like to try with that --recusrive after all
12:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> hahah
12:39 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> what does it do?
12:39 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> am in not getting eyrything without it ?
12:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> read documentation, it's first link
12:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> command*
12:40 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> mimimimimi
12:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> idk, maybe you made somethiing wrong while cloning, that's why i suggest to do it like they said
12:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> in documentation
12:41 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> how can u fail cloning lul
12:41 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ok itz me...
12:41 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but still.....
12:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> just try
12:41 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i am
12:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's small effort to try
12:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> xD
12:41 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> #vacation-net-speed
12:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> #oh-my-god
12:42 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> looking good
12:42 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> this recursive rocks
12:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> xxD
12:42 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> and u too Sanvander ma boii
12:42 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> misspleeddleled ur name
12:42 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> gg
12:43 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> xd
12:43 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> u just became Sanvander
12:43 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> giggle
12:43 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ah nuuu

12:44 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> the compiler copied my typos xd
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> huehuehue, no idea
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> SDL_Joystick wtf
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> is this android stuff?
12:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ya
12:45 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> windows10 != android
12:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I see
12:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe obs thinks it is
12:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> lul
12:45 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ah it doesnt find SDL.h
12:45 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> also
12:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> curious
12:45 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> SDL is kinda important i guess
12:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, like really important
12:45 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> yo San can u trade an SDL.h ?
12:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> how much you pay?
12:46 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> uhm
12:46 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> 2$
12:46 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> in shitcoin
12:46 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> my own crypto currency
12:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> try bam clean
12:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> nope .-.
12:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> still no SDL.h
12:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i guess i dont have it
12:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> lemme search it
12:48 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ah i found one in the ddnet libs
12:48 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> maybe i can change tha path
12:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> nonono
12:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it should works, it had to be in ddnet-libs
12:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> that's why it's called ddnet-libs
12:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> somehow it can find it
12:52 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i fixed 1 error
12:52 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> by replacing #include "SDL.h" with #include "super/long/path/to/SDL.h"
12:52 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> xd lyfe hacks w chiller
12:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :v
12:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I can't test bam by myself hehehe
12:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> using cmake to do compile
13:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ha, same problem Chiller
13:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> on bam
13:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> fixed
13:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> !!:P
13:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> @ChillerDragon
13:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/other/sdl.lua#L42
13:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> adjust that line to:
13:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> `settings.cc.includes:Add("ddnet-libs/sdl/include/windows")`
13:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> temporary solution, since I don't know how it exactly works. because there's a mac file
13:29 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> it compiled yay
13:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Yay
13:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> savander the dev

16:22 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Savander wanna make a pull request to fix that line?
16:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> don't know how to fix it
16:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> there's a mac file
16:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> don't wnat to break anything
16:24 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> just do the change you wanted to do, that's exactly the right one ðŸ™‚
16:27 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 closed pull request #969: [DO NOT MERGE] Abusing CI (master...dd_pr_of) https://git.io/vbdxo
16:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> @heinrich5991  how to assign fix?
16:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> to issue
16:30 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> what do you mean?
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> have you used git before? ðŸ™‚
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yes but
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i mean
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> sometimes i see "fixed #724"
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ah
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and it's strikethrough
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> how it works xD
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you can add "Fixes #972." to the commit description
16:32 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> then it automatically closes #972 when it is merged
16:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> oh, great
16:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> close/fix/resolve in all their forms close the issue ðŸ˜ƒ
16:33 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] savander opened pull request #974: Fixes #972. (master...patch-1) https://git.io/vbpAy
16:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> good, didn't know
16:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
16:33 <+Learath2> still can't get rid of bam /o\
16:33 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it's usually good practice to use the first line of the commit message to describe what you changed
16:33 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> e.g. "Fix bundled SDL includes for bam on Windows"
16:34 <+Learath2> "Fix SDL include for bam. Closes #972"
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :<
16:34 <+Learath2> I'm not sure what the consensus is on the final punctuation tho :D
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> the "closes"  can also go on a new line
16:34 <+Learath2> second line should be empty imho
16:35 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes
16:35 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> no punctuation in first line, punctuation afterwards
16:35 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> first letter is capital
16:35 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> first line is in imperative form
16:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> woah, it's rather difficulty hahaha
16:36 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> "Fix abc", not "Fixed abc"
16:36 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜›
16:36 <+Learath2> You are for only one sentence in first line?
16:36 <+Learath2> I almost prefer to have the issue number on the first line
16:36 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> meh
16:36 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ok
16:37 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> don't really think it's necessary
16:37 <+Learath2> @Savander nah it's not, just describe what you did on the first line and most everyone will be okay with it
16:37 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it's not really important
16:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It's necessary to make project readable
16:38 <+Learath2> I feel the more strict you get about these things the more you drive away new contributors
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> and that's definitely a thing I want to avoid
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> see also teeworlds/teeworlds ðŸ˜¦
16:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> That's right, it's not necessary in this project
16:39 <+Learath2> It's not necessary in any project imho, as long as it's not too messy
16:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but imagine a big one, with mishmash inside
16:39 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> see rust-lang/rust, it's okay
16:40 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> they have ~100 merged PRs a week
16:40 <+Learath2> if I was running a huge project I'd force First line describes change and has Issue # if it closes an issue for commit messages
16:40 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
16:41 <+Learath2> and for coding format I'd have them run it through a formatter
16:41 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> +1
16:41 <+Learath2> It's much less painful to have people run it through a formatter then to shove a format down their throats
16:41 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> if you can get clang-format to work with the ddnet style, please go ahead
16:41 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I tried it a bit already
16:43 <+Learath2> well we could try to make it as close as possible and have one large format commit to fix the rest of the codebase
16:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think, the worst think is to teach people how the name convenction works
16:43 <+Learath2> the naming convention we have in teeworlds code is one I love actually, a lot of people seem to hate it
16:44 <+Learath2> but m_ g_ s_ _p _a conveys a lot of information for me
16:44 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] bors[bot] merged staging into master: https://git.io/vbpp2
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I don't understand how people can be so ignorant of the coding style tbh
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> (looking at you, eeeee :P)
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think, things like that were good when IDE wasn't that good as now
16:45 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> when I enter new projects, I just look at the code that's there, and format my code accordingly
16:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Since, IDE provides any information you need to understand
16:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but yea, i like to follow code convections
16:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i like to have pretty and solid code
16:46 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> IDEs tend to provide `m_`, might have `g_` and `s_`, but I don't think I have seen IDEs which support `p` or `a`
16:46 <+Learath2> GNU style makes me want to claw my eyes out :P
16:47 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> whatever
16:48 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> just use the pre-existing style ^^
16:48 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it doesn't matter ^^
16:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> PSR yeey
16:48 <+Learath2> in case they use GNU style, I just don't contribute
16:48 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: do you know a file that has perfect format in ddnet?
16:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> the shortest oe?
16:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> the shortest one?
16:49 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> teehistorian? :p
16:49 <+Learath2> preferably the longest known perfect file
16:49 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I'm the only author ðŸ˜›
16:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> @heinrich5991  build failed ;<
16:50 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> my fault
16:50 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> see the error
16:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> where?
16:56 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: are we doing tab for indent space for align or just spaces?
16:57 <@heinrich5991> we're using tabs for indentation
17:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> does it matter? ðŸ˜„
17:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> is there somekind of stylecl for c?
17:05 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: we both have "switch (" and "switch(" no space is more common
17:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or it works for everything, I worked only with it for PHP
17:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> choose one!
17:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> tbh with space, more clearer
17:05 <+Learath2> I'd put a space but teehistorian.cpp doesn't have one
17:05 <+Learath2> actually no
17:05 <+Learath2> I wouldn't put a space
17:06 <+Learath2> will do no space after control
17:07 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> Learath2: most code doesn't have space after `if` `while` etc. in tw code
17:08 <+Learath2> nice
17:19 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: fixed https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/958
17:28 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] bors[bot] merged staging into master: https://git.io/vbhJ8
17:53 <+Learath2> well clang-format can't do indentation for PP directives
17:55 <+Learath2> and if we are running everything through clang-format I'd rather not have braces for one line blocks
17:56 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> `goto fail;`
17:59 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: well clang-format is missing indentation for PP so no way to succeed :D

19:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> web development with rust
19:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> huh, maybe i will start learn that lang
19:24 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜›
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you know when sth belongs in game/variables.h and belongs in engine/shared/config_variables.h?
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> never wondered ðŸ˜›
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> game stuff in `variables.h`, theoretically
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but lots of variables break that rule
20:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> should recategorize them sometime
20:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> why we have two files after all?
20:31 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> separation I guess?
20:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> We have lack of documentation, no idea differences between both without your help
20:34 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> one is in engine, one is in game
20:34 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> game stuff should mostly use stuff that is in game, too
20:34 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> same for engine stuff
