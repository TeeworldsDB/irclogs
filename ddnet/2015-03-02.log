14:49 < o_be_one> hi all :)
14:53 <@deen> hi
20:49  * Pwned slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
21:42 <@deen> didn't know it's that easy to get servers which can fake any ip
21:43 <@deen> they're kicking everyone on block server by sending disconnect packets from their ips
21:47 <@deen> at least they only do it on the block server
21:47 <@deen> and seemingly they can only do it on non-ddnet clients
21:51 < eeeee> deen: promote ddnet client in the broadcast?
21:52 <@deen> i did
21:52 < eeeee> did it work?
21:52 <@deen> after they shut down the servers
21:52 <@deen> using xRoThx's rcon
21:52 < eeeee> wut
21:52 <@deen> which is a bit weird
21:53 <@deen> since I made multiple safeguards against that
21:53 <@deen> he was on with ddnet client apparently
21:53 <@deen> so his port should be randomized
21:53 <@deen> and rcon logs out after each command
21:53 <@deen> but if they have his ip, through skype for example
21:53 <@deen> they can scan all his ports to try which one is correct
21:54 <@deen> and then send the shutdown rcon command until he does something in rcon
21:54 <@deen> and that would probably work =/
21:54 < eeeee> yep
21:58 < eeeee> so instead of logging into the normal rcon, maybe we can have a kind of "sudo" rcon command which doesn't require privileges (like show_others or whatever it's called)
21:58 < eeeee> having password and the actual command you want to execute as arguments
21:59 <@deen> yep, sounds good
22:02 < eeeee> would be even better if we can send a signature (rotating token from server and password hashed) instead of a password
22:03 < eeeee> that way we don't have to worry about someone accidentally sending the password to a fake server
22:04 < eeeee> or we could go all out and instrument the client to use econ over ssh
22:05 <@deen> haha
22:05 < eeeee> yeah i know, at this rate we'll soon have pentagon level security in teeworlds
22:05 < xRoThx> hahaha
22:06 < eeeee> have to pass a retina scan to log into a server
22:07 < eeeee> if we only had to support linux then econ over ssh isn't bad at all, we just shellexec ssh and that's it
22:07 < eeeee> but in windows...
22:08 <@heinrich5991> deen: is just sending the rcon password with every command an option?
22:08 <@deen> heinrich5991: yes, i think so
22:09 <@deen> would also be nice to prevent people from being kicked
22:09 <@deen> but would have to roll out protocol changes for ddnet client exclusively then
22:09 <@heinrich5991> that needs a client-side fix, so I'd call it impossible
22:09 <@deen> the server knows who's with ddnet client and who not
22:09 <@deen> so we could fix it in ddnet client
22:12 < eeeee> or we can just use js client for all your rcon needs
22:12 < eeeee> :D
22:12 < eeeee> it's tcp so much harder to inject packets
22:13 <@deen> Oooor add an ssh library and use ssh instead!
22:13 < eeeee> plus it has some ridiculous stream compression
22:14 < eeeee> in fact let's just tunnel the game traffic over ssh as well to prevent disconnects
22:15 <@deen> yep, problem solved
22:15 <@deen> can also have accounts as ssh accouns
22:16 < eeeee> hmm idk
22:16 < eeeee> feels like we'd need some LDAP for that
22:17 < eeeee> and RADIUS to support X.509
22:17 < eeeee> no enterprise will ever adopt teeworlds without that
22:18 <@deen> adopt teeworlds?
22:18 <@deen> could make it the new Second Life when we get multiplayer editor
22:19 < eeeee> seriously though, lets extend protocol so that client recieves a 32bit token from the server on connection and then passes it back with every VITAL 
22:19 <@deen> yep
22:19 < eeeee> no need for rcon changes then i guess
22:19 <@deen> that would be perfect
22:20 <@deen> make it ddnet client only and tell everyone to use ddnet client
22:20 < eeeee> yes please
22:21 < eeeee> and use a secure prng for tokens
22:21 <@heinrich5991> such as? :)
22:21 <@heinrich5991> on linux you could probably read some bytes from /dev/urandom
22:22 < eeeee> could just keep some stats on server
22:24 < eeeee> like every client latency reading probably has at least half a bit of entropy
22:27 < eeeee> or we could get sth like http://www.burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaacafa.html
22:27 < eeeee> and seed it with server rcon password :)
22:28 < eeeee> mh plus timestamp ofc
22:28 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: rolling your own crypto, classy :)
22:28 < eeeee> well do you have a better suggestion?
22:29 <@heinrich5991> read some bytes from /dev/urandom on non-windows or call an appropiate API on windows
22:31 < eeeee> that would block though
22:31 <@heinrich5991> urandom doesn't block
22:32 < eeeee> it's not a syscall?
22:32 < eeeee> it has to read from /dev/random from time to time iirc
22:32 < eeeee> also windows api prolly blocks just for the lulz
22:33 < eeeee> checks windows update for updated certified list of random numbers
22:38 < eeeee> heinrich5991: by blocking i meant not the /dev/random kind of block, but just high read latency
22:38 < eeeee> like this http://drsnyder.us/2014/04/16/linux-dev-urandom-and-concurrency.html
23:00 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: just read once then?
