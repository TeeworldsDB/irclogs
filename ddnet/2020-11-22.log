00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> ???
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> Why does it happen?
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BÂµmM>> which mod is that
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> I'm using ddnet as base
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> The default code of shotgun dont work fine
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe someone botched it, since we don't use that part of the code in ddnet
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you could compare to 0.6.5 vanilla
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> I uncommented the part that was commented on shotgun and it's like this
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, check how it looks in 0.6.5 vanilla
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> I looked at the codes and they look the same
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> @deen
03:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> @Spyry you could try to replace "FillExtraInfo" in projectile.cpp with "FillInfo". also check if the tunings are the same
03:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> idk guys but
03:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/779889700897816626/unknown.png
03:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> maybe do this space more usefull?
03:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> names can be rly long
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Spyry it's most probably a 0.6 error as I had "shotgun split pellet" bug in tracker for months before fixing it. If I recall this correctly it was due to shotgun has 5 pellets but 2 edge ones are scattered differently. It's rather easily fixed, you should just make all pellets use same algorythm. Or reuse shotgun scatter routine from 0.7.
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Though in my mod it was not so extreme. I've ported shotgun and some procedures from 0.7 from the start.
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But in fact there were custom infClass procedures. I just didn't felt like using DDNet weapon routines as I already have too many custom weapons in game which altered behaviour.
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @triki we always have to make everything work in 5:4 resolutions too, not so much space there
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Spyry though 0.6 had not this bug in vanilla so @deen is right it's something broken (but easily fixed) in DDNet code.
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/779997428421623818/screenshot-20201122101055.png
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Spyry just take my code https://gist.github.com/pure-luck-999/6b991574a73b648750d24b130109bd4a
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Maybe I've had a different problem as I've had only 1 of 7 pellets "split". As you see it was fixed by adding another coefficient to `float Spreading[]` and also checking `ShotSpread` and especially `a += Spreading....` line.
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Modding is rarely about cleanness of code anyway. And taking a well-alive teeworlds fork (which DDNet is) and not mostly stalled mainline teeworlds (which 0.7 is) you get many benefits. First of them is community and support, as I got "teeworlds is not for mods" too much in teeworlds discord. Second â€” vast library of functions to reuse. Much faster bugfixing. And the last (but not least) â€” excellent SixUp protocol :heartw:

10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And I am not flattering. Thinking about developing or supporting compatibility layer of myself is intimidating.
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And it is developed far better than I could in years.
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> @deen i think 80%(i think too much) ppl use 16:9, why just no update for they, simple info + friends or etc.but if have other. he just no will see. What u think?
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> @deen i think 80%(i think too much) ppl use 16:9, why just no update for they, simple info + friends or etc.but if have other(4:3). he just no will see. What u think?
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Spyry @stnwtr it would be very nice if one/both of you could make something like devlog about problems you encounter using DDNet as a base for a mod. I'd collect and format this info to a tutorial/wiki later. Personally I just don't remember everything I've fixed while porting my mod to DDNet but some things could be important or hard especially for a beginner in tw/ddnet modding.
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> This could revive modding culture of teeworlds as there are no tutorials on using ddnet as a base. And nowadays I think ddnet should be used as a base at least for compatibility and player count if not for other benefits.
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> HMM
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And I am still thinking about making a DDNet fork for mods which will include things that are not needed for DDRace: rounds, proper damage routines, scoring etc.
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Though it's hard for me to separate infNext code from those general fixes now.
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> better revive original infection
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Best mode
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti how? I've revived inf* by making a new actively-developed mod. Official Infclass folks were trying to revive infClass for ages and failed. If you have ideas (and/or energy), feel free to propose/implement.
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> infclass was overdeveloped
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> it was good and fun and then made meh
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> unbalanced somehow
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> unbalanced in which way
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Let's go some other channel/server, should we?
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> in favor of humans or zombs
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> And i felt annoyed when my account was deleted after 2 weeks not playing or whatever
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> getting frozen for hookcoll ðŸ¥´
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Original infection on minecraftsafok was the best :feelsamazingman:
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
11:13 <+ChillerDragon> How do you guys read this channel? All messages and notifications? Do you scroll up until the last read message? Or do you read backwards like me lol?
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> we use discord because this is 2020
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sry for spam @noby xd
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i didnt see msg sry
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> uh
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wat
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its broken with 0.7 client bcs the map wasnt converted correctly
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont use 0.7 and i dont know how to map ðŸ˜…
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it replaces the external images with the 0.6 ones bcs 0.7 ones changed
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> other people have mapped this for me
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u just need to run the tool with a data dir
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> whats broken about it? / how would it be fixed
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> else it cannot replace the images correctly
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/780019148679806996/screenshot_2020-11-22_11-37-23.png
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh the doodads
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> gfx_high_detail 0
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xDD
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> will the tool increase map file size?
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> a bit yes
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we have another tool to decrease it
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but its not compiled in the client, its only compilable yourself ðŸ˜„
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its called map_optimize
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> aw man i was hoping u were gonna fix it xd
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i can fix ur 0.7 map if u want
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do you want it as small as possible?
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes pls
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and this will be not noticeable if u have gfx_high_detail 0?
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not even with 1
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> nice
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Okay, sounds good
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> No need to go into details if you're not the kind of person which likes to write a lot. Just take records of obstacle you've stumbled upon. Just a list.
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> I will, however, I can't say when I will start ... maybe not in a few weeks, life is pretty stressful right now xd
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> What is the difference between Map Version 3 and 4?
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> `v4 has uncompressed data sizes as well`
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> This only? And what exactly does that mean?
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I have no idea what are map version 3 and 4 are. As far as I am aware it's 0.7 maps format which removed some necessary data for 0.6 to load it properly.
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And as I know there is no way to simply know without loading which map file version you have. There are no tools for that. But I hope someone will correct me.
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And also no tool to downgrade 0.7 map to 0.6 too.
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> so 0.6 and 0.7 are not compatibel
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> ddnet is an upgrade of 0.6
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> 0.6 and ddnet should be more ore less compatibel (on loading on different servers)
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> The Map-Version (in 0.6 and ddnet) is the first 4byte sized integer after the DATA or ATAD signature
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Are we talking about maps now?
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Are we still talking about maps now?
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @stnwtr which is the offset for map version? is it fixed?
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's wanted to be able to simply open map in hexeditor and instantly know if it for 0.6 or 0.7
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> https://i.imgur.com/RjrdYAx.png
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> I mean this Version
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Here the selected value is a 4 -> version 4
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @stnwtr I see no difference in 0.6 and 0.7 maps. All them are v4
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I think v3 is for 0.5
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I hope this will make this clearer to you

13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> sorry for edit spammer (for those who are sensitive)
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> sorry for edit spamming (for those who are sensitive)
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> take this for a reference

13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Pure_luck i think the first give-away that its a 0.6/0.7 map would be in the third item
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> You sent 4 Images? xd
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the first element in the item_data is 1 for 0.6 maps and 2 for 0.7 maps
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've just edited image 6 times
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/780047904387629086/Screenshot_from_2020-11-22_15-31-07.png
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> too bad this channel is linked to IRC and some people here are oversensitive to edits which bridge obviously does not support
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> however you will need to find the first item which isnt trivial
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i use https://ide.kaitai.io/# for inspecting maps, with the extension https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/doc/datafile_v4.ksy
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Maybe we need another channel/server to discuss freely as here I am living in constant psychological pressure of waiting for "you are spam-editing our IRC-bridged" channel ðŸ˜…
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Anyway, that's the 7th version of an image
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/780048623273508894/Screenshot_from_2020-11-22_15-33-26.png
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've wanted to make a separate discord server for modders, but there are just not to much beginners and old modders just know everything they've needed
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> last time we've discussed that we've decided that #dev channel in my server is a suitable place
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> though if there will be #mods channel I'd appreciate that
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> why can the ddnet client save 0.6 maps only mostly?
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> cause if you will use ddnet tiles 0.6 server will not understand them
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> game layer and other DDNet layers I mean
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but it can completely open + save 0.6 maps without problems
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yes, but it's about saving and then opening on another version. Hard to make 2d infographics on that
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that should be completely possible
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> afaik
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yes, but I am talking about saving then opening
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> though that last section could be misleading as it's about servers opening the result of saving, not clients
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> no information should be lost when opening 0.6 maps with the ddnet client and then saving it. 0.6 clients could then easily open the maps without problems
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> cant 0.7 vanilla client join ddnet servers?
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> i thought they support that protocol
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yes, but what I've intended to say:
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> * 0.6 vanilla client can open ddnet map in editor, but you could not use DDNet game tiles and layers or it will be tricky
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> * DDNet client can save ddnet map but it will not be purely 0.6 map as it will contain game tiles and layers which 0.6 server will not understand
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ok, maybe there should be a legend. Or I just need to remove that last section
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm i still don't quite understand what purpose the last section was supposed to have
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> also i think 0.7 should be able to open 0.6 maps without any problems, server + editor
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> well except for the mapres i guess, fair
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> So, no matter which maps i am going to make (for 0.6 / ddnet and NOT 0.7) -> i should create maps with ddnet?
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> maybe 0.7 server can open 0.6 maps without converting
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> not sure
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea i think so
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @stnwtr yes, stick to DDNet editor.
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> why not rewrite the ddnet map logic to 0.7 to support all maps?
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> it has all the backwards compatibility
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and never ever open your maps in 0.7 editor
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> as there is no way back after saving them to 0.7 format
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> you could use my conversion tool :p
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> to get from 0.7 back to 0.6?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Patiga do you have 0.7 -> 0.6 conversion tool?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> whoa
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> where? I have a lot of 0.7 maps that I could not use now
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> as I've edited them in 0.7 editor or lost 0.6 sources
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> for vanilla @Patiga ?
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> well it is a ddnet map in theory, but like i said its just as well a 0.6 map, since when you convert it from a 0.7 map you dont use any stuff from ddnet
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Could you explain me the structure of TW/DDnet maps in different versions?
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Patiga give me a link to your tool please
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap < the tool, however currently you would need to use the `directory-map-format` branch
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the binary `edit_map` can do the conversion
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> if you like i can build it for you
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> which platform are you on?
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> (though its command line based)
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> omg is it in Rust?
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea ^^
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Arch
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it seems that I need something like `cargo run Compiling`
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it seems that I need something like `cargo run`
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `cargo build --release`
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> on the branch `directory-map-format`
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> whoa it doing something
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/780052394637262848/edit_map
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh you are already building ^^
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> how to convert 0.7 map to 0.6 now?
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ah, edit_map binary
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yea, it can hopefully explain itself
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> wow, it have really nice help
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> :heartw:
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @noby fix your map bruh
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> @Patiga Could you explain me the structure of TW/DDnet maps in different versions?
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> What exactly is the difference between the Map versions and so on?
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sry forgot that question
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i documented the map format here: https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/doc/map.md
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> + is Map Version 3 still supported somewhere?
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> thank you!
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> got lunch now tho
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> think version 3 is supported by the clients, 100% sure tho
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i support it anyways ^^
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Ahhh this documentation is soo helpful xd
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Wow, so teeworlds/DDNet do have some documentation after all ðŸ˜„
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> today is a day of great finds!
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Patiga your tool works perfectly!
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And I've saved my old 0.7 maps from oblivion with it
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Is there somewhere a good 0.7 Map documentation as well?
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @stnwtr the documentation is about both 0.7 (vanilla) and ddnet ^^
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i think version 3 is supported by the clients, not 100% sure tho
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> edit: it is supported by both clients
