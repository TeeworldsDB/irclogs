00:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> fix that audio pls
00:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> it sounds like my ears are full of water
00:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> it makes me feel weird
00:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> agree
00:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Deeper> :/
00:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen the master stats are using up quite some space if left uncompressed
00:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 5.4 GiB for a whole day (18 MiB compressed)
00:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, the 18 MiB are probably not a whole day
00:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but still, we only have 20 GiB remaining on ddnet.tw
00:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 120 MB for a whole day, so maybe a bit too much
00:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> will think about it later
00:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can we increase the disk size for now? ^^
00:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyway, I'm off. good night ðŸ™‚
00:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sounds like a waste of money. good night
00:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> iâ€˜ll delete some useless stuff tomorrow
02:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> OH THIS
02:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i had something similar on my map c when i was testing it
02:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i have no idea how it works tho (never considered it being affected by being frozen or not)
07:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @deen usa sketch server just died for some reason
07:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh nvm its all of USa
08:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think json a space efficient format, tho its good for api responses
12:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Get with the times grandpa, space is free now
12:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well maybe for ur server it is, but i prefer to have my disks as m2 ssds and usually they arent that free
12:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
12:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Bro pls all space is free now whether it be ram or whatever kind of disk you prefer
12:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's how everyone codes
12:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
12:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 250g game is ok. Browsers using 5g of ram is ok
12:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, atleast json comoresses decently being repetitive
12:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Compresses*
12:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 300 KB json is ok
13:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> https://nocarrier.co.uk/json-sucks
13:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> nothing is perfect ðŸ™‚
13:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Using msgpack isnt an alternative?
13:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> It uses the key: value pattern like json, but encoding is made for m2m ( maschine 2 maschine )
13:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.techpowerup.com/282422/tsmc-claims-breakthrough-on-1nm-chip-production
15:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> so i want to bind that when i press a (/pause key) it also do the zZz emote
16:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> without packet overhead, it seems to be about 120 KiB transferred (measured using wireshark, subtracted 42 B/packet for headers) for the old serverinfo protocol and <50 KiB transferred for the new serverinfo protocol @Learath2
16:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this doesn't seem to be a case of "space is free now, that's how everyone codes"
16:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> re-checked, it's 60 KiB with the 0.7 servers
16:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it's a net improvement surely, it's just not as tightly packed as it can be given this is mostly m2m. Protobuf and msgpack would both pack this tighter
16:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm okay with json since it's easier to consume on a website
16:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> seems to make a 5% improvement of gzip'ped msgpack over gzip'ped json (that's the transport encoding the webserver chooses)
16:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what about br
16:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli
16:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, I checked what the webserver chooses
16:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see
