00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i had problems with this for a long time...
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> this is actually a topic where i prefer to be a windows user, since it works out of the box
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> when i turn off my bluetooth headset it sometimes wouldn't reconnect and i'd have to reboot while my bluetooth headset is on.
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> when trying to reconnect manually it would give me this error: 'Failed to connect: org.bluez.Error.Failed br-connection-profile-unavailable'
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i had problems with this for a long time...

00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't know how it used to be with pulseaudio, nor with bluez of the past, but if I have bluetoothd running and I pair with bluetoothctl, it just works fine, literally out of the box
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i was using pipewire too.
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, guess I just got lucky
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but actually it's cool that it worked quite fast without configuring lots of config files.
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> if you have noise cancelling, can you actually turn that on/off with bluetoothctl too?
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> right now i do this on my phone with the sony headset app
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, on my headset the left touchpad turns on/off the noise cancelling. But I'm pretty sure it was part of the bluetooth interface, just need to dig around to find how to send the correct packet üòÑ
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i disabled my touchpad, because i sometimes touched it accidently, skipping my music or something. now it sometimes crashes, makes a noise and shuts down when i touch it. funny that a bluetooth headset can crash üòÑ
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/Plutoberth/SonyHeadphonesClient seems this guy reverse engineered the proprietary part already
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> nice, i need to try this out for my wh-xb919n. then i only need a smartwatch with reverse engineered software and feel complete xD

03:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Unfortunately other colors don't work
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Oh also this: https://www.engraved.blog/building-a-virtual-machine-inside/
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Oh also this: <https://www.engraved.blog/building-a-virtual-machine-inside/>
03:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I know @Not Keks will be interested in reading this ^
06:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Again? Xd
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 3rd time
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ChillerDragon: https://github.com/valence-rs/valence
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Edw Mark zha> how to make custom guns :d?
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> by putting another game.png in %appdata%/ddnet, for example https://forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=506&hilit=game+png+aoe
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> by putting another game.png in %appdata%/ddnet, for example https://forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=506
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Oh lol, didnt know you already read it, sorry
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> I read it again xdd tho it was more scrolling over
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I made it act like a node.js console
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> It worked well but i was on phone and couldn't do more lines
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> But setting variables and making functions worked
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Next time I need to install something really fast i'm gonna ask it to generate a powershell script for it
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does anyone know a terminal sql client that can do postgres, mariadb, mysql?
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Why would you want one for all of them?
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think everyone just uses psql and mysql respectively
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, just so I can have less packages on my system tbf üòÑ
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `mysql` works for mariadb and mysql since they are mostly compatible
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also thought maybe there might be a client that's a little more ergonomic
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I really wouldn't want to deal with this imaginary tool not supporting the DBMS perfectly. Safest bet to use the standard cmd line tool
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That said, google tells me https://github.com/xo/usql
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, at the end of the day, aren't you the one writing the queries? The client shouldn't really be doing much at all except maybe display some helpful visuals
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The client has to support the right data types and be able to display them properly, for example with jsonb
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> error messages have to contain all relevant information
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> many DBMSes have nice convenience functions like `\dt`
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw u can prettyfy psql and sqlite
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```bash
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ‚ùØ cat .sqliterc
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #.mode column
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> .headers on
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #.separator ROW "\n"
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> .nullvalue NULL
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> .mode line
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> .timer ON
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> .psqlrc can be made too irc
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont have one rn
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> pipewire truly is the best thing since sliced bread üòÑ
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1050822428642779236/test.png
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can mix sources however I want, I can put filter nodes inbetween for noise reduction, EQ
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> what is that tool called?
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> looks fun
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> qpwgraph
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so its just display?
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or can u modify stuff there
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can also manage the graph in cli but working with graphs one node/edge at a time is not pleasent
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can change connections between nodes as I like here
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats cool üòÑ
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Filter nodes are provided by 3rd party programs or you can create filter chains yourself in pipewire configs and the nodes will be created when pipewire launches
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then you can wire them up however you like
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> When I saw this I thought it was gibberish xD. Really cool though
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can also use lua to program what sources go to which sinks. I saw a guy who when he brings his laptop home it auto connects to his desktop so he gets only his notification audio on both headphones and a bluetooth speaker in the middle of his house
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @heinrich5991 `RustVersionPrint` in rust_version.cpp looks unused or is it there to understand how to call rust code from c++?
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it got unused somewhen
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it was supposed to be called on server and client startup
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it got lost somewhen
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Edw Mark zha> I mean a custom gun, like a shotgun that fires grenade shells x2
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Code
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Edw Mark zha> Is there any tutorial
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Edw Mark zha> or example of a custom gun
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> life aint so easy
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> first know c++
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then learn the codebase
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Development
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Edw Mark zha> i prefear killing my self
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Edw Mark zha> never mind
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Edw Mark zha> bruh
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Seems even less complete than feather but yea still cool
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Ryozuki)
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chiller the downer
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Edw Mark zha> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1050895743742922772/Screenshot_20221209-230405_Google.jpg
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Edw Mark zha> the video: Hello guys, today i will teach you c++.
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Edw Mark zha> thats all for today
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Edw Mark zha> thats all for today, Cya
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do you monitor service availability?
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does someone have stories how they do it at work?
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we usually only notice that something is down once users report it here
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> have a separate serverr
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pinging
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do you set that up?
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> presumably also checking stuff like "enough servers in server list"?
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> large jumps in server number?
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but how do you track that
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES2_Shrug:
