08:56 <+ACTom> hi
08:57 <+ACTom> Does ddnet or teeworlds has any plans to stop support Windows XP?
09:47 <@heinrich5991> ACTom: I don't think so, at least not active plans. why do you ask?
09:55 <+ACTom> There're some students have interest in tws/ddnet's source code, but compile environment in Windows is complex, need to change unicode to English, so I'd like to make a virtual machine with compile environment, if there is not a plan to stop XP, I'll do it using Windows XP.(it's smaller than 7)
10:31 <@heinrich5991> ACTom: making a winxp vm for compiling teeworlds should be a safe bet
10:31 <@heinrich5991> however, xp is totally outdated. if you connect it to the internet, you *will* get viruses
11:02 <+ACTom> yeah, but xp's image is smaller than 7, you know, China's network isn't very well..
15:25 <@deen> make a linux image!
15:46 <@deen> our teacher back in school was cool. he allowed me and a friend to hold a class for a few months, installing gentoo and explaining linux on the way
16:00 <@heinrich5991> nice
16:44 <+o_be_one> hello
16:45 <+o_be_one> ahah deen ok the host i was talking yesterday is a host ive continued to pay but we have already migrated can ddnet to a new host, ive just forgot to stop to renew -_-.
18:21 <@deen> o_be_one: ah, ok
