03:18 < bridge> [freenode] <nemo> ok... I thought font was changed and people were complaining?
03:18  * bridge [freenode] <nemo> shrugs
07:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nemo: No, I think the font rendering was improved and thus the text looks crisper/different now
08:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> but the settings icon is so off center now lol
08:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the gui is broken anyway:

08:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>     CUIRect r = *this;
08:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>     Cut *= Scale();
08:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>

08:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
08:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they call it hmargin and vmargin and just swap both xD
08:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
08:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno if the creator of this thought margin to the horizontal/vert. line, but that would be black magic

17:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Henningstone> Hey I've got a question, just out of curiosity... When joining a DDNet server it will send me a chat message that's like "if you know botters report them to the moderator" or smth; now the thing is: if the server's got 63/64 clients connected, this message is sent from ID -1 as expected, but if noone on the server has got ID 63 (I assume), this message is sent from ID 63 instead and thus (normally <message clipped>
17:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know about that message
17:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What server and what message exactly @Henningstone ?
17:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Henningstone> all the official DDNet servers. Here's a screenshot of the message that appears when joining a full (63/64) server:
17:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Henningstone> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/432569659490041897/unknown.png
18:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol
18:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what is it for
18:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <Henningstone> most likely a bug as far as I can see
18:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Never saw this message
18:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ddnet easter egg :GWchadThinkeyes:
21:29 <@deen> Are you sure that's on official server?
21:30 <@deen> oh, apparently it is
21:31 <@deen> the code looks wrong indeed :D heinrich5991 wrote that I guess
21:33 <@deen> but he's on vacation I think, I'll just leave it for now
22:24 <@deen> @Jupeyy totally stable 60 fps zoomed out on fully packed 64 player server with my 10 year old laptop with integrated graphics, no lags with chinese text. :)
22:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nice \o/
22:25 <@deen> (just had to switch to intel driver instead of modesetting, otherwise I got software opengl rendering)
22:27 <@deen> that old laptop feels faster than new company laptop anyway...
22:28 <@deen> only problem is that intel will not provide microcode updates against spectre for it
22:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> any new piece of tech I get crumbles to pieces very quickly :/
22:28 <@deen> how so?
22:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have  a gameboy advance sp still in perfect working condition but my 3DS is already broken
22:30 <@deen> To be fair I have seen many broken GBAs :D
22:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My main laptop is a Thinkpad T440p, an 2010 macbook pro is completely unusable now
22:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My main laptop is a Thinkpad T440p, an 2014 macbook pro is completely unusable now
22:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My grandmothers Nokia 3310 is still kicking, I went through two iphones and my samsung is already getting sluggish
22:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They just don't build em' good nowadays ðŸ˜›
22:33 <@deen> Hm, I don't remember hardware breaking at all for me in the last few years
22:33 <@deen> just being annoyed at software :D
22:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also really annoyed at my "smart" tv
22:34 <@deen> I ran an update on an LG one, afterwards it stopped supporting subtitle switching
22:34 <@deen> and of course the update is irreversible
22:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't understand how they can think that sluggish interface is acceptable? I don't think it'd cost them shit to put a better processor in there but no, lets put the bare minimum
22:35 <@deen> and support says they never officially announced supporting that feature, so it's ok for them to randomly remove it without writing in the changelog
22:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd very happily pay the 100$ premium it might cost them to put an actual proper processor in there
22:35 <@deen> it's not about the processor, mine has a fast quadcore
22:35 <@deen> and still takes 1 minute until I can press any key and something moves
22:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So it's software?
22:36 <@deen> Sure
22:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's beyond me how those get through QA at all, I'd be embarrassed to even submit that for testing
22:37 <@deen> well, people don't seem to mind, they keep buying
22:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because they dont know
22:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `Could NOT find SDL2_net (missing: SDL2_NET_LIBRARIES) (found version
22:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>   "2.0.1")` good job cmake
22:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've been seeing some horrible software engineering work recently, I don't understand how someone can do work that they take no pride in
22:38 <@deen> Learath2: to earn money? :D
22:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would rather sell toasts at the corner or work at a coffeeshop then release some of the things I've seen
22:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki :thonkery:
22:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 nvm i fixed it
22:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Found SDL2_net: C:/SDL2-2.0.8/include (found version "2.0.1")
22:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ‘Œ
22:40 <@deen> what are you doing with sdl2_net?
22:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> windows sucks with cmake
22:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk im gonna try it
22:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> deen: would you put out code that you don't feel good about just for the money?
22:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/docs/SDL_net_frame.html
22:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> deen, why dont you come over to discord?
22:41 <@deen> Learath2: yes, I don't feel good about ddnet code either and it's still out :D
22:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not like we get paid for it
22:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
22:42 <@deen> fokkonaut: i saw lots of spam on discord so i closed window
22:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this game gave me more hours playing than paid games
22:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gives*
22:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> deen xD
22:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it's funny cuz bugs in this game create more gameplay
22:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Point is if I always try to do my best even if it doesn't yield me anything extra, an indian guy tried to pass off `md5(date())` as authentication
22:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
22:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even if you paid me 10$/h I wouldn't try to pawn that off on you...
22:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he rly did that?
22:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep
22:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not even salting
22:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What salt?
22:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it makes the hash from the current date?
22:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He used md5 or sha256 of the current date as the authorization proof
22:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that reminded me of https://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/
22:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://prntscr.com/j2mg8q
22:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
22:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> he also used unsalted md5 for all the passwords but as there was no authorization that was a second priority
22:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I worked for 8 hours straight just to patch in some shitty token authorization
22:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```A modern server can calculate the MD5 hash of about 330MB every second. If your users have passwords which are lowercase, alphanumeric, and 6 characters long, you can try every single possible password of that size in around 40 seconds.```
22:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
22:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :GWqlabsGarThink:
22:49 <@deen> The craftsmen in my apartment destroyed some dishes while painting my kitchen, painted over a display and left a mess everywhere. So I turned on the vacuum to clean it up, turns out they also filled up my vacuum to the top so the bag exploded immediately. So I'm not surprised at your programmer example :D
22:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
22:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Think of what you can calculate with a serverfarm, which is very easy in this day and age, EC2, digitalocean, google cloud. So easy to get thousands of servers for a minute or so
22:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> painted over the display?
22:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would be very very angry
22:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> deen: guess who isn't getting hired again?
22:50 <@deen> learath2: that programmer?
22:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> him and your craftsmen ðŸ˜›
22:51 <@deen> sure they are, just by someone else
22:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk the situation in germany but in turkey craftsmen operate with references, you do shit like that you aren't going to find a job anywhere in my social circle nor in my neighbourhood
22:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do you talk to your neighbourhood?
22:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here nobody does xd
22:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I talk with the guy who works at the store, after that it easily travels to the entire place ðŸ˜›
22:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Turkish people love gossip
22:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :O
22:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also seems to be the case in italy, the only way you find a handyman is by asking someone else for theirs
22:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh let me show you the wonderloop
22:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `foreach($array as $key => $value) { $array[$key]['id'] = $value['id']; }
22:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `foreach($array as $key => $value) { $array[$key]['id'] = $value['id']; }`
22:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This was littered all over the code
