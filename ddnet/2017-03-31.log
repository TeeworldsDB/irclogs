00:07 < grenadepro> actually dont need this line https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/ddracecommands.cpp#L305
00:08 < grenadepro> fixed :)
00:08 < Henningstone> you should rather add a range check for the input from the console command...
00:09 < grenadepro> but what this line for ? i mean L305
00:10 < grenadepro> this line is enough https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/ddracecommands.cpp#L308
00:11 < grenadepro> check tele and teleto
00:13 < Henningstone> it checks if there is a player with the given ID
00:13 < grenadepro> maybe check "if (pSelf->m_apPlayers[TeleTo])" after L308 work ...
00:13 < Henningstone> but if GetPlayerChar does that too, it would actually be unnecessary
00:14 < grenadepro> yes exactly
00:14 < Henningstone> ok it really does that ^^ https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/bffb989a11b610ae95366262e9c9ce81c11ba4f8/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L109-L110
00:15 < Henningstone> so yeah, https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/bffb989a11b610ae95366262e9c9ce81c11ba4f8/src/game/server/ddracecommands.cpp#L305 has to be removed as you said
00:16 < grenadepro> yeah
01:10 < grenadepro> good night
