00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> What an absolute joke... I'm still waiting on which country you want the lawyer in
00:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or do I need to get one in every country?
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> would germany suffice for you?
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> given that this is where we're from?
00:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd say we should get licenses for the tilemaps we can too, but seeing how you react to the maps, I'm scared to even propose that
00:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> yea get the lawyer
00:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> ask if its legal to license maps that contain other tilesets or parts of other maps that dont have compatible licenses
00:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is germany fine?
00:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> y
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Imagine spending money because jao decided this is a great hill to die on
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> jao why do you want a lawyer, you dont have liability in this
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 🤡
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only deen probs
00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just stop this ridiculous hate towards heinrich
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> u are the ones who dont want to accept it lol
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> licensing maps is common sense, the CC-BY licenses are human readable, they are project made for this
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so stop this bullshit
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> > [1:04 AM] jao: u are the ones who dont want to accept it lol
00:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The fact that you unanimously decided this is a bad idea?
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 how can you allow 1 admin to gatekeep something so important
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> so u think its normal to start a discussion again and again after its done because the result isnt ur opinion?
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "its done"? whats done
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> if its so important why has no one cared about it for 7 years
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Result? What result @jao ? Everytime you swoop in and say we aren't lawyers and say discussion is over
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> if its so important why dont u license old maps or remove them
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because we werent on a platform such as steam were there can be legal issues
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> that argument is hypocritical
00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its common sense
00:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> What discussion even, it's only us trying to appease you, for hours at end and you just saying no
00:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 the result was that u couldnt answer my questions and stopped responding
00:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why do we even try to appease him? just lets do it
00:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> the thing is steam cares about licenses and maps that ddnet releases as official are ddnet's responsibility
00:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this guy is to ego to accept anything right now
00:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> if steam cares about licenses then u have to only allow ddnet servers for steam client
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> otherwise any random server can put illegal maps up
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We are responsible for what we publish
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> What some random server publishes isn't our concern
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we dont ship ddnet servers with the configuration of ddracenetwork, we ship only a server and client executable along with some skins
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> u ship ddnet client to steam
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> not our ddnet srv
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tell us
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats so wrong
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> about licensing the map
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> go ahead
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is ridiculous
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not worse than what we have right now
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> ive said my opinion last time already
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the map licensing is not directly related to steam (except for the two maps we ship with the client)
00:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tell me
00:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont remember it
00:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> go
00:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> whats an illegal map 👀
00:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> yes
00:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> i agree that u have to license the maps in the client
00:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can license the maps on released on ddnet too
00:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is no pejorative
00:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> you can do anything
00:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> but u dont have to
00:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> and its not important af like u make it look like
00:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> your mindset is the one i hate most
00:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stall in ur life
00:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it's important for some people
00:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just because u dont care
00:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur just ego
00:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> if its so important then why havent u done it 7 years ago
00:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> ur ego
00:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> BECAUSE WE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT
00:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this excuse
00:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> why didnt u think about it
00:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because most of us aren't 17yo anymore
00:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Hi im too dumb to decide
00:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> projects grow
00:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> I kind of laugh at how 4 ppl have to explain to one guy why this is important, like explaining it to him even matters
00:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Soreu it kinda does when he can just stop us from doing it
00:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> it wasn't done 7 years ago because ddnet wasn't going on steam 7 years ago
00:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if he wasnt in care of map testing i would just make him go
00:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should probs search someone else
00:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> put someone else for map testing
00:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> one of the testers
00:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Learath2 how he can stop you, if you are responsible for the code, servers, and so on. Unless I'm missing some point that he has legal rights to block everything due to getting console rights on the servers
00:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll just go to sleep, tired of arguing. I'll try contacting a german lawyer that specialises in copyright law tomorrow and hope he'll give me a discount
00:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> and that
00:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> > if its so important then why havent u done it 7 years ago
00:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> dumbest argument ever
00:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> he's an admin and we don't want to push forward for something that someone disagrees with so vehemently
00:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my take
00:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> Either way, you ain't forcing anyone to add the licenses. You are ASKING to do so
00:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> and ur argument to remove me because i disagree with u is good? XD
00:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> what about respecting someones opinion
00:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> says you
00:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who just because someone says x u directly disagree
00:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Soreu we work as a team, can't really go ahead when people are objecting as it takes all of us to run this thing
00:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> i gave u arguments for my opinion
00:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u still havent provided proper arguments
00:15  * fstd senses drama
00:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> Respecting someone's opinion is one thing, being completely close-minded about specific subjects is another, when you don't even get the arguments presented by others
00:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> if i think those arguments make sense, whats wrong about it?
00:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tell me your arguments
00:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> So did we, which you dismissed the entirety of because we aren't lawyers
00:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> im not completely close minded
00:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tell me your arguments
00:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> why do u want to force me to change my opinion
00:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> u want to change my opinion based on what u believe
00:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> i want the same
00:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tell me your arguments
00:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> > big discussion incoming
00:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @ᶰ°Konͧsti
00:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so thats it
00:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @Learath2
00:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no arguments at all
00:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> sry that ping was accidently Learath xd
00:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is a community driven project, you can't be here without wanting to even bend over a bit for others
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> > [1:11 AM] jao: if its so important then why havent u done it 7 years ago
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is a recurring one
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> > [1:05 AM] jao: if its so important why dont u license old maps or remove them
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is another one
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> > [12:51 AM] jao: if law was so easy there wouldnt be need for lawyers
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is the last one I remember
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> I'd go get popcorn, but it's tiring to even read all that so ima just go play something until the senseless discussion of not adding licenses is hopefully over...
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> why not bend for me
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> when did u ever bend for someone
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i bended for ddnet lot of times
00:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> specially coding
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> i remember last time when u talked shit about lady saavik when she didnt like a thing in ur feature
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> honestly this disgusts me that 1 person can do this
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> where did u bend then
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i bended by adding options
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> u make it personal because i dont agree
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> because U AIN'T BENDING, when other members of your admin team wants same thing and you're the one that doesn't agree with them. You do have your point, ok, but in this case and bending it should be done towards majority >.>
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao didn't he completely abandon it because you and saavik didn't like it?
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to make it like how she wanted
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i think that the decision is headed to jao cuz hes a responsible admin and also responsible for the complete map testing xd
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont give me bullshit
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and he added like 5 options before giving up 😛
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1 feature
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> was completly abandoned
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> showing weapons when frozen
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> good feature
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> such a crazy feature
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ᶰ°Konͧsti jao gatekeeped it
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> wtf why was it not added
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> so his bending is insulting others and then abonding it
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> see
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> also he bended af to also include suggestions by me, even though he thought these were totally useless ones (and later community decided even further ones)
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i knew it was a good feature
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> > wtf why was it not added
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @plsplsplslol
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> so that's not going to get added @Ryozuki ?
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> ...but i'm out, gn & have fun
00:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Ravie jao and saavik were crazy about it not being added
00:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> actually just know the weapon numbers ez
00:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> well I had my own idea for it but I can respect that the person actually making it wants it a different way
00:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2307
00:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here is how it looked
00:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look the amount of options
00:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> disabling ninja particles would actually be sick
00:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> and hiding the sword
00:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> HMM
00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> back to map licensing
00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should do it
00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> show ninja skin and real weapon
00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 map releases are handled with django?
00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can just force it there
00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> you can disable ninja particles thru image editing but it makes some maps unplayable
00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and announce it
00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki it's trivial to implement it
00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> not going forward with it before we all reach an agreement though
00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so he will gatekeep this forever with his only argument being "if its so important why..."
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im done
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i go watch anime
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> have fun
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Neither will anyone else, no one wants to be the one that kills ddnet 😛
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lmfao these huge trolls reacting on a nouis message
00:24 <+fstd> rip ddnet
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Im not a troll
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hey maybe deen will make an executive decision to nuke ddnet
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> u reacted too
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> U
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 he did that
00:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if u were here
00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was, more lurking back then though
00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> wait deen is the head honcho right
00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> deen is the best thing ever happened to tw
00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye without deen we would have nothing at all
00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ᶰ°Konͧsti plsnomorereactionspam
00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> wat
00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u can disable external emojis
00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 no more trolls
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's making my script have a seizure
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Im only reacting one single time
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i think ddnet should become a public company
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Its plsplsplstroll
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> no u
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> what script
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddracenetwork is not trademarked, someone could steal the name ez
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby some statistics thing I'm trying out
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> is it open src
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> onby is ur gores Assistent tool os?

00:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> no
00:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> can u make?
00:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby nope, it's just an experiment
00:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> what does it do
00:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Training a neural network to act like the average ddnet discord member
00:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> hahaha
00:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> so why is reaction spam bad :troll:
00:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It always wants to say :justatest: for some reason though
00:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> because` :justatest: `
00:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I have a bug somewhere 😄
00:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> when ur finished u should make it into an account and nobody will notice
00:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> maybe the account name is louis and its been an ongoing experiment
00:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :justatest:
00:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> :justatest:
00:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> no its probably cellegen
00:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hey @Ravie, while you're here btw
00:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> can u give license?
00:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :troll:
00:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> quite a few skins in the ddnet client are from you
00:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (15)
00:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @heinrich5991 how many by Whis?
00:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 30
00:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lmao

00:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check out https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2518 @ᶰ°Konͧsti
00:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ravie did you already make your mind up whether and how you'd license your skins?
00:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I ask Whis for license but hes gone sleep 1h ago
00:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks @ᶰ°Konͧsti
00:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> those old cat skins are terrible but I think saying to remove them would be selfish, I don't really care what happens with them
00:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aoe skins were famous back then, but nowadays i dont see ppl with them
00:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pepe> Sleep is for the weaks
00:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> isn't it like afternoon where you live
00:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pepe> indeed
00:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pepe> 18:35
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pepe> but im awake at 2am too :justatest:
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Welf> they removed aoe Skins from ddnet
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Welf> Right?
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/734177203423805480/image0.png
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> wtf is with these names
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @louis aoe made personal skins
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 00 is a dirty trick
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to list them first
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on he client
00:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the*
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> its so bloat
00:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> should change name or remove
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> those aren't in the client
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> can we add bot skin by @eNJi to default skins?
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> yea but having it in database is stupid
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> like you
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> whos gonna use a skin with someone elses name on it
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> u

01:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ravie it'd be cool if you could license your skins under either CC-BY-SA, CC-BY or CC0
01:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 
01:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> BY means that others have to credit you when they share the skin.
01:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 
01:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> SA (share alike) means that if someone else modifies the skin, they also have to give permission to share etc.
01:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> don't really care about getting credit for them
01:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> (in fact I'd rather nobody knows I made them xD)
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> CC0 is without mandatory credit
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> @heinrich5991 how far is the rls on steam?
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Do you know that?
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah that's fine, how do I make it official?
01:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> can u even rls on steam?
01:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> didnt they change something
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Trafalgar Law release is currently uncertain
01:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @heinrich5991 @Whis wants to give license
01:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ravie either write here or on github that you release your skins as CC0. note that you also have the x_spec skin, but CC0 would be fine for that as well (but you can also do something else there if you want)
01:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Whis> use them if you want, you have all my permissions for it (CC-BY) @heinrich5991
01:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cool, thank you @Whis 🙂
01:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> Why are we doing the licensing thing? I really don't care what people do with my stuff on the internet as long as they are not being dicks. People know I don't mind and I won't sue them. I always took teeworlds stuff be it code or assets and used/modified it. I knew the creator wouldn't mind, often they were long gone and I wouldn't be able to ask them anyways. If we're putting of a few maps under non-restrictive licenses we are indirectly
01:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> all of my skins currently included in ddnet client (kitties and x_spec) are licensed under CC0
01:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro maps fall under copyright whether we acknowledge it or not. we're probably not going to go over all past maps and check with their authors, and rather the lack of takedown requests as permission to host them. we were made aware of some of the copyright problems by trying to publish on steam, so we're working to get everything we ship with the client properly licensed and perhaps also future maps
01:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> Only a few maps like Kobra are shipped with the client
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, two
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Kobra 3 and Goo!
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2519
01:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is only about mappers who contacted us about map licenses
01:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> CC-BY matches my "don't be a dick" philosophy, so hereby my maps are under CC-BY (can't speak for my co-mappers).
01:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> 
01:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> But I don't believe bringing up licensing is a good idea for the teeworlds community. I understand that it's necessary for steam, but for everything not concerning the steam release if it was for me I wouldn't just not touch on the subject.
01:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> CC-BY matches my "don't be a dick" philosophy, so hereby my maps are under CC-BY (can't speak for my co-mappers).

01:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> @heinrich5991 <-
01:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, thanks 🙂
01:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Im not the only mapper of Not Adrenaline 6
01:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Silex is the main mapper and me and and stormphoenix are comapper
01:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oops, didn't read properly
01:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks for the note
01:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro why is not a good idea?
01:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh come one @Ryozuki
01:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we had this discussion five times already ^^
01:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i seriously still dont know why
01:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you really want to start another one ^^
01:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to know
01:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > But I don't believe bringing up licensing is a good idea for the teeworlds community.
01:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think that summarizes it
01:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because people will think about licenses and that can lead to outcomes timakro doesn't like
01:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah I might have stated my opinion on that before, I don't remember :D
01:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure, but we had a discussion similar to this like 5 times in the last weeks ^^
01:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not with you though
01:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i still havent seen a proepr argument tho
02:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> Wow you can edit these kinds of checklists in github issues just by clicking them ... I'm sure there are more people like me who wonder why they can click it and accidentally edit something (don't worry I changed it back)
02:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we have a history, should be good
02:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> note that only people with access to the repo can click the checkboxes
02:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> ik ofc
02:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I think license can be good to avoid Aoe discussions a la "DDNet sux, delete my maps"
02:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> you can still be annoying about it with a license
02:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How can I add fast download for DDNet clients to my 0.7 bridge mod?
02:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah, I think I have it
03:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Welf> aoe wanted ddnet to delete his Maps?
03:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> yes
04:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <eNJi> rly? xd
05:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pepe> Show proves or fake
07:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> yes
08:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Its true and was a big discussion years ago.
08:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> DDNet refused to delete them :kek:
08:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=2902
09:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 it was fair fro ryozuki to ask. @timakro's argument wasn't an argument either
09:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> This whole discussion has been plagued by people scared of the boogeyman
09:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> > But I don't believe bringing up licensing is a good idea for the teeworlds community.
09:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> "I don't believe" many things, you don't see me putting it out there without any arguments backing my opinion
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> > DDNet refused to delete them :kek:
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> DDNet had no right to refuse to delete them but alas I'm no lawyer, maybe if I close my eyes hard enough the law will cease to exist and it'll all be sunshine and rainbows
09:37 <+ChillerDragon> So do we need licenses from every mapper? :D
10:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we want the right to "refuse to delete" yes but I'm fine with the old maps being susceptible to takedowns
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> u can get a public domain or CC0 for my maps if you want :)

12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> There always was a sentiment in this community (I guess it's the sentiment of the old internet) that everything is up for grabs. I genuinely believe there is truth to that AND that this could be translated into lawyer speech: Implied consent, common law? For example the map takedowns: I'm not a lawyer and I don't know how to phrase it but we all agree with the point: By submitting your map to ddnet you agree that it's hosted on their serve
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> 
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> That's just how I see it, I don't know what the real verdict would be if it came to it. But I'm sure it can't be a simple binary "you loose because copyright" argument.
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> 
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <timakro> So what I'm saying is all maps are de-facto free to use and I believe with enough effort and a good lawyer we could slap a copyleft license onto the entire ddnet catalogue. Surely no one wants to do that and it's not going to happen among other things because there is no incentive right now to act. Just the same way as there is no incentive for making a list to collect licensing information of ddnet maps. The people declaring their maps co

12:23 <+Learath2> I agree that by submitting your map you agree that it'll be hosted on our servers. I don't see how it also implies that you can't want it taken down later. E.g. by uploading my pictures to a image host (which usually still do make you agree to some terms btw) I don't give away all rights to that picture
12:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> this is where u need an actual lawyer
12:25 <+Learath2> I've contacted one, hoping he won't quote me an entire arm and leg because you are having lulz
13:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Lionheart> It's not because the maps are not under licence they are not protected. In fact, if someone can argue the property of one, the map is protected my the right of author. Even with licence this doesn't change. What you need is a public agreement to give the right to ddnet to use the map.
14:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Lionheart> Ddnet is not even association or enterprise ... So this going to be difficult

14:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The Practical Implications
14:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
14:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Legally, the answer couldn’t be more clear: Creative Commons Licenses are irrevocable.
14:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
14:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> However, there are some practical application points worth discussing, even if they don’t change anything legally.
14:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
14:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> First, many, if not most, works licensed under Creative Commons are not used. If a work hasn’t been used under the license and the license is removed, no one will be able to use it in the future unless they recall the license and use it later. However, most won’t know or recall the license and will either never have been presented with the license, such as with new visitors, or otherwise won’t be aware of it.
14:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Lionheart you are wrong
14:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Lionheart> I'm not wrong totally, just partially
14:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Lionheart> But it's fun to see you consider all what i say wrong because i say one thing wrong
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you don't license something explicitly to grant rights to others, you reserve all rights
16:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Lionheart I'd rather if people decided on their own how to license their works, but we could also work with something like an agreement e.g. a license that you agree to when you publish work on ddnet, like wikipedia does it
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Great the lawyer I picked is on vacation...
17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Lionheart> @Learath2 yeah, it's that, either you licence your work under thing like creative common, so ppl can use it under the rule of licence, or you give a explicit agreement for your work be used. It's not a licence but a contract between the mapper and ddnet.
17:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Either is better than just closing our eyes really tight and pretending the internet is a lawless wasteland
17:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Lionheart> Hum, it's not really "our" but your. Because if ddnet is not an organization, it's mean your personally responsible of outrage ^^
17:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Lionheart> In fact, i don't see someone attack ddnet or admins for something so trivial. It's wasting money, and in final, maybe it's going nowhere. In true, i find that politic bad. If we say "Okay, by propose your map you agree to give the right to ddnet to use it unlimited of time, you keep right on it, but you can"t ask us to remove the map. Do you agree" it's okay for me. But if you say today to mapper their map cannot be removed, since they d
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> @Learath2 I got some reports from players that the votes still has a bug. 
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> If sv_vote_majority is 1 and the vote failed, the vote is not going away:

19:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> There comes 2 msges if someone start a vote
19:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh that looks off
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Trafalgar Law is there a message when the vote fails?
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Nope
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and is it not going away for 0.6 either?
19:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> For 0.6 its going away
19:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> 0.6 get a msg that the vote failed
