01:18 <@deen> Learath2: I think so too, 50 thousand unique visitors on the blog in 12 hours
01:18 <@deen> ddnet has about 2000-3000 daily
01:32 <@heinrich5991> deen: happy new year, and nice blog post :)
01:32 <@heinrich5991> it sounds like the "helping the compiler optimize code" is a very dangerous device
01:33 <@deen> heinrich5991: indeed, easy to shoot yourself in the foot!
01:33 <@deen> happy new year to you too, heinrich5991 
01:43 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: are you here?
08:50 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: what's up ? :)
09:38 < eeeee> deen: can you give me an up-to-date serverlist.json?
09:38 < eeeee> the one at ddnet.tw/serverlist.json looks weird
10:33 < eeeee> i tried manually fixing it and it seems to somewhat work now, but still would be good to have the original
10:38 < eeeee> anyway i updated http://tw.qwe123.info/d.html with it
10:43 < coffee`123> hey nice work
10:44 < coffee`123> are you using websocket ?
10:46 < coffee`123> the game is really smooth with firefox
10:47 < EastBite> awesome
10:47 < EastBite> is it possible to go ingame yet? 
10:48 < EastBite> oh it works

11:37 < Learath2> eeeee: server list seems to kill the client :D
11:39 < Learath2> the game itself is k
11:40 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
11:41 < Learath2> serverbrowser really kills the fps
11:41 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
11:42 < Learath2> eeeee: also moving out of the serverlist and going back in that tab seems to kill the serverlist too but literally this time no servers

12:33 <@heinrich5991> EastBite: I saw in the forums that you have disassembled the kog stuff
12:33 < EastBite> yes
12:33 <@heinrich5991> how did you know that they had a backdoor? :)
12:33 <@heinrich5991> wow, that was a quick answer :D
12:34 <@heinrich5991> how did it take you to find that password?
12:34 < EastBite> how long?
12:35 <@heinrich5991> yes
12:36 < EastBite> basically I'm just searching for the string "authed" in the binary
12:36 < EastBite> and I often find some strange string next to it
12:36 < EastBite> which looks like a password
12:36 <@heinrich5991> :)
12:37 <@heinrich5991> but this is IDA
12:37 <@heinrich5991> and you annotated "comparefunc"
12:37 < EastBite> yea I verified it using ida
12:37 < EastBite> I loaded IDA when I was at the c3
12:37 < EastBite> and now I'm testing stuff :)
12:38 < EastBite> why are you asking?
12:38 <@heinrich5991> you were at the ccc
12:38  * heinrich5991 jealous :)
12:38 < EastBite> yes
12:38 < EastBite> one hour from here :P
12:38 <@heinrich5991> why I'm asking? because I've also tried to reverse engineer some TW stuff
12:38 <@heinrich5991> but it always took very long
12:39 < EastBite> I started using the decompiler this morning
12:39 < EastBite> pretty awesome
12:39 < EastBite> I'm comparing the teeworlds sourcecode with the decompiled stuff and rename vars
12:39 < EastBite> takes pretty long yes
12:41 <@heinrich5991> which talks have you listened to on the CCC?
12:41 < EastBite> hmm, fnord new show, tor (onion), "Ich sehe, also bin ich ... Du", security nightmares
12:42 < EastBite> and some I don't remember
12:43 <@heinrich5991> were they good? :)
12:43 < EastBite> absolutely
12:43 <@heinrich5991> =)
12:44 < EastBite> http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/
12:44 < EastBite> this time we even have vp8 /webmencoded videos
12:45 <@heinrich5991> I usually just browse youtube.. ._.
12:46 <@heinrich5991> or can I view these in the browser
12:46 < EastBite> sure you can
12:46 <@heinrich5991> k
12:47 <@deen> eeeee: http://update.ddnet.tw/ddnet-servers.json
12:49 <@deen> hm, i still have a list of 10 talks or so i forgot to watch
12:49 <@deen> any recommendations, EastBite?
12:49 < EastByte> hmm
12:50 <@deen> eeeee: So, will we get a pull request for websockets in ddnet server or will it stay proxy-only?
12:50 <@deen> and really nice work, looks playable in browser
12:50 <@heinrich5991> watching sec nightmares right now :) last year it was pretty nice
12:50 <@deen> heinrich5991: oh yeah, have to add to my list
12:50 <@heinrich5991> I see I'm contra-productive :D

15:04 < Nimda> HyperEdge by nealson T'nP just released on Solo at 2015-01-02 15:02
15:21 < Savander> Hey! Question
15:22 < Savander> How many people standard clients allows to see?
15:22 < Savander> e.g. when i join to ddnet server 64slots
15:22 < Savander> i'll see all people?
15:23 <@heinrich5991> Savander: no, only the 16 nearest
15:24 < Savander> but
15:24 < Savander> what when
15:24 < Savander> all 64 ppeople
15:24 < Savander> is near to you
15:24 < Savander> ?
15:25 <@deen> only the closest ones
15:25 < Savander> but look, 
15:25 < Savander> inivisible tees
15:25 < Savander> make collision?
15:25 <@deen> the others are just invisible then
15:25 <@deen> but as you come closer to them you can see them
15:25 <@deen> so you see everyone before colliding
15:25 < Savander> ahm okay
15:25 < Savander> thanks, : )
15:25 <@deen> there was a video on youtube where you could see it, i think
15:28 < Savander> I just wanted to know, how it works. Because my friend ask me"Is it possible to create 64 players vanilla.
15:28 < Savander> but now i know it
15:28 < Savander> it's not possible :PP
15:30 <@deen> well, it is, but you would need a non-vanilla client and server :P
15:31 <@deen> but the game could still be regular vanilla teeworlds, only with more players
15:31 < Savander> ye its possible, but not for standard clients
15:32 < Savander> because players should see all of tees
15:32 < Savander> on CTF e.g.
15:32 <@heinrich5991> it is, with the same hack that deen employs
15:32 < EastByte> Savander: >16 players on one players doesn't happen often
15:39 < Nimda> Tatooine by Rapture & Gridwyn just released on Brutal at 2015-01-02 15:37
16:31 < Learath2> str_copy(m_aLastFile, m_ClientUpdate ? "DDNet.tmp" : (m_AddedFiles.empty() ? "" : m_AddedFiles.front().c_str()), sizeof(m_aLastFile)); does this look as ugly as i think it is ?
16:38 < EastByte> Learath2: do you fear multilines?
16:38 <@heinrich5991> that could probably be done with a couple of ifs
16:40 < Savander> deen: 
16:40 < Savander> i know how to add infos on zcatch
16:40 < Savander> oh, im idiot
16:40 < Savander> you need to type 
16:40 < Savander> add_info <interval> <message>
16:40 < Savander> interval in minutes
16:41 <@deen> ?
16:41 <@deen> ok
16:49 < Learath2> EastByte: didnt feel like writing 3 srr_copies :D
16:49 < EastByte> ah
16:50 < Learath2> should prolly split it up tho 
16:53 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: you can do const char *src; if(foo) src=src1; else if(bar) src=src2; else src=src3; str_copy(dst, src, sizeof(dst));
19:29 < eeeee> deen: i have the code for websockets and will pullreq soon. wanna do a bit more testing before that, as it seems to behave a bit differently on linux and macos. i think i found a bug in libwebsockets :/
19:29 <@deen> ^^
19:30 <@deen> ok, good luck
19:30 < eeeee> that thing i posted above is using the real versionsrv compiled with websockets support
19:32 < eeeee> Learath2: can you elaborate on how you kill the client? i don't understand what do you mean.
19:32 < eeeee> when i switch around the tabs everything still works for me
19:33 < Learath2> eeeee: it went down to 5 fps
19:33 < Learath2> mouse wouldnt move
19:33 < Learath2> eeeee: and if you switch tabs there are no servers
19:33 < eeeee> can you tell me your os, browser and cpu/gpu specs?
19:34 < Learath2> eeeee: seems to be working all fine now tho :/
19:34 < Learath2> fps is still shit
19:34 <@deen> eeeee: nice
19:35 < eeeee> shit how. and how do you even measure it
19:35 < eeeee> do you "debug 1" ?
19:35 < Learath2> no eeeee the cursosr teleports
19:35 < Learath2> let me debug 1
19:35 < eeeee> yeah please try
19:37 < Learath2> and im on Windows 7 x64 Firefox 34.0.5 CPU: Intel Core i7 4770k GPU: AMD R9 290X
19:38 < Learath2> eeeee: fps seems k its probably input lag
19:38 < Learath2> its always >30
19:40 < Learath2> console seems to have the same lag too
19:41 < Learath2> scoreboard also seems to get stuck
19:48 < eeeee> Learath2: can you also test it in chrome and see if that's any better?
19:49 < eeeee> this version is using the browser's html5 canvas to render all the text
19:49 < eeeee> i can compile the freetype version later when i'm at home, maybe it will work better for you
19:50 < Savander> Question, it's possible to make server which you can connect only from one specific client? (yes it's possible) but what i should do?
19:50 < Savander> i need do it for tournament. ..
19:50 < Savander> with awards.. we don't want bots and cheats ;d
19:50 <@deen> easy to hack
19:50 < Savander> but
19:50 < Savander> client will be availble
19:50 < Savander> minute before tournament
19:50 <@deen> ok, then just make a secret key that's sent?
19:51 <@deen> similar to a password, but probably not quite
19:52 < Savander> but, then i need to make new Netmessage ? Like this ? https://github.com/savander/zcatch/blob/zCatch/datasrc/network.py#L344
19:52 < Savander> and then send it from client?
19:56 <@deen> yeah, would probably be good enough
19:56 <@deen> or make the client send some stupid message on rcon, like the "crashmeplx" for ddnet
19:56 <@deen> and if the server sees that the message hasn't been sent, kicks the player
19:56 <@deen> but none of that is really secure of course
19:57 < Learath2> eeeee: and is it possible to do the mouse 1to1
19:58 < Learath2> so the os cursor is at the same location as teeworlds cursor
19:58 < Learath2> or better yet remove the os cursor :D
19:59 < Savander> ye, but maybe
19:59 < Savander> for tournament it will be enough
19:59 < Savander> i'll try and learn how
19:59 < Savander> NetMessages works
19:59 < Learath2> capture the cursor maybe eeeee
20:08 < Learath2> going to finish a map with the client eeeee :D
20:08 < eeeee> it'll probably crash at the end :P
20:09 < Learath2> it better not for your sake
20:09 < eeeee> i'm not liable for any damages
20:09 < eeeee> and this is shitty proxy anyway, should work better when we merge native websocket support
20:10 < Learath2> oh i thought you had websockets in
20:11 < eeeee> currently it looks like <your browser>---websocket---<node.js script on tw.qwe123.info>---udp---<???.ddnet.tw>
20:12 < eeeee> we'll make it use websocket to connect to ddnet server directly
20:13 < Learath2> we'll ? who is the we eeeee inc. ?
20:14 <@deen> Learath2: DDNet!
20:15 <@deen> I love the web client so that will definitely make it into ddnet server
20:16 < Learath2> eeeee: your sticky score board failed me :d
20:19 < Learath2> eeeee: serverlist seems fine on chrome
20:19 < eeeee> yeah would make sense, i only tested it on chrome :/
20:19 < eeeee> will look at it more in ff later
20:19 < Learath2> scoreboard too 
20:19 < Learath2> it works fine in chrome
20:20 < Learath2> options icon seems to be missing in chrome but is there on ff
20:20 < eeeee> might be just a transient error
20:21 < eeeee> anyway you should do the http map loading for ddnet client
20:21 < Learath2> the proxy seems laggy too
20:21 < eeeee> so that it's easy for me to port it to web client :P
20:21 < Learath2> eeeee: already did that actually
20:21 < Learath2> its in some branch somewhere
20:21 < Learath2> will push it after i go over it 
20:22 < Learath2> downloads the map from fastdl.ddnet.tw 
20:23 < Learath2> eeeee: how do you debug a problem in  js client ?
20:24 <@deen> hi goo
20:43 < goo> hi deen 
20:46 < Learath2> deen: finished Kobra2 in 59 minutes 59 seconds with the js client :D
20:46 <@deen> woah, nice!
20:47 <@deen> Nim so popular now!
20:47 <@deen> And maybe I should rethink my policy of writing my mail address under blog posts^^
20:47 <@deen> people write me all kinds of Nim questions now
20:50 < Learath2> :D
20:51 < Learath2> you should get another email for that
21:01 < Learath2> deen: two people on the zcatch server chillin around and we just get to watch
21:02 <@deen> huh?^^
21:03 < Learath2> i was trying to show a friend teeworlds joined GER zcatch server
21:03 < Learath2> two people chillin there so we cant join
21:07 <@deen> aaah
21:07 <@deen> i forgot how zcatch mod is supposed to work^^
21:10 < Savander> deen: netmessage is automatically generated in protocol.h?
21:10 < Savander> e.g NETMSGTYPE_CL_ISDDNET
21:10 < Savander> ?
21:11 <@deen> yeah, from datasrc python stuff
21:14 < Savander> and, how to send from client netmessage from client? Which file i should find? :<
21:20 <@deen> i don't know, look how CL_ISDDNET is sent
21:21 < Savander> i found something
21:21 < Savander> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10828
21:21 < Savander> now i know how
21:42 < Savander> ehm
21:56 < Savander> e.g. when i have ban, how server check it?
21:56 < Savander> i mean, ehm
21:57 <@deen> there's a list of banned ips and ranges
21:57 <@deen> netban.cpp
22:54 < Savander> question, how unpacker know ? 	const char *pVersion = Unpacker.GetString(CUnpacker::SANITIZE_CC);
22:55 < Savander> it get variable name or something?
22:55 < Savander> heinrich5991, you know maybe? :)
23:15 < eeeee> Learath2: debugging is not very hard. you can even have a mapping from c++ line numbers to js line numbers. you also get normal stack traces and stuff in debug build
23:16 < eeeee> the build i published is release build though so you can't debug anything :P
