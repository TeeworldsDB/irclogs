09:41 <@heinrich5991> deen: do you know which server sent the "Cannot write: No space left on device"?
11:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Does hookcoll is lost while you spectating someone?
11:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I mean, you can see that red line
11:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but it not indicate if the guy can hook someone, or can hook wall
11:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's always red, and hookthrough
11:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> hmm weird, i restarted client and it works now
11:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> curious..
12:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> About hook collision, maybe add player collision too, that would show the exact center of tee and its collision box.
12:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> So like red box with cross on the middle
12:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> would be useful, since all skins aren't centered perfectly, which makes tee towers hard
12:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> And it would help hooking and shooting ppl
12:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> And landing edges
12:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> And would generaly just make sense
12:42 <+Henningstone> sounds cheaty to me
12:44 <+Henningstone> wait, I'll do a quick mockup to see what it'd be like
13:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Well now that I think about it, hook collision lines are in a way, cheaty too, since they help you aim, and so on...
13:05 <+Henningstone> in a way you're right
13:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> I know
13:13 <+Henningstone> ok done so far...
13:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone>

13:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> @Mokuz something like that?
13:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Yea about right...
13:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> green circle is hook-collidable, red circle is tee-collidable and the square is for world-collision
13:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Yea
13:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Howabout center point/cross
13:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> ah sorry forgot that x)
13:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> No problem!
13:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> Here you go:
13:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> 
13:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/374895862847111168/screenshot_2017-10-31_13-22-02.png
13:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> the collision boxes looking wrong on this screenshot is caused by the bumping-around on the tee I'm sitting on
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> I can see that being usefull
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> woah
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it loooks.. interesting
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but, i wouldn't give it to normal use
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> How so
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Maybe only as a option
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> for auth users
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> to test maps etc
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like in csgo, you can enable model wireframe
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but only in cheat mode
13:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> right!
13:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> *cough cough* hook collision *cough*
13:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> tbh, collision boxes gives you much more
13:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> than simple usefull hook coll
13:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe instead of those boxes
13:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> we can make option, to make all players looks
13:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> "default"
13:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?
13:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Hmm would help pro tee towerers like myself
13:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> actually, you can do it
13:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> by remove all skins
13:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but you know, its stupid ðŸ˜„
13:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Yea
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I'm curious why all skins are loaded on startup. Isn't it a waste of memory?
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Why why didn't load it while joining to game
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or something
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> That would mean frozen tee as well.
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Why ?
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Show all tees as default, should show frozen tee as default too
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You would do it in another thread. He would have default skin, then he's own after load
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ah
13:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, that's right
15:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> I see the main benefit of this in a faster client startup for people who have got many skins. The memory consumptions is neglecable imo.
15:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> although tbh I don't even feel a real difference in startup time with the 112 skins I've got...
15:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yes, but we should think about weak computers
15:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> computers that don't have 5 MB of ram to spare are probably too weak to run any game made in the past 20 years tho ðŸ˜›
15:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ask deen then
19:31 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> 5 MB?
19:31 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> 100 skins?
19:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> approximately... I've looked how much the process's memory usage in the taskmanager would increase when I load the skins
19:32 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> Skin DB has 700 skins, takes 350 MB of RAM for me
19:33 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> not sure about video ram, same there maybe?
19:33 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> I think it's reasonable to expect DDNet to keep running on 10-15 year old computers
19:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> definitely
19:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Henningstone> ok maybe I did something wrong, I probably I didn't load all skins. I've did the estimation again and observed an increase in ram usage by 15,7 MB, and the 'gfxmem' on the debug screen increased by 63148k
19:45 <@deen> disable texture compression?
19:46 <+Henningstone> yes it was disabled
20:08 <+Learath2> redix: #934
20:43 <+eeeee> i have this old patch for on-demand skin loading https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/compare/master...eeeee:ondemand_skins2
20:43 <+eeeee> don't remember why i didn't pullreq though
21:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> bind k "kill; (wait 5 sec); say /weapons"
21:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> is something like this possible?
21:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no
21:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> ðŸ˜¦
21:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> gay
21:11 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i thougth of a sleep in rcon and bind sys too
21:11 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> would be great
21:12 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> @Ezy it is, even with ddnet client, you need to parse the client output and (ab)use cl_input_fifo
21:13 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> can u explain what it is?
21:13 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> never used it
21:13 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i heard of rcon fifo
21:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> oh, right
21:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> fifo
21:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> b ut not working on windows, if I remember
21:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜‰
21:14 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> yes only works for unixsystems
21:15 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> how do i use it?
21:15 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> clientside
21:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you can send commands to fifo
21:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> use whatever language you like, and send commands to fifo file
21:16 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ??
21:16 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> how
21:16 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> it is pretty much writing to a file, except it blocks until someone starts reading
21:16 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> what do i do in detail?
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/c837208e75d8cd633da1138f9c5384d58d264725/servers/scripts/snake.py
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> snake used fifo
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> right?
21:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/c837208e75d8cd633da1138f9c5384d58d264725/servers/scripts/snake.sh
21:18 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> `mkfifo ddnet.fifo`, then set `cl_input_fifo ddnet.fifo` then you can write to it like this for example: `echo some_f1_command > ddnet.fifo`
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> your paths might be different tho
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ah verstehe
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> live?
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ah understand
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> fifo redirect messages from file to server/client
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> yes the commands are instantly executed (at least nearly)
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> thats crazy
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I bet, it's how ddnet send messages
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> to world
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> at once
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> that is true, global broadcasts work like this
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> u could use the other thing for that
21:21 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> how was it called
21:21 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> econ
21:21 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> econ?
21:21 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ye
21:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but, it's simpler to send message to all files
21:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> than connect to every server and send message
21:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no ?
21:21 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ``use whatever language you like, and send commands to fifo file``
21:21 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> languages?
21:21 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> C C++ Python...
21:21 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i thought i send tw commands?
21:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Yes, but you can use those language to make expressions, statements
21:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> etc
21:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> waiting events
21:22 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> can u give me a sample?
21:23 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> i already gave you a basic shell example
21:24 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ah
21:24 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i understand
21:24 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but how do i wait events ?
21:24 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> like tw events?
21:24 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> you need to parse the clientlog then
21:24 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> can i get tw input
21:24 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ah
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ye makes sense
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> thats cool
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I remember, that once, someone made a bot
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> with quiz feature
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> then i could add a bind
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ``bind x echo testcmd0``
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> and if my script ready testcmd0 in log it sends all the delayed commands
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe it was made with fifo ?
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> thats nice
21:26 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> then i could add a bind
21:26 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ``bind x echo testcmd0``
21:26 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> and if my script read testcmd0 in log it sends all the delayed commands
21:26 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> yes, except that deen removed the echo command / made it the same as say afair
21:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> But then you have to make a program, which will wait for those echo's
21:27 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ye
21:27 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> nice
21:28 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> Learath2: considering #934... do you know what version of gcc deen is using?
21:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> echo as a say?
21:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You mean, that echo send message to cchat?
21:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but if i see, it's indicated as a "-2" player
21:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @redix not really
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> g++6 and g++7 as well as clang-5 seem to work for me
21:31 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> the compiler tries to use the copy constructor although the move constructor exists and I'm using std::move =\
23:04 <+Learath2> well he is probably compiling on Debian 6 so maybe gcc5 or gcc 4.8?
23:17 <+ddnet-discord> <redix> Even Debian 7 uses gcc 4.7 which has no full c++11 support :/
