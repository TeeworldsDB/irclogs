16:30 < Chairn> nice ddos

16:33 <@EastByte> hm?
18:01 <@deen> my whole computer hardware is breaking: 1 byte of RAM had to be disabled, GPU had to be baked to get rid of graphics errors, Both displays had blown capacitors, as did my PSU, DVD drive motor stopped working, mouse button wore down, SSD is sometimes losing data on trim, and CPU crashes occasionally
18:03 <@EastByte> you don't need to fix all hardware issues by yourself, just by a new computer
18:04 <@EastByte> buy* :p
18:04 <@deen> i prefer to fix them over buying new stuff all the time
18:05 <@deen> I'm just surprised that so much stuff breaks
18:05 <@EastByte> for how long do you have that system now?
18:05 <@deen> 8 years
18:05 <@EastByte> ah, well
18:06 <@EastByte> mine is only 5 years old an didn't find an issue yet
18:06 <@deen> these issues all came pretty recently
18:06 <@deen> i probably just don't remember the older ones
18:06 < fstd> IME the PSU can be responsible for a wide array of mysterious issues
18:07 < fstd> i'd fix that first and check which problems actually remain
18:07 <@deen> fstd: indeed
18:08 <@deen> the PSU took out every single component in my brother's brand-new computer. that was fun...
18:08 <@deen> they ALL were smoking
18:09 < fstd> wow
18:09 < fstd> cheap "china-boeller" PSU? ;D
18:09 <@deen> nah, i think it was a rather expensive one
18:10 <@deen> also just a guess that it was the PSU, maybe the mainboard fried them, it was also connected to everything
18:11 <@deen> we get far fewer votes on Steam now, but they've become mostly positive now
18:12 <@deen> it says "69% of the way to the top 100"
18:12 <@deen> i guess when it's in the top 100 we get a chance of someone taking a look at it and deciding
19:32 < Savander> hi
20:11 < o_be_one> "<deen> my whole computer hardware is breaking: 1 byte of RAM had to be disabled, GPU had to be baked to get rid of graphics errors, Both displays had blown capacitors, as did my PSU, DVD drive motor stopped working, mouse button wore down, SSD is sometimes losing data on trim, and CPU crashes occasionally"
20:11 < o_be_one> OMG x) !
20:11 <@deen> o_be_one: no worries, i can fix all issues i think :P
20:11 < o_be_one> you need to ask donation for a new comuter ahahah :p
20:11 < o_be_one> computer*
20:11 <@deen> never!
20:11 < o_be_one> i'm joking :p
20:12 <@deen> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=115596#p115596
20:12 <@deen> hm
20:12 <@deen> "I've tried to play DDRace server with the official DDRace Android client, for like 5 times already. So I reach that black ninja tile, and weapons don't work, moving doesn't work, rope doesn't work, I'm totally stuck, I cannot even suicide. How the hell can people enjoy DDrace? Are they know each level and all black tiles by heart ? Some levels have you literally surrounded with that, with only one small hole 
20:12 <@deen> at the top."
20:17 < o_be_one> lol!
20:22 <@deen> i think that's a pretty typical noob experience
20:22 <@deen> we need to work on that
20:22 <@deen> making DDNet friendlier for noobs
20:22 <@deen> even our novice 1 maps are extremely difficult for some
20:22 < Savander> you seen this?
20:22 < Savander> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPnSli3UQOY&feature=youtu.be
20:23 <@deen> can't, not available in germany
20:23 <@deen> and i think we don't need a video, but an ingame-tutorial
20:23 <@deen> as most professional games have
20:23 <@deen> so you learn the controls, the elements of the game
20:23 <@deen> the purpose, etc
20:24 < o_be_one> like a "tutorial" button with a "noob map" with informations
20:27 <@deen> yeah
20:27 <@deen> and some dummy that has preprogrammed movements so you can practice stuff with it
20:27 <@deen> and when you start for the first time you're asked if you want to run the tutorial
20:28 < o_be_one> nice
20:29 <@deen> Teeworlds doesn't really need that because it's a shooter and everyone knows shooters
20:29 <@deen> also because it has more intuitive controls
20:29 <@deen> all the text inputs in ddnet don't really help
20:30 <@deen> writing /pause, f1, kill, etc
20:30 < Savander> really
20:30 < Savander> not available in germany o.o?
20:30 <@deen> Savander: no youtube videos with music are available in germany
20:30 <@deen> commercial music*
20:30 < Savander> lol.
20:30 <@deen> i can download from one of the ddnet servers i guess
20:30 < Savander> 30 minutes
20:30 < Savander> it generally explaining you vanilla
20:30 < Savander> every weapon
20:30 < Savander> how to move
20:30 < Savander> etc.
20:31 < Savander> with good music and montage
20:44 <@deen> looks good, but way too complicated for real noobs
20:44 <@deen> just try out the weapons and get a feeling for them!
20:45 < Savander> :PP
21:21 < Learath2> cant get sound back without a restart ?
21:21 <@deen> right
21:22 < Learath2> but you can lose it without restart ?
21:22 <@deen> dunno
21:22 <@deen> yes
21:23 <@deen> and if you disabled it you can re-enable in the same session
21:23 <@deen> but if it's disabled from start, then whole sound system, classes, files aren't loaded
21:25 < Savander> it's bug?
21:25 <@deen> sounds like a reasonable compromise to me
21:25 <@deen> you could of course make everything more complicated and allow loading the sound system during game
21:39 <@deen> has anyone found a good german hoster with ddos protection by now?
21:45 <@deen> because we still have ping 100 for Deutsche Telekom people
21:45 <@deen> and other hosters' ddos protection sucks
21:47 <@EastByte> we'll see how good ovh game does
21:47 <@deen> it's not in Frankfurt is it?
21:47 <@EastByte> sbg
21:47 <@deen> and pretty expensive
21:47 <@deen> sbg had some ping jumps iirc
21:47 <@EastByte> I'm talking about the dedicated server o_be_one bought
21:47 <@EastByte> we can still test it
21:47 <@deen> maybe we can find a hoster to sponsor us, I'm thinking about filling that out: http://www.host1plus.com/sponsorship/
21:48 <@deen> they have ddos protection and servers in frankfurt
21:48 <@deen> and their website doesn't look like shit
21:48 <@EastByte> we should give it a try
21:48 < Savander> savander-host.com
21:48 < Savander> the-best hosting (not available yet!)
21:50 <@deen> they also have other interesting locations, nice
21:50 <@deen> and a great connection to deutsche telekom (best I've seen yet)
21:52 <@deen> ah shit
21:52 <@deen> "Earlier this week Host1Plus has announced the implementation of DDoS protection for a wide customer audience in all available VPS locations, except Frankfurt, Germany."
21:53 <@EastByte> hm
21:55 < Savander> hahahah
21:55 < Savander> it's funny because, it's always when i searching for something
21:55 < Savander> it's not for me m:P
22:17 < o_be_one> deen: i'll have place available for DDNET GER in my Game Dedi i think, i'll talk with you again when i'll get it and started to play with ddos protect
22:18 <@deen> o_be_one: in strasbourg?
22:18 <@deen> we'll have to see if the ping is fine, from what I can remember some had higher ping than in frankfurt
22:19 < o_be_one> and some have better ping that in frankfurt :/
22:19 <@deen> sure, but the main crowd is in germany, so i mostly care about their ping
22:19 < o_be_one> btw there's new peerings too, i dont remember with who, but cause OVH works by making peering with as much as provider they can, they are able to offer the best connection worldwide
22:20 <@deen> name would be interesting
22:20 < o_be_one> did you asked to nfo if they can sponsorise ?
22:20 <@deen> nope
22:20 <@EastByte> at nfo we have the telekom problems
22:20 <@deen> nfo has bad Deutsche Telekom peering
22:20 < o_be_one> maybe you must try this before
22:21 < o_be_one> oh ok
22:21 <@deen> it's not about the cost
22:21 <@deen> it's about having ddos protection, good peering to Deutsche Telekom, stable server, and prize < 50 € / month
22:21 < o_be_one> about ddos protection the main problem is that they don't check UDP correctly (cause it's not possible yes, but it exists some tricks to do that, ovh do that)
22:22 < o_be_one> well you'll be able to try on my blockers, i'll switch V3ROYAL on it to begin, i think
22:23 <@deen> o_be_one: when will you have the server approximately?
22:23 < o_be_one> 2 type of ddos happend on game servers, i've seen : ip framentation and udp
22:23 < o_be_one> maybe 10 days, as OVH said to public
22:23 < Savander> deen,  you had server in host1plus.com?
22:23 < Savander> i mean VPS?
22:24 < o_be_one> but i think i'll be able to know the exact availability for me like tomorrow, ive just to find who manage this
22:24 <@deen> Savander: nope
22:24 < o_be_one> host1plus doesnt seem to protect udp attak ..
22:24 <@deen> host1plus has no protection at all for GER
22:25 < o_be_one> oh :/
22:25 < Savander> btw
22:26 < Savander> you have any proposals for VPS for teeworlds servers? I need not big server, i need it for teeworlds.pl and tournaments organized there.
22:26 < o_be_one> fstd: ive switched to ZSH with Oh My ZSH, good shell too
22:26 < Savander> We prefer germany.
22:26 < o_be_one> read that it's like bash with more features
22:26 < Savander> nothing big, for polish community :p
22:27 < fstd> o_be_one: bad idea
22:27 < o_be_one> Savander: nfoservers ?
22:27 < o_be_one> fstd: why ?
22:27 < fstd> zsh is made for interactive use; it's slow and broken wrt. script execution
22:28 < o_be_one> it seems to be less mature than bash, btw
22:28 < fstd> coincidentally i've dealt with a lot of shells lately in the attempt to write portable list handling
22:28 < fstd> at some point i had to drop support for zsh, because it's just too broken
22:28 < fstd> (i still support ash, bash, dash, ksh, posh and pdksh though)
22:29 < fstd> for example, consider:
22:29 < fstd> foo='bar baz'
22:29 < fstd> set -- $foo
22:29 < fstd> echo "$1"
22:29 < Savander> Linux only Single core   should be enough? https://www.nfoservers.com/order-virtual-dedicated-server.php
22:29 < fstd> or:  for f in $foo; do echo "element: $f"; done
22:29 < fstd> but:  for f in bar baz; do echo "element: $f"; done
22:30 < fstd> then, their built-ins have a few "intentional" bugs
22:30 < fstd> i fixed their 'which' the other day, submitted a patch, and got a reply back that that bug was intentional because some ancient C-shell also has it
22:30 < o_be_one> Savander: afaik yesn its really lightweight to host tw
22:30 < fstd> (which is braindead because zsh isn't even trying to be like c shells)
22:30 < fstd> etc etc
22:30 <@deen> fstd: for interactive use i still find zsh nice, even if it's slow and buggy
22:31 < fstd> yeah i'm not really complaining about interactive use, just posix- (and common-sense-) compliance
22:31 < o_be_one> so if i'm well i'm right to think that bash is good for all kind of use ... no ?
22:31 < fstd> not giving existing syntax new semantics, and the likes
22:32 <@deen> zsh is much older than i expected, i remember looking at their mailing list when i found a segfault
22:32 < fstd> bash at least understands posix scripts, that's something
22:32 < o_be_one> why debian and ubuntu move /bin/sh to /bin/dash ? How dash is better that bash fstd ?
22:32 < fstd> dash is much faster
22:32 < fstd> and also less insane and much less bloated
22:33 < o_be_one> idk dash but now i know that i'll get information about it
22:33 < fstd> if you want to run a few nontrivial shell tests, clone https://github.com/fstd/lstd  and run ``tools/allsh.sh tests/test-thorough.sh''
22:33 < fstd> (add zsh to the list in allsh.sh to see it break, i guess)
22:36 <@deen> o_be_one: game servers look pretty strong and expensive at OVH. are you just planning to run block servers and ddnet ger on them?
22:36 <@deen> (that they would do easily)
22:37 <@deen> except the 250 mbit/s bandwidth could get low when starting a tournament for example
22:38 < o_be_one> deen: i plan to put my blockers in it to begin, but cause i'll remove my online.net dedi, i'll move 4 other games on it : Project Zomboid, 7 Days to Die, StarMade and StarBound
22:39 <@deen> ok, no idea how much resources they need
22:39 < o_be_one> ive choosed OVH instead of SYS cause for the price diff, OVH worth it (for me ... 240gb SSD x2, 32gb ram, 500gb backup, ...)
22:40 < o_be_one> not much, they are linux supported and there is just lik 0 to 3 players on these games lol
22:40 <@deen> ice
22:40 <@deen> nice
22:40 < o_be_one> but just 7DTD could get maybe more players when i'll get this server (better quality)
22:41 <@deen> DDNet would probably require 2 GB of RAM and 1-2 cores at max
22:41 < o_be_one> and when you host a correct 7DTD server ... many people come :/
22:41 < o_be_one> yes thats ok, PZ is really lightweight (2D game), Starmade is developped by linux fanatics (lol) and Starbound ... I dont remember, just i remember it's light too
22:42 < o_be_one> 7DTD needs a little more, like SSD instead of SATA, but about cpu and ram it will be ok
22:43 < o_be_one> oh and i know that some players asks for an ARK server, it's really heavy, so i'll think about it before
22:43 < o_be_one> or wait some updates
22:43 <@deen> you sure host a lot of things :P
22:43 < o_be_one> i just listen my community and host what hey want to play or they have
22:43 < o_be_one> i have no problem, i just use like 70% of my infra
22:44 <@deen> DDNet servers use nearly nothing except RAM currently, but I'd be too scared to let anything else run that could cause lags
22:44 < o_be_one> my main prods, Minecraft, must to be the top, thats why its hosted on independant VPS
22:45 < o_be_one> and TW, cause i like it, i try to do my best to offer quality serveur, but its nothing for r0x.fr, players doesnt care (and are not french)
22:45 < o_be_one> ill run Docker (by CoreOS), btw
22:45 < o_be_one> Docker or OpenVZ, but i think i'll go for Docker
22:46 < o_be_one> be scared on other DDoS the server will get :p
22:46 <@deen> ?
22:46 < o_be_one> but i'm not sure, i think ive read that each dedicated ip will be independant
22:46 < o_be_one> Harmony Hosting with anti-ddos pro from OVH, when an ip from the range is hard ddosed, it's all ip from this range who get some lags ...
22:47 < o_be_one> but, since last year, it's hard to cause this i've seen
22:47 < o_be_one> lol for the story, last year, ive got 200 ddos on my tw2.r0x.fr node ahahah ... 200/300 attaks to the entire range, thats really much :p
22:47 < o_be_one> this year, just 3 poor attaks :/ its funny cause its since DDNet hosted blockers lol
22:48 < o_be_one> idk what vali is making for me :/
22:48 <@deen> o_be_one: yeah, we can get 30 attacks a day
22:48 <@deen> back with the blocker servers
22:48 < o_be_one> well just dont forget that the more attak i'll get, the more possibility i'll have to handle it ...
22:49 < o_be_one> i'll have my DDoS training this month so ... I'll be able to begin to work on game ddos so to make a profil to handle TW ddos ...
22:49 < o_be_one> and when my settings will be ok ... It will be really hard i think to down it
22:49 < o_be_one> btw, for information, game ddos is in testing since 1 year so i hope it will be good :p
22:50 < o_be_one> too bad that they just worked on most played games actually (for other games, its a little less good, but ok)
