10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 use `rg`, it's quite fast
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was searching in vscode, absolutely crashed vscode which somehow locked up the entire computer
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lost an hour of work ;(
11:14 <+ZillyHuhn> Today my laptop stopped booting my debian patition due to a secure boot error. And when I disabled secure boot it was loading some thingys in during the boot. Is that some sort of update or is my system in danger?
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you haven't done stuff to the kernel, a change in secure boot behavior is a little bit surprising
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you checked the internet for other people having similar problems?
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ArMor> on ddnet servers there is a command /practice
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ArMor> on my server its not there
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ArMor> how do i enable it?
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> update your server
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ArMor> its fairly up to date
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ArMor> 13.1
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it was added 7 days ago, it's only in 13.2+
13:59 <+ZillyHuhn> i suck at talking to the internet @heinrich5991 :D
14:00 <+ZillyHuhn> did not find anything bug or security related only initial setup issues
14:00 <+ZillyHuhn> cant apt upgrade cause a kernel change?
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but it shouldn'tâ„¢ go from booting to not booting
14:01 <+ZillyHuhn> But yea the thing is now i am not able to activate secure boot again
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not sure what to think about secure boot
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the end, it probably doesn't matter much whether you have it enabled or not
14:04 <+ZillyHuhn> me neither doesnt sound like the best thing but still suspicous
14:04 <+ZillyHuhn> i guess i just continue life and hope im not haxxed :D
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think this is just a fluke, probably has nothing to do with an attack
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Been watching a lot of talks while stuck at home
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Found this gem
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/717737983108841522/Screenshot_2020-06-03_at_16.54.01.png
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like the man actually went ahead and proved that C++ is better mathematically
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> @onby
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it says right there in the name that C++ must be better than C
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Makes sense, I'm uninstalling my C compiler
17:29 <+ZillyHuhn> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1591198151.png omg I finally did it o.O
17:29 <+ZillyHuhn> dropdown terminal in teewoods
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is that tmux running there? Did you use a library to handle rendering the terminal, b/c it's not trivial
17:31 <+ZillyHuhn> this is my dream since years
17:31 <+ZillyHuhn> I looked into sdl terminals and other thigys but i gave up cracking it into my client
17:32 <+ZillyHuhn> I used a bunch of gnome extensions that hides my menu bars so i can use non fullscreen borderless tw behind gnome dropdown terminal
17:32 <+ZillyHuhn> there i launch tmux
17:32 <+ZillyHuhn> and inside tmux i launch teeworlds
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> AH, I thought you hacked the terminal into teeworlds code
17:33 <+ZillyHuhn> that was the intiall plan but turned out to be easier and still possible this way
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so a window manager?
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm confused ðŸ˜„
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> quakelike terminal? ðŸ™‚
17:34 <+ZillyHuhn> There is a gnome terminal dropdown extension
17:34 <+ZillyHuhn> and i use non fullscreen tw to keep it in background
17:34 <+ZillyHuhn> lets see how this works out probably ends in a lot of flame cuz i get into rabbit holes while being ingame :D
17:36 <+ZillyHuhn> did quake have a full terminal? Or like tw?
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like tw
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> tw also has a quakelike terminal ðŸ˜‰
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ZillyHuhn: have you tried i3 btw?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I miss my tiling WM being stuck on a mac for 3 months ðŸ˜¦
17:49 <+ZillyHuhn> nah im not interested in crazy wm tbh
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you started it with your quakelike terminal though ðŸ˜›
17:49 <+ZillyHuhn> I like my desktop and also i think i3 doesnt help with overlap terminal other than that my solution works fine
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the question is how useful is the concept of a window, it's actually a very meh to use experience when the windows occlude eachother
18:06 <+ZillyHuhn> I can lot of things in this much space of terminal while being rdy to react ingame super fast
18:06 <+ZillyHuhn> doÃœ
18:07 <+ZillyHuhn> is about visibility in the background to react when needed
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> > Found this gem
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Learath2 link?
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://youtu.be/D7Sd8A6_fYU
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't like the talk though, it's so holier then thou
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> r u a masochist?
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/717819994309918750/unknown.png
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ewwwww
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how can u watch these talks
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u can write buggy code in any language tho ..
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @onby be safe! code in rust!
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> bleh
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hav u tried rust?
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most loved lang for 4 years now xd
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no i prefer using languages that arent named after a common process of deterioration
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluestripe:
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> have u tried Mold
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> best language
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> rust is a game
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant even find mold in google
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> have you tried nim
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> i heard it rocks
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Be safe only code in Ada
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i saw in rust reddit that ada is not as safe
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i might overread it
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Be safe only code in haskell and formally prove that your program runs correctly
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to try haskell
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i think the lang server sucked hard
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Very good for math stuff
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why cant they have a good lang server
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Very meh for other things, the syntax is just not that good for general purpose coding
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt programmer tools the first thing u should casre
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <arch1t3cht30> haskell has a decent lang server, it just takes 60min and 2gb to compile
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> java sucks, but being so ide makes it super fast to code
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've been coding in java for a while now, the IDEs are like an absolute must
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so far golang lang server gopls is the best i found
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eclipse should be made illegal though
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ofc ide is a must in java
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've never seen a piece of software run so sluggishly
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u dont use idea
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> brb eat
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The project I'm contributing to integrates very hard with eclipse
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Couldnt for the life of me get it working in IDEA, so I just use vscode now and compile from the terminal
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The autocomplete is little shitty but what can you do
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> when is hookrace releasing
22:18 <@deen> never :D
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> so we have a little bit time, huh
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :peepocig:
