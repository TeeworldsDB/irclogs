16:54 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: conversion from reverse iterator to iterator
16:55 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: (i.e. in the for loop init)
16:55 < Learath2> thanks 
16:57 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: use auto if you can
16:59 < Learath2> not sure if we can use c++11 stuff in teeworlds code ?
16:59 <@heinrich5991> no
17:00 <@heinrich5991> but then you can't use STL either ^^
17:52 < fstd> and you can't check error conditions either :)
19:04 < Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/fetcher.h
19:04 < Learath2> is there any way (CFetchTask*)->m_pDest could be different from (CFetchTask*)->Dest() ?????
19:12 < dhkmt> sup
19:12 < Learath2> o/
19:13 < dhkmt> who will agree that less is awesome?
19:27 <@heinrich5991> less the command line tool?
19:43 < Chairn> i think he was refering to the player
19:47 < dhkmt> haha
19:47 < dhkmt> no, less = css precompiler
19:48 <@EastByte> of course :P

19:51 < uchar> best sass! :P
19:52 < dhkmt> why sass?
19:52 <@EastByte> hello uchar 
19:52 < uchar> hi! ;)
19:52 < dhkmt> waird, uchar = unsigned char*? c:
19:52 < uchar> yo!
19:53 < dhkmt> hi :3
19:53 < uchar> hi dhkmt ;)
19:53 < dhkmt> im a fan, dude
19:53 < dhkmt> xd
19:53 < uchar> oh? my first fan... pls pls pls pls... you are woman?
19:53 < uchar> xDD
19:53 < uchar> :P
19:53 < dhkmt> no but i have tits
19:53 < dhkmt> xd
19:54 <@EastByte> sizeof(EastByte) == sizeof(uchar)  basically
19:54 < uchar> xD
19:54 < dhkmt> joke
19:54 < dhkmt> :C
19:54 < dhkmt> what about the colors/design? ofc not my design idea http://puu.sh/jSTIh/cb8a5d9c58.jpg
19:55 <@EastByte> neat
19:55 < uchar> dhkmt, what are you doing?
19:55 < dhkmt> im working on a backend application
19:55 <@EastByte> looks like frontend
19:56 < dhkmt> yea the login form does
19:56 < dhkmt> but the real backend will be like www.shopwaredemo.de/backend
19:56 <@EastByte> so you are doing backend dev aswell?
19:56 < dhkmt> yes
19:56 <@EastByte> what language?
19:57 < dhkmt> javascript and php
19:57 <@EastByte> ah
19:57 < fstd> two nice backend languages
19:57 < dhkmt> i'll use both of them :b
19:58 < fstd> i was not being serious
19:58 < uchar> you know meteor? it's pretty awesome
19:58 < dhkmt> no i dont
19:58 < dhkmt> fstd: what do you prefer then?
19:58 < uchar> javascript framework fort real-time websites
19:58 < dhkmt> for realtime websites i know nodeJs
19:58 < uchar> yeah.. it uses nodejs
19:58 < dhkmt> ah
19:58 < fstd> dhkmt: that would obviously depend on the project; my point was that js and php seem far from 'backend languages'.  especially js
19:59 < dhkmt> why?
20:00 < fstd> because it used to be a language for scripting the front-end, duh
20:00 <@EastByte> but you are contacting the backend with it
20:01 < dhkmt> yea true
20:01 < dhkmt> fstd look at ExtJS
20:01 < dhkmt> it is used by shopware as backend language
20:01 <@EastByte> oh
20:01 < uchar> Sencha! i use ExtJS in one project xDD
20:01 < dhkmt> which?
20:01 < fstd> looks horible.  what's the point?
20:02 < dhkmt> its developed since 10 years (or so) and yea.. good for backend applications (like shopware)
20:02 < dhkmt> but ofc, i only use it for shopware because i have to
20:02 < dhkmt> fstd: when you would have to program a backend now.. which language would you choose?
20:03 < uchar> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30566237/demo-web-cen.PNG
20:03 < fstd> there is no such thing as 'a backend'.  it would depend on what said backend is supposed to do
20:03 < uchar> xD
20:03 < fstd> but i'm pretty sure i'd use a language that doesn't have weak typing
20:05 < dhkmt> uchar: looks great, would you be my anytime helper?
20:05 < uchar> uff i use it too years ago.. i don't remember anything xDD but i can try xD
20:05 < dhkmt> oh xDwell
20:06 < dhkmt> was it easy for you to join ExtJS?
20:06 < uchar> yeah have a good documentation
20:06 < dhkmt> the official documentation?
20:06 < uchar> yes
20:07 < dhkmt> ah
20:07 < dhkmt> be happy that you never had to work with shopware
20:07 < uchar> its a e-commerce crm?
20:07 < dhkmt> yea
20:11 < uchar> See Odoo: https://www.odoo.com/es_ES/page/e-commerce
20:11 < uchar> :P
20:12 < uchar> open-source!
20:12 < uchar> ups.. sry for spanish web
22:28 < Learath2> update works \o/
23:01 < Donate4DDNet> deen? you got my pm today?
23:13 <@deen> Donate4DDNet: hi
23:13 <@deen> don't think so
23:17 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #316: [DONT MERGE]Allow for the update of dll files (master...pr_dllupdate) http://git.io/vGn65
23:18 < Learath2> deen: need to sleep now seems to be working but lets not take chances
23:19 <@deen> Learath2: great, thanks for the work =)
23:20 < Learath2> do take a look if you have the time and if anything feels off tell me
23:23 <@deen> damn reg.ru, sends me 10 emails every time i renew the service
23:24 <@deen> (and takes 10 minutes to load paypal)
23:49 <@deen> I assume this is caused by the big team messages: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?p=23293#p23293
23:58 <@deen> or is there any other big message being sent when people join?
