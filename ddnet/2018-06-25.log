00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i will add the issue tomrrow oke?
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 since im today still awake and i can create some real github traffic from my pc
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i promise i will do it tomorrow
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> (dont get confused: tomorrow isnt after sleeping in german time it is after the next 00:00 xd)
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I use tomorrow as "after sleep" in german as well
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye we tend to do it
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but github doesnt so i dont xd
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i released libtw3 in shell
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but my github fanbase already knows xd

00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> like and subscribe!
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @heinrich5991 its only ddnet ger that cant find Stellar in its db is that the 1 you checked?
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ZombieToad indeed, that one doesn't have it
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mh. replication broken
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 ^
00:27 <+Learath2> why?
00:27 <+Learath2> I really would rather not deal with this right now
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> are the map release scripts open source?
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> where
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet/ddnet-scripts
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/map-release what part adds the points and map type to the sql?
02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ZombieToad if we have an inconsistency in the db, that probably means that the replication isn't working
02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there shouldn't be anything manual in the process of syncing the databases
02:15 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: did you verify that replication broke?
02:15 <@heinrich5991> no. but I see different states of the db on ddnet.tw and ger.ddnet.tw
02:16 <@heinrich5991> the query `SELECT * FROM record_maps WHERE map = 'Stellar';` gives different results
02:17 <+Learath2> if only i remembered the mysql root pw
02:18 <@heinrich5991> I'm going to sleep. good luck if you try :)
02:20 <+Learath2> I'll give it a go, can't sleep because of the turkish elections panic
02:20 <@heinrich5991> oh right
02:20 <@heinrich5991> you had election yesterday/today
02:20 <@heinrich5991> how did it go?
02:20 <+Learath2> some really creepy shit is going on
02:21 <+Learath2> all the opposition leaders suddenly just stfu'd, there are thousands of erdogan supporters out there with guns, and opposition supporters are getting pepper sprayed en-masse
02:21 <+Learath2> very very tense stuff
02:25 <@heinrich5991> :(
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 fixed replication
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> Mhh guess u need a bomb there @Learath2

14:58 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] bors[bot] merged staging into master: https://git.io/f49Mf
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1514#issuecomment-400012773 I guess we have the real deal here
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> Now the question is, who is willing to c/c the code from ddnet to teeworlds ._.
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> cuz it's what it's gonna be
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> :/
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Gabbo forcing guy
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> actually stitch is right, if we could remove a lot of servers that fights to get players & start to attack randomly other servers, that would be greatful
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @FluffiexD hmh? ðŸ˜›
19:19 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: do we actually not allow other servers on the ddnet master?
19:20 <@heinrich5991> I don't know, I think deen firewalled something (?)
19:28 <+Gabee> ddnet = diktat net
19:33 <+Learath2> yes
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```@teetow "If it's indeed the case that DDNet is significantly more popular, why merge them at all?" ->
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Because DDNet is improving the game. Yes, the term is very subjective here, but DDNet is giving a few improvements, in terms of security & stability. The rest (visual features etc), I don't really mind.``` So? this doesn't mean a merge is needed, just patch teeworlds with those security fixes
