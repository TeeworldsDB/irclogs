01:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> this random firefox window just stole focus from my game, as i was last trying to save someone else in a 1 hr 10 minute run
01:18 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> chillerdragon: u awake?
01:22 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yas @fokkonaut 
01:22 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> go wire c:
01:27 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye sec
01:27 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar âœª there are ego shooters on mobile. Thast a aim game isnt it?
05:50 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> The more i think about the protocol the more i think that control messages should be removed
05:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Imo they should just become system messages and have a proper chunk header
05:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> them being their own type adds so much complexity with almost no benefit?
05:52 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> It saves 2-3 bytes on a chunk header sure.. but who cares about 2-3 bytes in the control messages
05:52 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> The control flag could be removed from the packet header
05:53 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> The entire payload parsing of a packet will be way cleaner because the structure is always the same
05:54 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> If their chunk header would set the system flag and not the vital flag they would behave in the exact same way as before
09:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yay new isp isnt behind cgnat
09:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i can now self host some stuff
09:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> awesome
09:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but 2d
09:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or do u click on screen in 3d and it aims where u clicked lmao
09:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> sounds terrible any way without a joystick tbh
09:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watafak is 3d aim
09:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im mouse enjoyer i dont get it
09:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 3d game
09:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> trollerdragon
09:52 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> world is flat
09:52 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> screen is flat
09:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> flatland
09:52 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> mousepad is flat
09:52 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> flat aim
09:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> now that u say it
09:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> everything is a plane
09:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lol
09:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> plain
09:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i am so genius
09:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> chatgpt can go home
09:53 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is no 3d on a 2d screen
09:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> true
09:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> except u have nintendo 3ds
09:53 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxxxxD
09:54 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so how can controllers aim 3d?
09:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i am just waiting for headshot to post 3ds version
09:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> with 3d effects xD
09:54 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> joysticks*
09:54 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> isnt it the same as a mouse?
09:54 <+bridge> <Ewan> gn ddney
09:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> totally the same
09:54 <+bridge> <Ewan> time to sleep
09:54 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or the same as a joystick on a 2d phone screen?
09:54 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there are 3d ego shooter with aim on da phone
09:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @mpft good night
09:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> chiller: question is about joystick vs directly clicking where u aim
09:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the second doesnt really work in 3d games
09:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because your mouse is stuck in the center?
09:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> funny stuff happens if you play csgo with a laptop that has a touch screen xd
09:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yea also how the fuck would u flip with just clicking on screen xD
09:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> do u click multiple times?
09:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> click 5 times for 360Â° flip xd
09:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u got experience with csgo & touch? XD
09:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sounds funny
09:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 2mins 2yrs ago
09:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im basically an expert
09:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that qualifies you as the world bests csgo touch player
09:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the conversation is about ddnet mobile controls right?
09:58 <+bridge> <meloÆž> i mean - i can see it work if you just map mobile controls to the game with an overlay of some sorts
09:59 <+bridge> <meloÆž> imagine getting 15 / 0'd by someone with a touchscreen taking a dumpy on the toilet with his laptop
09:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sometimes
09:59 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bottom left should be a fire and hook button. bottom right should be a aim joystick. And walking left and right is ofc tilting the phone.
09:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but mostly it's about csgo touch controls
10:02 <+bridge> <egyt> CRD can't say so
10:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> flat joke
10:03 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaYkIB0AYGM
10:03 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just put buttons everywhere
10:03 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet mobile gamers have 5 arms
10:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> he aint doing flicks
10:04 <+bridge> <egyt> Flat humor
10:05 <+bridge> <egyt> Ayo a crab
10:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> anyway that looks like drag controlls
10:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that would a third option xd
10:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> not direct click nor joystick, but dragging your cursor xddd
10:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> would probs suck hard
10:09 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye drag works better in 3d
10:09 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think
10:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it works when ur cursor is always the mid
10:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> like in free spec
10:09 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the og android release has click aim?
10:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> we are still discussing about that, but yeah robyte wants to add huge cheats
10:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xd
10:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> this botter
10:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> osu! ddnet edition
10:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> fng
10:10 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the old one
10:10 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does it have aim to click?
10:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dont even know, but i think yes
10:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it has both
10:11 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> both woah
10:11 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that explains why i get banned less on fng when spoofing the client version of the android version
10:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> forgottencat already told me that noby just bans
10:12 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cant antibot with touch flicks axaxa
10:12 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that would be an argument against it
10:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> :banhammer:
10:12 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> makes antibot harder
10:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah but we, the majority, oppress the minority of mobile players and just ban them
10:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> do you want to fight for their rights?
10:14 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I don't agree with them or understand them. But I still would fight for their rights yes!
10:14 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Same as windows or 0.6 players
10:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lmao
10:14 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> In the end we are all tees!
10:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 0.6 players

15:59 <+bridge> <unknow_axeolotl> devs i got problems with my client
16:30 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how can we help?
16:34 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> oh bruh
16:34 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> you just made me remember I made one in middle school with windows movie maker
16:34 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i didn't know it was called amv
17:20 <+bridge> <draggory> Is this my end or server end?

17:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> client
17:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well let's say it like that:
17:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
17:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it looks like a bug in the client
17:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> unsupported should never happen, which client is that?
17:33 <+bridge> <draggory> 18.0.1
17:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mh ok, guess u have to manually update then
17:34 <+bridge> <draggory> Gotcha
17:53 <+bridge> <jxsl13> @chillerdragon, can I merge my twapi stuff into your teeworlds-go repo?
17:54 <+bridge> <jxsl13> (a little bit of the stuff)
19:50 <+bridge> <learath2> I can not believe after a decade since apple yoinked `.local` for their mDNS, the IETF still hasn't designated a TLD for internal use
19:52 <+bridge> <learath2> After 4 months of public input, ICANN determined `.internal` can work, then they said "we'll present it to the ICANN board for futher consideration" then radio silence
19:52 <+bridge> <learath2> Where were the considerations and months of approval processes when Apple yoinked `.local`?
20:00 <+bridge> <avolicious> `.localhost` is traditionally statically defined in host dns imlementations to pointing to loop back ip addresses, no?
20:01 <+bridge> <avolicious> so you can even use it for `my.localhost`, `another.service.localhost`
20:01 <+bridge> <learath2> I need one that doesn't point back to 127.0.0.1
20:02 <+bridge> <avolicious> What do you want to achieve?
20:02 <+bridge> <learath2> I want to give names to hosts within a vpn network
20:03 <+bridge> <learath2> I'll just use `.internal` it's fine, I'm just surprised at how easy it was for a corporation to repurpose a previously designated private use tld and how difficult it was for us to get an alternative
20:04 <+bridge> <avolicious> Basically you can get any TLD ðŸ˜„
20:04 <+bridge> <avolicious> You just need to host your own DNS then & use it
20:04 <+bridge> <avolicious> like `service.learath2`
20:05 <+bridge> <learath2> With a caveat, you need to be careful to always only use your own DNS
20:05 <+bridge> <avolicious> Yeah, so remove all root certificates from your browser & only use your own PKI
20:05 <+bridge> <learath2> It's unlikely ICANN will register the `.learath2` tld to someone, but if they do and you are not careful with your setup now someone else has your dns
20:05 <+bridge> <learath2> It's unlikely ICANN will register the `.learath2` tld to someone, but if they do and you are not careful with your setup now someone else has control of your dns
20:05 <+bridge> <avolicious> No, you host your own DNS server
20:06 <+bridge> <avolicious> how should they take over this dns server?
20:06 <+bridge> <learath2> Accidents happen, perhaps your server also needs access to traditional dns, so you set up your dns server to resolve those aswell
20:07 <+bridge> <avolicious> But if you own a TLD ( top-level domain ) like .learath2, then nobody can get it
20:07 <+bridge> <avolicious> Mostly DNS servers can resolve if they dont find any .zone on their own host
20:07 <+bridge> <learath2> You don't own it unless ICANN says you own it
20:07 <+bridge> <avolicious> No
20:07 <+bridge> <avolicious> If you want to have it in "public" internet, thats true
20:07 <+bridge> <avolicious> but not for DMZ
20:08 <+bridge> <learath2> As I said at the very start, if you are careful with your setup, it's fine
20:08 <+bridge> <avolicious> You are talking about DMZ
20:08 <+bridge> <avolicious> VPN
20:08 <+bridge> <learath2> Did you know that devices don't have to be exclusively on one network?
20:09 <+bridge> <avolicious> Thats actually how the internet works ðŸ˜„
20:09 <+bridge> <learath2> I have a set of servers that has access to the public internet, and a private network between them
20:09 <+bridge> <avolicious> Okay, if you know have a DNS server available in your DMZ & you are using it within all the hosts
20:09 <+bridge> <avolicious> it will resolve the stuff you have configured on the dns server
20:10 <+bridge> <learath2> and your DNS server is properly configured to ignore the case of ICANN giving your tld to someone else
20:10 <+bridge> <avolicious> ???
20:10 <+bridge> <avolicious> If you own the DNS server, you can resolve it to whatever you want to
20:10 <+bridge> <avolicious> You can resolve google.com to 1.1.1.1
20:10 <+bridge> <learath2> How do you propose I resolve `.com` domains with my local dns server?
20:11 <+bridge> <learath2> You forward it along to an actual dns server that is authoritative for those
20:11 <+bridge> <avolicious> You can be an authoritive DNS?
20:12 <+bridge> <learath2> Ok, we are getting nowhere. I know what I'm doing and I know how dns works. You are right, you can set it up in a way that is safe and just take whatever tld you want
20:14 <+bridge> <learath2> (in a similar way to how you can by using routing tables steal any ip you want, yet we still have private-use subnets, exactly for the same reason we need a private-use tld)
20:17 <+bridge> <learath2> ((less important because tlds are strings with many more possibilities than the 4 bytes an ip address is))
20:17 <+bridge> <avolicious> I just want to clarify. Just because you use a DNS server, you dont have to trust the results it gives back. Authoritive or Recursive.
20:17 <+bridge> <avolicious> 
20:17 <+bridge> <avolicious> To face this problem, DNSSEC has been introduced for example.
20:18 <+bridge> <avolicious> You and me heavily trust our upstream aka ISP, that he routes the packages correctly to its destination.
20:18 <+bridge> <avolicious> 
20:18 <+bridge> <avolicious> DNS Hijacking or even BGP hijacking is a known threat
20:20 <+bridge> <avolicious> So thats why I am saying, if you run it in your own DMZ, you can use whatever you want to use. But it will be hard for you to announce it to the broad public.
20:20 <+bridge> <avolicious> 
20:20 <+bridge> <avolicious> The root zone `.` is owned by ICANN, so they delegate `learath2.` to you as TLD, so you can use `hey.learath2.` as domain
20:23 <+bridge> <learath2> I understand, but now consider situation where a machine has to resolve both traditional internet domains and domains within my own intranet. Then ICANN comes along and registers `learath2.` to you. Now if I'm not careful with my configuration, (whether it be the configuration of my dns server, or the resolving clients), you can make `hey.learath2.` resolve to an IP outside my intranet, now I'm leaking traffic to wherever you want
20:23 <+bridge> <learath2> (Ignore for a second that ICANN has no reason to sabotage me by registering the extremely specific string `learath2` to anyone else)
20:25 <+bridge> <avolicious> There are several ways to proof that its actually you
20:25 <+bridge> <avolicious> Either you use DNSSEC and configurate clients to trust your root key for a specific domain
20:25 <+bridge> <avolicious> or you do it based on HTTPS for example
20:25 <+bridge> <avolicious> application level
20:25 <+bridge> <learath2> Or I use a TLD that ICANN already agreed that they won't ever register to anyone
20:26 <+bridge> <avolicious> `.localhost`
20:27 <+bridge> <avolicious> .localhost is always resolving to 127.0.0.1 until you change it in your local configuration
20:27 <+bridge> <learath2> Assuming the dns client implementation and the layers inbetween even let that `localhost.` resolution reach my dns server, sure
20:29 <+bridge> <learath2> RFC 6761 clearly says:
20:29 <+bridge> <learath2> > ...Users may assume that IPv4 and IPv6 address queries for localhost names will always resolve to the respective
20:29 <+bridge> <learath2> > IP loopback address.
20:29 <+bridge> <learath2> and
20:29 <+bridge> <learath2> > Application software MAY recognize localhost names as special, or
20:29 <+bridge> <learath2> > MAY pass them to name resolution APIs as they would for other
20:29 <+bridge> <learath2> > domain names.
20:30 <+bridge> <learath2> Actually point 3 of 6.3 explicitly says:
20:30 <+bridge> <learath2> > Name resolution APIs and libraries SHOULD recognize localhost
20:30 <+bridge> <learath2> >        names as special and SHOULD always return the IP loopback address
20:30 <+bridge> <learath2> >        for address queries and negative responses for all other query
20:30 <+bridge> <learath2> >        types.  Name resolution APIs SHOULD NOT send queries for
20:30 <+bridge> <learath2> >        localhost names to their configured caching DNS server(s).
20:31 <+bridge> <avolicious> https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6761#section-6.2
20:31 <+bridge> <avolicious> Then you can use .test
20:31 <+bridge> <avolicious> >    2.  Application software SHOULD NOT recognize test names as special,
20:31 <+bridge> <avolicious> >        and SHOULD use test names as they would other domain names.
20:32 <+bridge> <avolicious> You can try to resolve `grafana.intra.kog.tw`, I'll tell you there is no result even tho it has a valid dns entry
20:33 <+bridge> <learath2> Well this is something you are completely free to do, you are afterall the authority for `kog.tw.`
20:34 <+bridge> <learath2> `test.` is pretty good, it just sounds wrong ðŸ™ƒ
20:35 <+bridge> <avolicious> Then go with example
