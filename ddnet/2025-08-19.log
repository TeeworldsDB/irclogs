00:42 < bridge> <teero777> Works for me
00:43 < bridge> <kebscs> started working the second you replied
00:44 < bridge> <kebscs> :deen_star:
01:31 < bridge> <teero777> I fixed it
06:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn louis admin didnt expect
06:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
06:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> today im continuing my AHCI journey
06:45 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
07:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> acpi?
07:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
07:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Advanced Host Controller Interface
07:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Computer standard for SATA host controllers
07:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
07:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> interesting
08:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> acpi is to get info about the cpu and stuff, for example to get the Multiple APIC Description Table (MADT)
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> with acpi u can get the power profile, the interrupt model, the processor info and the pm timer
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> with processor info u can get each processor id
08:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://tenor.com/view/anime-loli-gif-20946617
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> also initially only 1 core is enabled
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> u need to start the others
08:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i havent done that yet
08:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> im single core
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> im single
08:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon have u tried activating the other cores
08:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> .\_.
08:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You mean the -j2 boyfriend?

09:02 < bridge> <melon> -j${nproc} that my guy
10:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u know if i need a kernel option to detect my esp32-c6?
10:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill just emerge arduino maybe it has useful stuf
10:19 < bridge> <learath2> No idea, isn't it just UART?
10:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk its waveshare esp32-c6-dev-kit-n8
10:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> it has a usb-c port
10:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a usb-c to usb to my pc
10:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> the red light shows so it has power
10:20 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, if it's a usb port then there might be a usb uart bridge on it
10:20 < bridge> <learath2> You might need a driver for that
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> riscv
10:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1407278268775665704/PXL_20250819_082106569.jpg?ex=68a58585&is=68a43405&hm=d357d142e72422ea67fbff6ed2f8014ffb836cd0b12883e673f7bf234c98332f&
10:21 < bridge> <learath2> Yes it does have a usb to uart bridge
10:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1407278598473384017/image.png?ex=68a585d3&is=68a43453&hm=8c81c1316cf245890b3b277fd46e153f10c5cadc96c4a009b8b2eac3488276b0&
10:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk i have this already
10:25 < bridge> <learath2> Check the model of the uart bridge, it might need a specific driver
10:26 < bridge> <learath2> It's the small square chip on top on your board it seems
10:27 < bridge> <learath2> Apparently one of the possible chips for your devkit is a CP210x
10:28 < bridge> <learath2> And the other one is FTDI
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh i didnt have cp210 enabled
10:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need to restart, ill do it later
10:28 < bridge> <learath2> So if you can't read the chip, just get both
10:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice thanks

10:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
10:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> dev-embedded/esp-idf
10:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is a package

10:43 < bridge> <learath2> @ryozuki what are you making btw?
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk just trying stuff
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanted to make also a riscv kernel
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> but idk if 8mb ram is good xd
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> Integrated 320KB ROM, 512KB HP SRAM, 16KB LP SRAM and 8MB Flash memory.
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i accept ideas
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have 2 of these dev kits
10:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Onboard CH343 and CH334 chips can meet the needs of USB and UART development via a Type-C interface.
10:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh it uses these chips
10:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> found it

10:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** http code is non obvious to me in ddnet 
11:03 < bridge> <Assa> hmm I have a veriy interesting issue, if I debug my current client it starts and runs, if i run release it crashes 🤔
11:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> gdb with debg info but not debug build?
11:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> gdb with dbg info/asan but not debug build?
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw so far been using xfs and no issues
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> are u ebugging with debug build?
11:08 < bridge> <Assa> yes
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> C++ will show the effects of UB (and its poor memory safety aspects) in release mode
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> debug with release and debug symbols
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i guess ubsan
11:10 < bridge> <Assa> there are multiple things that might go wrong 🙂 maybe even the graphics card
11:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** "and its poor memory safety aspects"
11:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
11:27 < bridge> <Assa> got a cmake error that my compiler was not found, I have no idea what it build with xD
11:28 < bridge> <Assa> windows sometimes so scuffed
11:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** go delete windows
11:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and install OpenBSD
11:31 < bridge> <Assa> going to do that in oktober, but not openbsd but ubuntu
11:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yew
11:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the ugly distro :p 
11:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** go get some gigachadery debian
11:31 < bridge> <Assa> now after compiling, it doesn't crash anymore D: who would have thought that if you compile not with a random compiler, it works
11:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** had that too once @Assa 
11:32 < bridge> <Assa> why ugly?
11:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i was furiosly interrupting cmake and at some point i think it confused objects and linked together something weird xd
11:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ubuntu is the worst non windows you can get
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its so corporate bs with amazon placements and garbage
11:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont like software maintained by companys, i prefer software maintained by the people that use it
11:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i wouldnt be surprised if canonical employees run windows
11:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i mean just look at this comparison
11:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://ubuntu.com/pro
11:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://www.debian.org/download
11:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if you dont feel what i feel when browsing the two sites i can not explain it any further
11:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** not to mention that the ubuntu design is unusably ugly
11:40 < bridge> <Assa> while I understand your hate on big corpo, and ubuntu pro subscriptions, I don't hate the design xD i don't know what you have in mind
11:40 < bridge> <Assa> ubuntu still an upgrade to windows
11:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** !remindme we need a deen if heinrich is still afk https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10716
11:43 < chillerbot> Helo ChillerDragon I will remind you in 86400000 time units about your matter again.
11:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa yes upgrade to windows it is!
11:45 < bridge> <Assa> I am currently implementing culling and thinking, should I chunk tile layer D:
11:45 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i hate Ubuntu so much
11:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** I wouldnt even run a ubuntu vps privately. The enterprise smell would disgust me too much to launch some cute teeworlds server on it
11:45 < bridge> <soulyvevo> but somehow i agree that it feels better than windows
11:45 < bridge> <Assa> I have to use it at work anyways, if I want or not
11:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** L work
11:46 < bridge> <soulyvevo> lol im literally at work rn using Ubuntu
11:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Solly the worker
11:55 < bridge> <soulyvevo> chillerdragon: i use arch btw
11:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> xubuntu vm on a windows 11 host system 🚀
11:57 < bridge> <Assa> tell me you mean dual boot
11:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> nope
11:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> I hate windows, but I need to develop for it as well as for linux D:
12:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> what u developing for in windows
12:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> a daemon application for monitoring & config management 👀
12:05 < bridge> <Ewan> oh?
12:06 < bridge> <melon> I use my private laptop at work, i.e I use nix at work :justatest:
12:06 < bridge> <melon> I use my private laptop at work, so use nix :justatest:
12:06 < bridge> <melon> I use my private laptop at work, so I use nix :justatest:
12:16 < bridge> <learath2> Hates windows, but doesn't run it in a vm instead of the linux. Make it make sense
12:17 < bridge> <melon> wsl is pretty strong can't blame If you really need both
12:18 < bridge> <melon> I used it a lot when I started server development
12:18 < bridge> <learath2> It didn’t exist before I managed to move to linux completely
12:19 < bridge> <learath2> So by the time it got good I never really had any use for it 😛
12:19 < bridge> <melon> :p
12:19 < bridge> <melon> I'm using windoof only when necessary but my work sometimes requires me to use it so dual boot it is
12:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> actually I also run another windows 11 in a vm on a win11 host
12:20 < bridge> <learath2> Nowadays I only have a couple games with very invasive anticheat that require me to reboot into windows
12:21 < bridge> <melon> I just realized I'm on Gentoo
12:21 < bridge> <melon> 
12:21 < bridge> <melon> Hell I could setup single GPU passthrough more easily than ever now..
12:21 < bridge> <melon> My PC is heckin fast so rebooting over to windows takes 30 seconds, but it'd be cool to just keybind into it :kek:
12:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> except for macOS and Windows, I got no other choice for the host system anyway 👀
12:22 < bridge> <learath2> Mac user detected
12:23 < bridge> <jxsl13> I do use one privately
12:24 < bridge> <melon> I also have a Mac <a:pepecryfall:1049505999519748106>
12:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> What I meant to say was:  except for OS X and MS DOS, I have no other choice.
12:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** mac is pog
12:39 < bridge> <learath2> Especially arm macs, very cool. I wish Apple were a little more open so it would be easier to have linux on it
13:18 < bridge> <terribling> Hello. I am looking for a pre-compiled DDNet `.ipa` file for iOS. Since it's not on the official website, can someone please help me and provide a trusted download link? Thank you!
13:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> what made u think ddnet is available for ios xD
13:20 < bridge> <terribling> in 2016
13:23 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> DDNet doesn't have iOS version
13:23 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Only supports Android for mobiles
13:23 < bridge> <kollpotato> its possible but no dev will want to make one
13:24 < bridge> <terribling> What's the problem with doing it on an iPhone? many people ask
13:25 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> The problem is nobody there wants to support iOS version, or more detailed, no one has that much time
13:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> and i think to make an ios version u need an apple device to build it
13:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> and some expensive ide
13:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> android uses sdl main so it should be quite easy to port to ios since sdl supports it
13:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but its effort and ^
13:27 < bridge> <melon> (costs money)
13:27 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> When ddnet devs have 100h a day
13:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> 99% of players play from pc, 0.9% play from android, 0.1% dont play from iphone
13:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> ez math
13:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we dont actually got stats for that
13:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> atleast on ddnet
13:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> kog does tho
13:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> how xd
13:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> ddnet doesnt send what device the player is using
13:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> nope!
13:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> lookd at the graph its all tclient
13:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which doesnt advertise the os either
13:30 < bridge> <terribling> It's a pity you don't want to
13:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @terribling: you have to do it
13:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> yea
13:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> +1
13:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> lazy devs
13:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> your literally the only purple one here
13:31 < bridge> <terribling> xd
13:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> This is how things work here @terribling everyone works on what they want and need.
13:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> devs get paid too much to not make an iphone version
13:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://github.com/ddnet-community/community-protocol/issues/6
13:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> the ide is free, the device is not. and the signing certificates cost 99€ per year.
13:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> lmao
13:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> FreeFlight mentioned
13:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> basically the apple dev account
13:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> then it's never going to happen
13:33 < bridge> <terribling> if you pay for the mac rental, then I'll release it
13:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> unless someone wants to donate 99€ a year
13:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wait no that’s a different thing xd
13:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> maybe sideloading does not need the app to ne signed, dunno
13:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Isn’t there some iOS app to install apps not from the AppStore?
13:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im sure theres someone who would benefit from ddnet sideloaded on ios
13:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but that person would probably be the only person who could test it
13:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> epic games store >:D
13:33 < bridge> <terribling> altstore
13:34 < bridge> <terribling> and sidelodly
13:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I thought there is something from apple but idk
13:34 < bridge> <jxsl13> a lot of devs here have iphones, i'd guess
13:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There is probably a way to distribute open source iOS apps for free
13:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have pixel pro 8
13:34 < bridge> <jxsl13> I'm not one of those, tho
13:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @jxsl13: hi (sent from my iPhone)
13:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> @chillerdragon Hey (send from my pixel 7a)
13:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> sent
13:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> @jxsl13 hi (sent from my microwave)
13:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Fake
13:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> no
13:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> i got linux on my microwave
13:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> trust
13:36 < bridge> <jxsl13> @kollpotato Hello (sent from my fridge)
13:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Smort iot
13:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> TestFlight
13:38 < bridge> <jxsl13> bruh
13:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not FreeFlight
13:38 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's the official beta app
13:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have the feeling we can use TestFlight to skip 100$ fee
13:38 < bridge> <jxsl13> highly doubt
13:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Rip
13:38 < bridge> <jxsl13> because you probably need an apple developer account
13:39 < bridge> <jxsl13> which is 99€ per year
13:39 < bridge> <terribling> maybe there are beta versions of ddnet, or even teeworlds
13:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ?
13:39 < bridge> <terribling> for ios
13:39 < bridge> <jxsl13> probably means on TestFlight
13:39 < bridge> <jxsl13> unlikely.
13:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I did game Teeworlds on my iPhone before! :p
13:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> 😮
13:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It was surprisingly smooth
13:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Back when it was in the AppStore
13:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Still have it on my old ass ipad
13:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Some random dude ported it without making big waves and published it in the store
13:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Only real gangsters knew
13:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Like 12yo dragon who was searching for Teeworlds in the AppStore on a daily basis
13:41 < bridge> <terribling> in theory, someone has the ipa file when they uploaded it to the app store
13:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @terribling: gogo do it
13:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It would be cool
13:42 < bridge> <terribling> no way
13:42 < bridge> <terribling> i don’t dev
13:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why not
13:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> ios main dev, time to start.
13:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> big scale, big money
13:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> attack!
13:43 < bridge> <terribling> pay for the mac rental, I'll do it
13:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You don’t even have a Mac? Xd
13:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> you can get a mac mini. pretty cheap
13:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How do you demand iOS stuff even without a Mac.
13:43 < bridge> <terribling> You don’t even have a Mac? Xd
13:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And wat u do with ipa files without a Mac?
13:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I do have a Mac!
13:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I can lend you mine
13:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ono more pr
13:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Holding prs below 70 is impassible
13:44 < bridge> <terribling> so what does mac have to do with it if it's not connected to ipa
13:44 < bridge> <Assa> this is an easy bug fix chillerdragon
13:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> you need a mac, in order to develop applications for iOS
13:45 < bridge> <Assa> `CalculateEnvelopeClipping` is supposed to calculate the offsets caused by position envelopes in quad clipping
13:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk what ipa is and what u want .-.
13:45 < bridge> <Assa> but we early exit and disable clipping if we find no env
13:46 < bridge> <Assa> but we early exit and disable clipping if we find no env, instead of setting the offsets to 0 and keeping the clip
13:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> you can also use GitHub CI as free Mac I guess
13:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But sounds painful haha
13:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fix style @Assa

13:53 < bridge> <Assa> I just implemented quad clustering, but it seems to make little to no difference because there is hardly any map complex enough to benefit from it :pepeW:
13:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> blyat enuff
13:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok atleast its typescript
13:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 10 Bucks that ryo rage quits on js before gettin anything done
13:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> i actually know js and ts
13:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Remember when melon couldn’t fix simple bug? xaxaxaxxa
13:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> he probably reimplements it in rust before writing 10 lines of js/ts code
13:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> Ryozuki, ryo
13:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Fr
13:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> what is this
13:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> !ping
13:55 < chillerbot> pong
13:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wot
13:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> u have a csv
13:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> with my name
13:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ono he finds the backdoors
13:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> shiet
13:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> omg
13:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur truly a coder
13:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> its like looking at a junior dev
13:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Don’t u dare
13:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Look at the code
13:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> 🔥
13:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @ryozuki: if you do it pls use unix sleep command units. So seconds by default. 10 is 10 seconds and 10m is 10 minutes
13:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And if it can’t parse it defaults to 24h so !remind message doesn’t break
13:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> how to get your own bot approved here? 👀
14:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Don’t ask for permission, ask for forgiveness after you did it

14:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> XxxxD spaghet
14:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> We need a deen
14:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> where a deen
14:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> rust irc crate sux
14:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> i cant make my own potatbot
14:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> :(
14:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Build irc crate
14:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or ask milkeey to send one
14:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> do u connect to stockholm.se.quakenet.org?
14:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think so
14:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> what crate?
14:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> ur env example has 2 irc servers
14:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://lib.rs/crates/irc
14:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> some are more rigged than others
14:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It doesn’t always work so I flip

14:51 < chillerbot> Elo @Assa I just wanted to remind you that: @chillerdragon the bot should maybe not ping
14:53 < bridge> <Assa> hmm spaghet 🍝
14:55 < bridge> <Assa> !remind -1 good bot
14:55 < chillerbot> Helo Assa I will remind you at Tue Aug 19 2025 14:54:37 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.
14:55 < chillerbot> omagawd @Assa I almost forgor to mind you about: good bot
14:55 < bridge> <DDNet> :heartw:
14:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> wtf it timeouts `Error: Io(Os { code: 101, kind: NetworkUnreachable, message: "Network is unreachable" })`
14:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> irc shenanigans
14:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> i got it to work xd
14:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> for some reason by default it wanted to use tls
15:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @chillerdragon would u accept tsmash into ddnet-insta
15:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> would be nice for replacing ddnet servers with insta since tsmash is a gamemode that is... played sometimes
15:01 < bridge> <Assa> i guess you could make more work, like bomb or ghost or catch16, maybe not catch64
15:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> catch64 === catch16?
15:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also already added
15:02 < bridge> <Assa> no
15:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh its not
15:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh its not added
15:02 < bridge> <Assa> catch64 was the 64 player variant which works with 0.7 skins
15:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well yeah i get that
15:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but thats a change made irrelevant with a ddnet base
15:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and all gamemodes get 128 support when ddnet server does
15:03 < bridge> <Assa> yeah the issue will be porting the skin logic
15:03 < bridge> <Assa> I know, because I made it btw
15:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is catch64 not based on 0.7?
15:03 < bridge> <Assa> it is based on 0.7
15:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> when ddnet maintainers change their minds we can get 0.7 skins in ddnet
15:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and thus in catch
15:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> untill then they will have to fallback to 0.6/vanilla skins and use colors to differentiate for unsupporting clients
15:05 < bridge> <Assa> maybe I'll instead do catch 128 😄
15:06 < bridge> <Assa> and instead of inheriting the color, you also get a random skin part when you're shot

15:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> literally evil denail of service.tar.gz
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah it cant do anything unless i somehow made a virus that escapes qemu
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> it runs in a virtual machine
15:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> it freezes randomly after some time
15:15 < bridge> <kollpotato> cant reproduce xd
15:24 < bridge> <Assa> sometimes C++ is really too complex, if all I want is just a @cached annotation and cache the inputs and results of a function
15:25 < bridge> <Assa> say what you want about python, but you can code fast and sometimes your time is more valuable then perforance and software runtime
15:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> wdym
15:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> just like ps does
15:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> i press random characters and it just dies
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> f
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess some deadlock somewhere
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> making kernels is hard xd
15:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> is it a microkernel
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah, in rust its really easy too
15:27 < potat> rust mentioned

15:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> im doing it monolithic
15:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess
15:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk i just want something that works
15:28 < chillerbot> ding dong ping pong @ryozuki  @ryozuki @ryozuki @ryozuki: @chillerdragon learn rust
15:28 < potat> rust mentioned
15:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> wtf
15:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> i forgot the bot is on
15:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> they can know talk to each other
15:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> rust
15:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> darn
15:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah i did ctrl c
15:29 < bridge> <Assa> they can't, tested that already

15:29 < bridge> <Assa> !remind -1 rust
15:29 < chillerbot> Helo Assa I will remind you at Tue Aug 19 2025 15:28:54 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.
15:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> i think without this check there would be gazillion messages already
15:29 < chillerbot> Elo @Assa I just wanted to remind you that: rust

15:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> and i would get banned by heinrich
15:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> i want to take a break for kernel dev but its just too interesting to make everything from ground up, thats why im trying to get into the riscv board i have
15:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> also ill probs do a second kernel some day i guess now that i know more
15:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> after 2 kernels back to ddnet
15:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> potat
15:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> i want ideas to use my 2 riscv dev boards
15:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> load balancer
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe i can do my own alexa, but maybe 160mhz is not enough cpu
15:31 < bridge> <Assa> hmm maybe I'll write Assbot and put it into questions
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> OHH
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can make a ddnet bot inside the riscv board
15:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> :justatest:
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> since its low power
15:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can have it on at home all time
15:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> u need permission to have a bot here
15:32 < bridge> <jxsl13> someone gimme permissions
15:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> discord or irc?
15:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> irc i guess idk
15:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> so then u would need to implement ur own irc lib
15:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> because no std
15:33 < bridge> <Assa> serious expert question: Is it possible to create the graphics backend in a no-window mode?
15:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes
15:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> with vulkan
15:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> its called offscreen rendering
15:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://docs.kdab.com/kdgpu/unstable/offscreen_rendering.html
15:34 < bridge> <Assa> and ddnet doesn't provide this functionality?
15:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
15:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it woudl be nice for testing ig
15:34 < bridge> <Assa> not only that, I want to do the map screenshot tool
15:34 < bridge> <Assa> not only that, I want to do the map screenshot tool based on maprendering
15:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:34 < bridge> <ryozuki>     Create swapchain
15:34 < bridge> <ryozuki>     Create image views from swapchain
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki>     Create render pass
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki>     Create framebuffer from render pass
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki>     Acquire from swapchain
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki>     Bind render pass/framebuffer
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki>     Draw
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> replace sawpchain with image i guess
15:35 < bridge> <Assa> and build on that map-previews
15:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> ingame?
15:35 < bridge> <Assa> yes
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> For offscreen rendering, you'll:
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> 1. Create render targets as `VkImage` with `VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT` (and depth if needed)
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2. Use `VkFramebuffer` with your images instead of swapchain images
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> 3. Render to these framebuffers normally
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> 4. Read results back to host memory or use them as textures
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> Key differences from windowed rendering:
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> - No `VkSurfaceKHR` or `VkSwapchainKHR` needed
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> - You control image creation and memory allocation
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> - No presentation queue required
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> - Can run entirely headless
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> ai respone warning
15:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh no vulkan
15:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> 900 lines of code for a triangle
15:36 < bridge> <Assa> yeah no I'd need to put that into the backend
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> vulkan best
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually
15:36 < bridge> <Assa> and not every build supports vulkan as well
15:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i should learn vulkan in depth
15:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> another interesting project is a renderer
15:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> and maybe i can become jupstar v2
15:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> what about wgpu
15:37 < bridge> <Assa> you mean a general renderer?
15:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> which supports all the backends
15:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> lets not support no vulkan pcs
15:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> more general is harder to optimize
15:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u only use vulkan its easier to optimize
15:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u can tell more easily whats under the hood
15:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> jupstar jr.
15:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> "If OpenGL is GPU Javascript, Vulkan is GPU C."
15:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> xd
15:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Fack I passed `-j8` instead of `-j5` to make and now my pc is dying :feelsbadman:
15:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) tsmash sounds good. If someone codes it in a way that does not cause git conflicts ill merge it :) 
15:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> fng already modifies hammer and should have  a way to do kill credit, idk if  you can modify skins easily
15:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i should make kernel blog posts
15:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> but im not confiden the stuff i do is correct and ill get roasted
15:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> by whom
15:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> learath?
15:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> blog is personal stuff u want to share not phd research
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
15:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> c only has simple things but you can make complex things out of them, vulkan does not share this
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> vulkan is complex because modern gpus are rly complex
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> opengl is simple but is not enough
15:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yep. i dont think you can make a "gpu c"
15:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa Assbot xd
15:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> i think it can be interpreted as opengl can be used anywhere by anyone with ease, but vulkan can not
15:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) zcatch does stuff to skins already
15:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> c is probably more widely implemented than js
15:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Solly (bun bun) are u gonna code tsmash?
15:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah
15:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** pro
15:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im gonna try
15:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** are you gonna code ddnet ios?
15:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> nope!
15:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** sad
15:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** worth a shot xd
15:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** tsmash is ryo mod right?
15:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no clue
15:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im probably gonna make it feel like tsmash rather than trying to steal code
15:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** since he stepped down as ddnet maintainer we can easily force him to maintain tsmash in ddnet-insta
15:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 👀
16:08 < chillerbot> Elo @Assa I just wanted to remind you that: @chillerdragon the bot should maybe not ping
16:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** omg ping
16:08 < chillerbot> DO NOT FORGET @chillerdragon TO: @ryozuki learn bash
16:08 < bridge> <soulyvevo> chillertroll
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know bash enoug to do my things
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is call rust
16:11 < potat> rust mentioned
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> im using ai to make a 4 wheel robot project to use my dev kit
16:12 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i wonder
16:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1407366517452181576/image.png?ex=68a5d7b5&is=68a48635&hm=28c9ae888e984187ff2badf69c0cd2828ae2bb577f2f9f52eb041893033eb2d9&
16:12 < bridge> <soulyvevo> @ryozuki do you actually have a rust focused job or something
16:12 < potat> rust mentioned
16:12 < bridge> <soulyvevo> like, do you make a living out of it
16:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes im a professional rust dev, for 4~ years
16:12 < potat> rust mentioned
16:13 < bridge> <soulyvevo> cool
16:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> 4 motors cost as much as the board itself
16:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> how can boards be so cheap
16:20 < bridge> <Assa> where do I set cli options in VS :pepeRage:
16:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> first question is why do u use vs
16:22 < bridge> <Assa> only for debugging and profiling
16:22 < bridge> <Assa> because windows
16:31 < bridge> <Assa> you need to create your own project profile to do that oO
16:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> To the binary or the build

17:03 < bridge> <teero777> https://github.com/nukeop/nuclear/blob/master/docs%2Felectron.md
17:03 < bridge> <teero777> I saw this recently xD
17:04 < bridge> <teero777> > It's clear that highly polarized opinions about languages and frameworks are characteristic of people who lack real-world programming experience
17:04 < bridge> <teero777> :nouis:
17:09 < bridge> <teero777> what Gemini 2.5 flash thinks of this
17:09 < bridge> <teero777> > Yes, the text you provided is a classic example of "yap." It's not a reasoned technical argument but a highly emotional and condescending rant.
17:09 < bridge> <teero777> The author's approach can be summarized by these points:
17:09 < bridge> <teero777>  * Personal Attacks: Instead of addressing the performance concerns about Electron, the author attacks the character of those who raise them. They dismiss people who dislike Electron as "lacking real-world programming experience."
17:09 < bridge> <teero777>  * Dismissal of Valid Criticisms: The author writes off legitimate performance issues, like memory usage, as an old "meme" that isn't relevant anymore. While Electron has improved, its resource usage is still significantly higher than native alternatives.
17:09 < bridge> <teero777>  * Arrogant Tone: The language is aggressive and dismissive, with phrases like "whining makes them seem smart." This isn't a productive way to discuss a technical topic.
17:09 < bridge> <teero777> In short, the passage uses inflammatory language and personal attacks to avoid a genuine debate about the technical trade-offs of using Electron.

17:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @teero777 go comment that llm dump here https://github.com/nukeop/nuclear/commit/4bb8ca59efe71e605054efb248578401ea15d9f7
17:14 < bridge> <teero777> what? Can I comment there? xd
17:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ofc
17:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i do it all the time
17:14 < bridge> <teero777> phone doesn't let me smh
17:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** do u even github
17:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ah ye github mobile L
17:15 < bridge> <teero777> why must the mobile app always be inferior of the website
17:15 < bridge> <teero777> why must the mobile app always be inferior to the website
17:15 < bridge> <chairn> aren't you a bit late ? commit is from 2019
17:15 < bridge> <teero777> and electron still hasn't improved much :v
17:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> what if ma compooper doesnt like electron
17:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the cost of using Electron is the hit to your pride as a programmer, some memory usage on users' machines, and maybe damaged reputation among some nerds that nobody cares about
17:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> discord in electron runs so much worse in the app than the browser not that it... runs well in the first place
17:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (on bad hardware)
17:16 < bridge> <kollpotato> we have tauri now
17:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> and learath wrath
17:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (on good hardware i use browser because the app sucks at streaming and hardware accel sometimes break)
17:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> "some nerds that nobody cares about"
17:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well you see the nerds care about each othere
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> its insane that temu is the best option to source cheap af components
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1407382981450006608/image.png?ex=68a5e70a&is=68a4958a&hm=36b27d350ea25f6e1aa68d0f785b6b3c93ebff7c49aab44050e1ce01c7bb041c&
17:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> not my personal opinion of course, since I'm one of those nerds myself
17:17 < bridge> <teero777> care what you say, learaths dream is world domination
17:17 < bridge> <kollpotato> u buy from temu???
17:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> just saying like it is practice most of the time
17:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> is it even reliable for that
17:18 < bridge> <teero777> why not?
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye it is, my gf does all time
17:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> great question
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also was tunnel focused on amazon
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> but temu is cheap af

17:23 < bridge> <kollpotato> why use ascii for this
17:23 < bridge> <kollpotato> its not even ascii
17:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> these emojis make it look much worse
17:24 < bridge> <Assa> binary, I still didn't find it, I found a stackoverflow entry for VS 2008
17:24 < bridge> <Assa> I just went with hardcoding argv[1] instead
17:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd ai likes emoji
17:24 < bridge> <teero777> tell it to hate emoji
17:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
17:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can do that
17:25 < bridge> <teero777> which model are you using?
17:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> of what
17:25 < bridge> <teero777> ai
17:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> claude
17:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i heard its the best for coding related
17:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> so far im impressed xD
17:26 < bridge> <teero777> I've never seen AI do such good ascii art before xd
17:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> im using the 20€ version btw
17:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> claude sonnet 4
17:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> (its not even their best model)
17:27 < bridge> <teero777> How much of a difference does it make?
17:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk but it feels smarted atleast vs the free chatgpt i tried and gemini ai looked a bit dumb
17:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk but it feels smartest atleast vs the free chatgpt i tried and gemini ai looked a bit dumb
17:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> altho i gemini theorically has the biggest context of 1m
17:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> they have opus 4.1 which i think is better than the new gpt, but it uses a lot of "token" value or smth
17:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> so when i use it i run out of usage
17:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> fast
17:28 < bridge> <teero777> with gpt5 It once got so lost after a few prompts that it started using python to implement random bs xd
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> tell me python program to do
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can show u the result
17:29 < bridge> <teero777> no no I needed some help in c99
17:29 < bridge> <teero777> With a bigger project like 2000loc at most
17:30 < bridge> <teero777> And it started cooking random shit in python
17:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> send me a snippet of the code having thep roblem
17:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> send me a snippet of the code having the problem
17:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:30 < bridge> <teero777> It was a few days ago xd
17:30 < bridge> <teero777> wait
17:31 < bridge> <teero777> I don't have gpt on phone, I'm too lazy to go to my pc
17:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> can u describe the problem?
17:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> otherwise doesnt matter xd
17:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill go play a dota ranked i guess
17:32 < bridge> <teero777> It was a vulkan backend problem that I wanted it to diagnose
17:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> for some things its quite smart, for example i have code i want to avoid bounds checking thats a bit math involved, and it can make some great detail on the bounds
17:32 < bridge> <teero777> So I can't really describe the problem xd
17:32 < bridge> <teero777> I just had some values switched around
17:33 < bridge> <teero777> btw @learath2 did you know this?
17:33 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1407386933763510343/Screenshot_20250819-030133.png?ex=68a5eab8&is=68a49938&hm=40937f34954f7e9a89a66ef3fd0edaf5515047f7b0fd709c2807b851f577b23c&

17:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well i did do it on cpp so maybe i am sillybilly
17:36 < bridge> <learath2> I've only seen this one to enforce a size
17:36 < bridge> <learath2> ```c
17:36 < bridge> <learath2> void foo(int (*arr)[32]);
17:36 < bridge> <learath2> ```
17:36 < bridge> <learath2> Don't need a secret discord, just be an ass in here

17:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> ?
17:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:37 < bridge> <learath2> C++ did just flat out ignore some features of C99. Like flexible array memebers and variable length arrays

17:42 < bridge> <teero777> https://godbolt.org/z/GP7x94bax
17:42 < bridge> <always> u potat :omo:
17:43 < bridge> <teero777> anyways its a cool feature
17:43 < bridge> <always> do demos contain how long u held +fire?
17:43 < bridge> <always> and other players
17:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://h4x0r.org/futex/
17:43 < bridge> <teero777> the fire input is a counter so yes. inputs are saved in the demo
17:43 < bridge> <always> what about other players
17:43 < bridge> <teero777> yes just as i said
17:44 < bridge> <always> is it possible to make a indicator when someone is holding +fire in freeze? (in game not demos)
17:44 < bridge> <always> and what weapon they are holding
17:45 < bridge> <teero777> i would consider that cheating
17:45 < bridge> <teero777> unless its in thew official client ofc x
17:45 < bridge> <teero777> unless its in thew official client ofc xd
17:45 < bridge> <always> well u are informed of the sound
17:45 < bridge> <always> and i think u can hear if they switch weapons
17:45 < bridge> <teero777> unless its in the official client ofc xd
17:46 < bridge> <always> (like the tee pain sound)
17:46 < bridge> <always> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1407390236593623100/DDNet_GPXUy4MGJY.png?ex=68a5edcc&is=68a49c4c&hm=ac3f1ad907226d6f30afe6ee19f60d05af0b52945d5e66e5c84e40ce3eeefd8c&
17:46 < bridge> <always> but u dont know if they are still hodling
17:46 < bridge> <always> but u dont know if they are still holding
17:46 < bridge> <always> so they could just press leftclick and let go and u wont know if they are holding

17:58 < bridge> <Assa> does sb know what Destroy in Kernel() means?
17:58 < bridge> <Assa> like this code
17:58 < bridge> <Assa> ```
17:58 < bridge> <Assa>     pKernel->RegisterInterface(pStorage.get());

17:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc used for xml
18:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** random ah pr
18:08 < bridge> <Assa> lol it just worked, the map screenshot tool opened a window for a split second taking a screenshot and closing it :justatest:

18:24 < bridge> <Assa> tree training for amazon?
18:25 < bridge> <Assa> `TreeNode **n;` but why
18:25 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, have my interview tomorrow, just doing random leetcode hoping I get lucky with tomorrows questions too
18:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
18:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** where did u apply?
18:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fang?
18:25 < bridge> <learath2> That's the beauty, by using double indirection you don't have to keep track of the predecessor
18:26 < bridge> <Assa> good luck btw 🙂
18:26 < bridge> <learath2> I can directly replace the contents of the pointer from the parent, because I always keep a pointer to the pointer that led me here instead
18:27 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, Amazon. For some reason of all the applications I made to all the places only Amazon replied 😛
18:27 < bridge> <Assa> with all your maintainer powers, I am pretty sure you are qualified enough
18:28 < bridge> <Assa> I wonder what they want and why no other firms replied
18:28 < bridge> <learath2> It just doesn't look like it at all on my CV, so I always get filtered way before an interview
18:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa how did u know its amazon? oO
18:29 < bridge> <learath2> Most HR departments or AI bots they employ don't seem to consider my experience with teeworlds/ddnet as counting towards their "professional(?) work experience" requirement
18:29 < bridge> <Assa> ~~hacked his PC~~ I mean he told me ofc :justatest:
18:29 < bridge> <learath2> I think I talked about it in #off-topic a couple times
18:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** didnt we decide on llm exploit in cv?
18:30 < bridge> <learath2> I'm still very meh with interval questions and subarray/subsequence stuff, I hope I don't get any
18:30 < bridge> <Assa> My CV looks very good even to LLMs, you just need recommendations from others
18:30 < bridge> <Assa> I collect them and attach them to every CV
18:31 < bridge> <learath2> I have never really ever been asked for recommendations, idk where I'd even attach one
18:31 < bridge> <Assa> No i Mean a document which sb. gave you which tells a firm how great you are and where you accell at
18:32 < bridge> <Assa> Got one from my bachelor thesis and from one of my old workplaces (where I caused them to have a deal with BMW, because I implemented an algorithm in a day lol)
18:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 is your cv open source?
18:32 < bridge> <learath2> I could get one from my boss at the internship I did, but I wouldn't know where to attach it is what I mean
18:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** did you frame it correctly?
18:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** head maintainer of steam game with 600k monthly users?
18:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** since 20 years
18:33 < bridge> <learath2> Probably not, I'm not good at selling myself 😄
18:33 < bridge> <learath2> It's also not very machine friendly honestly. I couldn't bring myself to make it ugly enough that clankers can read it easier
18:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
18:34  * bridge <Assa> hides invisible metadata
18:39 < bridge> <learath2> I had chatgpt re-fill it with filler stuff except teeworlds/ddnet section
18:40 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1407403734169944135/image.png?ex=68a5fa5e&is=68a4a8de&hm=ca61c04fe687be016abeaa7f462a711d6c80cd5aeb8eeb6ce8389ec291116dde&
18:40 < bridge> <learath2> tbh not sure why I even bothered given kinda everyone knows who I am here anyway 😄
18:44 < bridge> <lomination> Hm, what about height balancing?
18:44 < bridge> <learath2> https://gist.github.com/Learath2/00fd14f18b97a5e0a1be1af5bd68ed0b I did make this when my latex knowledge was worse, so cut me some slack, but it is open source now 😄
18:46 < bridge> <learath2> You mean after removing? Not very easy, you'd have to be keeping extra metadata
18:47 < bridge> <lomination> Yes, I was thinking of AVLs
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, or maybe a RB tree, otherwise it's not possible to rebalance the tree faster than reconstructing it balanced
18:48 < bridge> <pioooooo> Just tell gpt write one
18:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> hi tech lead
18:49 < bridge> <learath2> ChatGPT suggested I overstate everything I ever did
18:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not bad
18:50 < bridge> <learath2> He is the one reading the CVs anyway, so I'm asking him how he'd like it 😛
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> technicall u are kinda the tech lead
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz u are not coding much now and more deciding
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> its what my tech lead does
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> heinrich would be the project manager
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> the grumpy one
18:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> skill section looks kinda weird
18:50 < bridge> <learath2> I should sneak the player count in there somewhere
18:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> do employers care about these ratings
18:50 < bridge> <learath2> You don't like the dots? GPT didn't like it either
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i wouldnt put ratings on skills either
18:51 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe I should just list all of them, but it kinda looked weird like that
18:51 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah it just doesnt say much
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> athis is mine lol
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1407406724234743989/image.png?ex=68a5fd27&is=68a4aba7&hm=2aecb93f53d8ee102e3dff96805977db3dcfea55bc7992084c33873b05e80b00&

18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> most ppl hiring tell my i have a rly nice CV skill wise
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> but this comes mostly from my current work
18:53 < bridge> <learath2> Also, I have learned about a new data structure yesterday. Suffix trees
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just list what i do at my current job
18:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> is ddnet mentioned there?
18:53 < bridge> <learath2> (and suffix arrays)
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mentioned ddnet at my first cv
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> where i got this job
18:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> gg they got addicted to ddnet too
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also mentioned my old kernel back then
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> so kernel and ddnet got me he job
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> ryoOS

18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> and then the guy couldnt do anything with my skillset and sent me to his corpo friend
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> and then i found a better job
18:56 < bridge> <learath2> yeah, that's kinda the only positive you can hope to get from a school
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> 600 -> 1500€ -> 2600€

18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> epic bot
18:59 < bridge> <learath2> Pretty much everyone in amazon can recommend anyone for any position, but it'll only let you skip that weird ai check that kept getting my ass as far as I understand
19:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont even try cuz going tho the process is tiring af
19:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually the place i work at, if u have ideas for startups they are open to fund you
19:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> (as investors ofc)
19:02 < bridge> <learath2> I'm so not fit for this sort of dragged on interview thing with stupid leetcode. If I don't get this one I don't think I'll try FAANG again
19:02 < bridge> <learath2> It's not good for my anxiety, nor is it any fun having to just memorize a billion algorithms
19:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> W merge

19:06 < bridge> <melon> XDDD
19:07 < bridge> <learath2> iirc it wasn't trivial, we have blacklists and stuff for broken drivers
19:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> blacklists lmao
19:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I mean SDL does the same. The bug I reported got fixed by banning my keyboard from controller discovery xd
19:09 < bridge> <Assa> I just don't know how to access the config before the engine does xD
19:09 < bridge> <pioooooo> ChillerDragon: #10476 needs your maintainer opinion
19:09 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10476
19:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @pioooooo: sorry I will have a rare moment of real life now and touch some grass
19:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> review outside
19:10 < bridge> <learath2> Looks like another amazing PR to break stuff with, looking forward to chillers review
19:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I won’t bring my phone
19:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> wtf not a phone addict
19:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> based
19:11 < bridge> <learath2> gebasiert
19:11 < bridge> <pioooooo> It's okay the issue already sit there for a month
19:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Konsti
19:11 < bridge> <konstee> lmao that smells <a:chotdetected:808830246513147904>
19:11 < bridge> <melon> axaxaxaxaxaxaxa
19:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> German C2
19:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2: include in your CV that the software is so serious it has an external pentest team
19:13 < bridge> <learath2> What is your favourite algorithm?
19:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> bubble wrap sort
19:14 < bridge> <melon> good choice
19:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> not teeworlds interger compression?
19:14 < bridge> <melon> i like A* for its simplicity
19:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> smh
19:14 < bridge> <pioooooo> Random tarjan stuffs
19:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don’t get it @kollpotato
19:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh Shit im Late
19:14 < bridge> <learath2> If they make me implement any sorting I'll do bogosort
19:17 < bridge> <kollpotato> sleep sort way better
19:19 < bridge> <learath2> Was that the one where you slept until cosmic rays flipped all the bits necessary to sort the array?
19:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> no u sleep X amount times for each element (where X is the value of the element) so they are printed in the correct order
19:20 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, that's nice too
19:21 < bridge> <kollpotato> no u sleep X time units for each element (where X is the value of the element) so they are printed in the correct order
19:28 < chillerbot> Elo @Assa I just wanted to remind you that: @chillerdragon the bot should maybe not ping
19:31 < bridge> <0xdeen> Wait, you're supposed to practice something for interviews? I thought that's counterproductive since you'd reveal to the interviewer if you've seen a similar problem before. I always assumed it's more about seeing how you approach something you have no idea about. 😄
19:31 < bridge> <0xdeen> Good luck with the interview!
19:40 < bridge> <learath2> I thought so too, but other people told me I should know that stuff. So I took a middle ground approach, just study a bit for it 😄
19:41 < bridge> <learath2> It's unlikely I come up with any solution to the single source shortest path problem myself without knowing anything about it tbf
19:43 < bridge> <melon> didnt you refer to yourself as a junior a while ago lerato?
19:44 < bridge> <learath2> I think so, I should be
19:44 < bridge> <melon> all "junior" devs i've seen at my workplace dont even come close xd
19:45 < bridge> <learath2> I'm a great bargain, you hire me as a junior. I'm actually not a junior
19:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> junior is a term made up by tech companies
19:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> its not real
19:45 < bridge> <melon> well.. there is a big jump from studying programming and actually programming
19:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> junior in one company can be senior in another
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> this chat is outliers
19:46 < bridge> <melon> i guess the ddnet devteam are a nieche set of devs
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah there are real juniors out thee
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> at my company i saw someone use a iterator to copy byte by byte instead of using copy from slice
19:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> i changed it and perf increased 100x
19:47 < bridge> <melon> (reminder that my co-worker who was scheduled to teach ME virtualization used GPTee to write a fetch function in javascript)
19:47 < bridge> <learath2> I'm a junior by the amount of "professional experience" I have
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:47 < bridge> <melon> i wonder..
19:47 < bridge> <melon> @0xdeen did you put DDNet in your resume? :p
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also saw ppl wrap stuff in arcs when the internal structure already had arcs
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> they dont rly grasp what cloning rly does i guess
19:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> wow im already better than that
19:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> hire me
19:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> :kek:
19:48 < bridge> <melon> rather sounds like missing rust knowledge/coming from a OOP lang
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> u need to speak spanish
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> well or live in barcelona
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can be fine not speaking spanish but yeah
19:49 < bridge> <pilonpl> It's hard to understand when you are experienced but even knowing how memory works is not obvious
19:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know its not obvious, but hence why junior fits them
19:49 < bridge> <kollpotato> uh hola
19:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk but my company is mainly rust so
19:49 < bridge> <melon> ah hmm
19:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust+ elixir (i havent needed to do elixir yet tho)
19:50 < bridge> <melon> my company, given its size uses a lot of different langs for no apparent reason
19:50 < bridge> <learath2> The people who just graduate uni without any real experience are truly juniors
19:50 < bridge> <melon> we use js/ts - c and some weird noname lang from 1988
19:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> ada?
19:50 < bridge> <melon> could be it
19:51 < bridge> <melon> some people prefer that language over C for programming SPS systems atleast
19:51 < bridge> <melon> never looked into it tho
19:51 < bridge> <Assa> any idea why Kernel()->RegisterInterface might not work? I don't get it
19:52 < bridge> <pilonpl> Seems like universities don't teach you how computers work lol
19:53 < bridge> <louis> they do but u can graduate without paying attention on any of ur classes
19:53 < bridge> <louis> especially now with mr. chatgpt
19:54 < bridge> <0xdeen> Of course, it's still on my resume. The interview for my first job at SAP was mostly talking about DDNet and what I did with it
19:54 < bridge> <learath2> They also teach you how very old computers work, but that's still better than nothing
19:54 < bridge> <melon> thats sick xd
19:54 < bridge> <0xdeen> and it allowed me to skip being a junior, counted as "work experience"
19:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> do they teach u x86_64 in depth?
19:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> im having so much fun
19:55 < bridge> <learath2> Noooooo, we learned 8086
19:55 < bridge> <learath2> A very small subset of 8086
19:55 < bridge> <pilonpl> So actual programming experience matters, good to know
19:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> make ur own teeworlds mod and become a middle dev for free
19:56 < bridge> <learath2> YMMV, I pretty much got zero return on my teeworlds time
19:56 < bridge> <learath2> (Jobswise that is. I did learn an insane amount of things just being around here)
19:57 < bridge> <pilonpl> From my 3 PRs i learned that i hate CPP
19:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust

19:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> use rust bridge
19:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> for the next prs
19:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also put ddnet and explained how i made the telegun
19:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> for my actual job
19:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> something about the ddnet char protocol too iirc
19:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot
19:59 < bridge> <learath2> I talked a bit about the autoupdater with the first amazon phone interview dude
19:59 < bridge> <pilonpl> You made the telegun?
19:59 < bridge> <melon> ddnet was my first and only history of coding C++ on github, which helped convince them i'm capable of reading C code
19:59 < bridge> <melon> :kekw:
19:59 < bridge> <pilonpl> I guess someone had to make it
19:59 < bridge> <melon> ddnet masterrace
19:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> usually first interview is a HR guy to assess ur not crazy
19:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> filter
19:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> yep
19:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> with timakro
20:00 < bridge> <pioooooo> https://dallaylaen.github.io/ski-interpreter/quest.html

20:00 < bridge> <learath2> Amazon offloaded the HR guy part to AI too. You get an Online Assessment thing before phone interview
20:00 < bridge> <louis> i put ddnet on my resume and got asked about it too lol
20:01 < bridge> <learath2> It made me take a personality test like thing. Then a "work assessment", where you work thru a simulated day where virtual coworkers email you and atuff
20:01 < bridge> <learath2> It made me take a personality test like thing. Then a "work assessment", where you work thru a simulated day where virtual coworkers email you and stuff
20:01 < bridge> <learath2> My virtual coworker asked me to debug an issue with a backend, sent me logs and stuff to read thru to find the cause 😄
20:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol
20:03 < bridge> <learath2> Also just noticed, we never ever used a bfs or dfs in ddnet. We should find a graph problem pronto
20:04 < bridge> <pioooooo> teero's secret tas searcher mentioned
20:04 < bridge> <learath2> Or a binary search tree
20:05 < bridge> <louis> cant we use four way tree for 2d collision
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oh wow
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Louis stopped playing ddnet?
20:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That's sad
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> So wait. I wasn't supposed to be practicing? :pepeW:
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> I'll just do my very best to pretend I haven't seen the problems before
20:08 < bridge> <louis> Everyone practices for those so u probably should
20:09 < bridge> <Ewan> green louis
20:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> all admins have different roles xd
20:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> but they are all green
20:10 < bridge> <learath2> grouis
20:12 < bridge> <pioooooo> looks more ecofriendly than ever before
20:13 < bridge> <melon> we have colorblind admins too!
20:13 < bridge> <melon> colors never match
20:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> how do u see it
20:13 < bridge> <melon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1407427319861350541/image.png?ex=68a61055&is=68a4bed5&hm=ee45e75aee562db739e115d4beeeccf1defb510bc0ab5b6fbf9c7ffcca9c9bd1&
20:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> role named red with a green color for a user with a blue name
20:14 < bridge> <learath2> That is 100% red, idk wym
20:15 < bridge> <melon> :crythumbsup:
20:15 < bridge> <learath2> It's the same color of the beautiful ocean
20:15 < bridge> <melon> no wait a minute.
20:15 < bridge> <melon> now wait a minute.
20:15 < bridge> <learath2> It's the same color as the beautiful ocean
20:16 < bridge> <learath2> Or the lush forests of the amazon
20:16 < bridge> <bomab> if you disagree you will get demoted like that forgotten moderator from last time
20:16 < bridge> <kollpotato> forgotten cat?
20:17 < bridge> <bomab> can be considered cat
20:26 < chillerbot> DO NOT FORGET @ryozuki TO: add the linear frame page allocator to the dma and dont forget to deallocate the dma buffer after using it
20:31 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems like a bug, the minimum value for `gfx_gl_major`  is `1`, it should never pick or show `0.0.0`
20:41 < bridge> <chairn> well, you need more than a class to learn how modern computer works
20:41 < bridge> <chairn> but the basics are the same
20:42 < bridge> <learath2> I could see RISCV being more interesting, but yes, modern computers are just far too complex to cram into some undergraduate class
20:42 < bridge> <chairn> we teach risc-v here
20:42 < bridge> <chairn> there is at least one ooo RISC-V machine
20:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> we had classes on micro-optimization to make good use of pipelining and vector instructions
20:43 < bridge> <chairn> i think there's also some speculative extension you can enable
20:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so like, they do teach you about modern computers, but those are optional courses
20:43 < bridge> <chairn> that's kinda useless imo
20:43 < bridge> <learath2> We learn about a hypothetical very old cpu that is very loosely based on 8086, and for assembly we learn a very small subset of 8086 assembly
20:43 < bridge> <chairn> honestly, seeing a lil bit of assembly is fine, having all the course around it doesn't make much sense anymore
20:44 < bridge> <Assa> as you can see I managed to do that, I also managed to fix that:D
20:44 < bridge> <learath2> I wish they'd just teach it properly, the subset we learn is branchless, it's pretty much useless for anything but a very expensive calculator
20:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Clearly they're trying to teach you the greatness that is branchless programming
20:45 < bridge> <chairn> yeah, just use `mv pc, eax`
20:45 < bridge> <chairn> not sure that's possible on x86
20:45 < bridge> <learath2> LOL, we have branch at home
20:46 < bridge> <chairn> there's `call eax` though
20:46 < bridge> <learath2> LOL, we have jmp at home
20:46 < bridge> <chairn> is there `j eax` ?
20:46 < bridge> <chairn> to prevent stack growing ?
20:46 < bridge> <chairn> how does movfuscator work for branches ?
20:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> teeworlds attempt at decoupling
20:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> sob sob
20:47 < bridge> <chairn> https://github.com/Battelle/movfuscator
20:50 < bridge> <learath2> LOL, it abuses a signal handler
20:50 < bridge> <robyt3> What happens and what do you expected to happen? Example code?
20:53 < bridge> <Assa> I am currently working on a tool in order to create map screenshots as standalone, CMap for example says the IStorage interface is not there (nullptr) while I registered it at the Kernel
20:53 < bridge> <Assa> gonna create a minimal, sec
20:55 < bridge> <Assa> ```
20:55 < bridge> <Assa>     // create the components
20:55 < bridge> <Assa>     IKernel *pKernel = IKernel::Create();
20:55 < bridge> <Assa> 
20:55 < bridge> <Assa>     // Engine
20:55 < bridge> <Assa>     IEngine *pEngine = CreateEngine(TOOL_NAME, pFutureConsoleLogger);
20:55 < bridge> <Assa>     pKernel->RegisterInterface(pEngine, false);
20:55 < bridge> <Assa> 
20:55 < bridge> <Assa>     // Storage
20:55 < bridge> <Assa>     IStorage* pStorage = CreateStorage(IStorage::EInitializationType::CLIENT, 1, argv);
20:55 < bridge> <Assa>     //pKernel->RegisterInterface(pStorage);
20:55 < bridge> <Assa>     pKernel->RegisterInterface(static_cast<IStorage *>(pStorage), false);
20:55 < bridge> <Assa> 
20:55 < bridge> <Assa>         CMap Map;
20:55 < bridge> <Assa>         bool Success = Map.Load("maps/dm1.map"); // <-- crashes because pStorage is not found, even if I Register pStorage differently
20:56 < bridge> <Assa> ```
20:56 < bridge> <Assa> ```
20:56 < bridge> <Assa>     // create the components
20:56 < bridge> <Assa>     IKernel *pKernel = IKernel::Create();
20:56 < bridge> <Assa> 
20:56 < bridge> <Assa>     // Engine
20:56 < bridge> <Assa>     IEngine *pEngine = CreateEngine(TOOL_NAME, pFutureConsoleLogger);
20:56 < bridge> <Assa>     pKernel->RegisterInterface(pEngine, false);
20:56 < bridge> <Assa> 
20:56 < bridge> <Assa>     // Storage
20:56 < bridge> <Assa>     IStorage* pStorage = CreateStorage(IStorage::EInitializationType::CLIENT, 1, argv);
20:56 < bridge> <Assa>     //pKernel->RegisterInterface(pStorage);
20:56 < bridge> <Assa>     pKernel->RegisterInterface(static_cast<IStorage *>(pStorage), false);
20:56 < bridge> <Assa> 
20:56 < bridge> <Assa>     CMap Map;
20:56 < bridge> <Assa>     bool Success = Map.Load("maps/dm1.map"); // <-- crashes because pStorage is not found, even if I Register pStorage differently
20:56 < bridge> <Assa> ```
20:58 < bridge> <robyt3> You also need to register `CMap` with the kernel, as it's also a kernel interface
20:59 < bridge> <robyt3> ```cpp
20:59 < bridge> <robyt3> IEngineMap *pEngineMap = CreateEngineMap();
20:59 < bridge> <robyt3> pKernel->RegisterInterface(pEngineMap); // IEngineMap
20:59 < bridge> <robyt3> pKernel->RegisterInterface(static_cast<IMap *>(pEngineMap), false);
20:59 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
20:59 < bridge> <Assa> omg I commented it out 🙈  why did I do that
21:01 < bridge> <Assa> I still get the same segfault
21:02 < bridge> <learath2> (registering a kernel interface with the kernel populates its internal kernel pointer)
21:02 < bridge> <robyt3> You need to register the map before loading it
21:02 < bridge> <robyt3> You need to register the map interface before loading a map
21:07 < bridge> <Assa> I now literally put
21:07 < bridge> <Assa> ```
21:07 < bridge> <Assa>     CMap Map;
21:07 < bridge> <Assa>     Map.Load(MapName);
21:07 < bridge> <Assa> ```
21:07 < bridge> <Assa> 
21:07 < bridge> <Assa> Under the Kernel registering and it doesn't work
21:08 < bridge> <learath2> well time to whip out gdb
21:09 < bridge> <Assa> I can give you the full main
21:09 < bridge> <Assa> well building might be complicated without cmake and imports
21:12 < bridge> <learath2> Paste the full main somewhere and I'll give it a go
21:15 < bridge> <Assa> just deleted 99%
21:18 < bridge> <Assa> https://pastebin.com/GpUWJKWk
21:18 < bridge> <Assa> I am too stupid to paste right
21:18 < bridge> <Assa> dragging and dropping a cpp might have been smarter
21:20 < bridge> <robyt3> You need to register the map with the kernel. `Map` has no knowledge of the kernel. Remove that variable and copy https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1407438800069853186
21:21 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks like you added that code snippet already, but you need to use the map that you registered, `pEngineMap`, and not a new local variable `Map`
21:22 < bridge> <Assa> it worked, thank you all a lot :deen_star:
21:22 < bridge> <Assa> but this actually felt like black magic
21:24 < bridge> <learath2> `CMap` being a singleton is not very obvious yeah
21:26 < bridge> <learath2> Everything you register into the kernel is one of a kind, it's a singleton holding all the singletons
21:27 < bridge> <robyt3> It shouldn't even be an engine interface, the engine doesn't need to be aware of the map apart from its name, size and hashes
21:29 < bridge> <robyt3> Then you could have multiple maps and the editor could use the same code for loading them
21:30 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, that's how the engine exposes parts of itself to other parts of the code though
21:30 < bridge> <learath2> `CMap` should be something like `CMapHandler`, that could handle stuff like multiple maps
21:31 < bridge> <robyt3> Anything that uses the concrete map items should be in game code and not in the engine I think
21:31 < bridge> <learath2> Or `CMapLoader`
21:31 < bridge> <robyt3> You can still have that, but the gameclient/gameserver should own the map
21:31 < bridge> <Assa> What also works is if you set CMap::Load(const char* bla; IStorage *pStorage = nullptr)
21:31 < bridge> <robyt3> The engine justs asks the game for the map's metadata
21:32 < bridge> <Assa> but I didn't want to do that and don't know if this causes side effects
21:32 < bridge> <robyt3> The engine just needs to ask the game for the map's metadata
21:32 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, I guess that sounds sensible too
21:33 < bridge> <Assa> A screen now opens and it's pitch black, any idea what causes this? I tried to init SDL as well but this wasn't the issue apparently xD
21:34 < bridge> <Assa> oh maybe I need to flush, I don't know
21:35 < bridge> <learath2> Well you are likely just not initializing enough stuff, it's hard to know at this point, the client was never designed to be ran this way, you are the one doing the detangling right now 😄

21:52 < bridge> <pioooooo> I would start with game-client main and delete lines
22:07 < bridge> <Assa> Idk, I am at the point where the maprenderer renders the map with valid texture IDs and stuff, but the screen is still black 🤷‍♂️
22:07 < bridge> <teero777> what is a @ trial tester?
22:19 < bridge> <filoqcus> Does anyone have a compiled ddnet rust-client for win :D?
22:19 < bridge> <pioooooo> I think is a tester under trial
22:19 < bridge> <teero777> oh

22:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> watafak
22:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> thats why it has steam in name
22:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> is ddnet-rs on steam ._.
22:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs/actions/runs/17006963882#artifacts download from here
22:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> the one without steam in the name
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It supports the steam features for logging in. But it's not released on steam
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You need to manually add it to steam to use the features

23:13 < bridge> <Assa> huh screen coordinates are 0 0 0 0
23:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Could also be tile indecies. At the end there should be lots of air
23:41 < bridge> <Assa> no get screens returns 0, 0, 0, 0, even after I directly set MapScreen(0, 0, 1024.0f, 1024.0f);
23:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah I thought you talk about teeros screenshot
