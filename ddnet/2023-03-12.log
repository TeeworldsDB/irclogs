02:54 < bridge> <Mestre Madruga> hmmm i don't know.
02:54 < bridge> <Mestre Madruga> maybe the adms know how to solve it!! :D

04:06 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs Qt
04:07 < bridge> <Ewan> wslg is slow
06:27 < bridge> <Voxel> so the problem was that recently ddnet update that heinrich reverted + the fact i forgot to add linux support to my VS build LOL
06:27 < bridge> <Voxel> it's all good now!
07:03 < bridge> <Voxel> wtf did i do LOLL

07:23 < bridge> <Voxel> For context: I'm reworking the killfeed_crunch thing again. What I'm doing right now is testing if the packet is sending.

07:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What's your Mesa version and what's your hardware?
07:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
07:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But just look here https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/GFX_Troubleshooting
07:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So u didn't do any Client modifications?
08:00 < bridge> <Voxel> No
08:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But can u reproduce
08:42 < bridge> <Voxel> I don't know. I think I might have just did something weird and it's only this client that's like that.
08:43 < bridge> <Voxel> I'll try to reproduce it from square one
08:48 < bridge> <Voxel> wtf
08:48 < bridge> <Voxel> I literally just clone it and CMake runs in the background to compile and build it and everything
08:50 < bridge> <Voxel> Hmm-
08:50 < bridge> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1084382881356447814/image.png
08:54 < bridge> <Voxel> For some reason these aren't being generated. In fact, there isn't even a generated folder at all.

08:57 < bridge> <Voxel> Nevermind, it's in my current client as well.
09:01 < bridge> <Voxel> Nevermind, it's in my current client as well.
09:01 < bridge> <Voxel> I had to reinstall it, so that it fixed itself
09:03 < bridge> <Voxel> Yeah, everything seems to be fixed now. I'm going to try and reproduce everything
09:03 < bridge> <Voxel> Yeah, everything seems to be fixed now. I'm going to try and reproduce everything.
09:03 < bridge> <Voxel> It's nothing in the client, so that's good.
09:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its still weird that this happened, whatever u did server-sided, it should not trigger such problems xd
10:00 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 daily python trivia is this a syntax error? ``2,((2,2) == 2),2``
11:40 < bridge> <Raks> I need some help about host FNG2 server. Anyone could help me?
11:43 < bridge> <Voxel> https://dontasktoask.com/
11:49 < bridge> <Raks> I downloaded the scr and here is the "tutorial how to setup the mod. I translate it and i tryed to make it by myself. In other mods i just downloaded the server.exe and the scr and it worked, But at this FNG2 mod doesnt have server.exe . How can i make server with this mod?

11:51 < bridge> <Raks> The cmake-gui.exe was not there when i downloaded the zip. I made it by myself bc i thought i have to do that.
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u need to use the 0.6 branch anyway
11:54 < bridge> <Raks> The teeworlds version u mean?
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can also simply use pre compiled sources for windows
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://aliveclan.de/download/release/
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 0.6.5 is for ddnet client
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Jupeyy/teeworlds-fng2-mod/tree/fng_06
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is the 0.6 branch
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u want to compile ur own
11:57 < bridge> <Raks> Oh damn i made it thanks

12:37 < bridge> <–°eeper> why can't I log in to my trashmap server

12:39 < bridge> <bencie> any more info? What prevents you from logging on? What error do you get
12:40 < bridge> <–°eeper> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1084440678844596344/image.png
12:40 < bridge> <bencie> Join the one with an ipv4 address
12:41 < bridge> <Chairn> no, it's a tuple (2,False,2)
12:41 < bridge> <–°eeper> I didn't understand
12:42 < bridge> <bencie> You can copy the ipv4 from the trashmap site and `connect x.x.x.x` (replace x with ip) or search for your server and join the one out of 2 that works
12:43 <+ChillerDragon> pro @Chairn
12:44 <+ChillerDragon> u earned the daily python trivia medal
12:44 < bridge> <ReiTW> wasnt hard to guess the tuple
12:44 < bridge> <Learath2> Uuuh, I think it's fine
13:08 < bridge> <Teero> apparently the direction key inputs (for moving left and right) are only updated on press and release. is there a way to change that so they are updated by checking if the key is down instead?
13:10 < bridge> <Teero> apparently the direction key inputs (for moving left and right) are only updated on press and release. is there a way to change that so they are updated by checking if the key is down or up instead?
13:12 <+ChillerDragon> yo gamers i gave the simple proxy that allows client restarts a try
13:12 <+ChillerDragon> og who remembers my message from back in the days https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/irclogs/blob/2f5ae0e87f9f92c75ac8c53ff82a7886b4bab31a/ddnet/2022-06-19.log#L29-L53

13:12 <+ChillerDragon> it was way easier than i thought its literally pasting in a 10 line hello world python proxy and change 1 line to swallow tw disconnect packets
13:34 < bridge> <deen> @heinrich5991  I guess we aren't any further in understanding why Trashmap shows up twice in http master?
13:55 < bridge> <ReiTW> isn't it cuz of ipv6
13:56 < bridge> <ReiTW> it shows 2 entries, one with ipv4 & one with ipv
13:56 < bridge> <ReiTW> it shows 2 entries, one with ipv4 & one with ipv6
13:57 < bridge> <Chairn> it doesn't change anything?
13:58 < bridge> <Teero> doesnt matter anymore. sorry for asking
14:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
15:02 < bridge> <murpi> You're comparing a tuple to an integer in ((2,2) == 2) which would always evaluate to false (ChillerDragon)
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> python god murpi has spoken

15:10 <+ChillerDragon> pro
18:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, the protocol supports servers having both IPv4 and IPv6
18:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they should show as one entry
18:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm going to try to remove backcompat for servers registered at the http masters, this will fix the symptoms
18:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> will result in servers sending invalid json being completely invisible though
18:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we should maybe get some monitoring ^^
