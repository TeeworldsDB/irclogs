03:13 < bridge> <.pet> Ewan Banned...
03:20 < bridge> <Ewan> NOOOOOOOO
06:58 < bridge> <pioooooo> Isn't that a different zoom level?
07:04 < bridge> <Ewan> seems like both
07:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> zoom doesn't affect cursor being sent to the server iirc
08:15 < bridge> <totar> Can someone merge this pls

11:51 < bridge> <zhn> why?
11:52 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> the whole playerbase is gonna use that
11:52 < bridge> <zhn> affects
11:52 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> trust me bro
11:53 < bridge> <zhn> targetxy are scale by zoom level on client side

12:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 hi
12:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless my free package does not include electron development
12:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless how far did you get? did you already try to compile it?
12:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i believe in you! you can do it on your own!
12:24 < bridge> <woidless> 0%
12:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think it's just the cursor stays the same place in screenspace
12:26 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon, I would be able to pay you for the service of creating what I want. But we are in completely different countries
12:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
12:30 < bridge> <woidless> But as far as I understand, only you can do what I want.
12:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @0xdeen no hurry what so ever just wanted to check if you got a notificiation for https://github.com/def-/ddnet/pull/2
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless more people than me can do it. I assume you can not send paypal from russia? If you donate 20 bucks to the russian ddnet servers i will have a look at the electron app.
12:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :pepeW:
12:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't think it is practical to make dyncam in specview
12:44 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311659061519061092/2024-11-28_19-43-51.mp4?ex=6749a931&is=674857b1&hm=7b0e703c6b75e89c8f1f63c1fe6d1260a20a5eaaa2992cdfcc264d03b63d900f&
12:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i got this for spec
12:49 < bridge> <zhn> wdym
12:50 < bridge> <zhn> it just multiplies original targetxy clamped to screenspace to zoom level
12:50 < bridge> <zhn> so it coverts it to world space
12:50 < bridge> <zhn> converts*
12:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye but it stays the same screen position
12:50 < bridge> <zhn> only if you have same screenspace + zoom, no?
12:50 < bridge> <zhn> without clamping
12:51 < bridge> <zhn> and to clamp you have to know zoom level of player
12:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> no?
12:52 < bridge> <zhn> chillerdragon: he can donate to rus servers straight in rubles so yup
12:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089> wait
12:52 < bridge> <zhn> what
12:53 < bridge> <zhn> cursor is world positioned
12:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ok yes, you are right. when was this changed.
12:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> doesn't this mess up antibot
12:53 < bridge> <zhn> it was discussed like thousands of times
12:53 < bridge> <zhn> by fokko me and plenty other guys
12:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :nouis:
12:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> fine
12:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'll give up on this pr for the third time i guess
12:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> <a:EssexLemonEat:909223338528890900>  <- dis me rn with a grilled avocado sandwich
12:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> good mornin
12:54 < bridge> <zhn> gm
12:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't think there is a good way to show cursor then
12:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> for regular player*
12:54 < bridge> <zhn> no why, just do it as you did
12:54 < bridge> <zhn> maybe inputs will change back
12:55 < bridge> <zhn> it broke precision on zooming too
12:55 < bridge> <zhn> so topic is open still
12:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> honestly i kinda want to add an ex to sync zoom and dyncam settings, but player doesnt' even send the raw zoom but the screen size
12:55 < bridge> <zhn> why screen size :justatest:
12:55 < bridge> <zhn> just zoom
12:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> server doesn't seem to have player zoom or i can't find it
12:56 < bridge> <zhn> it doesn't because client doesn't send it
12:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's what i'm saying
12:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
12:56 < bridge> <zhn> so why do you need send screen size instead of zoom
12:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> if server doesn't have it i can't just add an server->client ex to sync it.
12:56 < bridge> <zhn> i don't get it
12:56 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't need that
12:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> server has that and i can't use it
12:57 < bridge> <zhn> client->server ex msg with zoom in it, what's problem
12:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm scared of touching c2s protocol, never done it before
12:57 < bridge> <zhn> :justatest:
12:57 < bridge> <zhn> as you wish
12:57 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
12:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> although syncing zoom and dyncam settings might be funny
12:58 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so you can see who's being a maniac
12:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> using regular dyn max mouse distance and high sens spinning
12:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> since the current one doesn't use any ex protocols, can i pr this and add the sync later?
12:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do people do that?
13:00 < bridge> <zhn> ask heinrich, idk
13:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ah fuck i give up.
13:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> hookcollision has an angle interp which is impossible to match
13:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :pepeW: i don't want people asking why demo in 0.1x shows cursor and hook collision being mismatch
13:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :pepeW: i don't want people asking why demo in 0.1x speed shows cursor and hook collision being mismatch
13:26 < bridge> <oxyzo.> Why demo in 0.1x speed shows cursor and hook collision being mismatchef
13:26 < bridge> <oxyzo.> Why demo in 0.1x speed shows cursor and hook collision being mismatched
13:40 < bridge> <woidless> I have $2, I thought it would be enough
13:40 < bridge> <zhn> xddddddd
13:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> $2 per minute is probably acceptable
13:41 < bridge> <DDNet> This command was not found.
13:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> bad bot

14:45 < bridge> <zhn> yeah looks like what id get used to
14:45 < bridge> <zhn> but im missing that half transparent cursor on overzoom
14:45 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that is true. any idea?
14:47 < bridge> <zhn> you have already implemented it haven't you :p
14:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't understand
14:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
14:47 < bridge> <zhn> that thing hehe
14:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it has that
14:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> let me double check
14:48 < bridge> <zhn> ah ye
14:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1311690215882227733/image.png?ex=6749c635&is=674874b5&hm=ae5731d9ad2b27f1d8b2cdef2a993a693f90a64f3f844fd2832c7fc677512a11&
14:48 < bridge> <zhn> player moves their cursor too fast
14:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> probably not much we can do?
14:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think people will just zoom out to watch
14:49 < bridge> <zhn> yeah same
14:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> alright, i'll try to pr this tonight (in 2 hours maybe)
14:49 < bridge> <zhn> :feelsamazingman:
14:49 < bridge> <zhn> waiting to test it out
14:50 < bridge> <zhn> will be ez to catch zoomers on vani
14:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> well vani doesn't have DDNetCharacter netobj
14:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it needs that
14:50 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :cammo:
14:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and ddnet-pvp is a bit too old to have that too. oof
14:52 < bridge> <tsfreddie> wait, since when can client demo be in free-view
14:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> btw we are still on clang-format 10 right?
14:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> the script is yea
14:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> :suizid:

15:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> just a random chinese gores server, thought the cursor would be more authentic there
15:51 < bridge> <tsfreddie> or athletic i should say
15:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> An athletic cursor?
15:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean.. look at him go

16:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> still have no idea why chiller got so much time
16:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm struggling at life here
16:08 < bridge> <woidless> Who knows if it is possible to make a program so that you can upload a bot to the server and manage it
16:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> do i need to redo ddnet-pvp to compete now
16:09 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
16:10 < bridge> <zhn> yeah its a bit... very outdated :P
16:10 < bridge> <zhn> nah don't try to compete
16:10 < bridge> <zhn> help chiller polishing code
16:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:amogus:876956004674338848> where is my multi map loader
16:11 < bridge> <zhn> yeah, its called ddnet client
16:11 < bridge> <zhn> multimap loader was just teams + one huge map with ol da maps?
16:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> well the end goal was to literally load multiple maps
16:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> the mega map was just for transitioning
16:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> didn't make it
16:12 < bridge> <zhn> you need to do it for ddnet in first i think
16:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but since we have server redirect now, we probably don't need it that much anymore
16:12 < bridge> <zhn> because we have this small little problem with maps
16:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> insta kinda conflict with my design tho, i'm pretty sure i don't want /rank and ddnet's sql queries.
16:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but it's hard to keep it up to date if i changed it too much like ddnet-pvp did
16:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :cammo:
16:14 < bridge> <zhn> let me know if you will hop on ddnet pvp rework
16:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :greenthing: i was planning on doing ddnet stuff every night while working on my own stuff
16:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> but i only got ddnet stuff done today so it might not really be a good idea
16:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :nouis:

17:04 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i still don't know pointers
17:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> They're just funny numbers, what's there to be confused about?
17:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm probably kidding
17:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> just probably tho
17:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> why is `bind lshift+f say hello` not doing anything? i assume because shift opens the emotewheel?
17:14 < bridge> <oxyzo.> left shift and f are in an argument and dont want to work together
17:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> its even funnier because it still doesnt work when unbinding lshift :kekw:
17:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> use `shift+f`; modifiers sadly don't accept specific keys, only the type of modifier
17:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think web modifiers works like that as well
17:50 < bridge> <woidless> What is a Docker file?
17:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's a file used to tell Docker (the software) how to build a container
17:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's a file used to tell Docker (the software) how to build a container image
17:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> a container is a way to isolate some software without running a virtual machine
17:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and a container image is a collection of all the files and software that you have inside this "isolation chamber"
18:00 < bridge> <woidless> thx
18:02 < bridge> <isowner> help pls üò≠
18:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> what do you need that information for.
18:05 < bridge> <zhn> ye, same question
18:12 < bridge> <oxyzo.> maybe hes trying something like self kill when frozen :greenthing:
19:11 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon https://github.com/k-i-o/CChat.TW created on kisao.This was confirmed to me by the TeeSports coder
19:12 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon https://github.com/k-i-o/CChat.TW  did not create kisao.This was confirmed to me by the TeeSports coder
19:16 < bridge> <kebscs> @tsfreddie with dyncam and non default zoom, the cursor is slightly off
19:16 < bridge> <kebscs> but other than than works and looks very nice üëç

19:19 < bridge> <kebscs> same with cl_spec_cursor_interp 0
19:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oof. i'll check tomorrow
19:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> is it possible that dyncam cursor position isn't sending to server the sameV
19:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like the dyncam cursor is actually different than the position sent to server?
19:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> is it possible that dyncam cursor position isn't sending to server the same
19:35 < bridge> <kebscs> maybe its getting scaled incorrectly by zoom
19:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> anyway i need some sleep, ill check tomorow:justatest:
19:36 < bridge> <kebscs> doesnt happen on default zoom, but bigger the zoom, bigger the gap in spec cursor
19:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> cuz local cursor is indeed screenspace. no idea why we decided to send cursor position in worldspace
19:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that involves two different conversion doing different things for the same position which is weird.
19:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it is possible that i just did something wrong tho

20:08 < bridge> <teero777> what language are you gonna do?
20:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> this https://ocaml.org/
20:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> i'll try to do what i can using nixlang :greenthing:
20:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I've never bothered to actually complete AoC
20:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'll miss a few days and then not feel like catching up and suddenly I'm a week behind oops
20:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> well thats everyone
20:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i don't have time
20:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> thank god I thought I'd be feeling so insufficient next to you productive people
20:15 < bridge> <learath2> LOL, this is what happens to me every time. I get to like day 6, miss a couple, then don't feel like catching up
20:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Last year (or was it the year before?) I tried to get some of my friends who "wanted to learn programming" to do AoC with me
20:16 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> like I could teach them when they got stuck on a problem or something
20:16 < bridge> <teero777> i can guess what happened xd
20:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah they did like the first two days and despite me pestering them repeatedly they just kinda stopped doing them
20:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so much for wanting to learn I guess
20:17 < bridge> <learath2> AoC might be too hard for someone that wants to learn
20:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> Advent of code is not really learning a language
20:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> Advent of code is not really for learning a language
20:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> me and furo benchmarked the first few days in different languages :kek:
20:18 < bridge> <learath2> I have trouble with some problems as someone who isn't learning a language
20:18 < bridge> <learath2> I have trouble with some problems as someone who isn't learning programming
20:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> hold on let me hand vectorize this
20:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah but even a newbie shouldn't be quitting before the end of the first week
20:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it wasn't even that they struggled, they just couldn't bother

20:23 < bridge> <melo∆û> ngl, as someone who is just learning a language this is pretty tough
20:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> it is not bad
20:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill learn more ocaml with it
20:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> but you know how to combine the first and last found digit in a string in other languages already
20:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> you just adapt it to the ocaml syntax really
20:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I guess, but it's not like they were just learning the very basics of the syntax
20:26 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> And especially with some guidance this should be a pretty simple lesson
20:26 < bridge> <melo∆û> wait let me see if i can do this in zig
20:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I guess in some high level languages where strings are all special it can be annoying to iterate over the characters of a string, which is a bit wild
20:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Surely the correct solution involves regex :P
20:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> a regex would be a ``""little""`` overengineered no? :kek:
20:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> but if you manage to write a regex without AI - you get that point
20:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm just joking about some languages where the easiest way to get characters out of a string is with the built-in substring method or whatever
20:30 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I swear I had that issue in some scripting language
20:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> in zig i think i'll just setup a buffer reader and read every line
20:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> let me cook :kekw:
20:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh yeah it was Lua
20:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> not so based anymore... :frozen:
20:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> can't index strings like arrays because lua doesn't actually have arrays
20:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> zig is a really nice language but damn it looks ugly as hell :kekw:
20:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
20:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> today i learned
20:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
20:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> `buf_reader.reader().readUntilDelimiterOrEof()` exists

20:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> maybe time spent on waiting for the zig compiler to initialize and realize that there's nothing to do but run the program shouldn't be counted

21:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> am i the only one that gets triggered when they read "java scripts"
21:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> A script written in Java, what's the problem?
21:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm cooking up something hideous right now <3
22:14 < bridge> <teero777> recursion is bad tho
22:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> cries in `infinite recursion occured`
22:18 < bridge> <melo∆û> any antivirus program you use outside of windows defender?
22:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> or a VPN/tunneling service?
22:24 < bridge> <totar> This error happens on ger10 pretty often for me
22:27 < bridge> <chairn> why though ?
22:27 < bridge> <chairn> it's really well suited for some problems
22:27 < bridge> <teero777> using an iterative approach faster 99% of times.
22:28 < bridge> <teero777> and if you have a big tree for example you're gonna run into stackoverflows really quick
22:29 < bridge> <chairn> ulimit -s inf
22:29 < bridge> <teero777> xD
22:30 < bridge> <teero777> just doing the same thing iteratively is exponentially faster based on the size of the tree than traversing it recursively.
22:32 < bridge> <x0r0711> No, I don't use an other antivirus programm#
22:32 < bridge> <teero777> depends on how deep the tree is tho*
22:32 < bridge> <teero777> also it is a nightmare to debug if your stacktrace is 1000 lines long
22:34 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm sorry

22:35 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm not very good at Haskell since I barely ever use it, but it's a *really* funny language
22:36 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm sure a *real* Haskell programmer would get this down to something way shorter
22:38 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Part of my goal here was of course not using any named variables
22:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh I'm dumb
22:40 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> there's `isDigit`

22:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```
22:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> already way prettier
22:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```hs

22:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ```
22:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> already way prettier, but sadly needs a second import
22:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> tai call opt is nice
22:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> it prevents that
22:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> tail recursion is divine

22:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> What do you think of my art piece? Can you improve on it?
22:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ohh we need a solution in APL
22:54 < bridge> <aegisub> If your program isn't fully eta reduced are you really trying
22:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I don't even know what this means but I'll be sure to read about it
22:55 < bridge> <aegisub> just fancy language for what you said
22:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> :lol:
22:56 < bridge> <aegisub> eta reduction is turning e.g.
22:56 < bridge> <aegisub> \x -> elem 1 x
22:56 < bridge> <aegisub> into
