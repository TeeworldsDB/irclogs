07:42 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 imo the non teeworlds "run server" icon is noticible breaking style
07:42 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1704004917.png
07:46 < ChillerDragon> and ofc the KOG logo in the browser https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1704005171.png
07:50 < ChillerDragon> oh and when you only play run like fudgy does it teeworlds client is nice since it has native race support
07:50 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1704005383.png
07:50 < ChillerDragon> a dedicated timer not messing with the gametimer
07:50 < bridge> <Ewan> that's neat but unique race does something else
07:51 < ChillerDragon> not sure if ddnet client can show such a high precision on times there might be a setting for it
07:51 < ChillerDragon> thanks to furo ddnet now has all the other 0.7 niceties such as finish msgs 
07:52 < bridge> <Ewan> toggles

07:59 < ChillerDragon> how does china man have 50 ping
08:00 < bridge> <Ewan> immigration
08:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> totally worth to migrate to another ping zone
08:00 < bridge> <Ewan> lol i mean
08:00 < bridge> <Ewan> he already lived in the usa
08:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ test5 2 months ago?! 
08:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1704006172.png
08:05 < bridge> <Ewan> what is it
08:05 < bridge> <Ewan> pg rated ddnet?
08:06 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet with NO GUNS
08:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no its ddnet written in pure postgresql
08:10 < ChillerDragon> jk its jopstis ddnet2 project he talks about all the time
08:11 < ChillerDragon> blazingly moddable pvp gameplay first rewritten from scratch teeworlds client written in badass rust
08:11 < ChillerDragon> and pg stands for playground since it is highly experimental and work in progress
08:13 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
08:13 < bridge> <Ewan> what about fred's thing
08:13 < bridge> <Ewan> not the first time i heard about a modular tw server
08:14 < ChillerDragon> yea my sentence misses punctuation
08:14 < ChillerDragon> "pvp gameplay first"
08:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i believe fred's is also pvp oriented
08:15 < ChillerDragon> it has no ddrace support so the "dd" and "ddnet2" is highly misleading. It was a marketing decison since "teeworlds2" does not look as cool according to jopsti
08:15 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
08:15 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
08:18 < ChillerDragon> @avolicious did you realize that the heated 1 week ongoing discussion at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7699 is happening without deen?
08:18 < ChillerDragon> publishing your code does not mean you have to be assed with every single pr
08:18 < ChillerDragon> or issue
08:19 < ChillerDragon> also its not only deen who is explaining ppl how to fix shit in the #questions and #bugs channel
08:19 < ChillerDragon> you do not need to have time to open source some yamls
08:20 < ChillerDragon> you need time if you want to actively support your users yes. But that is imo not a requirement for it to be open source. Id argue it is open source as soon as the source is open as in readable to everyone.

08:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> axaxax ofc i sneaked block gameplay in
08:53 < bridge> <Ewan> Lol
08:53 < bridge> <Ewan> this is such a troll part
08:53 < bridge> <Ewan> but we are getting laser
09:01 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> why c++ is so goofy-ass that won't even print cyrillic normally on windows?
09:01 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
09:01 < bridge> <Ewan> use wide chars
09:02 < bridge> <Ewan> or utf 8
09:02 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> i tried...
09:02 < bridge> <Ewan> how so
09:04 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> well, i tried this, and also `SetConsoleCP(1251)` and it still prints garbage

09:07 < bridge> <learath2> Is this in teeworlds code? We should be handling unicode properly already when printed through dbg_msg. Windows console is a disgusting beast. A patchwork abomination
09:08 < bridge> <Ewan> looks standalone
09:08 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> It's not, i just consider you as good samaritans who would help with general c++ problems 👉 👈
09:09 < bridge> <Ewan> this seems like a cmd issue
09:09 < bridge> <Ewan> which shell is clion using
09:09 < bridge> <learath2> Does your locale support russian?
09:09 < bridge> <Ewan> u can try `cmd /u` iirc
09:10 < bridge> <Ewan> or chcp something something
09:10 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> yeah, system itself is in russian
09:10 < bridge> <Ewan> im just gonna google it
09:10 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2849010/output-unicode-to-console-using-c-in-windows>
09:11 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly, I never figured out how to make windows do the right thing by sticking to the standard. We just use `WriteConsoleW`
09:12 < bridge> <Ewan> it's baffling that wcout is not enough
09:12 < bridge> <Ewan> typical windows shenanigans
09:14 < bridge> <learath2> I remember reading that it works on newer windows if you change the codepage of the wcout stream itself
09:14 < bridge> <Ewan> did u read the SO answer
09:14 < bridge> <Ewan> give `_setmode(_fileno(stdout), _O_U16TEXT);` a shot
09:14 < bridge> <learath2> Try `wcout.imbue()` after your setlocale
09:15 < bridge> <Ewan> dont u need locale param for that
09:17 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> xd
09:17 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1190931763481026593/image.png?ex=65a398a2&is=659123a2&hm=36e5f6d85a55f5ac29519d16ddaa70cc417af663461e1b88076d7922b04be87f&
09:17 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> it actually happens when i use default cout, and it also doesnt print it
09:17 < bridge> <Ewan> erm
09:18 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> didnt work
09:18 < bridge> <learath2> This also might help
09:18 < bridge> <Ewan> may work on older windows as well
09:18 < bridge> <learath2> Do you still have the Ls before the string literals?
09:19 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> yeah
09:19 < bridge> <learath2> Comment out the cout maybe and just try wcout
09:20 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> yeah, i triend and it still prints this...
09:20 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1190932462411464715/image.png?ex=65a39949&is=65912449&hm=0a2582292fa1cd2114c774b6ce2d4e64317555f3f92e11d9f12ccc8fc8965687&

09:21 < bridge> <learath2> Allah willing one day windows console will support unicode without this mess
09:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> isnt hui ruski for dick?
09:21 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> yeah, its most common test word i guess
09:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
09:21 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> first thing that comes to mind :owo:
09:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lmao
09:21 < bridge> <learath2> Are you doing setlocale still?
09:21 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> mhm
09:23 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> i just will try to use WriteConsoleW
09:24 < bridge> <Ewan> ill look once i die again
09:24 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> maybe make every output via my custom class :monkaStop:
09:24 < bridge> <Ewan> currently skipping
09:24 < bridge> <learath2> Can you give me the string you are trying to print?
09:24 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> `server хуй`
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan> 
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan> int main()
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan> {
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan>     //    setlocale(LC_ALL, "Russian");
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan>     _setmode(_fileno(stdout), _O_U16TEXT);
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan>     
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan>     //    wcout.imbue(std::locale());
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan>     wprintf(L"server хуй\n");
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan> 
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan>     //    wcout << L"server хуй" << endl;
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan> 
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan>     //    std::cout << "e" << std::endl;
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan>     return 0;
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan> }
09:29 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
09:30 < bridge> <Ewan> the following works for me
09:30 < bridge> <Ewan> but not wcout
09:30 < bridge> <learath2> Common C W
09:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Dragonball you still here?
09:33 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> doesnt for me
09:33 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> im cursed i guess
09:33 < bridge> <learath2> Btw just don’t ever mix cout and wcout
09:34 < bridge> <learath2> Have you tried on just a plain cmd?
09:34 < bridge> <learath2> IDEs sometimes do bizarre stuff to their terminals
09:35 < bridge> <Ewan> oh yeah i was using mintty with fish not cmd ^^
09:35 < bridge> <learath2> Anyways, IMO just never use `wchar`s
09:36 < bridge> <learath2> Windows is an oddball that hasn’t supported utf8 properly ever. Just do utf8 on all platforms and output utf16 to windows consoles
09:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: chillerdragonball you still online?
09:37 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> yep
09:38 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> i used ```
09:38 < bridge> <Anime.pdf>     SetConsoleCP(65001);
09:38 < bridge> <Anime.pdf>     SetConsoleOutputCP(65001);```
09:38 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> and it just kinda started working, but smh i get gibberish on error handling

09:38 < bridge> <Ewan> lol now runtime is using the wrong locale
09:38 < bridge> <Ewan> oih maybe i misunderstood
09:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> omg chillerdragon i have that desire to open github issues to ping you
09:41 < bridge> <Ewan> @animepdf it might be `cmd /U` :x
09:41 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> nah, printing cyrillic with cout works fine
09:42 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> so its something with i have no clue what
09:42 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> but not console already
09:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> try test6, also do rustup update before
09:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
09:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> instructions from root dir:

09:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
09:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then check against tw 0.7
09:42 < bridge> <learath2> ^^
09:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and if i don't win, kill me
09:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> test
09:43 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> i kinda love windows, but i kinda hate developing anything under windows
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what kind of love do you feel for windows?
09:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I use gentoo btw
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what kind of love do you feel for gentoo
09:45 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> i dont have to start terminal to do 99.9% of tasks
09:45 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> and i cant delete system
09:45 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> by accident
09:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I have to start terminal to do 99.9% of tasks
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> when was the last time you used a linux that is targeted for "normal" ppl?
09:46 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> also adobe stuff is kinda nice
09:46 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> i used fedora
09:46 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> mainly
09:46 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> for almost 2 years
09:46 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> it was nice
09:46 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> but terminal needed for at least 50% of tasks
09:46 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> and smth breaks
09:46 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> constantly
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's simply not true xD
09:47 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> or needs additional setting up
09:47 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> that's my honest user experience :justatest:
09:47 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> developing experience is 100% positive tho
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i gave ubuntu with gnome to ppl that i consider complete noives with computer.
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's still easier than windows, bcs the ui is so slim and can't do anything useful, and the store is basically like stores for mobile phones
09:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd claim ubuntu is easier than windows, if you don't do anything customizable
09:49 < bridge> <Ewan> jupstar come play springlobe 3 swap this guy
09:49 < bridge> <Ewan> the's leaving
09:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i go take a shower now, then eat, then dunno
09:49 < bridge> <Ewan> nooo
09:49 < bridge> <Ewan> he's leaving soon
09:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then tell him good bye from me
09:49 < bridge> <Ewan> :c
09:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> What os u use?
09:49 < bridge> <Ewan> debian
09:50 < bridge> <Ewan> almost typed devuan just thanks to fat fingers
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i use debian with KDE
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i use debian bcs: i don't want to self compile as much as possible
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u give me a faster alternative with similar amount of pre compiled packages, i'd use that
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but arch has WAY too many AUR packages
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and gentoo is nogo for me xd
09:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I love updating packages for 6 hours. I have much time to think bout life and such
09:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i want it simple and still powerful xd
09:51 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> debian is based
09:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> To have dev role any commit has to be merged or only useful for ddnet client one :justatest:
09:55 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> lynn had dev role after commiting "changing comments in code to gender-neutral" or smth like that
09:55 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> :greenthing:
09:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
09:58 < bridge> <Ewan> when's ur shower man
09:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> So i can commit use capital letters at the beginning of the sentences and will be a dev
09:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Gud
09:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Now, wanna join?

10:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> How secure is uploading a .kdbx file on GitHub with ~30 chars master password :thonk:
10:01 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> :justatest:
10:01 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean
10:01 < bridge> <Ewan> very secure
10:01 < bridge> <Ewan> but less secure than not uploading it
10:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I think if i don't upload it somewhere ill lose it eventually
10:03 < bridge> <Ewan> why github
10:03 < bridge> <Ewan> and not private drive or smth
10:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The biggest problem is that it has to timeout. So you can brutally brute force it

10:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Imagine someone spending time to get MilkeeyCat's passwords
10:27 < bridge> <louis> thought she made some web changes
10:31 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> i followed only main repo changes ngl
10:32 < bridge> <louis> that being said pls send dev role 🥺

10:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That works better than pinging in this channel. Because i have no notifications for this channel. I have github mobile notfications active. Feel free to create issues here to ping me https://github.com/ChillerDragon/github-meta
10:33 < bridge> <Ewan> how was ur shower jupstar
10:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Use nixOS
10:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> In 5yrs a 12yo skid with quantom phone can crack it in 60 seconds
10:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sefa: @scrumplex help sell nix. You said something about binaries. With jopsti you have potential customer
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragonball: did u test now?
10:39 < bridge> <Ewan> nix rocks
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nix is german for nothing
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so u said nothing rocks
10:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
10:40 < bridge> <learath2> Does this not use a slow kdf?Z
10:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: what did i do to those 12yo kiddos 😦
10:41 < bridge> <learath2> Actually bruteforcing the 256 bits that make up the actual encryption key should be of no concern, it won’t happen in the lifetime of our universe unless aes has a secret weakness
10:42 < bridge> <teero777> def inaccurate xdd
10:42 < bridge> <teero777> i think this is ok website
10:42 < bridge> <teero777> https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/
10:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what i meant is, there is no limit of parallelization
10:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> additionally he already said the pw is 30 chars xd
10:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1190953269523120160/image.png?ex=65a3acaa&is=659137aa&hm=42c188464d6315795eb75bf859a7f208801a1d2efefd39503f99f03cdf41f049&
10:43 < bridge> <teero777> wtf
10:43 < bridge> <teero777> what is your pass?
10:43 < bridge> <Ewan> yes pls tell me ur password
10:43 < bridge> <learath2> I mean with a kdf even if you were to massively parallelize it will be agonizingly slow
10:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i mean i wont expect him to get hacked anyway, bcs he has no money 😏
10:44 < bridge> <learath2> Tru
10:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how to write ` in between two other ?
10:44 < bridge> <teero777> ´wat?´
10:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im in da zoo
10:44 < bridge> <teero777> `wat?`
10:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 6lX5}506jKoPT|[_`G82^SKaO?)t:;
10:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Didnt bring laptop
10:45 < bridge> <teero777> hope you dont have it memorized
10:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf, stop zoos
10:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> evil
10:45 < bridge> <teero777> you see ape?
10:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ? Watafak u talkin
10:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ill generate new and will memorize it 😬
10:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes i see ape
10:45 < bridge> <teero777> no no dont generate new
10:46 < bridge> <teero777> current is ok!
10:46 < bridge> <teero777> 🐒
10:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: u were saying that 12yo kids with quantom phone can crack my password in 60 seconds
10:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> A those. Ye they just bored and want to steal your coin
10:46 < bridge> <learath2> Wasn't it pretty much settled that passphrases are better than random passwords and are infinitely more memorizable
10:47 < bridge> <teero777> just memorize the page number of a dictionary and then thats your pass
10:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillderdragon: they better to and hack yter first https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/ansible/tree/master/auth_codes
10:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How do you remember that? You type it manually?
10:48 < bridge> <teero777> german words also help
10:49 < bridge> <teero777> they are in no crack dictionary
10:49 < bridge> <teero777> xd
10:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> why not :justatest:
10:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There are better langs than ger for passwords
10:50 < bridge> <learath2> Sprinkle in just a couple special characters in there and it should be impossible to bruteforce in any sane timeframe
10:50 < bridge> <teero777> whats the lowest amount of chars you go that are centuries safe?
10:51 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1190955299369132094/image.png?ex=65a3ae8e&is=6591398e&hm=ab671e82dbfc53bf908f535ddaa5ed3695ff085fc34aff44b71bd78eb92a44bb&
10:51 < bridge> <robyt3> What's a character?
10:52 < bridge> <robyt3> You mean bytes in UTF-8 or what exactly are we counting? `ö` = 2 bytes
10:52 < bridge> <teero777> a
10:52 < bridge> <teero777> is a character
10:53 < bridge> <teero777> æ is also a character
10:53 < bridge> <teero777> okay website inaccurate xd
10:53 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1190955851243077694/image.png?ex=65a3af11&is=65913a11&hm=153725265ef4b5af6ece9728535a5640f47e89ccc56b21f8cc79277ad14026ac&
10:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> u can also add emojis in passwords 😬
10:56 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1190956712488869938/image.png?ex=65a3afdf&is=65913adf&hm=94d0c551cfe82c115fb40b9f2782d8eaa3c3497da0b8b4041b294846e1c7d6eb&
10:57 < bridge> <teero777> hmm yes very easy to crack
10:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Dude milkeey how do you remember that password?? tell me!! Do you enter such a beast by hand?!
10:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Everytime you need to access a pw
10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> maybe a crack-like emoji is harder to crack:
10:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 💊
10:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
10:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> can i use an image like a file needed to open keepass database :justatest:
10:59 < bridge> <teero777> no it seems not
11:00 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1190957519628144660/image.png?ex=65a3b09f&is=65913b9f&hm=58238c51063bac47036b26ec90de87b3b124a8ccb5c328ea4b1a331c484b76dd&
11:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can base64 any image
11:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Thats actaully a cool idea
11:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Imagine you use a publicly available image as pass
11:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillderdragon: YEP
11:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Then you just need access to a base64 tool
11:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> thats what ive thought about
11:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sounds good to me
11:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Dude thats genius
11:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I might do that
11:01 < bridge> <teero777> yea just drag and drop your pass image straight into that tty0
11:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so take img of this:
11:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1190958253035761684/image.png?ex=65a3b14e&is=65913c4e&hm=d76ee025af52b3e67010d75869dd4808dc1d6c7dca7e17efd22109d5433b964a&
11:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> encode as base64
11:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then u have strong PW?
11:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Its not very unique image
11:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Better use something that is not a standard emoji
11:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it has a very small white thing on top
11:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and it has grey background like discord
11:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Maybe instagram pic of your favrite tiktoker
11:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i want to see you cracking it xd
11:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Then it suddenly is behind auth wall and you need the image to auth
11:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> gg
11:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it works with .jpg as well :justatest:
11:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1190958657148555344/image.png?ex=65a3b1ae&is=65913cae&hm=9cc3f1f13b92eff450afa9275b022de4a11eef87fc4eaedd8f27f628773847bc&
11:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Dude imagine you can just auth on any airport pc with a fakin 512 long password from duckduckgo images in 2 seconds
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dragon: can u pls stop zoosing
11:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am in a mall now
11:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok i put phone away ill test ur stuff later
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ping me
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else i overread
11:06 < bridge> <robyt3> https://xkcd.com/1683/
11:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lmao yea then you are fucked. It has to be some statically served source. I assume the ddnet logo would be a good candidate. Or any png file tracked in the Git history of a big enough project
11:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: tee skin
11:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Could also base64 encode or shasum a specific code file
11:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Heck or use straight up commit hashes
11:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Guys please never try to login to my instagram with the 0.7 commit hash
11:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillderdragon: so u wanna use it as passwords for websites, not as a pass for a program which gives you access to other passwords?
11:16 < bridge> <Ewan> who made this bullshit
11:16 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1190961599473795092/image.png?ex=65a3b46c&is=65913f6c&hm=dd7be8e9c350b49b0aff7f8619ec03f70a10be72dd6cb846d1ae8b3885276376&

11:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No as password manager password i guess
11:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> oh oke
11:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And then publisj the password manager data
11:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Publish it as image ofc
11:22 < bridge> <avolicious> But as I said, if we would open source the gameserver itself, we would have to open source all other moving parts aswell, because without them, KoG doesnt run
11:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
11:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I was talking abljt tjat avo
11:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Publish everything wjere is the issue ?
11:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @avolicious
11:25 < bridge> <avolicious> I am not going to open source my terraform and ansible files
11:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why???
11:25 < bridge> <scrumplex> NixOS is cool indeed! But Jupstar said that it should be simple and powerful. I don't think that's the case with NixOS
11:25 < bridge> <scrumplex> (It's quite complex)
11:25 < bridge> <avolicious> To complex for people to adopt
11:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Dont worr ablut that
11:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Jzst publish it
11:26 < bridge> <avolicious> I do worry about that
11:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And dont explain and support it
11:26 < bridge> <avolicious> xD
11:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why do yoz worry ablut that
11:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just clikc the one toggle from private to public and call it done
11:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I dont see a problem
11:26 < bridge> <avolicious> Imagine you go to a store and buy something, after you get the item you received the seller doesnt answer any question anymore but he is the only one who understands how things work
11:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You dont buy open dource
11:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It free
11:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ^
11:27 < bridge> <avolicious> No, open source comes with active maintenance, support and other important parts
11:27 < bridge> <avolicious> its not free
11:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @avolicious you shouldn't fear that your code is too bad to publish.
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We've all written and seen worse code,  no matter what 😉
11:27 < bridge> <avolicious> Yes
11:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Then dont open src
11:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just publish the code
11:28 < bridge> <avolicious> It is actually that bad, that we dont use mysql anymore 😦
11:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> u use webscale mongodb?
11:29 < bridge> <avolicious> No, we export data via protobuf and in our event-driven backend it will be inserted/selected from/into cockroachdb
11:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How would you call it if there is just public code and nothing else? Just do that
11:30 < bridge> <Ewan> :troll:
11:30 < bridge> <avolicious> I would call it bad experience, because if I do have questions who to ask for?
11:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ask you
11:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You say i dont answer
11:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Done
11:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I do the same for chillerbot half of the time
11:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> he just puts excuses
11:35 < bridge> <avolicious> You are right, I fear the time after being open source
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know, nothing to fear
11:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i think with this proposition you literally have to provide zero code maintenance beyond what you'd do close source
11:35 < bridge> <Ewan> let your code be shitty in public
11:35 < bridge> <Ewan> it's already shitty in private
11:36 < bridge> <Ewan> and then at least ur players can have some peace of mind
11:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also know many devs dont use gpl because they think their code will be used by some company and get rich but the only thing it happens is the company gets rich
11:36 < bridge> <avolicious> Oh wow, so now you say that ddnet devs do shitty code? 👀
11:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why?
11:36 < bridge> <Ewan> everyone does sometimes. but not that's not what i was saying
11:36 < bridge> <avolicious> Well, we just removed parts from ddnet and replace them with event-driven features. So its mostly your code
11:37 < bridge> <avolicious> Well, we just removed parts from ddnet and replace them with event-driven features. So its mostly your(ddnets) code
11:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought with this u were onboard with ur code sucking
11:38 < bridge> <Ewan> not trying to get into a catfight about how bad ur code is when we cant even see it
11:38 < bridge> <Ewan> if hypothetically it was bad code
11:38 < bridge> <Ewan> it would still be bad code behind closed doors
11:38 < bridge> <avolicious> You can read it for sure, but you cant use it without setting up all needed microservices
11:40 < bridge> <avolicious> Anyways, you can host our maps on normal ddnet servers too. The most important feature to use `sv_no_weak_hook`
11:41 < bridge> <Ewan> yea rly wondering why springlobe 3 doesn't have that on rn
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf is wrong with tunezone prediction using jetpack on springlobe 3 xD

11:51 < bridge> <Ewan> true
11:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea im giving up on the dicussion. @avolicious i feel like you do not want to go open source.
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just upload source.tar.gz in this channel
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then u dont need to maintain
12:09 < bridge> <Ewan> ☹️

12:24 < bridge> <Ewan> he did that on 30000 ping and I don’t think arrows are predicted
12:24 < bridge> <Ewan> he had a little tussle with some
12:24 < bridge> <Ewan> but lived
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they are predicted
12:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i touched them on one part, but it had enough time to react
12:26 < bridge> <Ewan> when i touch them when lagging it feels like they aren’t
12:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i played spongebob 2 in china
12:26 < bridge> <Ewan> that was not fun

13:12 < bridge> <learath2> I almost installed systemd :hypervomit: on my computer
13:13 < bridge> <learath2> I forgot archlinux does not respect it’s users enough to let them pick their own init system and makes the choice for them, the wrong choice at that
13:13 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
13:13 < bridge> <Ewan> u can use non systemd init systems on arch?
13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 stop
13:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> go back to gentoo
13:14 < bridge> <learath2> No, sadly systemd is a parasitic disease, it infects all other software so that any attempt to run a systemd free arch is impossible
13:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i quite like systemd
13:15 < bridge> <learath2> But alas it’s not hopeless, the guys at artix linux provide a un-systemdified version of it
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i once argued vs a systemd guy
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> he brought up the problem with PID files on openrc
13:15 < bridge> <learath2> This sad excuse for a computer can’t compile it’s own packages sadly
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 cant u use ur main computer or smth
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> distcc
13:16 < bridge> <learath2> My main computer is a thousand km away
13:16 < bridge> <learath2> He googled that just to have something to say. Pidfile races are exceedingly rare, it’s like saying systemd can crash if a cosmic ray caused a bitflip in the right place
13:21 < bridge> <learath2> The proper proper way to do this is to have a supervisor. That’s not how systemd does it either btw
13:22 < bridge> <learath2> But ofc that’s not a problem, these people enchanted by Poettering will go to insane mental gymnastics to excuse any issue in systemd
