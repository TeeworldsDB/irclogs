00:47 < ChillerDragon> wtf juspatr you really do a bridge?
01:06 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> what bridge
01:06 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> how big is the bridge
01:06 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> what location
01:06 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> in what city
01:48 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Didn’t ddnet break demo compat beyond repair anyways?
01:49 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh I haven't been around long enough to know about that
02:07 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Im not super sure but I remember some incompatibles
02:54 < bridge_> <StormA, Sovereign of chilling> poor risu
02:55 < bridge_> <StormA, Sovereign of chilling> 24/7 in timeout
04:11 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> bad risu
08:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Chill yeah
09:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what happened
09:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Nothing, why
09:58 < bridge_> <meloƞ> @jupeyy_keks i love you
09:58 < bridge_> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1365597880311742464/image.png?ex=680de3a2&is=680c9222&hm=0c5cefe57ee253e3cc86e84d52c80ed23042029376e962db899e9f60d37a3d19&
09:58 < bridge_> <meloƞ> this is so cool :owo:
09:59 < bridge_> <TsFredium> eww
09:59 < bridge_> <meloƞ> how can you say that!
09:59 < bridge_> <meloƞ> 
09:59 < bridge_> <meloƞ> ddnet-rs on a ddnet server :owo:
10:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> :deen_star:
10:04 < bridge_> <zerolacqua> cooool!
10:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Do you know someone that uses a bot tho? XD
10:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno why that msg is sent to me xd
10:06 < bridge_> <totar> wait since when is ddnet-rs compatable with 0.6?
10:06 < bridge_> <totar> is that new?
10:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, since yesterday
10:08 < bridge_> <totar> nice
10:09 < bridge_> <totar> was it hard
10:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I am surprised how much less information ddnet has for prediction
10:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Well currntly the ddos protected servers still make trouble since libtw2, which I use, does not support the reconnect token
10:10 < bridge_> <totar> what's missing?
10:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the easiest example is laser, it's missing like almost anything.
10:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
10:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> The client could not tell how much energy from a laser is left for example
10:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and the vanilla snapshots are missing owners of projectiles etc.
10:14 < bridge_> <totar> do you mean actual laser or the 6 other entities that look like laser
10:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the actual, but the others are a good example too. i think it _could_ make sense to have proper snaps for every type of it
10:15 < bridge_> <totar> it would yeah
10:46 < bridge_> <robyt3> It's sent to every joining client, you are expected to ignore chat messages without valid client
10:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Oh yeah makes sense ig, I'll try to ignore it 😄
11:07 < bridge_> <Assa> is and std::vector<bool> bitwise? I wonder why the code feels so much faster compared to a bool array
11:08 < bridge_> <Assa> oh good morning 😄
11:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it is
11:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It's a special case in cpp
11:09 < bridge_> <Assa> oh explains why .data() didn't work
11:09 < bridge_> <Assa> and explains the speed improvement ^.^
11:12 < bridge_> <kebscs> Use std bitset
11:12 < bridge_> <kebscs> Or maybe it auto changes to that as you say special case
11:28 < bridge_> <totar> it's crazy the cpp committee decided to make a special case for vector<bool> instead of just making std::dynamic_bitset or something.
11:29 < bridge_> <totar> so now if you actually want a dynamic bitset you need to use janky vector<bool>
11:30 < bridge_> <totar> so now if you actually want a resizable bitset you need to use janky vector<bool>
11:49 < bridge_> <learath2> It's also annoying to create a "real" vector of bools 😄
11:50 < bridge_> <totar> vector<byte> is not acceptable?
11:50 < bridge_> <learath2> I had an issue with a templated class that contained a `std::vector<T>` that broke for `T = bool`
11:50 < bridge_> <totar> ah
11:50 < bridge_> <totar> yeah
11:51 < bridge_> <learath2> Ended up wrapping the T and hoping the compiler saw through the wrapping
11:51 < bridge_> <totar> it's bad even if you want to use it for what it is too because the vector api is much worse than what you'd actually want for a bitset
11:52 < bridge_> <totar> I had to write my own dynamic_bitset instead of using vector<bool> the one time I actually needed it
11:52 < bridge_> <learath2> Overall, godawful decision by the std committee
11:59 < bridge_> <kebscs> "It was a design mistake in C++98, now retained for compatibility." from stack overflow :kek:
12:17 < bridge_> <robyt3> With some adjustments the demo player can also correctly play demos that are still being recorded, also works with multiple clients playing the same demo. CC #10114 @sollybunny

12:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lel, demo live stream
12:28 < bridge_> <jxsl13> playing server side demos live :poggers2:
12:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> apropos
12:30 < bridge_> <Assa> I think it's done for the "dummies", so that this special case works  somewhat efficient even if you're not a C++ expert
12:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> do we have a tool that can stream demos from a server to a client?
12:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then I'd have a demo to ddnet-rs converter xdd
12:31 < bridge_> <ljpb> i can't connect to server
12:31 < bridge_> <ljpb> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1365636334810697882/image.png?ex=680e0772&is=680cb5f2&hm=c227b9b343d776e4baa3f1762def70755fbf2374ee2c0a9c2852c23fb0516976&
12:31 < bridge_> <ljpb> help
12:31 < bridge_> <jxsl13> what server and what client version
12:32 < bridge_> <Assa> Then you could add a TV player to your client and just watch a tournament?
12:32 < bridge_> <jxsl13> as well as what protocol version?
12:32 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> This wouldn't work under windows due to files only being able to have 1 handle right
12:32 < bridge_> <ljpb> f-ddrace server
12:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then i could export demos in 4k, bcs of offscreen rendering support
12:32 < bridge_> <robyt3> This is on Windows
12:32 < bridge_> <ljpb> 25.3 kind of
12:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But without proper prediction it will suck anyway
12:32 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> How can this be?
12:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that's just fair to say xD
12:32 < bridge_> <Assa> What I mean, this would have some serious implications into the esports direction
12:33 < bridge_> <Assa> Like in CS you have a GoTV and can watch tournaments over it
12:33 < bridge_> <Assa> meaning they are live-streamed
12:33 < bridge_> <robyt3> You can open the same file multiple times but you need to set the correct flags
12:33 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> I see
12:34 < bridge_> <ljpb> the firewall is open, I have opened port 8303
12:34 < bridge_> <robyt3> That's why `io_open` on Windows needs 35 lines of code :justatest:
12:35 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> Lovely
12:35 < bridge_> <jxsl13> what client do you use?
12:38 < bridge_> <jxsl13> according to the github, it should work with 0.7 and 0.6 protocol versions
12:38 < bridge_> <jxsl13> according to the github repo, it should work with 0.7 and 0.6 protocol versions
12:38 < bridge_> <ljpb> i used Nightly 19.1, cactus, tater
12:40 < bridge_> <jxsl13> you could use ssh tunnel the port to localhost and check if it's an issue with your server firewall settings or an actual compatibility issue between f-ddrace and your client
12:41 < bridge_> <ljpb> I'm from Russia, and my server is in Germany. Maybe that's the problem?
12:41 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If the server registers it probably shouldn't be a server firewall issue...
12:42 < bridge_> <ljpb> But the one who rents this server to me is Russian.
12:42 < bridge_> <jxsl13> dunno if that's the problem but could be.
12:43 < bridge_> <jxsl13> hm
12:43 < bridge_> <jxsl13> I mean, you can ssh into the server

12:47 < bridge_> <jxsl13> can you post the ip:port in here
12:49 < bridge_> <jxsl13> 5.231.230.167:8303
12:49 < bridge_> <DDNet> 5.231.230.167:8303 is not a DDraceNetwork or Community server.
12:49 < bridge_> <jxsl13> I can connect to it
12:49 < bridge_> <jxsl13> it's related to your location
15:55 < bridge_> <Assa> Are you also in favor of removing the map_create_pixelart - **standalone** tool in favor of the editor tool implementation?
16:49 < bridge_> <fushi_gg> can we get better vote treshold, atleast for afk players? often there will be people afk blocking a part and u cant do anything about it
20:18 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I love when chatgpt makes up quotes :pepeW:
20:18 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1365754002742055023/image.png?ex=680e7508&is=680d2388&hm=2698a7a85c64f99ac067b17aa8250a9fa7920c0fe7ef1aa5d71dd4bd3bc8bb30&
20:25 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> uhh no thats a tuple in rust
20:26 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> or something idk rust xd
20:27 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/primitives/tuples.html
20:27 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> weird things
20:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> tuple is fixed size, that may constitute an array depending on who you ask but they’re not really iterable & aren’t really used like arrays
20:33 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah
20:33 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> if you were to make one comprised of the same type
20:33 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> then they are iterable with probably unsafe memory stuff
20:33 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> and are structures with elements of the same type
20:33 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> rust 69 me 420
20:46 < bridge_> <chairn> what did you ask ?
20:46 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> I ask it many stupid questions :justatest:
20:47 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> > Is array treated like a struct with N elements of same type?
21:41 < bridge_> <learath2> This scares me
21:42 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> should be fine, just target DDrace mode from server
21:43 < bridge_> <meloƞ> that isnt nice, my extfeat_love would look like someone is high and drunk!
21:44 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> cant you set entities per mode though
21:44 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> so why does it matter
21:44 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> or maybe you cant distinguish vanilla/ddrace in this way right now
21:44 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> oh but it isnt from entities hmm
21:44 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i guess u should need similar system for gameskin?
21:46 < bridge_> <learath2> It's not that we can't do it. It's that if we do it it'll make people mad
21:47 < bridge_> <syrinok> We haven't been mad in a minute Learath, don't leave us hanging, it fuels us
21:48 < bridge_> <meloƞ> Skeith when apply for mod?
21:48 < bridge_> <syrinok> What's a mod
21:48 < bridge_> <meloƞ> i'm pretty sure you'd be a GREAT addition
21:48 < bridge_> <meloƞ> wait claude is thinking a little hard rn
21:49 < bridge_> <meloƞ> come on 3.7... dont leave me hangin
21:49 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> sorry this is a sore subject for me i tink i will explode into subatomic particles!
21:49 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> why would it make people mad
21:49 < bridge_> <Lumpy ◐ω◑> hey, did you solve this issue? Yumiko has the same issue, his cursor moves on the second display from ddnet, he uses fedora and can't fix it
21:49 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> its already a thing for entities
21:49 < bridge_> <meloƞ> because it changes something people were used to for 11 years
21:50 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> it doesnt change anything if the server is configured correctly?
21:50 < bridge_> <meloƞ> yeah exactly.. dont use "configured correctly" when trying to debate about a feature
21:50 < bridge_> <meloƞ> :cat_cracked_hehe:
21:50 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> they already are, you set the mode for DDNet-Server
21:50 < bridge_> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1365777135809200158/image.png?ex=680e8a94&is=680d3914&hm=b19a49338afe54754da612c8a859b8451e1d54e698aba89ec7f4257753f1b54b&
21:50 < bridge_> <meloƞ> i like the third one
21:50 < bridge_> <syrinok> https://tenor.com/view/spongebob-patrick-angry-chase-primal-gif-17199286692718135430
21:51 < bridge_> <syrinok> me running to attack learath when I see a giant snowflake
21:51 < bridge_> <meloƞ> damn snowflakes everywhere
21:51 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> plus the person using the feature has to opt-into it
21:51 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> otherwise the fallback gameskin applies
21:52 < bridge_> <syrinok> That sounds quite interesting, where do I apply
21:52 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> if the goal of changing star particles to snowflakes was to make the behavior more clear to new players, this is no different imo
21:53 < bridge_> <syrinok> I agree
21:53 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> if you want it to be compact, stick it in extras.png and then just have a default client option `cl_show_hearts_as_snowflakes` that oldheads can disable
21:54 < bridge_> <syrinok> Already enough has been changed for these people to refuse to update their clients, why stop now
21:54 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> it's a really simple solution no matter the implementation
21:54 < bridge_> <learath2> Because it won't look like it did in 2012
21:54 < bridge_> <learath2> People hate that
21:54 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> you guys are way too concerned about veteran players. they are not going to quit over any features
21:54 < bridge_> <syrinok> Ya, we're hardstuck dw
21:54 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> they are addicted
21:55 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> if they dont know how to press f1 and enter a command they might as well not be olds
21:56 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> @sollybunny feel free to chime in here or on either issue, i linked the freeze skin discussion
21:57 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> really
21:57 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> thats rough
21:57 < bridge_> <learath2> They are all old friends and it feels bad when they call us sewage eating rats ruining the game
21:57 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> anyway as long as the effect can be reskined its fine
21:57 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> they already do this
21:58 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> (a freeze overlay can be reskined to x_ninja if wanted)
21:58 < bridge_> <learath2> They don't if we don't remove their 2009 aesthetic
21:58 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> no they do
21:58 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> when masterserv goes down
21:58 < bridge_> <syrinok> ^
21:58 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> when there's cheated ranks
21:58 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> when practice is disabled
21:58 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> when servers get ddosed
21:58 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> there's plenty that people complain about, don't cherry-pick
21:59 < bridge_> <syrinok> We know this because of the SP client drama
21:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> what speciically do people not like
21:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> sp someone?
21:59 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> Linear
21:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> thats not a client feature
21:59 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> Being able to join linear
21:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> that would be an added feature
21:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> wait no that exists
21:59 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> just exclude linear
21:59 < bridge_> <learath2> Then everyone calls us rats. That's different
22:00 < bridge_> <syrinok> sitting animation, any change that changes the visuals of the game at all, they don't like change
22:00 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> the sitting animtion really?
22:00 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i would really prefer if as a group we could grow up and just make the kind of game that we want. this attitude has also needlessly stalled account discussion in the past imo
22:00 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i didnt even notice it until i looked at the code
22:00 < bridge_> <syrinok> don't ignore what I'm saying :J
22:00 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> you also could be joking but it's a pretty common sentiment
22:01 < bridge_> <meloƞ> yes, AFAIR voxel even received lazy negativity for implementing it by some people
22:01 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> people can always use old clients, nothing stopping them
22:01 < bridge_> <syrinok> You know it's the truth
22:01 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> b-but how did they even know?
22:01 < bridge_> <meloƞ> unless SP_Someone decides to steal the URL again and not give it back this time
22:01 < bridge_> <meloƞ> <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
22:02 < bridge_> <meloƞ> "bro who the fuck changed the animation"
22:02 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> it was actually "stealing", i saw on the page "we thank sp someone for giving us the ddnet.tw domain" and read "sp someone fucking sat on our domain", idk what actually went down
22:02 < bridge_> <learath2> You wouldn't hesitate to call me a pebble eating moron if I changed the hearts
22:02 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i saw on the page "we thank sp someone for giving us the ddnet.tw domain" and read "sp someone fucking sat on our domain", idk what actually went down, plz inform
22:02 < bridge_> <learath2> We know you are the biggest veteranman
22:02 < bridge_> <syrinok> True
22:02 < bridge_> <meloƞ> trust me, i was there when it happened. Learath didnt allow me to sleep until the @ everyone happened
22:03 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> how did it happen, did you not renew the domain?
22:03 < bridge_> <syrinok> Give me the fuel I need Learath, stop toying with my emotions
22:03 < bridge_> <meloƞ> we went from ddnet.tw to ddnet.org and our provider was a dumdum
22:03 < bridge_> <meloƞ> and sp someone yoinked
22:03 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> so u unregistered ddnet.tw on purpose, then got upset when someone baught it?
22:04 < bridge_> <meloƞ> no. we transferred with all rights - its just that it was never supposed to be on sell
22:04 < bridge_> <meloƞ> its just that the provider fucked it up
22:04 < bridge_> <learath2> Almost correct. We were transferring ddnet.tw from one registrar to another. The outgoing registrar transferred it out, the incoming one didn't onboard it, it expired instead
22:04 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> how long was that overlap?
22:04 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> accidently put it up for sale, and the person who dropped the ball wasnt you, tyhen sp someone was like "ehehheheh, my time to shine"
22:04 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ~~accidently put it up for sale, and the person who dropped the ball wasnt you, tyhen sp someone was like "ehehheheh, my time to shine"~~
22:04 < bridge_> <meloƞ> its just funny it was sp someone
22:05 < bridge_> <syrinok> He do a little trolling
22:05 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> he's out of ways to troll, nothing is fun anymore
22:05 < bridge_> <meloƞ> known for his toxicity, lazy negativity, ban evading and much more
22:05 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> he was toxic to me as a novice
22:05 < bridge_> <syrinok> Guys, SP doesn't exist anymore, he already told me he'd quit when accounts are added
22:05 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> and as a brutal...
22:05 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> i should airstrike ddnet servers on april fools as a prank
22:05 < bridge_> <syrinok> It's too ez
22:05 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> if you think it's lazy negativity then ragebait works
22:05 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> :kek:
22:05 < bridge_> <learath2> It took some cia work to find out who it was
22:06 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> woulda been put on pervebial lazy stake for the nameplates if they werent already on an older client
22:06 < bridge_> <meloƞ> didnt he say he has it
22:06 < bridge_> <syrinok> Ya, he just straight up told me he did it
22:06 < bridge_> <meloƞ> when you mentioned you'll drop old clients
22:06 < bridge_> <meloƞ> xD
22:06 < bridge_> <meloƞ> i was talking to him ingame and he confirmed he wants his 14.2 client to function
22:06 < bridge_> <meloƞ> or smth like that, i forgor
22:06 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> everyone smacking the top of their 4:3 CRT TVs running 0.6
22:06 < bridge_> <syrinok> Then I informed him that he's a moron and he won't be able to use old clients anymore, then he folded
22:07 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> GOD DAMMIT !!!!!!!! WORK DAMN YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!
22:07 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> he could not give it back and then we wouldnt have to worry about backwards compatibility
22:07 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> in some russian cottage
22:07 < bridge_> <meloƞ> see? you did so much great stuff
22:07 < bridge_> <meloƞ> imagine what you could do with blue name
22:07 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> yes please wear the blue outfit mister officer
22:07 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> flex on colorblind people not being able to tell the difference between member and a mod
22:07 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> save me from my purgatory
22:08 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> :tear:
22:08 < bridge_> <meloƞ> one would be light grey, the other would be dark grey - no difference!
22:08 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> colorblind people dont see in monochrome 😭
22:08 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> :nouis:
22:09 < bridge_> <syrinok> Kayden has been a rat recently, I'm tempted. tfw the trolls increase trolling after you stop being a mod, when they vocally hate that you have mod. Little bro, you're only harming yourself
22:09 < bridge_> <meloƞ> bro how do you still have interactions with kayden
22:09 < bridge_> <zhn> you are missing big part - options are no-no
22:09 < bridge_> <meloƞ> he joins, pings me 3 times and goes rq if i dont answer
22:09 < bridge_> <syrinok> I don't even respond to him, he still shows up
22:09 < bridge_> <meloƞ> XDD
22:09 < bridge_> <meloƞ> you're on his hitlist
22:09 < bridge_> <meloƞ> gg
22:10 < bridge_> <syrinok> always has been
22:10 < bridge_> <zhn> thats why big percent of really old players use outdated, vanilla or rebuilt based on their wishes clients
22:10 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> why is that options = no-no
22:10 < bridge_> <zhn> ask heinrich
22:11 < bridge_> <zhn> or lemme find our discussion about this topic
22:11 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> when people have the ability to use old options, they decide not to update because they're allowed to use old options? what are you saying
22:13 < bridge_> <jxsl13> this is actually a garry's (the snail) mod reference.
22:13 < bridge_> <meloƞ> reminder that i made freezy a client that does nothing but display "freezy gigachad client" in the bottom right corner of his start menu when he launches it in rgb.
22:13 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> clearly it's time to add a config.h dwm style :greenthing:
22:14 < bridge_> <meloƞ> and ofc - old stars
22:14 < bridge_> <syrinok> Guys, the katana was pretty cool though, it had sparklies
22:14 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The obvious way to avoid adding more in-game options!
22:15 < bridge_> <meloƞ> the little circles made me all happy :c
22:15 < bridge_> <learath2> It increases the testing space exponentially. If I recall correctly from @robyt3's talk we have on the order of hundreds of thousands of configurations without even considering config options and we only test like 5 of them
22:15 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> that's a good point, but how many of these options even overlap?
22:15 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> something like freeze skin should only affect the loading of one asset
22:16 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> regardless, there should be more testing for config i guess
22:16 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> @learath2 if i really cant be blue can i be purple 🥺
22:16 < bridge_> <meloƞ> you know what should only affect something that is bound to that thing? 0.7 skin settings
22:16 < bridge_> <meloƞ> CAN WE HIDE THE CONFIG OPTIONS WHEN NOT CONNECTED TO A 0.7 SERVER ENTIRELY PLEASE TY. I HATE TYPING player_skin AND THE FIRST THING THAT POPS UP IS THE 0.7 OPTION... please?
22:16 < bridge_> <zhn> ?xd you are forced to use new features
22:16 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> do you know what option means
22:17 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I guess the way to test something like this properly would be testing some random subset of possible configurations
22:17 < bridge_> <syrinok> Should probably ask in private, but what happened!
22:17 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> huh? nothing
22:17 < bridge_> <meloƞ> would you rather have one thing that works, or 300 settings to change that one thing without a proper UI to do so?
22:17 < bridge_> <zhn> do you know if voxels animations have none of option do disable them
22:17 < bridge_> <syrinok> Just be blue, it's easy
22:17 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if you do a large number of tests you're highly likely to catch issues even if you don't go through every possible combination of options
22:17 < bridge_> <meloƞ> e.g f1 console
22:17 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> nothing happened so i figured nothing was going to
22:17 < bridge_> <syrinok> gg
22:17 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> ticket was open for a while
22:17 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> closed it
22:18 < bridge_> <learath2> You can be blue
22:18 < bridge_> <learath2> Be blue
22:18 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> to be purple you simply need to get a pull request accepted :)
22:18 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i did?
22:18 < bridge_> <meloƞ> send PR right now
22:18 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> ive made 2 to ddnet-web

22:22 < bridge_> <learath2> It's pink. I stand by it
22:22 < bridge_> <zhn> void is about to eat me
22:23 < bridge_> <jxsl13> i cannot follow, but I'm straight male and white.
22:23 < bridge_> <jxsl13> so no
22:23 < bridge_> <jxsl13> whatever that means
22:23 < bridge_> <meloƞ> i bow to you my king

22:23 < bridge_> <jxsl13> xd
22:24 < bridge_> <learath2> Ok enough
22:24 < bridge_> <meloƞ> i'll be your scabbard
22:24 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> Pink role
22:24 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> No way
22:24 < bridge_> <meloƞ> i'll be your scabbard
22:24 < bridge_> <meloƞ> 
22:24 < bridge_> <meloƞ> i'll be your shield
22:24 < bridge_> <jxsl13> well
22:24 < bridge_> <syrinok> No more colors :C
22:24 < bridge_> <jxsl13> I'm white again
22:24 < bridge_> <oxyzo.> You are no longer pink
22:24 < bridge_> <jxsl13> or still
22:25 < bridge_> <syrinok> Personally, I documented this admin abuse and I'll be using it in my defense if the hearts are changed. 💼
22:26 < bridge_> <zhn> no ur pink
22:26 < bridge_> <jxsl13> deletes all other messages, leaves this one without context
22:26 < bridge_> <louis> this would be good actuallyu
22:26 < bridge_> <louis> sorry i scrolled up too far
22:27 < bridge_> <syrinok> Be careful with your next moves, Learath
22:27 < bridge_> <meloƞ> :kek:
22:27 < bridge_> <learath2> It's your word against mine. Your toxicity is well documented. I'm a smol bean
22:28 < bridge_> <louis> @syrinok whys it bad
22:28 < bridge_> <louis> hearts dont really make sense anyways, u can always change ur .png
22:28 < bridge_> <syrinok> It's not, I'm simply doing the trolling
22:28 < bridge_> <louis> i like the idea of having hp in ddnet gameplay
22:29 < bridge_> <syrinok> I don't think we'll ever go that far, but ya hearts to snowflakes makes sense
22:29 < bridge_> <louis> i also want a reset button that isn't kill
22:29 < bridge_> <louis> so u can make unfailable parts that have freeze on the ground
22:29 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i wrote down that he made me blue even though im a new player
22:29 < bridge_> <syrinok> He's done for
22:30 < bridge_> <learath2> It might be interesting to have real health in ddrace. As in spikes that send you back to cp if you have health
22:30 < bridge_> <jxsl13> color blindness is documented
22:30 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> you could do this with switches easily
22:30 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> but not sure about making it in a nice way visually
22:31 < bridge_> <louis> u cant make it visually nice w switches
22:31 < bridge_> <syrinok> I too love being teleported to a room every fail
22:31 < bridge_> <louis> you actually cant make anything visually nice with switches unfortunately
22:31 < bridge_> <learath2> You had good vibes. I made an executive call
22:31 < bridge_> <syrinok> gorp ate my moderator role (damn dogs)
22:32 < bridge_> <syrinok> I'm proud of you
22:32 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> the nature of my vibe is probably disputed
22:32 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> but maybe i'll make it more easier to reason with over time
22:32 < bridge_> <learath2> I have no idea who gorp is. The name was very friendly
22:32 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> u know what my name means?
22:33 < bridge_> <Ewan> nothing
22:33 < bridge_> <jxsl13> let it he vibe anything, except for vibe coder
22:33 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> yeah
22:33 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> im not vibe coder wtf
22:34 < bridge_> <syrinok> Now just never give gorp auth
22:34 < bridge_> <syrinok> Enjoy your role, nerd
22:34 < bridge_> <jxsl13> https://github.com/go-gorp/gorp
22:35 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> wtf
22:35 < bridge_> <learath2> Gonna Only Role Play
22:35 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> nope it's this dog https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpZXRJwDVt0
22:35 < bridge_> <learath2> Wrong
22:36 < bridge_> <learath2> What would you know about your own name? I'm an authority on this subject
22:36 < bridge_> <syrinok> there's a hidden E in there
22:37 < bridge_> <learath2> Ayo <a:ayo:1093778459093893190>
22:37 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> it probably means penis in hebrew
22:37 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i think learath made me a mod because we both like anime girls
22:38 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> thoughts
22:38 < bridge_> <syrinok> It's quite possible

22:44 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> something else jester

22:45 < bridge_> <syrinok> DONT PUT ME ON THE SPOT
22:45 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> it's like social shuffleboard really
22:46 < bridge_> <syrinok> SP Someone did nothing wrong
22:46 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> topical, recent relevance
22:46 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i like it
22:47 < bridge_> <learath2> Mh, that was rather bland. Demoted
22:48 < bridge_> <syrinok> sad jester noises
22:48 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> learath you're being too much like the US government right now
22:48 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> this is a triggering experience
22:48 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> as an amaerica
22:48 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> n
22:48 < bridge_> <learath2> The `ath` in my name is for `authoritarian`
22:48 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> ATH? 🤨

22:49 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> but ur not a mod nor an admin!
22:49 < bridge_> <syrinok> no proof
22:50 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1365792062573907998/image.png?ex=680e987a&is=680d46fa&hm=c5732af88ee1b04a33f9c18f3c600076b5a055bb48aa85fb0e509c065b414411&
22:50 < bridge_> <syrinok> They had proof
22:50 < bridge_> <learath2> They paid me in bitcoin
22:50 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> if i pay you in bitcoin can i be mod?
22:51 < bridge_> <learath2> It depends on whether you pass the vibe check
22:51 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i wouldntve paid u in bitcoin anyway
22:51 < bridge_> <syrinok> Is that why I was removed
22:51 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> but if i did do i pass the vibe check
22:51 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah you gave off abuser vibes
22:52 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> why are her screenshots so terrible
22:52 < bridge_> <learath2> I'm out of vibe checks for the night
22:52 < bridge_> <learath2> She takes them with a fax machine
22:52 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> knew i shoulda gotten a better learath2 subscription
22:52 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> when are we playing ddnet mafia in VC? would be fun
22:52 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> because theyre 80% quality webps
22:52 < bridge_> <learath2> What fax machine even supports webp? Scam
22:52 < bridge_> <louis> someone needs to make a trouble in tee (terrorist) town mod
22:52 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> they take less space yo
22:53 < bridge_> <louis> plz ill pay u
22:53 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> i was going to do that actually
22:53 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> it supports everything all it does is transfer data
22:53 < bridge_> <learath2> Ok enough off topic in developer. We need to duck before the admins show up
22:53 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> if you have ideas for how to do it I'll make it
22:53 < bridge_> <louis> ok start a repo ill code too 🧠
22:53 < bridge_> <syrinok> Those damned admins
22:53 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> hey i said we should move to off topic
22:53 < bridge_> <louis> i liked how hiveMC did it with trouble in mineville
22:53 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> I'm basically a moderator rn
22:53 < bridge_> <louis> pickuppable weapons, ingame store when u get kills, traitor tester
22:54 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> im putting u on probation for off-topic in developer
