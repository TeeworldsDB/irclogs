00:39 < Voxel> Hi! I'm just joining in really quickly to ask a question about a possible new update. It's for the ZIP file asset update, and I don't know if implimenting it will hinder preformance, since it will be dealing with a lot more singular images, instead of one big texture atlas.

07:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> putting my drinks always as far away from anything electrical as possible on my desk. spilled tea once, luckily it had no sugar in it. never doing that again 😄

10:27 < bridge> <totar> I wonder if the teeworlds networking model was based on this exact paper. It seems like a lot of somewhat arbitrary details are nearly identical https://mrelusive.com/publications/papers/The-DOOM-III-Network-Architecture.pdf
11:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this gives a type error. do you mean `foo_mut(&mut j);`? then I get an error for the `drop(y);` but that one has nothing to do with lifetimes. it's simply that `x` has been dropped and thus `y` is no longer valid
11:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I remember people saying it was based on quake networking
11:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what is that map, what do you need it for? 🙂
