01:19 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I had tried smt similar. I used demucs to separate the vocal from the noise. Then from the captions I generated a .csv file. Then with coqui-tts to actually generate the model. Was fun but got no actuall result since I don't have a nvidia gpu or a amd which supports rocm/hip (so was trained in cpu).

11:48 <+ChillerDragon> yo @Zwelf im kinda forced to adapt this failsafe in downstream huh? Im trying to skip the effort of understanding it and rewrting all my sql write callbacks :( https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/a4b7c9d08a301f21b0497eb3c32b83e967bd0500
11:51 <+ChillerDragon> hm maybe i can do a ``if(w != Write::NORMAL) { dbg_assert() }`` in the beginning of all methods and leave the rest untouched
12:10 <+bridge> <Zwelf> Yeah, you can do `if(w != Write::Normal) { return false; }`
12:12 <+bridge> <Zwelf> and then have the same database code in `engine/`
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> nice
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> so this is okay? https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/commit/2ed3efc3efc1494f248c2f6ff65f9401bd8a0284
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> yo @heinrich5991 i got some non public securtiy alert from github could you bump/pin tokio to fix it ? :) https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1673694734.png
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> oof is ddnet becoming a javascript project now? spammed with dependabot alerts ._.
12:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> just disable them in the settings
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> hrmpf
12:17 <+bridge> <uwu> Kid named pipe: :justatest:
12:18 <+bridge> <Zwelf> To keep it exactly the same. You'd have to `if(w != Write::Normal && w != Write::NORMAL_FAILED) { return false; }` to keep writing into sqlite on failure. The function is called on every query with `Write::WRITE_BACKUP` and later on success with `Write::WRITE_SUCCEEDED`.
12:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: the security alert is irrelevant for ddnet, ddnet doesn't use the specified functionality
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> thought so
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> as always w those alerts
12:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so disable them
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> okok
12:20 <+ChillerDragon> didnt get that :( @Zwelf what does writing into sqlite on failure even mean. If it fails to connect to mysql?
12:21 <+ChillerDragon> also its return true to signalize an error right?
12:22 <+bridge> <Zwelf> yes, `true` for error
12:22 <+ChillerDragon> im a bit scared it writes twice now
12:24 <+bridge> <Zwelf> Write::WRITED_FAILED, is the previous case (bool Failure = true). Yeah, it means that it couldn't reach MySQL.
12:26 <+ChillerDragon> hm i also didnt add the "_backup" prefix hope it all works. I did add your normal_failed check tho. For now i use sqlite only anyways but i might switch to mysql one day
12:31 <+bridge> <Zwelf> As long as you don't use "_backup" in you queries, then you are fine. And this is only useful if you use mysql.
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> ok
12:35 <+ChillerDragon> thanks :)
13:40 <+bridge> <Voxel> i dont know...
13:52 <+ChillerDragon> is there some new sqlite black magic? running a query on the copied db file says the db is empty :(
13:52 <+ChillerDragon> there seems to be this -wal file now 
13:52 <+ChillerDragon> hm
13:55 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1673700895.png
13:55 <+ChillerDragon> thats new
13:55 <+ChillerDragon> fakin write ahead logs 
14:10 <+ChillerDragon> ok ok nice the client crash was in chillerbot-ux not caused by the ddnet update :) ddnet master is stable poggies
14:11 <+ChillerDragon> can some1 teach me coding? everything i touch breaks
14:51 <+bridge> <FlowerFell-Sans> If I submit a content unrelated to the DDNet server (such as an image entity that can be controlled on the server), will the developers merge?
15:19 <+bridge> <deen> Probably not, what is your use case?
17:03 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> My custom all-in-one character node in godot 4, I'll take over that business :pepebooming:
