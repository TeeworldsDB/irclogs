00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> just testing the detection to help ddnet servers
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love how botters prove they use ddnet client by sending a screenshot of the client folder
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :danAmazing:
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thanks G
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the guy from kog discord an hour so ago
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> his ddnet folder seemed to be in his recent downloads folder
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> like he only just downloaded it after getting caught with bot
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :kek:
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or the ones that show a screenshot of the game running windowed and showing the window title
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://discordapp.com/channels/342003344476471296/746010285592150039/747198923336319067

00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ye lol
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> When i finished Ultranova in Creative way with sylbotter he used replay bot for what i kept doing 95% of tries :feelsbadman:
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> or says 'u can search my computer'
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> like u cant just hide ur bot on a flash drive/google drive /etc
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti he was lifebanned in 1kmin ruunu
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hes not a nobo so its fine but

00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is that true
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just didnt know why
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ya
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i see the time is hidden
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> why ban tho
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Guys I swear I'm not using a cheat client, client responds to bot?
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and ban reason = weeby name probably
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I cant start my PC without a special USB flash + Huge password
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> lmao the ChillerDragon hardcode "bot?"
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have 2 large passwords to decrypt my desktop
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm about to forget them tho because I haven't been home in 6 months to have unlocked it ðŸ˜¦
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> i need a super long key to encrypt my usb flash that has the encrypting key for the PC :troll:
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you have /boot encrypted too?
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Police gonna suffer when they take it
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> police just going to make you unlock it
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> cant
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> lmao
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> In GB they can jail u for 5 years if u dont give password
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> In germany not
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or they will just wait until you unlock it then arrest you, that's what they did to the guy that owned silkroad
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Why would i unblock it for the police
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/747218410332618782/security.png
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You'd unlock it for yourself
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> They just Come, take every phones and PCs and money and leave again
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Too many places to post news now: Website, Forum, Discord, Client, Steam. Maybe I should drop Forum, has the fewest readers I guess
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :feelsbadman:
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> forum biggest archive
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Australian border police has the right to search any electronic device that makes it across their borders...
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> if u want to go to USA u must give passwords
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen Maybe a little automation? ðŸ˜„
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never close forum pls
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has our history
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Hard to automate i guess cuz every announcement thing has a different format
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe u can delegate some work
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @noby its true, they copy ur hard drive and even want password for facebook and e mail
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would be cool if all platforms had an api
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u could just make a script
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/747219992054857848/screenshot_2020-08-23_17-25-14.png
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye ty alot whoever/whatever lifebanned my friend

00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk the reason was some weird japanese stuff
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it was his dummies name tho
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ask your friend to not be a raging racist next time around
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no who is ur friend
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye thats probably why
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why would reason be japanese stuff
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its his dumb dummies name
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> he probably said some racist shit
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> so ban is justified
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Reason is the name of the person banned. Don't ask idk why I set it up that way
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> lol fv
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> where freedom of speech
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not on a random game
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> typical argument of SJWs
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought you'd agree we are very lenient with speech anyway. Though we have no obligation to be
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 did u know
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Veeeery few things you say can get you punished and even those not for too long. You are testament to that ðŸ˜„
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is a new clan around in the game
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its called PONYggas
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> real fun

00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cool story bro
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I could say that there are already too much black people in europe
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> But i dont say that
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just said it
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> i said what i could say

00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :nouis:
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, in a couple months the german community of tw will just die away and we'll all be eternal servants to our chinese overlords
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> jk idk how many times

00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> The fun thing is
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Chinese people probably most racist
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ?
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> lol
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> They will apply another kind of freedom of speech

00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if someone made a map with it
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :troll:
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> would u decline it?
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> abuse
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chinese already got what they wanted
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they extend their dictatorship
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> outside their land
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They can have whatever they want
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> most of the hardware that tw servers run on is probably made in china
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the power of numbers
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> They gonna occupy usa first
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well maybe we can release it outside of china ðŸ˜„
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> china must tell them to have lot of kids
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so more ppl consuming
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this rly affects gaming
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz companies will bend their dick for china
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When are we getting our tencent deal?
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want a share
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pls
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can divvy up the earnings by line count
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> But lmao when china community is there with 1000 active players that are pros they will send in developers and admins
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Thats the end of german ddkingdom
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to rename methods
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We already got our first chinese contributor
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :justatest:

00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Waffle is probably better than N9
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeojingkang
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Japanese people don't enjoy playing games on computers much, doubt we'd get much traction there
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm rly
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> mobile pros
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> asia loves mobile

00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> The biggest tw pro is from Japan
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine the cringe
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> im not from japan
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> wtf
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> ur nobo
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :troll:
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> noname
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should move to #general
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Everyone knows I'm the best player around, I just use only 50% of my skill so you lot won't feel inadequate
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh this isn't #general? ðŸ˜„
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> just put ddnet 9.3 on google play store
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> We just wanna chow @ChillerDragon how much fun we have on 0.6 and how many players to deal with
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Yeah good idea since 9.3 cant join DDNet servers :feelsbadman:
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Hi, we should probably update the 0.7 mapres soon,
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the actual 0.7 fixed their grass main etc. ours is still a bit buggy
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> left actual 0.7, right ddnets 0.7
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the best would be to update all tilesets to be 0.7 comptible
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/747224156072050750/unknown.png
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why not just change ddnet 9.3 on mobile so it sends version 904 or something instead
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Grass main is buggy af
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Am I blind or do both just look the same?
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I'm blind ðŸ˜¦
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> look how the borders are bigger
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> update to 0.6
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> ur getting black lines in the tile with buggy tilesets
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah grass is the buggest indeed @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti ^^
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aren't the borders a result of borderfix?
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> like at the unfreeze corner
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probably
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but we will remove that tool soon
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for constitency
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for mappers
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and isn't borderfix a lossy operation?
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes, but we can use them from the 0.7 github
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they got a fixed one
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do you propose we fix the hundreds of maps with probably thousands of mapres that we have no way of getting the original of? ðŸ˜„
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we dont
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you rarely see the problem
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i only knew few maps on ddnet that look buggy
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So old borderfixed tilesets will be the ones looking buggy at the end of the day?
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but as i said u rarely notice
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> only when zooming in
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the current behaviour is undefined anyway
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its dependend on resolution and zooming level
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Odd, I'd have thought it'd look weird with the last layer of pixels being repeated, if you say it's not noticeable I guess it's fine to upgrade then
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> a 2k monitor gets completly different results than hd ready
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well you can test it, but if you concentrate you might notice it
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> keks is a cheater
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> He abuses double Jump after save for straight a year
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it was only 2 maps
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and its not a cheat, its a hack xd
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> troll
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i honestly dont want to know how many maps are finished by glitches
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> all of them
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> DDRace is literally made from glitches
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> update failed... check log... what to do?
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> i am updating from like 12.9 to 14.4
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> restart the game. did the update actually fail? i had the same message but the update went through
05:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> remove island rush from perma novice
05:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> + introduction and kobra 2
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Boci We had a mistake in the updater, so this failure is expected. If you want to make sure all files are there, just download a fresh copy from https://ddnet.tw/
07:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis and introduce which new maps instead?
08:36 <+ChillerDragon> yo @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti can i ping u? And why do you spend so much effort to encrypt ur device? o.O 
08:36 <+ChillerDragon> and tf is going on in CHINA
08:37 <+ChillerDragon> so many players in ddnet china
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @ChillerDragon :O it works
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> 
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Cuz i want the police suffer when they take my devices again
10:48 <+ChillerDragon> fair
10:53 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3z> .
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @deen not sure, but island rush is a really bad map for perma novice
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i guess you can keep the other two for now
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> feels like we keep removing perma novice maps, makes the perma novice servers more and more useless
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> will remove Island Rush now
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well we have a bit of novices in testing so hopefully those will get released
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Island rush hard and tiny
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then the map should be rerated, it's 1 star novice
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> its very short but already the start is too hard for 1* xD
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/747444572610625546/screenshot_2020-08-24_15-16-44.png
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> actually not that short, top5 is around 4 minutes
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so 2 stars?
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 3
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> 3 yea
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> its faily
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> everything hookable and tiny, nobos that dont have a fast reaction or just a high ping will fail mid map often
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <maggi323> 3*
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> @deen  im pretty sure it didnt update cause, i dont have the dotted spec thing
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Each time I start a python project, I start working on it, I get to the part I need to create a virtualenv, I drop the entire thing and use something that's atleast half sane like node.js
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> also, how do i update manually so my custom files stay there?
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Boci  ok, then probably bad permissions. You should put all your custom files in config_directory.bat, then they are never overwritten
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then you can just download a new version from ddnet.tw and everything from config_directory is still used
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> well shit i store them in the folder of the game
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, most do and we overwrite that when updating
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> i'll move my shit there then
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Think of config directory as yours and the game directory as ours
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> for example if i have custom emoticons.png then where do i put that in the config directory?
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> @deen  can i just fix bad permissions somehow so i dont have to update manuallly?
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> i tried launching administrator but doesnt work
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> unrelated q: what is wordlist.txt for in data?
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you need to create a data directory in there and put it there
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Boci after the update probably too late
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and launching as admin is the way to get bad permissions ðŸ˜„
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> wordlist is a list of random words that is used when you /save without a password
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Each time I start a python project, I start working on it, I get to the part I need to create a virtualenv, I drop the entire thing and use something that's atleast half sane like node.js
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 npm half sane? :justatest:
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is a great example of "just works"
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> python is a great exercise in quickly losing sanity
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> > wordlist is a list of random words that is used when you /save without a password
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> @deen nice ok
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> 1 more q
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> could cross-server dm-ing be a thing?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, but at that point just use a real chat program, like the one you're on right now
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Reason number 521 to hate python: No do while loop
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-building-github-alternative-called-095357551.html
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i find it hilarious that now open-source is a battle between countries
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> Git ee
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Inb4 it ends up better than github
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> git tee
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lmao
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> those reactionsssss
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> It would be nice to have a confirmed austria flag by my name :stonks: on https://ddnet.tw/ranks/
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> > yes, but at that point just use a real chat program, like the one you're on right now
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> @deen idk, i think its a good idea
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boci> @Brokecdx-  its just what server u play on most i think
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> yes, change server location to austria :FeelsBadMan:
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we could change the German flag to EU flag as long as we don't have other servers in the EU
