13:28 <+nameless-tee> Hey guys! Can you recommend a good irc (and maybe jabber) client with console interface (for Linux)?
13:30 <@EastByte> weechat can also be used as jabber client (I haven't done that before though)
13:32 <@EastByte> irssi should do that aswell via plugins
13:32 <+nameless-tee> I was writing a message about irssi :) And what is better in your opinion?
13:34 <@EastByte> I switched from irssi to weechat a few years ago, not sure what the reason was
13:34 <@EastByte> I think I didn't like the code
13:35 <@EastByte> for me weechat is like a modern rework of irssi
13:36 <+nameless-tee> Weechat looks more populated. I'll try it, thanks EastByte
13:38 <@EastByte> you're welcome
13:50 <@deen> bitlbee is what people use for IM in irssi I belive
16:09 < Yasusi> a
16:09 <+Yasusi> Can i get help?
16:18 <+Henningstone> always these people who ask if they may ask something, but don't await an answer and leave a minute later...
16:19 <@heinrich5991> because they don't really know that you need to wait longer to get an answer
18:01 <@deen> yeah, that's why I removed IRC link from ddnet website, most people don't understand how it's used
18:47 <+Rafael> xD
22:48 <+Savander> Hello, i wasn't here for a while. Actually, im here rarely. How you feeling, something has happened??
23:09 <@deen> hi Savander 
23:09 <@deen> Daily DDoS attacks, not much else DDNet related
