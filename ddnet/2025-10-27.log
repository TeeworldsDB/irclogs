01:10 < bridge> <nixuslegendary> Is this tool available to the public?:greenthing:
01:27 < bridge> <Teero> not yet
01:28 < bridge> <nixuslegendary> ok 😭
01:33 < bridge> <Nouaa> is there a way to use timeout with sv_max_clients_per_ip set to 1?
01:35 < bridge> <melon> No
05:55 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> yo
05:55 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs-rfc/issues/1
05:55 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> thoughts on this?
05:55 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> (It would be infinitely better if it was just APNG instead of GIF tho)
06:03 < bridge> <Ewan> lottie
06:05 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> that's a good idea too

08:29 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry team
08:29 < bridge> <Ewan> o7
08:30 < bridge> <Ewan> do i just play the game with gdb connected 😩
08:33 < bridge> <Ewan> oh right it's a clean shutdown so it won't even catch it
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @milkeeycat: omg help i need spell checker
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ewan Green: you could probably gdb break the clean shutdown entry but not sure how much use that is
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Have you tried not using Wayland?
08:43 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> you can set a breakpoint for the line that creates the log
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> i did this for now
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1432273667945009244/image.png?ex=6900744c&is=68ff22cc&hm=7e84b86d7e344eeca03b0d79e6d4e39b95639f5ff020cee6169848b3c48d5802&
08:44 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> that works
08:44 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> i dont know how much info youll get out of it
08:45 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> gpu errors kinda hide stuff due to it going through the gpu
08:50 < bridge> <Ewan> i just want it to crash
08:50 < bridge> <Ewan> so i can have timeout protection
09:05 < bridge> <Ewan> i put it in the wrong spot [hi](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1406663602181640212.webp?size=48&name=hi)
10:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: nice branch name xddd
10:08 < bridge> <pioooooo> Ignore list so funny
10:13 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat thanks :D 
10:14 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat WE NEED SPELL CHECKER FOR BRANCH NAMES!!! omagwad
10:14 < bridge> <Assa> maintainer btw :kek:
10:15 < bridge> <Assa> but I would sometimes need a spellchecker as well tbh
10:16 < bridge> <Assa> otherwise I tend to have code with the same spelling mistake all over it
10:16 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/a24bab0b4ee4453f31261899b78eca7b1a1a9bfa/scripts/compile_libs/make_lib_openssl.sh#L16
10:16 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** buid_openssl
10:16 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ hrhrhrhr
10:17 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** that was before jopsi was vibe coder
10:17 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** chartgpt would never typo build xd
10:18 < bridge> <Assa> I read over this thrice until I noticed ...
10:18 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa yea same here. I just dont know english and convinced my self my own spelling is correct. I urgently need the spell checker to learn something
10:23 < bridge> <Assa> there is a list of words I tend to write wrong: `initalize`, `apparantly`, `sattelite` are my worst offenders, but I am aware of this and this 3 are like a warning flag in my mind. And yes I know how to write them correct, I just have like a wrong muscle memory, where my writing automation fails, as if I have learned them wrong
10:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa in the ruby programming language you have to call the method `initialize` to define an constructor
10:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** imagine the trouble this causes
10:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but to call the constructor you say `new` why is the method not named new then???
10:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and DHH the giga troll has the audacity to say `initianlize` is nicer than pythons `__init__` bruv yes underscores but at least i dont have to look at it 3 times to find the typo
10:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** it doesnt even throw an error
10:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** it just calles the default constructor instead wtf
10:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa knowledge, achievement, environment are also hard imo
10:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ackknowledgement
10:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** go speedtype that xd
10:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** fak i typoed it
10:30 < bridge> <Assa> I agree, the 4th on my list is unknown which I tend to write as "unkown"
10:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** OMG SAME
10:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
10:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** fakin unkown xd
10:30 < bridge> <Assa> but I sh managed to fix this one , because you need to use it soo often
10:31 < bridge> <Assa> Unknown device, unknown user, unknown endpoint, ...
10:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** perl the giga chad script lang `perl -i -p -e's/\bunkown\b/unknown/g' $(find . -name *.cpp)`
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> it worked and saved me and we finished
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> 😃
10:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** W
10:32 < bridge> <Ewan> i love timeout protection
10:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** woah ewan actually playing the game
10:32 < bridge> <Assa> Chiller can you take a look at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/11075/files ? it's just converting from int to float and device by 1024, you can do it, really
10:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** device
10:33 < bridge> <Assa> ?
10:33 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1432301177168597134/image.png?ex=69008deb&is=68ff3c6b&hm=6e70ffc4f3b60d6905c54a72773b0aa7df62d6a6be1a61116df1b4ce37dee70a&
10:33 < bridge> <Ewan> ewan on ddnet is slightly less rare
10:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** "device by 1024"
10:33 < bridge> <Ewan> no drugs gives me previously untapped skill
10:33 < bridge> <Assa> ffs
10:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
10:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** W clean ewan
10:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** sober october
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> november is gonna be full clean
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> im putting it in writing
10:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** no nut?
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> ur onto something
10:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
10:34 < bridge> <Assa> xDDD
10:35 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa bro idk looks good i guess, but then i have really no idea what it does
10:35 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** get robsi to merge it
10:37 < bridge> <Assa> visually and in terms of features, it does nothing, just converts values in order to prevent overflows
10:38 < bridge> <Assa> you can activate the debugging with `dbg_render_cluster_clips 1` and confirm yourself, that it's still just working, you should see some bounding boxes around quads
10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> XDD
10:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ai is so good in english. Im so envy
10:46 < bridge> <Ewan> jopsti how.do u think that Wayland issue should actually be addressed
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> it currently causes a clean shutdown should it just be replaced with a dbg assert
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> I'm curious about the source of it and whether anything can be done on the ddnet side
10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No idea what issue we talking bout
10:53 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** scroll up
10:57 < bridge> <melon> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1432269863518208045
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since you use wayland assume it's a bug in wayland
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it's ez to reproduce try dbg_gfx 4
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and try with ddnet-rs to see if it's a sdl issue :deen_star:
12:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** how do i know which release started to support this? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10098
12:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** when it was merged there was 19.3 in version.h
12:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** does that mean the release was 19.4?
12:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** or 19.3 xd
13:01 < bridge> <Assa> look at changelog from deen
13:01 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/420565311863914496/1383463705596923954 19.3 ez
13:10 < bridge> <robyt3> Or open the individual commits, GitHub tells you which labels they are part of
13:16 < bridge> <Teero> is cmake turing complete?
13:17 < bridge> <Teero> ok it is
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> redstone too
13:44 < bridge> <Assa> so is magic the gathering
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wat really? that is funny
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so one round could take infinite amount of time?
13:46 < bridge> <melon> theoretically yes
13:46 < bridge> <melon> per rules, usually not
13:46 < bridge> <melon> some banned cards are rough
14:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Teero doom was already ported to cmake
14:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa nice discord link, dick
14:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** oh yea true i actually should know that @robyt3 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/165712dd86b328531a23b1b5d2ae2d454d0066a6
14:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so 19.3 already hm
14:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so the version number was already precomitted before the release
14:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** meaning forks before this commit have the version number but do not actually support it.,
14:54 < bridge> <melon> ChillerDragon: do your/any servers run on ddnet-insta?
14:55 < bridge> <melon> ChillerDragon: do your servers run on ddnet-insta?
14:57 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon all except my block servers they run on ddnet++
14:57 < bridge> <melon> 👍  cheers
14:57 < bridge> <melon> 
14:57 < bridge> <melon> there is a town-hall post you cant access that wanted to let the ddnet vanilla servers run on ddnet-insta and louis asked
14:58 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** my vanilla implementation is battle tested
14:58 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** the competitive CTF scene uses it instead of pure vanilla since quite some time

14:58 < bridge> <melon> > Not saying this could be done now, but in a future once it development gets more advanced and all that.
14:58 < bridge> <melon> > 
14:58 < bridge> <melon> > It would genuinely be so cool, playing FNG with some DDrace features (or the DDrace HUD itself) and then playing a different gamemode in the same server
14:59 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** well heinrich doesnt like it xd
14:59 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but to some degree it works
14:59 < bridge> <melon> because it mixes vanilla and DDNet? XD
14:59 < bridge> <melon> or why
14:59 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** see https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8923
15:00 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** he is not interested in flexible prediction
15:00 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so the client can not predict both vanilla and ddrace gameplay elements at the same time
15:00 < bridge> <melon> damn
15:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @louis.place: what is not advanced enough in ddnet-insta?
15:03 < bridge> <melon> the text was by blazu, not louis xd
15:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @blazulite: then
15:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also ddnets freeze index and onbgy fng spikes overlap so not sure yet what to do about it
15:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/ddnet-insta/ddnet-insta/issues/79
15:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** this will mess with entities and shit
15:26 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> progress

15:26 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> @jupeyy_keks @blaiszephyr
15:28 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> uhhh
15:28 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> idk how to explain what I meant
15:28 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> when more modes get added etc etc
15:29 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> also @sollybunny this is what I was doing
15:30 < bridge> <melon> making us suffer before we began
15:30 < bridge> <melon> typical blazu
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Neat. Tho i still prefer usability of communities over putting them in server browser 😂
15:30 < bridge> <melon> i tried doing your sidebars and egui is an intense bully
15:30 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://tenor.com/view/komaru-mugimeshi323-minecraft-berry-bush-sweet-berries-gif-3284361568604327292
15:31 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> in that case we could just add the bookmarks idea I had at the very start of this
15:31 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1432376165426921552/image.png?ex=6900d3c2&is=68ff8242&hm=9ec01bd43e831a6282b7b334abec80741660b4c829917be63d964faf05fddf08&
15:32 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> in my idea you could also pin communities you like as well
15:32 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> it would be an all-in-one generally
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Probs.
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Btw what I'm not 100% sure about.. The left and right panel kinda looks disconnected/not aligned to the mid stuff.. Would it be better to make the side panels floating too?
15:33 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> you mean like
15:33 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> this?
15:33 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1432376625055404114/image.png?ex=6900d42f&is=68ff82af&hm=6efdd6e20754d1850059cfa1dc683275d7bcc6d33587af020a4fd696d88bf2f0&
15:33 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> or the side bars?
15:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> cause the side bars are supposed to be expandable (specifically the right one)
15:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1432377013770911827/image.png?ex=6900d48c&is=68ff830c&hm=a4a65f65a16dad1b6c5698b7bc05a2b6a15c1f142d1c34737c2d07a71e920a6e&
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes the side bars
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> E.g. where the logo is
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That side bar
15:52 < bridge> <filoqcus> :poggers2:
15:55 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> what's up with it
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It doesn't look consistent of the inner part is floating
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It creates an asymmetric feeling
15:59 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @big eyed bencie ah i thought this was about the ctf/dm servers because imo they are as ready as it gets. Adding more modes and features will only add more bugs. Its basically just down hill from here ddnet-insta will never be as good again as it is now
