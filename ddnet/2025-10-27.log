01:10 < bridge> <nixuslegendary> Is this tool available to the public?:greenthing:
01:27 < bridge> <Teero> not yet
01:28 < bridge> <nixuslegendary> ok 😭
01:33 < bridge> <Nouaa> is there a way to use timeout with sv_max_clients_per_ip set to 1?
01:35 < bridge> <melon> No
05:55 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> yo

05:55 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> thoughts on this?
05:55 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> (It would be infinitely better if it was just APNG instead of GIF tho)
06:03 < bridge> <Ewan> lottie
06:05 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> that's a good idea too

08:29 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry team
08:29 < bridge> <Ewan> o7
08:30 < bridge> <Ewan> do i just play the game with gdb connected 😩
08:33 < bridge> <Ewan> oh right it's a clean shutdown so it won't even catch it
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @milkeeycat: omg help i need spell checker
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ewan Green: you could probably gdb break the clean shutdown entry but not sure how much use that is
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Have you tried not using Wayland?
08:43 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> you can set a breakpoint for the line that creates the log
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> i did this for now
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1432273667945009244/image.png?ex=6900744c&is=68ff22cc&hm=7e84b86d7e344eeca03b0d79e6d4e39b95639f5ff020cee6169848b3c48d5802&
08:44 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> that works
08:44 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> i dont know how much info youll get out of it
08:45 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> gpu errors kinda hide stuff due to it going through the gpu
08:50 < bridge> <Ewan> i just want it to crash
08:50 < bridge> <Ewan> so i can have timeout protection
09:05 < bridge> <Ewan> i put it in the wrong spot [hi](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1406663602181640212.webp?size=48&name=hi)
10:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: nice branch name xddd
10:08 < bridge> <pioooooo> Ignore list so funny
10:13 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat thanks :D 
10:14 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat WE NEED SPELL CHECKER FOR BRANCH NAMES!!! omagwad
10:14 < bridge> <Assa> maintainer btw :kek:
10:15 < bridge> <Assa> but I would sometimes need a spellchecker as well tbh
10:16 < bridge> <Assa> otherwise I tend to have code with the same spelling mistake all over it
10:16 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/a24bab0b4ee4453f31261899b78eca7b1a1a9bfa/scripts/compile_libs/make_lib_openssl.sh#L16
10:16 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** buid_openssl
10:16 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ hrhrhrhr
10:17 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** that was before jopsi was vibe coder
10:17 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** chartgpt would never typo build xd
10:18 < bridge> <Assa> I read over this thrice until I noticed ...
10:18 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa yea same here. I just dont know english and convinced my self my own spelling is correct. I urgently need the spell checker to learn something
10:23 < bridge> <Assa> there is a list of words I tend to write wrong: `initalize`, `apparantly`, `sattelite` are my worst offenders, but I am aware of this and this 3 are like a warning flag in my mind. And yes I know how to write them correct, I just have like a wrong muscle memory, where my writing automation fails, as if I have learned them wrong
10:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa in the ruby programming language you have to call the method `initialize` to define an constructor
10:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** imagine the trouble this causes
10:27 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but to call the constructor you say `new` why is the method not named new then???
10:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** and DHH the giga troll has the audacity to say `initianlize` is nicer than pythons `__init__` bruv yes underscores but at least i dont have to look at it 3 times to find the typo
10:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** it doesnt even throw an error
10:28 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** it just calles the default constructor instead wtf
10:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa knowledge, achievement, environment are also hard imo
10:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ackknowledgement
10:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** go speedtype that xd
10:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** fak i typoed it
10:30 < bridge> <Assa> I agree, the 4th on my list is unknown which I tend to write as "unkown"
10:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** OMG SAME
10:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
10:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** fakin unkown xd
10:30 < bridge> <Assa> but I sh managed to fix this one , because you need to use it soo often
10:31 < bridge> <Assa> Unknown device, unknown user, unknown endpoint, ...
10:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** perl the giga chad script lang `perl -i -p -e's/\bunkown\b/unknown/g' $(find . -name *.cpp)`
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> it worked and saved me and we finished
10:31 < bridge> <Ewan> 😃
10:31 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** W
10:32 < bridge> <Ewan> i love timeout protection
10:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** woah ewan actually playing the game
10:32 < bridge> <Assa> Chiller can you take a look at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/11075/files ? it's just converting from int to float and device by 1024, you can do it, really
10:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** device
10:33 < bridge> <Assa> ?
10:33 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1432301177168597134/image.png?ex=69008deb&is=68ff3c6b&hm=6e70ffc4f3b60d6905c54a72773b0aa7df62d6a6be1a61116df1b4ce37dee70a&
10:33 < bridge> <Ewan> ewan on ddnet is slightly less rare
10:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** "device by 1024"
10:33 < bridge> <Ewan> no drugs gives me previously untapped skill
10:33 < bridge> <Assa> ffs
10:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
10:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** W clean ewan
10:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** sober october
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> november is gonna be full clean
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> im putting it in writing
10:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** no nut?
10:34 < bridge> <Ewan> ur onto something
10:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
10:34 < bridge> <Assa> xDDD
10:35 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa bro idk looks good i guess, but then i have really no idea what it does
10:35 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** get robsi to merge it
10:37 < bridge> <Assa> visually and in terms of features, it does nothing, just converts values in order to prevent overflows
10:38 < bridge> <Assa> you can activate the debugging with `dbg_render_cluster_clips 1` and confirm yourself, that it's still just working, you should see some bounding boxes around quads
10:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> XDD
10:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ai is so good in english. Im so envy
10:46 < bridge> <Ewan> jopsti how.do u think that Wayland issue should actually be addressed
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> it currently causes a clean shutdown should it just be replaced with a dbg assert
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> I'm curious about the source of it and whether anything can be done on the ddnet side
10:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No idea what issue we talking bout
10:53 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** scroll up
10:57 < bridge> <melon> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1432269863518208045
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since you use wayland assume it's a bug in wayland
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it's ez to reproduce try dbg_gfx 4
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and try with ddnet-rs to see if it's a sdl issue :deen_star:
12:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** how do i know which release started to support this? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10098
12:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** when it was merged there was 19.3 in version.h
12:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** does that mean the release was 19.4?
12:42 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** or 19.3 xd
13:01 < bridge> <Assa> look at changelog from deen
13:01 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/420565311863914496/1383463705596923954 19.3 ez
13:10 < bridge> <robyt3> Or open the individual commits, GitHub tells you which labels they are part of
13:16 < bridge> <Teero> is cmake turing complete?
13:17 < bridge> <Teero> ok it is
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> redstone too
13:44 < bridge> <Assa> so is magic the gathering
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wat really? that is funny
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so one round could take infinite amount of time?
13:46 < bridge> <melon> theoretically yes
13:46 < bridge> <melon> per rules, usually not
13:46 < bridge> <melon> some banned cards are rough
14:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Teero doom was already ported to cmake
14:32 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa nice discord link, dick
14:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** oh yea true i actually should know that @robyt3 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/165712dd86b328531a23b1b5d2ae2d454d0066a6
14:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so 19.3 already hm
14:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so the version number was already precomitted before the release
14:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** meaning forks before this commit have the version number but do not actually support it.,
14:54 < bridge> <melon> ChillerDragon: do your/any servers run on ddnet-insta?
14:55 < bridge> <melon> ChillerDragon: do your servers run on ddnet-insta?
14:57 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon all except my block servers they run on ddnet++
14:57 < bridge> <melon> 👍  cheers
14:57 < bridge> <melon> 
14:57 < bridge> <melon> there is a town-hall post you cant access that wanted to let the ddnet vanilla servers run on ddnet-insta and louis asked
14:58 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** my vanilla implementation is battle tested
14:58 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** the competitive CTF scene uses it instead of pure vanilla since quite some time

14:58 < bridge> <melon> > Not saying this could be done now, but in a future once it development gets more advanced and all that.
14:58 < bridge> <melon> > 
14:58 < bridge> <melon> > It would genuinely be so cool, playing FNG with some DDrace features (or the DDrace HUD itself) and then playing a different gamemode in the same server
14:59 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** well heinrich doesnt like it xd
14:59 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** but to some degree it works
14:59 < bridge> <melon> because it mixes vanilla and DDNet? XD
14:59 < bridge> <melon> or why
14:59 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** see https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8923
15:00 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** he is not interested in flexible prediction
15:00 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so the client can not predict both vanilla and ddrace gameplay elements at the same time
15:00 < bridge> <melon> damn
15:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @louis.place: what is not advanced enough in ddnet-insta?
15:03 < bridge> <melon> the text was by blazu, not louis xd
15:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @blazulite: then
15:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also ddnets freeze index and onbgy fng spikes overlap so not sure yet what to do about it
15:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/ddnet-insta/ddnet-insta/issues/79
15:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** this will mess with entities and shit
15:26 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> progress

15:26 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> @jupeyy_keks @blaiszephyr
15:28 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> uhhh
15:28 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> idk how to explain what I meant
15:28 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> when more modes get added etc etc
15:29 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> also @sollybunny this is what I was doing
15:30 < bridge> <melon> making us suffer before we began
15:30 < bridge> <melon> typical blazu
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Neat. Tho i still prefer usability of communities over putting them in server browser 😂
15:30 < bridge> <melon> i tried doing your sidebars and egui is an intense bully
15:30 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://tenor.com/view/komaru-mugimeshi323-minecraft-berry-bush-sweet-berries-gif-3284361568604327292
15:31 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> in that case we could just add the bookmarks idea I had at the very start of this
15:31 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1432376165426921552/image.png?ex=6900d3c2&is=68ff8242&hm=9ec01bd43e831a6282b7b334abec80741660b4c829917be63d964faf05fddf08&
15:32 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> in my idea you could also pin communities you like as well
15:32 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> it would be an all-in-one generally
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Probs.
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Btw what I'm not 100% sure about.. The left and right panel kinda looks disconnected/not aligned to the mid stuff.. Would it be better to make the side panels floating too?
15:33 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> you mean like
15:33 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> this?
15:33 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1432376625055404114/image.png?ex=6900d42f&is=68ff82af&hm=6efdd6e20754d1850059cfa1dc683275d7bcc6d33587af020a4fd696d88bf2f0&
15:33 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> or the side bars?
15:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> cause the side bars are supposed to be expandable (specifically the right one)
15:34 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1432377013770911827/image.png?ex=6900d48c&is=68ff830c&hm=a4a65f65a16dad1b6c5698b7bc05a2b6a15c1f142d1c34737c2d07a71e920a6e&
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes the side bars
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> E.g. where the logo is
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> That side bar
15:52 < bridge> <filoqcus> :poggers2:
15:55 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> what's up with it
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It doesn't look consistent of the inner part is floating
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It creates an asymmetric feeling
15:59 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @big eyed bencie ah i thought this was about the ctf/dm servers because imo they are as ready as it gets. Adding more modes and features will only add more bugs. Its basically just down hill from here ddnet-insta will never be as good again as it is now
16:00 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** it peeked like i did 17 years ago
16:01 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Teero you should try `git commit --amend && git push -f` :D https://github.com/Teero888/ddnet_physics_c/commits/master/
16:02 < bridge> <Teero> i guess i should have yea xd
16:02 < bridge> <Teero> but that doesn't trigger the workflow no? i'd have to manually start it again
16:02 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> hmmm fair enough
16:03 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Teero also why do you shift bits if what you actually want to do is divide?
16:04 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** @Teero no need to do anything manual it runs the actions for every push forced or not
16:04 < bridge> <Teero> its the same thing lol. my physics only work with positive numbers.
16:04 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** yes 
16:04 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** so why not divide
16:04 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** if its the same
16:04 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** imo its clearer
16:04 < bridge> <Teero> yea for the example maybe
16:05 < bridge> <Teero> not in the physics themselves
16:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** why not
16:05 < bridge> <Teero> the compiler often doesn't figure it out
16:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** no way
16:05 < bridge> <Teero> how would the compiler know my values are always > 0
16:05 < bridge> <Teero> it cant
16:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** oh the shift trick only works for positives hmm
16:05 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i see
16:06 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** ok fair i guess
16:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is you have unsigned type? 😬
16:06 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** 🧠 
16:06 < bridge> <Teero> floats.
16:06 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** thats the first mistake xd
16:06 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** is that some simd requirement?
16:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** or why not use ints
16:07 < bridge> <Teero> no, floats are faster than fixed physics
16:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if you have unsigned type? 😬
16:07 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** hm
16:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> all my homies hate floats
16:08 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** fr
16:09 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> so like this?

16:17 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I'm not quite convinced honestly
16:17 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I feel like it kind of loses its point
16:18 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> the whole idea of the sidebars being fixed to the borders was to be able to quickly move the cursor to the buttons without worrying much about pressing it correctly
16:18 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> the whole idea of the sidebars being fixed to the borders was to be able to quickly move the cursor to the buttons without worrying much about pressing it in the correct position
16:19 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> plus the right sidebar doesn't look good when it's floating
16:19 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> plus the right sidebar doesn't look good closed when it's floating
16:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean that removes more of the space we need, but imo it looks not uniform
16:25 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> Huh
16:27 < bridge> <sqwinix> This is incredibly beautiful
16:27 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> Ty
16:29 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> yea I'm not finishing this I don't like how the right sidebar looks open either 🫠

16:30 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> tried compiling it a few days ago and just did perfectly fine
16:30 < bridge> <vahemaaa> oki
16:30 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> THO I'M STILL UNABLE TO BUILD DDNET
16:30 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

16:43 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> I think I just found out why
16:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> More*
16:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mean that removes more of the space we need, but imo it looks more* uniform
16:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not in bcn anymore
16:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> 1h drive away
16:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea I know -.-

17:04 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> y'all.........
17:04 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> how do I set up vcpkg
17:04 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> 🫠
17:04 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> my mind is frying
17:06 < bridge> <melon> what do you need vcpkg for
17:08 < bridge> <pioooooo> isn't just git clone?
17:08 < bridge> <pioooooo> and run some ps script
17:35 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> building with msvs build tools ig
17:35 < bridge> <melon> no need for vcpkg there
17:36 < bridge> <melon> clone with --recursive and download
17:36 < bridge> <melon> cmake
17:36 < bridge> <melon> rustup
17:36 < bridge> <melon> python
17:36 < bridge> <melon> 
17:36 < bridge> <melon> and msvc build tools from Visual Studio
17:36 < bridge> <melon> thats all you need
17:37 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> oh so that's what I missed................................................... --recursive,.,,,.,.,.
17:37 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> alr
17:37 < bridge> <big eyed bencie> ima try again
17:46 < bridge> <melon> if you cloned it already `git submodule update --init --recursive`
18:13 < bridge> <filoqcus> Does anyone have .exe ddnet-rs? 😄

19:28 < bridge> <b lazu wjelgook.i> you could try annoying jupeyy with PRs for ddnet-rs instead.............

19:37 < bridge> <Ewan> I'll see
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :deen_star:

19:52 < bridge> <sqwinix> hi guys
19:52 < bridge> <DDNet> Hellou :3
19:53 < bridge> <b lazu wjelgook.i> isnt there somethin called teesharp already tho?
19:53 < bridge> <b lazu wjelgook.i> that's what I remember finding
19:53 < bridge> <b lazu wjelgook.i> oh yeah there is

19:53 < bridge> <bombencie> @blazulite you know FlatCity mod by Matodor?
19:53 < bridge> <b lazu wjelgook.i> I remember hearing about it
19:53 < bridge> <bombencie> i think its based on this csharp port
19:53 < bridge> <b lazu wjelgook.i> oo
19:53 < bridge> <bombencie> check it out its amazing
19:54 < bridge> <sqwinix> Hey guys, I have a couple of questions for you. How do I get points sent to the database and actually work? I'm just trying to create my own race server and I don't understand. Is there a DDWiki article or something?

20:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> wot
20:01 < bridge> <melon> thats what i'm saying!
20:14 < bridge> <bombencie> lol this project is in microsoft store
20:14 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> whoee mama
20:14 < bridge> <making tclient accounts> that looks good
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> no extra output at all, definitely a vulkan specific bug. i guess i could google the error :4head:
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you installed vulkan validation layers, then dbg_gfx 4 validates our vulkan backend at runtime
21:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it crashes with the validation on:
21:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - either it shows the problem
21:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - it's a case the validation layers have not yet implemented (so kinda impossible to debug for me too)
21:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> - it's simply a bug in the vk/surface impl
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i have vulkan validation layers installed, i think. i don't know how i'd verify whether it's detected tho
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> because i get no extra output atm
21:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the game runs at like 200 fps most
21:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the validation layers are costly
21:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
21:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2025-10-27 21:14:48 I vulkan: enabled vulkan debug context.

21:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
21:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> smth like this too
21:35 < bridge> <Ewan> yea having a hard time getting it to work
21:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u have to start ddnet with the dbg_gfx cmd
21:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if that wasnt clear
21:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ❯ sudo pacman -S vulkan-validation-layers
21:37 < bridge> <Ewan> arch users
21:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cashey user
21:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah kinda
21:37 < bridge> <Ewan> cachy
21:39 < bridge> <filoqcus> :?

21:39 < bridge> <Ewan> you mean like DDNet dbg_gfx 4?
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i fixed that in the open pr
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i disabled monofonts in the mainmenu
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wait
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> `I read and understand the warnings about spatial chat`
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this is the text xd
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> DDNet "dbg_gfx 4"
21:41 < bridge> <Ewan> i got the layers
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nais
21:41 < bridge> <filoqcus> tysm

21:41 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
21:41 < bridge> <Ewan> 2025-10-27 14:40:41 I vulkan: got resize event.

21:42 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
21:42 < bridge> <Ewan> sadly i dont think this output alone tells me anything & there is no validation layer in place to catch this kind of crash afaict
21:42 < bridge> <Ewan> i would love to try with ddnet rs but i cant really get it to run
21:42 < bridge> <Ewan> it crashes on startup with other windowing bugs
21:42 < bridge> <Ewan> nixos moment
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lol
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i can only play ddnet-rs on wayland bcs they refuse to fix the relative mouse speed for x11
21:43 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
21:45 < bridge> <Ewan> let me see if i can get it going
21:48 < bridge> <filoqcus> For this, do I need to run my own ddnet-rs server?

21:51 < bridge> <Ewan> unable to load glass.spv is concerning to me but idk how it's meant to be run i guess
21:51 < bridge> <Ewan> if this is something that's expected relative to the cwd & i'm in the wrong place
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this is the standalone server.
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the client also ships an internal server that automatically starts when you enter the LAN tab
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how do you run this?
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git submodules update
21:53 < bridge> <Ewan> that worked xd
21:53 < bridge> <Ewan> didnt realize they needed to be updated
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah sadly i cannot force git to update them :/
21:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> only thing i hate about splitting data repo from the code
21:53 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
21:54 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe something to error if they're out of date would be nice
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there should be errors for that
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but maybe not for a shader
21:54 < bridge> <Ewan> some version manifest in the data repo the game itself or recognize, or based off of reading git output with a custom build step & seeing if the submodule hash matches what the remote has
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i simply recommend to use the nightly builds
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they cannot have missing data
21:55 < bridge> <Ewan> external builds on nixos.. that's a no-go
21:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tja
21:56 < bridge> <Ewan> for a moment, the game was freezing after ~1s of focus, and i would get another second or so of motion if i switched focus to another window & back to the game
21:56 < bridge> <Ewan> that was in "exclusive fullscreen" if there was such a construct in wayland (eh)
21:56 < bridge> <Ewan> now it is not doing that
21:57 < bridge> <Ewan> this is the game normally vs when i have the console open. i also wonder if the console window is supposed to animate or not yet
21:57 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1432473254630789211/image.png?ex=69012e2d&is=68ffdcad&hm=9f462f90e115ca1c912a6660bfa7c8d3f1f6d2b41cc85b53478341b86487249f&

21:57 < bridge> <Ewan> i think the game thinks it's a different resolution than it is rn
21:58 < bridge> <Ewan> you can not trust that the game window will stay the same size that you set it to. normal ddnet struggles with this too
21:59 < bridge> <filoqcus> People cannot access it via Radmin VPN D:
22:00 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry for spam
22:00 < bridge> <Ewan> is there a way i can import my binds from ddnet or is it all completely different in ddnet-rs
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i've no idea what that is, but it needs udp support
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> this server has it enabled
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1432475865832230962/grafik.png?ex=6901309c&is=68ffdf1c&hm=bfde062bf26ddb713f2ee7f92043c003de446ceac8c1d038182c76b7186126c8&
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> didnt try it in long time tho
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no guarantee it works xd
22:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sounds more like the window manager fails to update the state, what WM do you use
22:09 < bridge> <Ewan> hyprland, i definitely would not put it past them
22:09 < bridge> <Ewan> ive seen gh issues where the guy is like "eh i dont really follow the spec it just works because im such an awesome and naturally talented developer"
22:09 < bridge> <Ewan> paraphrasing
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xDDDDDDDDDDD
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> full vibe coders
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont think it's ai driven
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> he's undeniably kind of a skilled dev just very narcissistic and immature
22:14 < bridge> <Ewan> younger than me
22:16 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1432477981296689292/image.png?ex=69013294&is=68ffe114&hm=dc400582fbbc3879f4df746bac2b8b4177c8d18756f4df27433a2fcbe5632d71&
22:16 < bridge> <Ewan> idk, display is a certain size and the window is another
22:18 < bridge> <Ewan> the input seems to be detecting the change but it's not being properly reflected by the graphics. u can't see the cursor, but in this screenshot, it's below the gray bounding rect where the settings button is (which isn't even supposed to be there as far as i know)
22:18 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1432478517978988584/image.png?ex=69013314&is=68ffe194&hm=3f6de69480cc94b43629f90dbdefebad243e9529ccfb3a0b15a3aa26dba13cf7&
22:18 < bridge> <Ewan> hyprland is probably scaling the incorrectly sized buffer being given to it
22:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in kde (+wayland) i can change the window scale, and it works correctly
22:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so dunno
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think it's hyprland thing xdd
22:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i can't change window size at all with the built in mechanisms
22:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i think it's a tiling wm thing
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not even in windowed mode?
22:19 < bridge> <Ewan> correct

22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> of ddnet-rs? i just pulled from main
22:22 < bridge> <Ewan> i also can't seem to paste into it at all
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :/
22:22 < bridge> <b lazu wjelgook.i> how do yall find these at all
22:23 < bridge> <b lazu wjelgook.i> used ddnet-rs for like 20 hours
22:23 < bridge> <b lazu wjelgook.i> still havent come with  single bug
22:23 < bridge> <Ewan> you're on windows right
22:23 < bridge> <Ewan> that's gonna be the most stable experience
22:23 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
22:23 < bridge> <b lazu wjelgook.i> I used ddnet-rs for like 20 hours
22:23 < bridge> <b lazu wjelgook.i> still havent come with a single bug
22:23 < bridge> <b lazu wjelgook.i> I also tried it on linux lmao
22:24 < bridge> <b lazu wjelgook.i> elementaryOs
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i encoured almost all bugs ddnet-rs ever had
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> ubuntu lts based, never tried pantheon but if it supports wayland i might try it
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> i wish gnome was less bloated bcs it had a tiling extension what worked well enough
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> tho im probably spoiled now
22:25 < bridge> <learath2> I had pretty good experience with ddnet-rs too. Nothing really obv broken
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 👀
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> learath used it
22:25 < bridge> <Ewan> stacked wm users
22:26 < bridge> <Ewan> u are the bitch to ur window manager
22:26 < bridge> <Ewan> the window WILL be this size and this is how you will view it
22:26 < bridge> <Ewan> but maybe why it doesn't crash or break too
22:26 < bridge> <b lazu wjelgook.i> :greenthing:
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but tbf it's not impossible winit (the sdl alternative) doing stuff weird. it's defs less stable than sdl.
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> on the other hand side, it's MUCH better designed IMO
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> everything is so much more clear as dev
22:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i agree
22:27 < bridge> <filoqcus> Why is the frame rate -300 in TAB?

22:28 < bridge> <b lazu wjelgook.i> cuz its really annoying
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it needs glass shaders
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> full vibe
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gaussian blur is really expensive

22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you use the ingame aspect ratio?
22:29 < bridge> <b lazu wjelgook.i> wide
22:29 < bridge> <filoqcus> +
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think it has a hardcoded limit
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so this is probs not 999:1
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> upper value is the limit
22:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1432481464158654647/grafik.png?ex=690135d3&is=68ffe453&hm=4700ea6147619421e61ae29cc1e9e60c54cced43a4a24fb7b1688376c1330c14&

22:30 < bridge> <Ewan> if you are capping it i think it should cap at like 4:1 or vice versa bcs that will bypass zoom for zoom locked gamemodes like fng

22:33 < bridge> <Ewan> have u seen that
22:34 < bridge> <Ewan> are u planning to add zoom interpolation
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u on legacy server?
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the only thing that kinda works right is the native vanilla server
22:34 < bridge> <Ewan> ah
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rest is bunch of hacks, that i slowly try to fix
22:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i see

22:35 < bridge> <filoqcus> YAY
22:35 < bridge> <filoqcus> :brownbear:
22:35 < bridge> <Ewan> im assuming it's a bug,it could just be the map
