03:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Gwendal> @noby why atx client is a " cheat client " in ur fng serv ? :x
03:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <abcqwerty> because its considered a cheat client
03:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <noby> it allows zoom
04:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <worstwish> NOO JAO
04:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <worstwish> @jao NOOOO
04:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <worstwish> NOOOOOOOOO
04:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <noby> but @Gwendal there is a way to use this client on my server, afaik there is something in ath settings that turns off playerflags and cheats
04:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <worstwish> UNBLOCK ME

17:00 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ezy> I think it will sink more
17:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ezy> And then go up
17:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ezy> Even more then it did
17:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> Eeh I think Ill just buy more to lower my average buy price

21:57 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Ryozuki opened pull request #995: fix style in ddracecommands.h (master...pr_fix_style_cmd) https://git.io/vNB7q
22:00 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> spam
22:00 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> ‚ù§
22:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @timakro can you explain how the description in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/982 relates to the code change? üôÇ
22:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 what you think about implementing a new command stop_votes <id> <time> to prevent votes from a user (ip based) for that time?
22:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> maybe add that to the `mute` command
22:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki it would be nice if people who are muted could chat with all moderators on the server
22:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> you mean that they should be able to whisper authed people?
22:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> i bet they would only keep insulting
22:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> nah, like "the team channel" can now be used to talk to the moderators
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> also i don't think that should belong to the mute command, spamming chat and funvoting is a bit different
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> you mean a moderator channel?
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> basically
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> and how a player could acccess that channel to talk with them?
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> invited by a mod?
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> muted
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> oh
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> is this really useful?
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki honestly: if people use the non-gameplay elements of the server to annoy other people, we can just strip them of all the privileges
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> otherwise they can now start a kick vote to kick "Ryozuki", reason: idiot
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> yeah, tho they cant kick moderators
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> still
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> so muting should also dissable votes
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> something more?
22:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> oh btw, moving people to spec remains if the user reconnects?
22:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> dunno, are there more nongame features?
22:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> no
22:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> that should be fixed right?
22:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> dunno
22:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> moving to spec is for getting AFK people out of the way, right? or blocker
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> if AFK rejoins, fine
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> i also move blockers sometimes
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> if blocker rejoins, kick?
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> y
22:11 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> but i think its kinda silly moving blockers to spec then
22:11 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> depending on how obviously they're doing it on purpose, you can also kick them
22:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> otherwise it's probably getting their attention
22:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> also, https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/991, the helper rank already exists, so should we change the code to fit that issue or what?
22:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> nah, just add a "vote_no" command
22:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> that does the same as `vote no`
22:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> k
22:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> @heinrich5991 without my change using update in mysql to change the map stars for example updates the release date to the current time
22:36 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @timakro can you explain why?
22:36 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> I see you added `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
22:36 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> what does that mean, what does that change compared to before?
22:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> https://stackoverflow.com/a/2844909/3235192
22:40 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> @heinrich5991
22:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @timakro have you tested this? from what I can read in the linked stackoverflow post, they had a problem because they had `ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` in the `CREATE TABLE` statement
