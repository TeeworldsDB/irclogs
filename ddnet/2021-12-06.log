00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> first of all its fixed, and as far as I know the mod is based on the DDNet 10.3, on the problem I was referring to the network code (not on the mod by itself)
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> there were no changes between the net code and the originally 10.3 net code
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> so where's the problem
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> and btw blockworlds devs wont be happy if i publish a block mod based on theirs
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> first of all its fixed, and as far as I know the mod is based on DDNet 10.3, for the problem I was referring to the network code (not on the mod by itself)
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> they will
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> @ReiTW am i right?:troll:
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then why you do it?

10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> hi @ALittleHappy still waiting for ur invisible tiles remover 😄
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD> its broken for shift values not divisible by 32, I have to repair 😅
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> drive is full
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yikes its this time of the year again

14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @heinrich5991\: any plans to extend your teeworlds archive with demos too? \:D
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i swear last time i had some command to filter all demos with markers in it before deleting them
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i forgot how -,.
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> memoization carrying todays day
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe some math expert did it the math way
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ok i ended up pressing down arrow in the demo browser for 5mins and then sort by marker \:D
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ooh
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> do u even html ryo?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> xd
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> just casual front
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u even <insert random thing> chiller?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:p
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hereby accept the proposal
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 😄 I hope I finally found a good solution, tinkered around too long with this
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like it
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> specially the bonus for 1st
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> makes lot of sense
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Was not that easy to keep all of the motivations, but should work now
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, except the worst rank matters when there are 10 or fewer ranks on a map
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And a big disadvantage is that the calculation is so hard now that people won't do it in their head
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is this applied to the website?
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, that's the plan
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for https://ddnet.tw/ranks/
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean if its live r n
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, I did all calculations by hand so far
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> wanted to get some feedback before I waste time implementing
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would have been cooler if u render the math with latex or smth
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we got it like this on unique xd
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/917447854958719047/unknown.png
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, what's that from?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> timakro invented it
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://uniqueclan.net/ranks
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's quite similar to what I came up with except you have fixed lambda 😄
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> even with the floor and 100
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye xD
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> @deen so new calculation doesnt care whats your rank? even youre teamrank30 but as long as the time is very close then youll get high team points?
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> should maybe rename it to speed points
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> hmm, then i think it solve the problem that people changing team combination and other player cant fit in top 10
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not entirely
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but it removes the main motivation for top racers to spam the top 10
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because by doing so, they hurt their own speed points
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, you mean not just renaming same players, but different combinations, right
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> i think this need more example, hard to notify this from the calculation
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, that works a bit better then
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/917465016066789376/8H9gdV8DsrgXLQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg.png
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @snail say bye to ur job
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :justatest:
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Since 15.6 i am getting a weird bug with mouse movement in ddnet sometimes, it is like an "invisible border", that i cant pass sometimes. its most clear when being in spectator/pause. if i move my mouse to the right for example, at some point it just gets stuck even though i continue to move right at a relatively medium amount of speed.
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> My guess it its connected to Jupeyys mouse input pr.
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have experienced this bug now for the third time, only a client restart helps and i have all three times now checked whether its really nothing with my setup/mouse. on desktop it all works.
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/917487867540930570/ddnet.exe_2021.12.06_-_19.46.50.02.DVR_Trim.mp4
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Not too easy to spot but i think it works

20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: my map archive?
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> heinrich.de
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> "/maps/(maps
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://heinrich5991.de/maps/maps/
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yes
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> when /demos/dempos
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> cuz teehistorian :P
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't see a point of saving individual demos
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> user comntributiosn from non ddnet servers
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> they can be feed into some ML projects
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> why collect maps?
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> We don't have a review system, like in Trackmania multiplayer
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :FeelsBadJonas:
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because other people want to host them
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> maybe other people want to watch them?
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, I haven't heard that wish yet
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ok me neither
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> fair
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> I always wondered when can I watch r1 runs, to get the map easier
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> but it's me only :v
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea maps are more useful i guess
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there were map archives before mine, I just copied what they did
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> probably a waste of space
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> alone 80gigs a year from my side
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you tried compressing them with zstd?
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> why compress?
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> compressed demos cant be viewed
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> do you compress your maps?
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, because they don't take much space
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if they did, I would probably use a compressing file system
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like I do for teehistorian
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i just sorted out the 10secs of good moments and deleted the rest. Which hurt a bit I would have preferred to move them to some free hosting like heinrich.de xd
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> can you access a compressed file?
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> interesting
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in a compressing file system, the file is transparently compressed
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i should look into it for my hentai collection
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can access it like a normal file
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> cool
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> 👀
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> videos are usually already compressed files, those don't compress nicely
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> meh
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> why not make tw demos already compressed?
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> or teehistorian
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> teehistorian because it adds complexity
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably the same for demos
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oke
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> is that why rendering videos is so slow?
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> because it recompresses them?
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> if for example i concatinate two clips why do so much computation
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's probably away to concatenate videos without reencoding
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea sure but generic video editing software does take its time for this job
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> even first ffmpeg command i found took some time
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49371422/how-to-merge-two-videos-without-re-encoding
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ok nice time to auto fetch all clips from twitch and be the first to upload a highlight compilation
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> brb getting rich
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mkv > mp4 change my mind
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mkv and mp4 are just container formats, I thought
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> mp4 \> mkv change my mind
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mkv supports multi channel iirc
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. they don't say a lot about their contents
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does "multi channel" mean?
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but no player supports mkv
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mpv and vlc support them
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they support it
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> vlc even support tw demos
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/917506305365803008/unknown.png
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mkv > better
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but like your average electron app or browser handles mp4 better than mkv
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i encode mkv to mp4 on a daily basis
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mkv allows multiple audio tracks
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which mp4 doesnt
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> this is just an obs warning
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> AV1 > H.265
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u habe to put mkv into other file endings before u can watch tho
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the warning is due to mp4 restrictions u nobo
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no u dont lol
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all my anime is in mkv format
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the fansubs know whatsupp
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk mp4 is more supported
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe in 2008
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The Matroska Multimedia Container is a free and open container format, a file format that can hold an unlimited number of video, audio, picture, or subtitle tracks in one file.
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Matroska is similar in concept to other containers like AVI, MP4, or Advanced Systems Format (ASF), but is entirely open in specification, with implementations consisting mostly of open source software. Matroska file extensions are .mkv for video (which may include subtitles or audio), .mk3d for stereoscopic video, .mka for audio-only files, and .mks for subtitles only
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> both are useful i guess
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ❯ echo "hello" >> /dev/full
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bash: echo: write error: No space left on device
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> TIL
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/full
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lmao
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > a special file that always returns the error code ENOSPC (meaning "No space left on device") on writing, and provides an infinite number of zero bytes to any process that reads from it (similar to /dev/zero). This device is usually used when testing the behaviour of a program when it encounters a "disk full" error.
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thats nice to make software not crash when disk is full
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> for testing
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> which no developer ever does
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like ddnet
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😀
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> like linux
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make the log file write to /dev/full
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder what happens
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nothing
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ddnet ignores io erros left and right
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> errors*

21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> lol didnt know griefing github projects is a thing 😄
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @NeXus\: ye rare but funny i collect a few here https://github.com/ChillerDragon/github-meta/issues/1
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some links give 404
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> oh nice idea 😄
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u should have saved the archive links
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hmm
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> like some other archive site?
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> external
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://archive.org/
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> idk i prefer native links
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but yea those links might die
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but they dont exist bro
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/thelinuxchoice/instashell/pull/69

21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is gold
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> that one was funny i think
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector/issues/223>
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> iirc he replaced his name in credits and nothing else in the pr
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> how did I miss the meme culture in github
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> this is gold
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its not frequent
