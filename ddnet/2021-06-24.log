12:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We are getting a lot more bans on the servers, maybe it's time to optimize the meh hashmap we have for bans?
13:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> implement a hashmap with quadratic probing and SIMD lookup
13:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha, i totally know what the first thing means
13:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At the order of magnitude we are at, maybe a sorted vector with simd bsearch would work better
13:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what is the order of magnitude
13:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how many bans are there
13:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can see it being in the hundreds soon
13:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
13:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i have over 1000 i need this
13:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
13:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For thousands I’m not sure, we should benchmark this
13:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe just a better hashmap would work
13:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i profiled the code and the ban checking takes up surprisingly little cpu even with this many
13:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <noby> (also it ignores the banlist for inforequests)
13:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With many it should be much more efficient
13:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With little it’s actually a lot of overhead from hashing I presume
13:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can use a faster hash algorithm
13:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This naive one is pretty fast
13:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its CNetBan right?
13:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @noby Could you also benchmark it with 1k, 10k, 100k, 1M, ... bans to see how it scales? Then we know when we need to optimize it, if ever
13:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im about to sleep but i should try this yes
13:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess something like 1-2 ms is fine
13:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no hurry, just in general

23:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 any idea about mac ddnet not starting? https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/discussions/0/3104642254782501629/?tscn=1624557296
23:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> he deleted his post?
23:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no you need to be logged in
23:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I am, but the link goes nowhere but to discussions
23:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> weird, I get to the exact post when logged in, anyway, I will try on mac and see what's going wrong
23:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Someone else has issues on Mac in #bugs
23:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> maybe same guy? ^^
