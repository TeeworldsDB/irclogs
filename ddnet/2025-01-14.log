00:04 < bridge> <Ewan> so it‚Äôs a library
00:04 < bridge> <Ewan> that‚Äôs what i was missing
00:04 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
01:14 < bridge> <pioooooo> : when i decide to push before create a pr & sleep

06:38 < bridge> <hectavoxel> Did anyone answer this yet? The thing is, I made a psudeo-filter but it's really jank and leaves artifacts everywhere.
07:47 < bridge> <Ewan> std::copy_if
07:47 < bridge> <Ewan> is the stl way to do that
07:48 < bridge> <Ewan> actually you need iterators
07:48 < bridge> <Ewan> i'd have to look at code
07:48 < bridge> <Ewan> im going sleep
08:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> hmmm alright
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> good morning
08:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft sleep well
10:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Good morning, rust up?
10:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> rust stable
10:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sometimes i end up getting a map from downloadedmaps when in the editor i say load current map but i also have that map in my regular maps folder
10:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then i dont notice edit the map reload and get really confused
10:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dont we check the maps/ folder before the downloadedmaps/ folder? I dont recall this kind of stuff happening back in the days
10:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh i fighured out the root cause hmm thats fair
10:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so when you edit the map and the local server did not reload yet you end up in that situation not sure if it is fixable
10:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but at least we could throw a warning when you try to edit downloadedmaps/ since that really should not be a workflow then the hash in the filename becomes misleading
11:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jupeyy_keks why does a speedup layer count 3 and a tune layer count 1 i do not understand the pattern here
11:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/a3c667974b2aede95e2c1ebac12c38f75651a90c/src/game/client/components/maplayers.cpp#L1312

11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs speedlayer has 3 visible params, and tune only 1
11:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice thanks!

14:25 < bridge> <animepdf> not going into ddnet client anyway
14:25 < bridge> <animepdf> just fun feature to share
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i tested it with a few ppl too, and tbh it sounds cooler than it is xD
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> teeworlds is too dynamic and u often don't hear the others. maybe a game mode where team play isn't essential it works (like how it works in among us)
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> the proof is u can speedrun with a partner with 0 voice chat
14:59 < bridge> <aslanabi6155> dnet download
15:09 < bridge> <louis> voice chat is good for pvp modes though
15:10 < bridge> <louis> u always have all information in ddrace
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> especially in pvp it was annoying
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can only scream a single word
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then the player was gone again xd
15:16 < bridge> <Lillei> Not proximity
15:16 < bridge> <louis> ye with proximity it's probably troll ü§£
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah ok vc only maybe good if u dont play with friends
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ig in pvp the traffic problem wouldn't be as bad either
15:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs broadcasting the voice packets of a single player to up to 64players is not cheap üòÑ
15:48 < bridge> <kekomonter> We will test this on TF servers with block and fng xdd
15:50 < bridge> <murpi> @jupeyy_keks Implement a pencil weapon and allow people to draw on map backgrounds
16:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you want to implement a skribbl io mod or what üòÑ
16:11 < bridge> <zhn> nah, better map testers <-> map creators communication
16:15 < bridge> <louis> we need wrench weapon that can place all sorts of block with radial selector overlay
16:15 < bridge> <louis> for this
16:15 < bridge> <louis> and add a pencil mode to the wrench
16:16 < bridge> <louis> i will pay 25 burgers to whoeber adds this
16:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> Add Redstone üó£Ô∏è
17:31 < bridge> <01000111g> Add worldedit
17:36 < bridge> <eidderFsT> minetee
17:40 < bridge> <zhn> lowkey nodes
18:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> new clang just dropped
18:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> time to add .clangd config to ddnet 
18:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 if you dislike redirect layers what are my chances of getting it merged? I really think it is a cool feature that should go into ddnet
18:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i spent 2 days making it work and i am now polishing out the bugs
18:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a feature that is easy to use and has more code is better than something that is too hard to find or figure out for users with less code
18:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also i agree more code is always worse but i think you are taking it a bit too far and stalling feature development
18:18 < bridge> <hectavoxel> honestly it feels like a very niche thing only like, 3 maps are going to use
18:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it is already use a lot in custom servers
18:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for example ugblocker
18:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but in a weird way that requires configs and the entities look cursed for players
18:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but yea for ddnet i only see 1 map that uses it maybe linear too not sure what the blocker situation is there
18:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and that also depends on the redirect protocol to be finally extended to allow redirecting to different ips
18:27 < bridge> <avolicious> I get this point, it might be fun for some splitted maps, but can you make the redirect with a password?
18:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea redirect with password would be really cool! but i think heinrich rejected that in favor of accounts
19:23 < bridge> <Ewan> the deen
19:23 < bridge> <0xdeen> I didn't know the CTO of Databricks and Apache Spark creator did water rendering physics for 0 A.D. üòÑ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matei_Zaharia
20:07 < bridge> <avolicious> But what has redirection to do with accounts?
20:07 < bridge> <avolicious> They are different things
20:07 < bridge> <zhn> for client state to share i thing
20:07 < bridge> <zhn> like cookies
20:07 < bridge> <zhn> i think*
20:08 < bridge> <avolicious> Mhmmm, it does sound like two things for me
20:08 < bridge> <avolicious> Accounts are accounts & redirection is redirection
20:08 < bridge> <avolicious> It only allows to redirect on the same ip, just a different port
20:08 < bridge> <zhn> have to be something related with security and cookie hijacking and blah blah blah
21:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 have u ever seen the onetime buffer flag?
21:38 < bridge> <robyt3> You mean related to the crash? I've seen it in the code.
21:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The crash should be fixed regardless, but I think the idea of the flag was that a text cannot be bigger than how big our MAX_VERTEX_COUNT is
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that assumption is one of the reasons vk is so much faster in text rendering
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs it reuses buffers as much as possible
21:39 < bridge> <robyt3> ah, but it's being used for all `TextEx` rendering
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do we need 65k  character support?
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we can always increase the buffer ig
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or the text renderer has to flush (it probs has to anyway for opengl 1.x)
21:40 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, if that's possible that seems optimal, though limiting to some maximum amount of text instead of crashing would also be sane
22:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can i not add a format specifier in dbg_asserts?
22:21 < bridge> <robyt3> no, it doesn't have vararg support right now
