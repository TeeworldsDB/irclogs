17:40 < F1rSt> deen: Hi
17:40 < F1rSt> deen: i have decided to run persian ddnet 
17:41 < F1rSt> and we will buy an internet server this time
17:41 < F1rSt> deen: in iran we have an organization called FATA which can help us when someone attacks us and will track and arrest the attacker person
17:42 < F1rSt> deen: i made a friend with one of its employees which he can help us completely
17:42 < fstd> forget it
17:42 < F1rSt> forget what?
17:43 < fstd> "track the attacker person"
17:43 < F1rSt> we can
17:43 < F1rSt> :)
17:44 < F1rSt> it is a strong organization
17:44 < F1rSt> and actually we dont have professional attackers in iran
17:44 < F1rSt> they just have the tool and they use it
17:44 < F1rSt> tracking them is easy
17:44 <@EastByte> the attacks aren't coming from inside of iran
17:44 < F1rSt> we have professional attackers but not in teeworlds fortunately
17:44 < fstd> ddos traffic typically originates from compromised devices, or amplifiers which are sent packets with spoofed addresses
17:45 < fstd> there is nothing by which the attacker could be tracked, regardless of how strong whatever organization is
17:45 < F1rSt> you know its not my job to track them
17:45 < F1rSt> its the organization
17:45 < F1rSt> which has access to everything in iran
17:45 <@EastByte> but clearly it's impossible to do so
17:45 < F1rSt> they say they can
17:46 < F1rSt> so they should track the attacker
17:46 < fstd> a lot of people say a lot of things
17:46 < F1rSt> they are not "people"
17:46 < F1rSt> its an official org
17:46 < fstd> are they wizards?
17:46 < fstd> because unless they are, they cannot.  regardless of whatever they are or are not
17:48 < F1rSt> they can track him from isp
17:48 < F1rSt> they check logs and they find the attacker
17:48 < F1rSt> and there is not much to search
17:48 < fstd> that would imply you know that ISP he uses
17:48 < fstd> that information is not contained in the ddos traffic
17:49 < fstd> and also not deducible from that by any technical means
17:52 < fstd> anyway, just wait for your first ddos and see for yourself how the mighty organization can't do shit about it :)
17:55 <@EastByte> well, there still would be the possibility to track down an attacker based on tw logs
17:55 <@EastByte> but that will turn every player into a potential cyber criminal
18:10 < F1rSt> EastByte: we exactly know the attackers' names
18:11 < F1rSt> thats why i waited for 6 months
18:11 < F1rSt> i wanted to run persian ddnet exactly before when deen left
18:11 < F1rSt> but i stopped
18:11 < F1rSt> and searched more
18:12 < F1rSt> and now most of them know that we work with FATA organization
18:12 < F1rSt> so most of them scare :P :D
18:51 < ragent> good day:)
20:23 <@deen> "FATA (Persian: فتا‎‎) is a unit of the Islamic Republic of Iran Police, founded in January 2011. In December 2012, the head of Tehran's cyber police unit was dismissed in relation to the death of Iranian blogger Sattar Beheshti, who was being held in the cyber police's custody."
20:23 <@deen> I'm not sure that we should work together with them against DDoSers^^
20:24 <@deen> and I'm very much against intranet servers
20:25 <@EastByte> I guess he wants to run a normal server
20:25 <@EastByte> "and we will buy an internet server this time"
22:48 <@deen> ah
