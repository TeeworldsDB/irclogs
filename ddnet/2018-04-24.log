10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nyanto> I can't play on Ger, i have a rly hard slideshow becouse of antiping, players are just teleporting
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nyanto> ping 120
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nyanto> why it's happening*
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nyanto> why it's happening?
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nyanto> played with Xola, he has same ping, but no problems for him
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nyanto> only on my side
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sounds like packet loss
21:26 <+Davide> Hello guys
21:26 <+Davide> I can have help for one thing?
21:27 <+Learath2> Davide: not if you don't ask
21:28 <+Davide> True c.c
21:28 <+Davide> Ok go in pvt pls

21:53 <+Davide> Ok, i have this errors
21:53 <@heinrich5991> mh
21:53 <@heinrich5991> sounds like you're missing a c++ compiler
21:54 <+Davide> Strange
21:54 <@heinrich5991> have you installed `build-essential` or `build-essentials`?
21:54 <+Davide> I check
21:54 <@heinrich5991> type `g++ --version` into the terminal
21:54 <+Davide> Oh, installed
21:54 <+Davide> I try now
21:55 <+Davide> Ok build done now
21:55 <+Davide> Ok another thing
21:55 <+Davide> I need to build it with Mysql enabled
21:55 <+Davide> How i can do?
21:56 <@heinrich5991> the general instructions are located at the bottom of https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
21:57 <+Davide> Ok thanks
22:02 <+Davide> Ok done, compiled with database 
22:02 <+Davide> But.. Where i need to put mysql details?
22:04 <+Davide> mine.cfg?
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> mysql.cfg

22:08 <+Davide> Ok thx
22:09 <+Davide> teeworlds is name of table?
22:11 <@heinrich5991> it's the name of the database
22:11 <@heinrich5991> `record` is the prefix of the table names
22:12 <+Davide> Ok
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how does one sell a phone?
22:29 <+Davide> Ebay
22:29 <+Davide> Lol
22:29 <+Davide>  root@vps2025:~/ddnet/build/ddnet-sql# mysql -u root -p'x' teeworlds < record_race.sql ERROR 1070 (42000) at line 25: Too many key parts specified; max 16 parts allowed
22:29 <+Davide> I'm testing with ddnet db
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm, never sold anything on ebay, might check it out
22:29 <+Davide> But i have some errors
22:30 <+Davide> I think is too many large the db file
22:30 <+Davide> Right?
22:30 <@deen> Davide: Why are you trying to import the ddnet db btw?
22:31 <+Davide> For test the server
22:31 <+Davide> I'm fellowing the guide
22:31 <+Davide> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
22:32 <@deen> Hm, probably because you're using MySQL and we use MariaDB
22:32 <+Davide> Yes
22:32 <+Davide> D;
22:32 <+Davide> Ok
22:32 <@deen> Didn't know they have this limitation
22:34 <+Davide> Yes now i try with mariadb
22:35 <@heinrich5991> it's a bit weird that we don't have a primary key in our db ^^
22:35 <@deen> oh, we do apparently
22:35 <@deen> that's weird
22:35 <@heinrich5991> huh?
22:35 <@deen>   PRIMARY KEY (`Map`,`Name`,`Timestamp`,`Time`,`Server`,`cp1`,`cp2`,`cp3`,`cp4`,`cp5`,`cp6`,`cp7`,`cp8`,`cp9`,`cp10`,`cp11`,`cp12`,`cp13`,`cp14`,`cp15`,`cp16`,`cp17`,`cp18`,`cp19`,`cp20`,`cp21`,`cp22`,`cp23`,`cp24`,`cp25`),
22:35 <@deen> that's in our db export
22:35 <@heinrich5991> yes
22:36 <@heinrich5991> no explicit key = everything is key
22:36 <@deen> maybe because we added GameID
22:36 <@deen> GameID is missing, not everything
22:36 <@heinrich5991> oh
22:37 <@deen> smells like a mistake, right?
22:37 <@heinrich5991> yes, but nothing bad
22:37 <@deen> and I'm also not 100% happy that our keys from ddnet.tw are exported anyway
22:37 <@deen> they are only used on ddnet.tw for website stuff, not needed generally
22:38 <@heinrich5991> keys?
22:38 <@deen> indices
22:38 <@heinrich5991> ok. I think I'm too unfamiliar with DBs
22:39 <@deen> anyway, Davide: you can try deleting line 57 in record_race.sql
22:39 <@deen> heinrich5991: want to look for a fix for the primary key or should IÃŸ
22:39 <@deen> ?
22:39 <@heinrich5991> I don't understand the problem yet tbh
22:39 <+Davide> I've already done with mariadb
22:40 <@deen> Davide: works with mariadb?
22:40 <+Davide> Yes
22:40 <@deen> ah, great
22:40 <@deen> then I'll just "alter table record_race drop primary key;"
22:41 <+Davide> Good xD
22:41 <@heinrich5991> ok? ^^
22:41 <+Davide> Notepad++ have problems with record_race.sql too many length HAHAHAHA
22:43 <@heinrich5991> Davide: you'd need an editor specializing in huge files
22:43 <@deen> or enough ram
22:43 <+Davide> I know heinrich
22:43 <+Davide> No Deen
22:43 <+Davide> xD
22:43 <+Davide> More ram don't help in this case
22:43 <@deen> that's my main problem with vim and large files, filling up memory
22:44 <+Davide> I hate vim
22:44 <@deen> ah, and particulary long lines
22:44 <@deen> like this file having one huge line I guess
22:44 <+Davide> I prefer nano or ee
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sublime is pretty good in loading insane files, they do some lazy loading iirc
22:53 <+Davide> Where i can downlaod the structure of db?=
22:53 <+Davide> Db?
22:53 <+Davide> Without data
22:53 <@heinrich5991> the ddnet server can initialize the db itself IIRC
22:53 <@deen> yeah, if you don't need the data, don't need to download anything
22:54 <@deen> just set up the mysql connection data and set sv_use_sql 1
22:58 <+Davide> Guys?
22:58 <@deen> yes?
22:58 <+Davide> Oh
22:58 <+Davide> Sorry lol
22:58 <+Davide> Some connection problems
22:58 <+Davide> I read now
22:58 <+Davide> Thanks Deen
23:00 <@deen> someone should add some notes about how to set up your own server with mysql and separately how to import our db and why you probably don't want to do that
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> but need import database to make good fake server

23:04 <+Davide> Ah
23:04 <+Davide> Ok wait
23:04 <+Davide> xD
23:04 <@deen> hm no
23:04 <@deen> that doesn't exist anymore
23:05 <+Davide> Same error

23:05 <+Davide> What o.o
23:05 <@deen> and the default should be true, not false
23:06 <+Davide> I'm not understanding
23:06 <@deen> add_sqlserver w teeworlds record teeworlds "PW2" "localhost" "3306" 1
23:06 <+Davide> Yes i know
23:06 <+Davide> There already exist
23:06 <@deen> there's a 1 at the end :D
23:07 <@deen> that's not documented
23:07 <@heinrich5991> deen: db seems to have problems
23:07 <+Davide> lol
23:07 <@heinrich5991> you did anything in the last two minutes?
23:07 <@deen> yeah, I guess my db fix was a bit more expensive than I expected
23:07 <+Davide> 1 added and now work
23:07 <+Davide> Thanks Deen
23:07 <@heinrich5991> failed_mysql.sql, here we come ;)
23:08 <@heinrich5991> thanks for EastByte's? failsafe
23:08 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vpZAi
23:08 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 3f7b183 def: Set up DB by default
23:09 <+Davide> After first run, i need to replace 1 with 0 and remove sv_sql_create_tables 1 ?
23:09 <@heinrich5991> no need to remove it, no
23:09 <+Davide> Ok
23:09 <+Davide> But.. If i re-run say me this 
23:09 <+Davide> [2018-04-24 22:08:46][sql]: sql connection established [2018-04-24 22:08:46][sql]: Tables were created successfully [2018-04-24 22:08:46][sql]: sql connection established [2018-04-24 22:08:46][sql]: Tables were created successfully
23:09 <+Davide> Recreated? What
23:09 <@heinrich5991> it executes a
23:10 <@heinrich5991> "CREATE TABLES â€¦ IF NOT EXISTS"
23:10 <+Davide> Ah
23:10 <+Davide> Ok
23:10 <+Davide> Good
23:10 <@deen> so after the initial creation you can set the 1 to 0
23:10 <@deen> or leave it, doesn't matter
23:10 <+Davide> Yes ok :)
23:10 <@deen> Query OK, 2936730 rows affected (27 min 37.36 sec) 
23:10 <+Davide> xD
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> damn, we sure have a lot of rows
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen what was the query?
23:11 <@deen> alter table record_race drop primary key;
23:11 <@deen> which apparently recreates the table :D
23:11 <@heinrich5991> query seems to be done now
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if we still had CAN in the loop that query would have been quite a problem ðŸ˜„
23:13 <@deen> isn't that whywe removed it?
23:13 <@deen> not enough disk for any fun
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, I think it was stuck on some query
23:15 <+Davide> Anyway, server work good
23:16 <+Davide> Thanks Deen
23:16 <+Davide> Deen
23:16 <+Davide> You know where i can download all Gores maps?
23:17 <@deen> from KoG?
23:17 <+Davide> On KoG site download of Maps zip is broken
23:17 <@deen> or the ones we have on ddnet?
23:17 <+Davide> Kog
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @qshar please fix ^
23:17 <+Davide> xD
23:17 <@deen> or manually here: https://maps.ddnet.tw/
23:17 <+Davide> D;
23:18 <+Davide> But i need gores maps c.c
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> http://www.qshar.com/#mapss
23:19 <@deen> wait for qshar to fix the maps zip
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> http://www.qshar.com/maps.zip
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 404
23:19 <+Davide> Ok deen
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> ^^
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> I'll send you tomorrow
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @qshar where do you host qshar.com?
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it doesn't have https
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> nfo
23:20 <+Davide> i don't like nfo lol
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> I know, I'm lazy :)
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @qshar I'd help you set it up if you want
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> â€“ can I also have a copy of your maps?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for the map collection
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> y, sure - I'll update the maps zip file on the website tomorrow
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cool
23:22 <+Davide> Good xD
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> and yes, I think its time to implement https certificate ;) I delayed this task for too long
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Davide: nfo is the only people who will take us tw guys, no-one else wants to take our ddos
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @qshar letsencrypt is quite simple
23:24 <+Davide> Learath2, if you want you can try my hosting company
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> Well, I'm going to check this out tomorrow )
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Davide: doubt they'll want us with our 24/365 ddos ðŸ˜›
23:25 <+Davide> I want 
23:25 <+Davide> I love improve my protection with tests
23:26 <+Davide> For now it is impenetrable as far as I know
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> nfo has a great separate firewall that my scripts set up automatically. I helps to filter up to 70% of ddos attacks
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we'd just take down all your customers with us and we'd all be yelled at ðŸ˜„
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> nfo has a great separate firewall and my server scripts set it up automatically. I helps to filter up to 70% of ddos attacks
23:26 <+Davide> Learath2, this is not possible
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you have infinite bandwidth? nothing is impossible to take down
23:27 <+Davide> Try
23:27 <+Davide> Lowhosting.org
23:27 <+Davide> Try to get down
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that yours?
23:27 <+Davide> Yes :)
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean, we could try
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not like I have a botnet
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (we could try hosting ddnet servers there)
23:28 <+Davide> I've no problems if you want to try
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Feel free to ask our resident criminals vali, sp someone and ezy they all are well equipped to give it a try
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> xD
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're reselling OVH vps?
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we've had problems there before
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> Didn't you try OVH servers?
23:29 <+Davide> I'm partner of OVH
23:29 <+Davide> :)
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> ah
23:29 <+Davide> My server are on OVH datacenter, firewall done by me.
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we dropped OVH after they null routed us a couple times and didn't respond to deen's support requests on time
23:30 <+Davide> Try my server lol
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we could try hosting GER2 on it
23:30 <+Davide> Okay
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that would be up to deen
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe we should wait until we get some better protection against reflection
23:31 <+Davide> Reflection is not an problem
23:32 <+Davide> Reflection is not a problem
23:32 <+Davide> (For my servers)
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> of course it's a problem it amplifies any kind of attack
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> why don't you like NFO? they null-routed me only few times for a short period
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> unless you have some tech from asgard that we missed
23:33 <+Davide> Nfo is bypassable
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @qshar I don't think nfo ever null routed us
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> you are lucky. I even got a message from them that they are sorry about that ;)
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My mailbox is full of "(D)DoS attack against your service (for ddnetger/virtual)"
23:34 <+Davide> Lol
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> nfo has a firewall that can handle with filtering some packets
23:35 <+Davide> Qshar
23:35 <+Davide> I don't like Nfo because there are very very very much method to bypass it
23:35 <+Davide> methods*
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bypass what? their firewall?
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> to bypass what
23:36 <+Davide> Yes
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> how
23:36 <+Davide> Ok
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a firewall is a firewall is a firewall, it's as good as the rules you craft
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> yep
23:36 <+Davide> Use synack purple with 1/1.5Gbps (Of TCP) and nfo fall
23:37 <+Davide> Easy
23:38 <+Davide> With good 2Gbps spoofed server and good script like synack purple nfo fall on every case
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> did you try it with the firewall that disables all tcp connections?
23:40 <+Davide> Same thing, try with good UDP script and it fall
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> Well, its not perfect for huge DoS attacks, I know. but for most others it handle well
23:40 <+Davide> With 5-6 Gbps of Spoofed UDP and about 4-5kk of pps
23:40 <+Davide> And it fall
23:41 <+Davide> Yes qshar
23:42 <+Davide> Ok i've done one server with ddnet maps (for testing)
23:42 <+Davide> 37.59.160.156
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How would you filter that out without filtering out all udp? unless it's some set pattern any firewall protecting a game server will have a hard time with it
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> besides nfo handles udp floods just fine (no idea what you mean by spoofed btw) , catches similar lengths, attributes, types pretty well
23:46 <+Davide> All filters are preimposted on slave server and on firewall, if you need (I think you don't need this) you can add custom rules on our firewall with the panel or with iptables/others like this 
23:46 <+Davide> Learath2
23:47 <+Davide> Spoofed = Header IP modification on packets
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> on the ip layer?
23:47 <+Davide> I speak about attackers
23:47 <+Davide> All (Good) attacks are spoofed (obv)
23:48 <+Davide> And need one spoofed server for do this
23:48 <+Davide> I don't speak about botnet
23:48 <+Davide> Botnet is shit (For me)
23:50 <+Davide> more powerful attacks are done by spoofed servers not botnet
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually the record attacks are all reflection/amplification attacks rather then spoofed attacks, rarely does a server have enough bandwidth to pull off an attack itself
23:52 <+Davide> ..
23:52 <+Davide> Learath2..
23:52 <+Davide> For do amplified attack you need one spoofed server..
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and the biggest recorded attack that doesn't involve a reflection/amplification is iirc by Mirai at 300gbps
23:52 <+Davide> Without spoofing you can't do reflected attack!
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ofc, but flooding from one server is quite inefficient
23:52 <+Davide> You understand me ?
23:53 <+Davide> Anyway, now you can't do good mirai :/
23:53 <+Davide> 2-3 years ago yes
23:53 <+Davide> Now no
23:53 <+Davide> Now you've more difficulty to do good botnet
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also besides I don't see how you can tell apart a reflection attack from a botnet flooding except by analysing the source of the flood and applying some heuristics, all of which are irrelevant during an attack as traffic is traffic is traffic
23:56 <+Davide> Yes don't care 
23:56 <+Davide> Anyway
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways, if deen feels up to it we might give one of your servers a go on GER2
23:56 <+Davide> Learath2, you can join on test server and tell me if is all ok?
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't have tw on this computer and have a ripping headache, can't look at screens for more then 10s at a time
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can try
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> name?
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 37.59.160.156
23:58 <+Davide> Yes 37.59.160.156
