00:26 <@deen> Looks like I'll have to do https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/251 soon. RAM already reaching 92% on ddnet.tw server
00:30 <@deen> Just was reminded of this, wanted to write it an eternity ago: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/302
00:40 < Lady> good evening
00:41 <@deen> hi Lady
01:11 < nuborn> hi
01:14 < Chairn> and another timeout but internet is fine
01:17 <@deen> Chairn: f1, conn_timeout
01:17 <@deen> what value is set?
01:17 < Chairn> 100
01:18 <@deen> and you had timeout in less than 100 seconds?
01:18 < Chairn> timeout protection used instantly, so nice work east ;)
01:18 < Chairn> instant timeout
01:20 < daBossInDaHouse> is there any econ command? sv_econ_port ? can't find it
01:21 <@heinrich5991> daBossInDaHouse: I think it's ec_port or so
01:21 < daBossInDaHouse> but it exist?
01:21 <@deen> econ? =/
01:21 <@deen> i didn't remove econ in ddnet source yet?^^
01:22 <@deen> i really prefer my fifos
01:22 < daBossInDaHouse> what?! why you want it to be removed?
01:22 <@deen> i don't know, I've never used them
01:23 <@heinrich5991> deen: about those fifos, are they threadsafe?
01:25 <@deen> heinrich5991: hm, are they indeed?^^
01:25 <@heinrich5991> (they looked pretty wonky when I looked at them ^^)
01:25 <@deen> now that you say it, would probably be good to fix that^^
01:31 < relas> ragequit
04:36 < Chairn> finally, the custom background feature seems in a good way now
04:36 < Chairn> no more segfault
04:36 < Chairn> just a lil problem, i got a background, but the tee is now rendered in the bottom right place of the screen :(
04:38 <@deen> sounds like a major issue^^
04:38 < Chairn> i show you a screen :P
04:39 < Chairn> http://i18.servimg.com/u/f18/11/55/83/62/screen10.png
04:39 < Chairn> bonus: find the map
04:40 < Chairn> second bonus: find the map that furnished the background
04:40 < Chairn> that provided*
04:56 < Chairn> fixed ^^
04:56 <@deen> great
04:56 < Chairn> just have to clean up the code, and i guess i'll make the pr tomorrow
04:57 < Chairn> but i think ill wait, to let people test
13:19 < SideTrack> hey everyone
13:19  * SideTrack slaps Q around a bit with a large fishbot
14:20 < Savander> Yay, teeworlds released!
14:20 < Savander> D:
14:22 <@heinrich5991> why D:?
14:22 < Savander> wrong emote -> :D
14:22 <@heinrich5991> =)
14:22 < Savander> btw, it's simple
14:22 < Savander> to repleace ddnet with teeworlds
14:22 < Savander> xd
14:22 < Savander> still teeworlds but, on steam :PP
14:25 < Savander> https://steamdb.info/app/380840/
14:25 < Savander> 16 in game
14:25 < Savander> now
14:28 <@heinrich5991> uhm
14:28 <@heinrich5991> it seems you can't actually install the game via steam (?)
14:28 < Savander> why?
14:28 <@heinrich5991> has anyone actually tried that? ^^
14:28 < Savander> i can
14:28 < Savander> i installed it
14:29 <@heinrich5991> but you installed it before it was released?
14:29 < Savander> uhm
14:29 < Savander> i don't remember
14:29 < Savander> maybe?
14:29 < WolfAlex> Savander: i can not download it ._.
14:29 < Savander> huh, wait
14:29 < Savander> i'll try
14:30 < WolfAlex> wtf Received a CTCP VERSION from heinrich5991
14:30 <@heinrich5991> wanted to know your OS
14:30 < WolfAlex> arch
14:30 <@heinrich5991> (ctcp is client-to-client protocol, can be used to get the client name/version/os)
14:30 < Savander> heinrich5991, 
14:31 < Savander> i downloaded now teeworlds
14:31 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/WcoFKhLT7703
14:31 < Savander> nad it works
14:31 <@heinrich5991> WolfAlex: I guess the install button is not there?
14:32 < WolfAlex> heinrich5991: nop
14:32 < Savander> You need to add this game to library
14:32 < Savander> then in library
14:32 < Savander> install it
14:34 <@EastByte> no idea how to do that
14:34 < WolfAlex> Savander: there is only 'wishlist' and 'following'
14:34 < Savander> o.O?
14:34 < Savander> heinrich5991,  maybe something wrong in
14:34 < Savander> creator page
14:34 < Savander> ??
14:36 < Savander> Huh, weird
14:37 < o_be_one> hello
14:37 <@EastByte> hi o_be_one 
14:41 < Savander> Weird
15:13 <@deen> There is now a feed for new map releases, hope it works fine: http://ddnet.tw/releases/
15:17 <@EastByte> cool
15:18 <@deen> next I'll try the same for the website news
15:18 <@EastByte> deen: can you release verification?
15:18 <@EastByte> I don't have time :/
15:19 <@deen> sure, I'll just release it right now :P
15:19 <@EastByte> okay, it was planned for midday
15:19 < Savander> now is midday
15:19 <@EastByte> indeed!
15:19 < Savander> ^^>
15:20 <@EastByte>  afk
15:20 <@deen> I'm wondering if I should take my laptop on my Europe tour or finally buy a smartphone
15:20 <@deen> not sure if i'd manage to fix serious server problems from smartphone
15:20 < Savander> i think, better laptop
15:22 <@deen> yeah, but so much to carry, hmmm
15:25 < ochristi> let someone else fix server issues? :D
15:30 <@deen> ochristi: i don't know if anyone will understand the chaos of ddnet servers :P
15:31 <@deen> and there's so much that can go wrong with these weird hosters
15:31 < Nimda> Verification 3.2 by Silex just released on Solo at 2015-08-24 15:21
15:32 < ochristi> l
15:32 < ochristi> whoops wrong keyboard
15:32 < ochristi> hmm hmm
15:33 < ochristi> not sure how to approach this issue
15:39 <@deen> usually by teaching someone all the stuff
15:40 < ochristi> jup
15:41 < ochristi> well you need volunteers who are trustworthy and know their way around console I guess
15:42 <@deen> EastByte is such a volunteer, he's been releasing maps recently, which is also quite a few steps: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/map-release
15:42 < o_be_one> hey wanted to know, am i allowed to run a custom ddnet server ? I mean is it ok if my r0x.fr ddnet bin had custom features (i dont talk about canada) ?
15:43 <@deen> o_be_one: and still call it "DDraceNetwork" mod or what?
15:43 <@deen> Lady: hi
15:43 < o_be_one> and let the origina ddnet name yes
15:43 < o_be_one> DDraceNetwork
15:43 < Lady> hmm
15:43 <@deen> o_be_one: that's totally fine to me, even better if you can make a PR with the changes
15:43 < o_be_one> i've a dev who dev member and raimbow based on latest DDNet sources
15:44 <@deen> oh right, rainbow
15:44 < o_be_one> well thats the problem, i'll be happy to help and i'll try to tell him to PR it
15:44 < Lady> deen where is Zeta-Hoernchen?
15:44 <@deen> Lady: apparently not here
15:44 < o_be_one> but i know you dont like that ...
15:44 <@deen> can't remember seeing him here for some time
15:45 < o_be_one> Lady: theres nimda, maybe theres seen feature
15:45 <@deen> o_be_one: yeah, but maybe it shouldn't matter so much what I personally like
15:45 <@deen> o_be_one: we can see what other people in this channel say
15:45 <@deen> !seen Zeta-Hoernchen
15:45 < Nimda> I don't know Zeta-Hoernchen.
15:45 <@deen> Nope, was never here
15:45 < o_be_one> well i just don't want to do a bad thing for DDNet, thats why i'm asking if i can host this and it's ok for you, and i'll purpose to the dev to pr it too
15:45 < Lady> oh?
15:46 <@heinrich5991> Lady: I can contact him, what do you need?
15:46 <@heinrich5991> ...
15:46 <@deen> o_be_one: well, i would disable it on the official ddnet servers of course
15:46 < Lady> what did you say?
15:46 <@heinrich5991> Lady: I can contact him, what do you need?
15:46 < Lady> him
15:46 <@heinrich5991> zeta-hoernchen
15:47 < Lady> or Obst
15:47 <@heinrich5991> Lady: just come to teamspeak clan-nut.de I guess
15:48 < o_be_one> no problem deen i understand :). My players will be happy again to get features they liked from XXLTomate/XXLDDrace on my servers, i'll try to get new ideas, i'm happy to have a good dev, long time ago didnt get one !
15:48 <@heinrich5991> (zeta-hoernchen is there)
15:51 <@heinrich5991> Lady: there he is
15:55 < Lady> ok thanks
15:57 <@heinrich5991> (the Speedy_Consoles is zeta-hoernchen :))
15:57 < Lady> what?
15:58 < Savander> heinrich5991, steam://install/380840
15:58 < Savander> it works
15:58 < Savander> copy -> paste it into browser
16:38 <@deen> Ok, now also with a bit of a redesign of the news (hope someone will make a proper design, I'm lazy), permalinks for news items and a feed: http://ddnet.tw/
16:56 < Chairn> tw has been released on steam :o
16:57 < Savander> yeas
16:57 < Savander> https://steamdb.info/app/380840/
16:57 < Savander> press "Free"
16:57 < Savander> to download
16:57 < Savander> something wrong on steam page
16:57 < Savander> :/
16:57 <@heinrich5991> Savander: it should be fixed
16:57 < Savander> yes?
16:58 <@heinrich5991> is it fixed?
16:58 < Savander> i don't know
16:58 < Savander> it works
16:58 < Savander> for me
16:58 < Savander> (it worked)
16:58 < Savander> on this site
16:58 < Savander> 100 players online now
16:58 < Savander> :D
16:59 < Chairn> 100 steam players i guess
17:00 < Savander> yes
17:00 < Savander> yes
17:00 < Savander> :) D:
17:01 < Chairn> many people on ctf today ^^
17:02 < Savander> Wow
17:02 < Savander> Vanilla
17:02 < Savander> 300+ players
17:02 < Savander> o.O
17:02 <@deen> 0 more players on ddnet, as expected^^
17:02 < Savander> first hours
17:03 < Savander> 200 players on steam
17:03 < Savander> huhuhu ;33
17:04 < Chairn> deen: maybe we should run some standart ddnet server?
17:04 < Savander> there is
17:04 < Savander> ;d
17:04 < Chairn> oO
17:04 < Chairn> never saw them
17:05 <@deen> Chairn: sure, tell me in which locations
17:05 <@deen> because they're always empty
17:05 < Chairn> ehm, maybe they will not be empty anymore ^^
17:06 < Savander> deen, maybe news about teeworlds on steam on ddnet.tw? With tutorial how to run DDNet instead of Vanilla Client?^^
17:07 <@deen> Savander: that's a huge hack that won't work
17:07 < Savander> it works
17:07 < Savander> for me.
17:07 < Savander> im playing right now
17:07 <@deen> when a TW client update or DDNet client update is released it will break
17:07 < Savander> I know
17:07 < Savander> but optional
17:07 <@deen> that's not considered "working"
17:07 <@deen> as i said a few months ago, we should get ddnet on steam
17:07 < Savander> as mod?
17:07 <@deen> but now that TW is on it, no chance i guess
17:08 < Savander> maybe it's possible to put it into workshop?
17:08 < Savander> or not? I don't know
17:25 <@deen> no idea: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/260
17:31 < Savander> question
17:31 < Savander> i cloned teeworlds
17:32 < Savander> from teeworlds/teeworlds
17:32 < Savander> github
17:32 < Savander> changed branch to 0.6
17:32 < Savander> and i can't compile it
17:32 < Savander> bam server_release <- Doesn't exists
17:32 < Savander> :c
17:33 < Savander> ls
17:33 < Henningstone> in teeworlds/master you only have bam anymore, did you really check out 0.6 branch?
17:33 < Savander> yes
17:33 < Savander> root@vps117925:/home/servers/TeeworldsSRC# git checkout 0.6
17:33 < Savander> Already on '0.6'
17:34 < Savander> :c
17:34 < Henningstone> hm ok...
17:34 < Henningstone> er, what does it say exactly?
17:34 < Henningstone> if you try bam server_release
17:34 < Savander> root@vps117925:/home/servers/TeeworldsSRC# ../BAM/bam server_release
17:34 < Savander> bam: target 'server_release' not found
17:35 < Henningstone> try coping bam to your working directory
17:35 < Savander> still the same
17:36 <@deen> Savander: works for me, you might have done something wrong with the checkout
17:36 < Henningstone> is there a bam.lua? it should or it cannot work
17:36 <@deen> are you on commit 7451ca5f67fe4f73dc04ff687c55106b7070ccdc?
17:37 <@heinrich5991> also post the output of git status maybe
17:38 < Henningstone> one recommendation, you may want to copy bam to "/usr/local/bin/" so you can run it from everywhere, it's much easier imo.
17:40 < Savander> how
17:40 < Savander> to check commit?D:
17:40 < Savander> ok
17:40 < Savander> root@vps117925:/home/servers/TeeworldsSRC# git status
17:40 < Savander> # On branch 0.6
17:40 < Savander> nothing to commit (working directory clean)
17:43 < Henningstone> that is quite strange, I did exactly the same than you said that moment, and for me workz
17:43 < Savander> lol.
17:45 < Henningstone> git clone url-to-repo/teeworlds.git; git fetch origin 0.6:0.6; git checkout 0.6; bam server_release
17:45 < Henningstone> it compiles fine...
17:46 < Savander> ye
17:46 < Savander> yes
17:46 < Savander> now works, thanks !:) :D
17:46 < Henningstone> lol 
18:11 < Savander> I run few servers
18:14 < Chairn> ddnet ctf is empty :(
18:14 <@deen> Chairn: as always :P
18:14 < Chairn> im in :D
18:14 <@deen> is there also a filter for default maps only?
18:14 < Chairn> im trying to attract people
18:14 < Chairn> i changed to ctf5
18:14 <@deen> because i run non-default maps on all servers
18:14 <@deen> which might explain why no one sees them
18:14 < Chairn> yeah, was ctf1_saavik
18:15 < Chairn> but i voted ctf5
18:15 < Chairn> so, now people should see it
18:15 < Chairn> anyone has steam tw to check?
18:15 < Chairn> or is it standart tw client?
18:15 < Savander> deEN YES
18:15 < Savander> and for compatibility
18:16 <@deen> oh well, so people won't even see that ddnet runs servers in all their locations
18:16 <@deen> that's why there are European servers full of people with ping 160
18:17 < Savander> all 3 options on bottom
18:17 < Savander> are checked
18:17 < Savander> by default
18:17 < Chairn> 3? i see 2, standard map, standard type
18:18 < Savander> really?
18:18 < Savander> maybe it was changed
18:18 < Savander> when i started
18:18 < Savander> it was 3 bottom filters
18:18 < Chairn> what's the third one?
18:19 < Savander> Compatilility
18:19 < Chairn> when i check, it doesnt change anything
18:19 < Chairn> but im using ddnet client, so maybe not the same effect
18:19 < Savander> hm
18:20 < Chairn> someone joined !! but he left 10 secs later
18:20 < Savander> xd
20:19 <@deen> oooh, they also sort by server name in vanilla client i bet
20:19 <@deen> because all the servers starting with 20 spaces are full, and rest not
20:20 < Henningstone> yes they do
20:23 < Savander> woah.
20:24 < Savander> that's why
20:24 < Savander> all servers weith
20:24 < Savander> !!                                   BlABLA
20:24 < Savander> are full.
20:24 <@deen> yeah, that's disgusting
20:24 <@deen> stupid names, can't even read the name
20:24 <@deen> and they get all the players for it
20:24 < Henningstone> they wanted to strip multiple whitespaces, no clue why they didn't
20:24 < Henningstone> clientside, I mean
20:26 <@deen> should instead just sort by Players or ping
20:26 <@deen> sorting by name makes no sense
20:26 < Henningstone> it is possible oc, but nobody does o_O
20:26 <@deen> in the default config i mean
20:27 <@deen> ddnet sorts by ping, but I'm not sure that's ideal even
20:27 <@deen> ideally I'd want a combination of players and ping
20:27 < Henningstone> what about gametype? i think modders wouln't call their mods !aaaMOD ;)
20:28 < Henningstone> so it seems fair to me
20:30 <@deen> nah, why would you want the mod named aaa before zzz?
20:31 <@deen> better show the most popular stuff close to the player  first
20:31 < Savander> don't sort
20:31 < o_be_one> +1
20:31 < Savander> sort by names then shuffle
20:31 < Savander> ;p.
20:31 < o_be_one> but by ping is good to
20:31 < Henningstone> random sorting?!
20:32 < Henningstone> lol.
20:32 < Savander> ?
20:36 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/vsM0r
20:36 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master ed0634f def: Update credits

20:36 < Henningstone> LOL?! RLY?!?! it is being announced here xDD
20:36 < Henningstone> or was it fake
20:37 < Henningstone> MHHHHHH
20:37 < Henningstone> ach ne lel it's true, and it's awesome!

20:41 < Savander> (steam)
20:47 <@deen> Learath2: now that i think about it, i think with our new autoudpater we will never be able to update dlls
20:47 <@deen> that means we can't even switch to sdl2 or fix any security bugs
20:47 < Learath2> deen: we didnt even test updating dlls and i know atleast one way of doing it but it aint pretty
20:48 <@deen> Learath2: well, but i need that feature and i said so from the start i think
20:48 <@deen> anyway, no way to get it working now i guess
20:49 < Learath2> ofc there is add dll updating stuff in push an update and after that push another update for the dlls
20:50 <@deen> no, updates get skipped
20:50 <@deen> if you don't do update 1, but update 2 is out, it will not update to version 1
20:50 < Learath2> you do sound kinda mad
20:53 <@deen> sure, i've spent many hours explaining to people that they need to update their client manually and now it's the same thing again =/
20:57 < Learath2> to be clear you didnt mention anything about dlls until way after we released
20:58 < Learath2> ill fix it if you want but dont really know how to update it
20:58 <@deen> i know how to update it
20:58 <@deen> if you can fix it
20:58 <@deen> we will just end up with 2 updates, then it's fixed
20:59 <@deen> and sorry if i sounded mad at you, i'm just mad that stuff doesn't work
20:59 <@deen> not at you or anyone else
21:00 < Henningstone> "When talking about computers, stuff doesn't work quite often. That's not the risk, that's the fun." I don't know where I have this from...
21:00 < Learath2> 2 updates wont work before they need the first update to be able to do the second one
21:00 <@deen> Learath2: i'll make it work, don't worry
21:26 < Chairn> hum, i got weird bug
21:27 < Chairn> with background feature
21:27 < Chairn> sometimes background is in background,(like with Runaway.map bg)
21:27 < Chairn> but sometimes(like optimum.map bg), bg is in front of tee, which means that tee is invis...
21:33 < Savander> http://steamcommunity.com/app/380840/discussions/0/521643320368546052/
21:33 < Savander> imo, good point
21:33 < Savander> (JonasTheRoman)
21:43 <@deen> Learath2: while we're at it, would be nice to put all the dlls into a directory
21:44 < Learath2> can we even have dlls in a folder ?
21:44 <@deen> yeah, there's a way to tell a binary in which directory to look for dlls
21:44 <@deen> looks a bit overloaded with dlls right now
21:45 < Chairn> deen: got a question about destructor in tw
21:46 < Henningstone> rly? o_O
21:46 < Chairn> some class like CGameClient are full of pointers, but no destructor nor delete
21:46 < Chairn> is there a reason? I guess its cuz those class are destroyed when leaving the game, so i would be senseless?
21:46 <@deen> dunno
21:47 < Chairn> it would*
21:47 <@deen> i would assume so
21:47 <@deen> i haven't checked by hand, only used automatic tools
21:47 < Henningstone> these pointers are not allocated dynamically, they are members of the class (see the header file)
21:47 <@deen> and they found no memory leaks
21:47 < Henningstone> so no need to delete non-dynamic memory
21:48 < Chairn> so what if i  got a class member that i created with new, do i have to use delete?
21:49 < Henningstone> i'd recommand whenever you write "new", write "delete" instantly. 
21:49 < Henningstone> could cause trouble if you forget to
21:49 < Chairn> yeah, but with or without, as the instance is destroyed when you leave the game, it didnt change anything for the moment
21:50 < Henningstone> exiting the program of cause frees all memory :)
21:55 <@deen> Chairn: while you're at making custom map backgrounds, should we also take the cl_menu_map from TW 0.7?
21:55 < Chairn> ?
21:55 <@deen> so you can have a map as the background in menus
21:55 < Chairn> ehm, i guess so
21:55 < Chairn> but my class doesnt render in menu, only when playing
21:56 < Chairn> i think i can try it
21:56 <@deen> yeah, but it's implemented in TW 0.7
21:56 < Henningstone> mmh porting stuff back from 0.7 is not that easy... there changed so much
21:57 < Henningstone> but when you write the background class to be universal, it should be easy to use it for the menu too
21:58 < Chairn> well, the map bg is loaded when starting client
21:58 < Chairn> so it should be possible to render it in menu
21:59 < Chairn> for the moment, i dont know how to make it possible to change during game
21:59 < Henningstone> xD
21:59 < Chairn> or maybe there is
21:59 < Chairn> lemme try
22:04 < Chairn> oh, it works, but its kinda ugly  i think
22:04 < Henningstone> no matter, tweaking is the second step! :)
22:04 < Chairn> i just compare g_config.clbackground with stored name at every render call...
22:05 < Henningstone> are you wanting to switch the background while the game runs?
22:06 < Chairn> indeed
22:06 < Chairn> it works
22:06 < Chairn> just freeze while the map is loading(freeze is <1 sec for me)
22:06 < Henningstone> :thumbsup: <- I know that this won't work, though you know what I mean :)
22:07 < Chairn> ?
22:07 < Chairn> ah ^^
22:19 < Henningstone> one offtopic question, "strnlen" is c++ right? or does it exist in standartc too?
22:20 <@heinrich5991> Henningstone: I don't think that function exists
22:20 <@heinrich5991> what would it do?
22:20 <@heinrich5991> the 'n' variant of the functions usually specifies the size of the target buffer, but there's no target buffer in strlen
22:21 <@deen> Henningstone: POSIX.1-2008 according to manpage
22:21 < Henningstone> ah
22:22 <@heinrich5991> okay, nevermind me :<

22:22 <@deen> heinrich5991: for TW it says "Free Demo" in steam
22:23 <@deen> that seems wrong
22:23 <@deen> it should be "Free" I think
22:23 <@heinrich5991> link?
22:23 <@deen> http://store.steampowered.com/genre/Free%20to%20Play/
22:23 <@deen> and some "Uninitialized" 
22:23 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/hsm4N3xH7836
22:23 <@deen> huh, maybe that was just my browser
22:23 <@deen> i pressed f5 and now it says something else
22:23 < Henningstone> for me it sais "Free"
22:23 < Savander> :D
22:23 <@deen> now it says "Free to Play"
22:24 <@deen> but "Free to Play" means ingame-shop i think
22:24 < Henningstone> it means just free does it? Not implementing pay-to-win
22:24 <@deen> "Free" is just free for me
22:24 < Henningstone> so what about "ingame-shop"?
22:25 <@deen> when something is only free to play, then something must not be free, which is usually winning
22:26 <@heinrich5991> note to self: close tabs in the future. >150 open tabs...
22:26 < Henningstone> xD and the browser didn't crash yet?
22:28 < Henningstone> warning: implicit declaration of function ‘strnlen’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
22:28 <@heinrich5991> no
22:28 < Henningstone>          for(int i = 0, j = 0; i <= strnlen(str, 32); i++, j++) {
22:28 <@heinrich5991> you need to #define _GNU_SOURCE
22:28 <@heinrich5991> but this isn't portable, you shouldn't use that function
22:29 < Henningstone> i was told to to "prevent buffer overflow", 
22:37 < Savander> Yea
22:37 <@heinrich5991> deen: thanks for the notice, I contacted valve
22:37 < Savander> I changed name of server to...
22:37 < Savander> "!space
22:37 < Savander> 35 players/
22:38 < Savander> 444 players on vanilla
22:38 < Henningstone> why aren't these spaces stripped, though? would be much smarter
22:38 < Savander> at beginning they are
22:44 < relas> http://puu.sh/jNbqR/92c7008d5e.png there is a desc. missing :D
22:47 <@deen> relas: thanks
22:49 < Henningstone> "How long the laser takes to bounce" or smth like that... :)
22:57 <@heinrich5991> Henningstone: that's fighting the wrong fight I guess
22:57 <@heinrich5991> if people cannot use spaces they'll use exclamation marks
22:58 < Henningstone> that might be true... and i think exclamation marks would be additionally ugly, other than spaces

23:38 < Chairn> seems like tw is not available on mac via steam
23:39 < Savander> rly?
23:39 < Chairn> when i check MacOs it disappear
23:39 < Chairn> http://store.steampowered.com/genre/Free%20to%20Play
23:39 < Chairn> check multiplayer & action, so you got only 2 games
23:39 < Chairn> and then macos and bb tw ^^
23:40 <@heinrich5991> Chairn: it doesn't work on mac right now
23:41 <@heinrich5991> some libraries are missing
23:41 <@heinrich5991> will be readded soon
23:41 <@heinrich5991> Chairn: do you have a mac?
23:47 < Chairn> no
23:58 <@deen> I'm again trying sdl2, still much to fix: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/sdl2-try3
23:58 <@deen> at least it runs as well as 0.7 for now
23:59 <@heinrich5991> that means still not good for you?
23:59 <@deen> text input is not working at all
23:59 <@deen> notifywindow isn't working yet
23:59 <@deen> ctrl-v isn't working
23:59 <@deen> mouse goes out of window all the time and you lose control
23:59 <@deen> and a few minor things
