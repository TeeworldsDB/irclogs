06:57 <+laxadedi> [00:25:41] ok building, going to take 2 minutes at least, crappy server :D
06:57 <@heinrich5991> [00:25:43] but you also need MYSQL_INCLUDEDIR, MYSQL_CPPCONN_LIBRARY and MYSQL_CPPCONN_INCLUDEDIR then
06:57 <@heinrich5991> [00:26:13] you could apply this patch and tell me what it outputs
06:57 <+laxadedi> [00:26:13] according to CMAkeCache, the include dirs are good

06:57 <@heinrich5991> [00:26:17] ok
06:57 <+laxadedi> [00:26:38] only the libs are wrong, which could explain the "undefined ref" when compiling
06:57 <@heinrich5991> [00:26:43] yes
06:57 <+laxadedi> [00:30:28] So slow :(, 65%
06:57 <+laxadedi> [00:31:22] And I am stupid, compiling everything instead of just the DDNet-Server
06:57 <@heinrich5991> [00:31:41] `make DDNet-Server`
06:57 <@heinrich5991> [00:31:45] you can safely ctrl-c
06:57 <@heinrich5991> [00:31:48] progress is kept
06:57 <+laxadedi> [00:31:57] Now building the server x)

06:57 <+laxadedi> [00:40:05] trying a fresh build after cleaning cmake + objs files
06:57 <@heinrich5991> [00:40:42] I hope that doesn't fix it
06:57 <@heinrich5991> [00:40:49] cmake/make should be able to track that
06:57 <+laxadedi> [00:41:19] Well, I have no idea, I never liked CMake, too much "magic"
06:57 <+laxadedi> [00:41:28] A giant pain in the ass to debug that
06:57 <@heinrich5991> [00:42:04] mh. I just recently learned it and I don't think it's that bad
06:57 <+laxadedi> [00:42:41] it worked
06:57 <@heinrich5991> [00:42:53] ahh :(

06:57 <@heinrich5991> [00:43:44] laxadedi: could you try the patch and check what it outputs?
06:57 <+laxadedi> [00:43:48] I guess it's because the only difference was the includes, afaik, make/cmake dont check timestamps on those files
06:57 <@heinrich5991> [00:44:09] for our own includes, it certainly does
06:57 <@heinrich5991> [00:44:19] (and otherwise you'd get serious miscompiles)
06:57 <+laxadedi> [00:45:02] What steps exactly you want me to do ? I tried to apply your patch but I had no different output when doing `cmake .`
06:57 <@heinrich5991> [00:47:05] mhmhmhmh
06:57 <@heinrich5991> [00:47:31] there isn't an extra line on top of Checking for …?

06:57 <+laxadedi> [00:50:38] Will do the same, thanks for the hlpe

07:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice there heinrich closing all the prs without discussion
07:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it looks like heinrich can veto everything he wants xD
07:20 <+eeeee> well he has to remind the plebs who's in charge
07:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not funny
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki I closed a couple of pull requests that hadn't had some discussion in some time, which I was not going to merge and no one apparently did
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> No
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Dont close them
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought keeping them open only made the authors think that they might get merged eventually, e.g. by me
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You so selfish
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which PRs would you like to have re-openend?
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> All the ones you closed
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why do you want to re-open the "show the IPs in more places to moderators"?
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I explained it iin the issue
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Brb i come in 1 hour
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1050
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't see a comment
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> **issue**
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we should modify the bans and mutes command to display which nick was used when the players was banned/muted
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Your idea on the modhelp pr is a thing i had in mind, but why if you suggested that, you close the pr? There is no need to do that.
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ssme with the ban pr
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It is senseless to hide the ip
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You could merge that pr and then when you have done the pr with ur feature change it
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And you know what? I'm in favour of the /mods command
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Did you even talk with the moderators about it?
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You dont even have rcon wheb you are admin to not spend time on that, yet you decide for them?
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we talked about the mods feature in discord
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why is it senseless to hide the IP?
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki I don't think /modhelp is useful without asking for external help
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> We talked about it and the only one against was you
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```Maybe what @Learath2 said is true, actually the mute system works with "mute indexes" so hiding the IP would make the moderator don't know who is who when using "mutes" to "unmute" someone. And also bans works with IPs not ids. So if a mod bans someone by mistake, without the ip he/she can't unban it.``` from here  https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/907
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Do you even read what i said? There is no need to close the modhelp pr, just wsit for the external feature
11:33 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] bors[bot] merged staging into master: https://git.io/vxZlY
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Same with teleportgun, you were against it without even testing it
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And seems like u ignore everything i said on that pr
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I think I read what you say
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but if a feature is not helpful, I don't think we should add it
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <XamuPL> hello xd
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hi
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <XamuPL> im just lookin' at this cvonversation go on xd
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> In my opinion you dont
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Shit mobile connection...
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And this convo will be hard ignored, i know it
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Everytime something is talked with admins, they wait to see if we forget it
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I alwsys had to remain things frequently to get something done
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I alwsys had to remind things frequently to get something done
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> merge /mods pr
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then people can detect that a mod joined
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "[3:56 PM] Ryozuki: the troll leaves when i join"
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that would be nice if mods could remove trolls solely by being present
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not if the troll rejoins once the mod leaves
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which apparently happened in that case
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wich they could anyway
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not if they don't have a reliable way of detecting a mod
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if they just leave whenever someone joins, then that's a troll greatly reduced in impact
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> just join and see whether you get banned 🤷
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then you don't annoy the server for a couple of minutes, hopefully you get bored
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or people can advance somewhere where they aren't blocked by you anymore
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and the mods names are public anyway and moderating with fake name is not allowed
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so what does it change
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I recommended ryozuki to change the name if that happens
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this would no longer be possible with the PR
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye but that’s illegal
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> "illegal"       A GAME jao  its a game
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> with rules
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> more like guidelines...
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well if you don’t want that mods act by rules 🤷
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> let’s see how often you get funbanned
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but i dont
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> whatever, @heinrich5991 let it be learaths or snails decision at least.. they actually have moderator experience..
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do *you* say about my argument, @jao?
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or you stop being to shy to moderate, try it for a month and decide then 😛
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, I won't do that. people will be even more mad at me afterwards
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> your argument is that you can’t moderate undercover anymore?
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my argument is that you can't do anything if the situation I quoted above happens
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what is bad about trolls leaving when mods join
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's bad if they rejoin once the mod leaves
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if the mod is only there to take care of the troll
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can ask the mod to come back
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. and then the troll leaves again
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the mods don't have endless amounts of time, in most situations when someone reports here, it's hard enough to get a mod to come once
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well you can still join with fakename, spec the troll or whatever to make sure you don’t ban for no reason, get the players id and then rename/ login and ban them
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, that would work
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so the positive thing we're after is being able to chat to the mod directly?
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao how about letting logged-in people be highlighted by the word "moderator" or "mod"?
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> spammy
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yes please do it 😄
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> moderator is spammy?
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mod maybe…
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mhmh
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no i mean people would just spam that xd
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but they wouldn't spam the people they get from /mods?
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye not much more than now
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mh
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wait. if people know the moderators they can just chat them directly
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> without /mods
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> the /mods is mostly for new or unfamiliar people and to easily find mods on crowded server
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think that could be achieved by hte moderator highlight as well
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the difference between these two might only be discoverability
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't think new players know about console commands that much either
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and you get no info about a mod being there and if yes, how many
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes… mh
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so this is the upside of the /mods command
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> imo the best way would be to color mods differently in scoreboard 😅
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that would give status to the mods – people would like to be mods for status even more I'd guess
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or just give them a little icon
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nothing super special
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't matter how they're different, if you can recognize it at a glance, you make it a status symbol
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> speaking of that, could we remove the "admin" tab on the right? 😛
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that is like having rcon
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> except you don't passively show other people that you have rcon
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so being admin doesn’t come across as status symbol
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and it’s not like we can’t remove mods if they don’t do a good job
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Sometimes its hard to delete mods who do nothing
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g onion and aoe
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> aoe was easy to remove
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I would still merge the mods ps, if youen counter a situation where you have to use a fake name cuz trolls leave when u join, they wouldnt see you in /mods unless you login
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> So u can find the id in the meantime
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Aoe was removed cuz me reminding it every day
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> To learath
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Same with gdin
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nah he was removed once we cared and found the time to deal with inactive mods
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Nah
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> When snail actually wanted to do it
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> xd
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And his gdin advice excuse...
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Pretty ridiculous
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> nice assumptions
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They arent
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not like an inactive admin hurts anyone
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> where is your proof xd
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Poor argument @heinrich5991
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i actually took part in it, but yeah tell me the truth 😃
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> gdin told me he might want to get mod/admin again for the summer.   would ddnet do that? knowing he will be gone after the summer again?
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> 2 years later @Ryozuki still thinks gdin is my best friend and that I solely protected him 🤷
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yes
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> 😂
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Aoe was the funniest
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Reaccepted a inactive mod
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> because he is black
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and snail's second best friend
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> 🤷
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 if deleting botted ranks from botters is not doable, whst you tjink about excluding then from the rank lists, e.g not count them on /top5points /teamranks etc
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And ofc ranks page
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki botted ranks will be deleted
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I would lifeban the name
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cool
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we're not the US
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah, this botterland
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah, this is botterland
13:41 < snail_did_9_11> snail did 9/11
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Sp someone?
14:36 <+jxsl13> I'm pro visibility of the ip for mods!
14:37 <@heinrich5991> why do you want it? :)
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> jxsl13 sadly your opinion will be ignored and no one will care, as heinrich is who decides
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he ignored my argument xD
14:37 <+jxsl13> Damn, did not read, just closed my client
14:37 <+jxsl13> What did you say before?
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://prntscr.com/itsk3r
14:38 <@heinrich5991> [14:37:13] <@heinrich5991> why do you want it? :)
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh the unexpected happened
14:38 <+jxsl13> That argument with other commands depending on ips and the ability to distinguish people was key
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/907
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```Maybe what @Learath2 said is true, actually the mute system works with "mute indexes" so hiding the IP would make the moderator don't know who is who when using "mutes" to "unmute" someone. And also bans works with IPs not ids. So if a mod bans someone by mistake, without the ip he/she can't unban it.```
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also most games with moderating capabilities show ips too
14:40 <@heinrich5991> jxsl13: bans and mutes could show nick and timestamp
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how would you ban
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and unban
14:40 <@heinrich5991> ban <clientid>
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unban
14:41 <@heinrich5991> unban <banid>
14:41 <@heinrich5991> after bans has been updated to show nick and timestamp
14:41 <@heinrich5991> (which was what the linked issue in Learath2's PR was about IIRC)
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so when this will be done?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as for now u cant do that
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> same with the people who complains about the unfinishable map due to the bug fixed
14:41 <+jxsl13> How many players with the same ip can enter your server at the same time?
14:41 <@heinrich5991> 4
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a lot of people complains you don't care about that
14:42 <+jxsl13> How do bans work?
14:42 <+jxsl13> Ip based
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki I will accept a PR that does that, if you want to contribute it
14:42 <@heinrich5991> yes
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "or don't you care about that"?
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you join a server with the map binary when there are players in, you can see that people complains due to the grenade bugfix making that map unfinishable
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they consider this should be a priority fix
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can talk about we can fix this if you want
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *about how we can
14:44 <+jxsl13> Ok, so mods will see the ips as well as nick and timestamp. (Y)
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> heinrich wants a id ban system
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he doesnt want to show ips
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in any way
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 ill do ban thing
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cool
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> jxl13 sv_max_clients_per_ip defaults to 4
14:47 <+jxsl13> If you ban id 4 and at the same time 3 other players due to having the same ip, how do you want to handle that?
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mmm
14:48 <@heinrich5991> they'll all be banned, same as for kickvotes
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this happens same now right?
14:48 <@heinrich5991> yes
14:48 <+jxsl13> It's an extreme example, but at least one other player could be expected to be banned.
14:48 <+jxsl13> Due to having the same ip
14:48 <@heinrich5991> yes
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its the problem of not having a auth system
14:49 <@heinrich5991> haven't seen that except when people are in the same household
14:49 <@heinrich5991> no, it's a problem of having a free game, where you can easily join
14:49 <@heinrich5991> accounts won't help here
14:49 <+jxsl13> Will they get the same ban id?
14:49 <@heinrich5991> yes
14:50 <+jxsl13> So hashing the ip :D?
14:50 <@heinrich5991> I believe unban <id> works today
14:50 <@heinrich5991> ?
14:50 <+jxsl13> For the id
14:50 <@heinrich5991> no, there are ban ids, they're incrementing from 0
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> s[ip|entry]
14:50 <@heinrich5991> IIRC
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its index
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not player id
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
14:51 <+jxsl13> Ah, ok
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mutes work like that too
14:51 <@heinrich5991> yes
14:51 <+jxsl13> Yeah, the unban id is the id on the bans list
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so the feature needs to show nick and timestamp?
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since u can already unban index
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
15:11 <+jxsl13> hm, the discord webapp is buggy as hell
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is a .deb package, but its still a webapp anyway
15:17 <+jxsl13> have discord installed, should work :D
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> hello jxsl13
15:17 <+jxsl13> hello back jxsl13 xD
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's like I'm having deja vu
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mh? 🙂
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> learath feels weird again
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🤔
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ryozuki keeps thinking we are all satan's bffs
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :)
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Or maybe im the only one who cares enough to complain about things?
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or maybe, just maybe things are not as horrible as you paint it to be
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I just try to make the decision-making process more open
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> seriously one read through your messages and people would think @snail and @gdin were running a money laundering operation and me and @heinrich5991 are trying to change the game so it plays like we want
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🤷
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually heinrich doesnt want to **change** the game it seems
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a game with max 1000 players that we are trying to keep alive, just relax and enjoy the game 🙂
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i do
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i also "try"
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also enjoy this game everyday so 🤔
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i will complain if i feel something is not fair or i dislike
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as im free to do it
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are free to do it but over exaggerating things won't get you anywhere. I'm pretty sure @heinrich5991 would discuss about anything yet you approached him with anger
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As a matter of fact if a PR isn't getting merged I'd rather have it closed, Just take a look at my PR in teeworlds/teeworlds. It's just sad
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i don't feel i approached with anger
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet is far from being as inactive as teeworlds
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd have preferred if oy closed it the second I opened it if he had no intention of merging it. Waste of my time and @cinaera's time.
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what does this mean "if a PR isn't getting merged"?
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh wasted how? did you even do anything with the pr?
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao means that the feature is not added
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wrote it?
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> being added*
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont mean that...
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> after u wrote it
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye but that's the same as closing it or no
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I fixed it?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao well its like saying you reject it
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wasn't any good back then, that thing took me hours to get it working
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or do you mean, not going to be merged because no one has time to check
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u usually state it by closing the pr
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I used "If a PR isn't getting merged" as "If we don't feel a PR should be merged"
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and we have super mind powers so we know that
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😌
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No I hoped you could read the queens english
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not like a PR is going to merge itself
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 🍿
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :salt:
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus.~> aren't you working on something to detect the use of bot?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i don't think, since can be avoided due to opensource
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gdin> @Ryozuki didn't even know snail defended me about keeping my status or whatever, don't worry about that xD. I agreed to leave for the time being because of obvious inactivity and I was too busy to make any contribution, but when the summer rolls around I'll probably be coming back

17:52 <+jxsl13> :c got a problem regarding sqlite 
17:55 <+jxsl13> it seems to cause server lags, even tho it's executed in different threads :c
18:02 <@heinrich5991> it's executed in a different thread?
18:02 <@heinrich5991> how?
18:15 <+jxsl13> back :O
18:17 <+jxsl13> basically liek this: https://git.johnbehm.de/jxsl13/zcatch/src/branch/zCatch/src/game/server/teehistorian.cpp#L509
18:17 <+jxsl13> like*
18:18 <+jxsl13> every transactions is executed in a new thread, every x ticks I execute a middletransaction, which writes all previous transactions to the db and starts a new transaction
18:19 <+jxsl13> and every x ticks I cleanup the finished threads from my thread queue
18:20 <+jxsl13> this is the cleanup https://git.johnbehm.de/jxsl13/zcatch/src/branch/zCatch/src/game/server/teehistorian.h#L164
18:21 <+jxsl13> joinThreads is only executed on shutdown
18:38 <+Henningstone> jxsl13: will CleanThreads not make the main thread wait for all left threads to finish execution either? You are joining them after all...
18:39 <+jxsl13> if I'm not mistaken, the t->joinable() returns true if the thread finished execution?
18:39 <+jxsl13> thus joining it directly, because finished executing
18:40 <+Henningstone> if I'm not mistaken it does exactly the opposite, return true if the thread is still running (thus joinable)
18:40 <+jxsl13> and every other thread is added back to the queue
18:40 <+jxsl13> ._.
18:40 <+jxsl13> xD let's test that out :D
18:40 <+jxsl13> thanks :O
18:40 <+Henningstone> http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/joinable
18:41 <+jxsl13> aw, damn :c
19:18 <+jxsl13> does anyone, know what this is https://pastebin.com/rtJ605Hp
19:35 <@heinrich5991> it seems you catch too many signals with your signal handler
19:45 <+jxsl13> something causes a crash :c
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's an exception being thrown
20:00 <@heinrich5991> have you compiled with debug info?
20:02 <+jxsl13> yep
20:03 <+jxsl13> some thread seems to throw an exception :c
20:03 <+jxsl13> and as someone mentioned to me that if this is done, everything within that thread'S context is deleted
20:03 <+jxsl13> thread'S
20:03 <+jxsl13> 's
20:03 <+jxsl13> ._
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 @fokkonaut that should fix it ^
21:16 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: why is that diff huge?
21:16 <@heinrich5991> "Update confusable data to Unicode 11.0.0"
21:16 <@heinrich5991> because it's a checked in generated file
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Does someone have a good project idea for a webapp. Something people could need/has potential :thonkery: ty
22:06 <+Learath2> If I had one i'd make it meself :P
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> make one that's not garbage
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> that's my idea
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhh_GeBPOhs
22:17 <+jxsl13> ._. still laggy ... don't know how to fix
22:39 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: +v NeXusTw_ 
22:39 <+Learath2> or deen
22:40 <+Learath2> or that
22:40 < NeXusTw_> test
22:40 < NeXusTw_> yay
22:40 <@heinrich5991> sorry
22:40 <@heinrich5991> forgot to remove the +m
22:44 <+jxsl13_webchat> does the thread limit apply to detached threads?
23:31 <+Henningstone> jxsl13 / jxsl13_webchat: detaching a thread basically just means that you don't have to (and can't) join it anymore. This allows you to immediately destroy the thread object (i.e. delete it), but this also means that you have no more way to make sure your thread has done it's job (e.g. write all left sql queries to the disk) before the program exists.
23:34 <+Henningstone> about your laggedy's... spawning a thread has got a little overhead as well; not sure if it's enough to cause noticeable lags though.
