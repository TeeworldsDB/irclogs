00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ a graphics crash ^
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 131072x2 resolution??? xd
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> well
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> btw u are using old cleint?
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rigfht?
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the one before 15.0.2
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ryozuki pls update aur :heartw:
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that doesnt qualify as old client tho, does it?
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rescale doesnt exist
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since 15.0
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> huh
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i removed thjat function
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs it was buggy
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> darn i cant select my image there
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> does the steam binary not use /usr/share/ddnet?
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> updating it
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> where should i put my own mapres btw?
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> thx!
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga done
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> thx, got it
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Jupstar ✪ you're right, it doesnt crash here
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> I'd like to report a bug too with the newest update. All servers show 700+ ping in the menu, but when I join it's normal ping. Not too bad, just hard to find servers near me without searching USA.
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> Used to happen before update also, but after like 5 refreshes it would stabilize. Now it doesn't stabilize at all
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @banana man Try f1, br_max_requests 25
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> your internet is quite slow, right?
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ oh, the rescale/resize thing could also be causing client not to start
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I released 15.0.2 without websockets now
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> Why without?
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to buggy
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> crashed
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki I think the server should keep running after client is closed, but not 100% sure
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> What ws were even used for?
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but it's annoying that steam then doesn't close
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the plan was to use websockets for official servers as a test
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think it should keep
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats the utility
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> Well keep alive connections are good and frames are cheaper than http
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> So I agree
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ 2-3 fps after release sounds like rescale too: https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/discussions/0/2952628008358995979/?tscn=1600380825
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki alright, I guess
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll provide a fix
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but won't release it right away 😄
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> that worked @deen Thx!
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> and yeah, my isp is messing up badly rn
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if more people have this problem we should probably keep the old default
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <banana man> I'm supposed to be getting 200 mb, but I'm jumping from .1 to 10 to 40 back to .1 XD
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i once had a router that couldnt handle 100 open connections, when torrenting and it shut down the net completly, i bought another router and it was fixed xD
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Why doesn't it show amount of markers / demo length until I select the demo file?
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756279785218375750/unknown.png
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> click fetch info
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> oh :heartw:
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> ddnet steam working?
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu because fetching info can be super slow on a hard disk with many demos
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Spooky it should
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> doesn't fully load in and then kicks me out
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> for some reason
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Spooky even after the most recent update?
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> yea
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ I'm guessing your scale change is causing this
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Jupstar ✪ it still doesnt like my super important `1024x1048576` image :/

00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but i conclude that there is no real limit on image sizes in maps
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> wtf
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> @DDNet bot are you drunk
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, but still need to open each file
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Spooky if you can wait 5-10 min, I can give you a version to test. Are you on Windows?
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> yea
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Patiga we dont support textures over 2gb, heinrich doesnt want size_t in code
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen ?
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, thats fair
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont get why the function should cause low fps
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Spooky https://ddnet.tw/ddnet-windows-latest.zip Does that fix the problem?
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Spooky what gpu do u have
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> @deen client not working from that
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> @Jupstar ✪ gtx 1070
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then the function is never called @deen
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, too bad
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I don't have a single problem with update nor updated client on Windows 10 x64 steam
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe the entity textures
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i tested that code
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd have noticed frame drops
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i thought maybe just bad for some
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean its not ultra fast, but it doesnt get called over and over again
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe it is the menuimages that we load now?
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> i noticed
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> on steam client
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it has todo with the loading, so maybe yes
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> when i updated it , after like 5 mins
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> it says update again
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, thinking about loading I can only imagine graphics or the images
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or something about the start menu
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i valgrinded all my code to be safe
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs i never worked with menu before
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> too bad, just did the same and found nothing 😄
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> works now
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what have u done
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> just updated it again on steam and it worked
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Spooky but it's 14.7.1, right?
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> but when i open my client it still says update for 15.0.2
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe yoour nightly still has websockets on @deen ?
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh i dunno then
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> @deen think so
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Spooky press f1
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it should tell top right
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> yup its 14.7.1
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I tested and websockets is off
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> some localization?
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Spooky do you have english as language ingame?
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> no
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> finish?
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> yea
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Spooky could you try switching to english, closing client, and then trying a new version?
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I changed a bit about the localization actually
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> weird the new update didn't go thru tho since u have to update on steam otherwise u can't play
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I reverted to old version on STeam
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> ah
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the easiest would really be someone with a debugger has the crash xD
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe i give my luck a try on windows quickly
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes. @Spooky you're not a software developer by any chance? 😄
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> i am actually
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> :Kapp:
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Great!
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know how to debug on Windows, but @Jupstar ✪ can probably help
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> i'm joking lol
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> given a windows machine, what do I need to do to find out if I have the crash?
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> 14.7.1 frames dropping tho
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> start client
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it happens at 3/4 of the loading bar apparently
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so menu images sound suspicious
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> steam version?
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> all apparently
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe it's also the binds? We support multi-key binds now
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ohh, i dont crash btw
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Spooky could you send us your settings_ddnet.cfg? Maybe that helps
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> sec let me try smthin
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oooh, or does your system have very little RAM?
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe the font file doesn't fit into RAM
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he has 1070 xD
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and 20mb ram
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tru gamer
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> unbalanced system, who knows 😄
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> xD
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oph
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> got crash when going back into the ddnet window
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> @Jupstar ✪ i have 128gb so :kek:
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> thehell you running TW at?
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> server at work?
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> Why someone would need 128 gb lol
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> @deen ok so what do u need , settings?
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> i actually have 16 only lol
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> settings might help
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen the only problem with the current steam version is, that it shows to update xd
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> @Jupstar ✪ leaving the old ver for now?
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, but still u could give me the settings, or you could install visual studio
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> most windows system seem to work
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its very very hard to anticipate what causes yours to crash 😄
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spooky> yea
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen its probs related to the video recorder
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can reproduce the crash now
02:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can sometimes get the crash now
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok dunno got the crash 2 times in release mode, now relwithdebinfo no crashes
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but first happened when i enabled video recorder
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nope, doesnt work anymore... if it helps you, it was pretty sure right before half of the loading bar
03:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> my ddnet was on version 15 but somehow when i opened it again it's 14.7 wth
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> downgrade on steam
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> huh
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> was steam vers changed to 14.7
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> si
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can there be an option to skip the menu when you start the client?
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i dont hate it or anything but it throws me off a bit
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> and i love the " start server" button but it tabs me out of the client
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum Settings -> General -> Skip the main menu
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> nicuuu update
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i just checked out the new ddnet client, its really nice
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but when i try to Run Server, the client minimizes and the server doesnt start. probably because the map is missing
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen whats missing for the start menu icons is that they are instantly black/white again if mouse is not on it anymore. in 0.7 it fades out
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut why is the map missing?
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> dunno, probs my fault
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i didn't like the fade
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I didn't add it
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so, my maps folder has Gold Mine, but the autoexec says kobra 4
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats why
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Did you change the autoexec?
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you used autoupdater?
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how do i install sqlite3 for building ddnet on windows?
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut thanks, will be fixed
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it is bundled
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah ye
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 good that ur here
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i just tried to compile ddnet
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> doesnt work
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've been looking into something like vcpkg or chocolatey for windows, but it's rather hard to test VS stuff because it's slower than a toaster on my VM
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut it can't not work, it compiles on the CI
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756423333326749736/unknown.png
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then whats my problem
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't do python
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its your file
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd guess it's something to do with your python version
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i have python3
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 3.7.4
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats a python problem
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i seen many times
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can you help?
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> trying to remember what it was
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> position 2, could it be BOM?
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pip had that bug
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756424348688187482/unknown.png
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does it work with python2?
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> idk :D
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how to test it?
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can't work in py2
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's why I made py3 mandatory
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well it has to do smth with utf8
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye

10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe ur windows changed the file encoding
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> typical windows stuff u know
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how do i change it
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> right click the network.py and check
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im on linux rn
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but its generated files
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is no b4 on that line even
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but maybe changing the encoding makes it appear
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut can you upload network.py somewhere?
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for example
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not paste somewhere
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually send the file so I can take a look at the encoding
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756426406782697472/network.py
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there you go
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> network.py: C source, ISO-8859 text, with CRLF line terminators
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao file thinks its c source
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well looks like its encoded in latin-1
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is windows even
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> god awful operating system
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How is git thinking things should be encoded in latin1 and python thinking they should be encoded utf8?
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, this is not my file
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #!/usr/bin/env python3
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-```
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love how you don't mention that this is modified
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe just add that
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> everywhere
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 what is modified?
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe thats not related
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wait
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> OFC it's your modification...
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You have a stray backtick
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah no it doesnt make sense
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> line 234
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> uhm
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ofc it has to be modified
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> otherwise the encoding would be same
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i just pulled
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well okay then
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well it's backtick in my locale, god knows what it is in latin1
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah true
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will try to re-clone
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> git status
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it should tell you that indeed you have a dirty copy
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756427613979017256/unknown.png
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye, saw it ryop
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye, saw it ryo
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `git checkout -- datasrc/network.py` to reset it
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well u can change stuff and pull if it doesnt have merge conflicts u wouldnt even know, iirc
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is why I never pull
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also why I always reset my master to upstream master
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A dirty master is quite annoying
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i keep my master updated to updstream
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and make changes in branches
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> me too, i havent used this folder in ages
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You made me look at python before breakfast, before making sure that it was a clean repo. I am quite annoyed
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> im s orry
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2857
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> check this
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe u know better
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I completely agree that we need much more testing before a release, maybe we can jot down all the issues we've had in the past and boil that down to a list of things to test
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yep
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would be great if we could have a couple of people around here to test the release with us too
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756428908697485342/unknown.png
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the problem is we can't test on potato 2010 pcs
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which have most of the problems
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i managed to select 2 servers
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 😄
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, its the hover, not selected
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is hover the same color?
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess its floating point stuff
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur mouse is in the middle of 2
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> right
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki maybe I should buy some old laptops to test
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe xD
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the double hover effect only happens on the 7th and 8th entry of the browser for me
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756432363193499720/unknown.png
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do you keep breaking things that work for everyone?
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont know, just cloned freshly
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u musth ave a outdated version
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> of clang format?
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Im guessing old clang ye
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or maybe smth like that
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont knoooow xD
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for new changes people should test with github artifacts already, then problems can be found early. many here on discord should use the steam nightly. but what remains are autoupdater problems and problems that affect only few, like potato graphics.
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @n000b thoughts?
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> yes @Soreu im here if it is about the skins everyone is free to pullrequest but i think @fokkonaut added ddnet skins to the db already
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> @louis is that the name to ping? You probably built a nice collection of tw svgs already do you mind publishing them?
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> What is the label for feature proposals for github issues on ddnet project?
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I want to check for some kind of roadmap usually it's just issues.
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But I don't know how to filter. I've tried labels: enhancements, next-release and it doesn't seems to have any long-term goals or big features proposed.
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Are you ddnet guys are planning to add new features to protocol/client?
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> (phew, I've resisted to edit 4 my messages, so far so good)
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The next big thing for the protocol will be `SnapReplaceItem` so we can add new fields to existing netobjects without backwards compatibility code mess
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Oh it seems to be enhancements after all...
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For new features it's `enhancements` yeah
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> That SnapReplaceItem is not in issues, right?
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ok, found discussions here.
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Am I right and this function will replace a vanilla object with a custom one? So clients supporting only vanilla netobjects will use original snapshots and newer ones will parse both and use the last one?
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Like I dunno... I send a snapshot of a heart snapobject and then a SnapReplaceItem with an updated heart with more fields like it's size?
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And only newer clients will parse replaced netobject with more fields?
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @heinrich5991 will it work this way?
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've found exactly 4 messages on this function in this channel. Sorry for guessing.
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> does ddnet dev team have a patreon?
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nope
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I've been wondering if we should get one and do issue/feature bounties with anything gathered
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that indeed would motivate deveolpment
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> altho comparing dev activity from now to the past i would say we never been so active xd
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as now
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> why is download skins enabled by default...
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> why is download skins feature enabled by default...
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @heinrich5991 @deen any final decision on whether we can delete skins from the DB or you're coding alternative solution like flag or so that not every skin would be downloaded automatically?
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> before more ppl ask wtf is https://ddnet.tw/skins/skin/t-shirt.png
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hahaha
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i'm for deleting
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> then just waiting for heinrich's response in case he's in middle of working on something
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Soreu you can delete
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @ chillerdragon yea i have some stuff but its probably all random crap with none of it finished yet xd
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> is there any way DDNet Server process can communicate with DDNet Client process ? To share server connect password for example?
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> in mind comes only something trivial like writing data on drive into file
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > Though I've been wondering if we should get one and do issue/feature bounties with anything gathered
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> bounty for features would be awesome
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Soreu maybe u also want to fix skins with libpng warnings
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756507325103341608/libpng_warnings.txt
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> will try after we're done with cleaning up
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I know how it will sound.... but does it all mean I can upload my own skins and use fake characters as a custom projectiles? 😄
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It seems that I've got my custom sprites earlier than I've expected.
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> If I understand correctly - yes, if those skins would be uploaded to DDNet's skin DB
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ddnet without round edges looks nice xd
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756512734257872956/screenshot_2020-09-18_15-49-57.png
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> agreed
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i actuallyn ever liked the round edges b ecuase I play without fsaa and they look so harsh
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, and bcs hard edges look more modern
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never liked the round edges either 😄
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though they look amazing on this highdpi display
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ while you're modernizing the UI, you also want to get another background? or even get the map renderer working? I kind of failed and gave up
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can do that, but i won't modernize the whole gui, we need another gui anyway
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs currently it simulates the gui in the GFX frame
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats a real problem
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> need to split visualization and simulation
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just background maps like 0,7?
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eeeeh, please no rmgui
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what is that
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> retained mode gui, currently we have immediate mode gui
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it renders and does logic at the same time
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> decoupling the logic just creates an absolute mess of state synchronization
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the gui
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ yeah, this: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2731
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no, i'd write a simple gui myself, or does it intigrate into opengl versions?=
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> more html like gui tho
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can write both modes of gui yourself
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we dont need to go multithreaded
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Our current implementation is an example of immediate mode, where the logic lives with the style
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just remove the simulation from visiualization
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't you mean the logic by simulation?
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd bind the actual keys to event
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd bind the actual keys to events
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just like html does with its javascript impl
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, no. I don't support the idea at all
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its 100000 times faster
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> than simulating every shit every frame
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Who cares? It's a bug heaven
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This renders fine even on toasters with very acceptable fps, if the text was rendered deferred it'd be even better
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it renders like shit on opengl 3.3
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs streaming on 3.3+ is horrible
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it wants no bus activity
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it wants proper VRAM
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast I won't support merging it. I'll keep my own fork if it's merged
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> do as u want xD
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> @Jupstar ✪ how can i see ddnet without round edges?
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im with jupstar
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ u need to edit the code
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @<BµmM> i just disabled all corners... nothing is fixed for non corners
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ups
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wrong ping
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @<BµmM> if u can compile, i can upload it quickly into my github
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> ah
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> no xd
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> did you change anything with the ui?
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its the current version just without corners
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can compile it for u, if u want
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love how no one gives 3 shits what I think about anything
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> nah
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> I wait for the next update
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 i give a shit, but currently we wait for the mouse to update in the gfx thread bcs of the gui
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats just horrible
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @<BµmM> that won't be upstream soon
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I take it back, If an rmgui is merged before I also think it's a good idea, I'll just take my leave
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its just a hack
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> oh xd
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> anyway i dont need it
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> did you change anything with the ui?
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > I love how no one gives 3 shits what I think about anything
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 playing the victim card?
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in current version its a bit ddifferent yes
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its just 2 ppl in this chat u have yet to know heinrich take
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or deen
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> somehow it increased my gores skill xdd
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can more or less guess how they would respond to an UI cleanup
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Any cleanup is better than none at the end of the day
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Szturmi> where can i report a bug?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> here
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Szturmi github is the preferred place, but if you don't want to create an account one of us can post it for you too
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Szturmi> thx
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> learath you pinged the wrong person xd
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ i guess before you do such a huge UI change we should discuss if it's the right path
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but removing rounded corners is fine 😄
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen well lets say it like that:
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> idc about the gui too much, but if we want more changes, i wont use the current impl, even if its easy to use, the disadvantages are just killer for me xd
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it feels like wasted time
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I would go with Jupstar in this case. The current implementations seems at the very least "not right". Poor gpus
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> but as always the real problem if its even doable...
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @BannZay ofc it's doable, stateful gui brings with it many issues, like the ones faced by web browsers, modern js frameworks, modern web apps
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It brings the ugly solutions of the web into our codebase. MVC, flux, one way dataflow, whatever buzzword is the most popular right now. If you want to see how "beautiful" it looks and how "nice" it performs look no further than Qt or Swing
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> as far as I know even relatively old game frameworks made steps away from approach used in tw
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> Once again I came to game, I don't see my t-shirt skin (only default) while people on server do
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> do you have a log file?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think Learath2 showed you before how to create it
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> It's not creating
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> I've copypasted it to launch options

16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah might need quotes
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "logfile /tmp/dd.log"
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @deen you can remove Tournament from the News in client

16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> Some ppl see it on server, maybe they weren't restarting game after it got removed

16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, it's been deleted already, Soreu is cleaning up I think
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> t-shirt was cancer
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen can we implement background maps just like we do ingame when using entities with custom map
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the code looks like its destroying alot of things
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ yes, the code did destroy a lot
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if you can do it cleaner, sure
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'll try
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think i'll just try to load and display a map
17:11 <+ChillerDragon> @louis do you mind finishing or sharing it anyways just open a issue with the files here https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/images and ill sort them in for you or you can do it your self and pr
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @ChillerDragon I will do it later, because I have screenshot-backup, normal one, and way more sorted one from deen, so you will use whatever you see fit best
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yea i might later
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i have to find the files tho
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcell_HUN> I'm trying to make my server public, I opened the port but it still says it's closed, what should I do?
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <maggi323> sv_register 1
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> We have persian servers now?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @murpi yes
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The ones yesterday were actually in Dubai, but today I have some in Tehran
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ black screen indicates graphics problem? https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/discussions/0/2952629278001809992/
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen lets say it like this: no MacOS everything could be the problem xd
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but black screen sounds strange
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen lets say it like this: on MacOS everything could be the problem xd
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> more like a SDL thing(maybe)
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen do we also have a map from 0.7 to 0.6 converter xd
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @deen did you tag me somewhere, cant find it and i thought i saw a notification from you
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @n000b https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/756451495939014667
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2862
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oops, wrong link: https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=6972&p=68538#p68538
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I reported a similar issue yesterday. His description is similar to mine
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/756241435073708104
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> opengl got disabled after the major ui update got released. I think most people didn't notice that
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> with the recent update, my game get's extremely choppy after awhile (due to alt-tabbing alot?) not sure what the cause is but the only solution is to restart the game
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> edit: looks like enabling opengl fixed it. guess it was disabled prior to the update?
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we can also create the old background as map if smone wants it, bcs then it will be buffered for GL 3.3 xD
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen about that guy with the black screen, you can ask him to change opengl major in his config, but if its SDL related i have no plan whats wrong
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but u need to be verbose:
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> close client
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> change config
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> start client
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else they will do it wrong xd
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen i'll just do the background map ok? someone just has to map smth some day
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> who is laxa
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> is it possible to add a /name to change name in server (for 0.7)
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> is it possible to add a chat command to change name in server (for 0.7)
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> @NeXus  why you asking about him
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> He is a french player and hosts ddracepro
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @deen has the windows defender issue been resolved yet? I've got a report of someone having trouble with windows defender removing the ddnet.exe
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gorilla> I get this error when i try to start the ddnet.exe. Its saying this .exe possibly has a virus. I can only press the "ok" button and then the .exe automatically disappears. I'm using windows defender as murpi already mentioned
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gorilla> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756591529283420300/unknown.png
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Try updating your antivirus viruses definition list @Gorilla
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gorilla> @Soreu how can I do this?
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/microsoft-defender-security-center-antivirus#definition-version
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Learath2  more false reports
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Damn extortion ring....
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gorilla> it works. thanks
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wtf is this, do they just keep marking us until we pay for premium enterprise support?
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> xd
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Well, nothing really surprises me with Microsoft
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @Ama does he host ddnet too?
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> doesnt laxa host the ddnet teamspeak
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> yes and I think I found some safety issue, so who do I report this
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Learath2
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> laxa is on irc
21:37 <+Ryozuki> test
21:38 <+bridge> [freenode] <NeXus> hello
21:38 <+bridge> [freenode] <NeXus> bruh Idk how irc works, how can I contact him
21:39 <+Ryozuki> bruh ur on freenode
21:39 <+Ryozuki> we are on quakenet
21:39 <+Ryozuki> xD
21:39 < NeXus_> test
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen why did u implement the censoring on server? it should be on the client and opt-in
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ ok
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen finished the logic for background maps, now we need maps for it xd
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cant we convert 0.7 maps to 0.6 easily somehow?
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> just throw Multimap in the BG and it's done
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Can't wait for those Vietnam flashbacks to hit hard xD
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ i don't know, I think they added some things like bezier animations?
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mh ok
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know if that's the reason why we can't load them though
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe we can backport support for those animations?
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> is that where the loading fails?
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i havent checked, i just noticed alot of "double free'd" things
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so some overflows
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I thought their backgrounds looked nice, so would be cool if we can get them usable
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes they look good
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can open them in 0.6 editor just fine
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> did you try opening them in ddnet editor and just saving them again? 😄
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no, i'll try 😄
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Makoyuri> yes bascially no skins in steam version
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Makoyuri> the menu and shit updated but idk feel like i've got even less skins lol,
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we removed some skins, yes
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for legal reasons yet again
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen animations are broken tho
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but instead skins are auto-downloaded from skin db
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Makoyuri> xd
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Makoyuri> wait so i have to download skins
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ ok, so we'd need to support bezier
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Makoyuri> i mean that's not the problem
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Makoyuri not manually, that should happen automatically
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Makoyuri> it also says it's "0.6"
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's ok
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Makoyuri> cool, so i have to use ddnet's client
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Makoyuri> from website?
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The one from Steam should work just the same
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Makoyuri> yeah but it doesn't i guess :feelsbad:
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddracenetwork on steam
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Can you access https://skins.ddnet.tw/skin/aaa.png ?
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not teeworlds
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Makoyuri> yes
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Makoyuri> i know
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ups
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Makoyuri> yeah i can access it lol
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Makoyuri> should i dl?
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nope. In DDNet client set F1, cl_show_console 1, restart client
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ or recreate some simpler linear movements, not sure which is easier and whether it looks good enough
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah idc, should look ok with linear movement too
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @deen well maybe 1 day before release make an announcement on discord. People can react with thumbs up if they didn't found any problems. Not sure if this works but atleast people know that they could be helpful
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how do i use beta testing on steam client
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or do u just download from github
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis settings -> properties -> beta
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 i guess the binary find works reliably? I didn't check closely, but that also changed recently
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If anyone can help with fixing the skin issues with bad graphics and crashes I'd appreciate it. Maybe someone else can reproduce?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> are all skins valid for pnglite?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, I think so
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and even if not, it shouldn't cause crashes etc
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> skin db has been used for years
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well libpng showed alot of warnings 😄
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah true
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so i don't think the skins are broken
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i am curious about one thing
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it showed a tile set texture
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I could imagine some software could be proxying all http(s) and recompressing the pngs, but I don't think that's it
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe it sometimes returns a wrong texture handle
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But we just create a normal skin once it's downloaded
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the same way the other skins are initially loaded
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/342454474117218334/756485914036797540/unknown.png
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it could also be the string overflow
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that looks like totally corrupted memory, yeah
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i sent here some valgrind, that demo page breaks when u startt client with german and change to english
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for me it keeps german ind ebug mode
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> always xd
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and in release it often just writes random stuff
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> works fine for me, weird
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/756624439298490489/screenshot_2020-09-18_23-15-12.png
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> started with german, went to the page with german, changed to english
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> breaks
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> can't reproduce 😦
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/755427277222838362
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ok, I see some statics with localize, that can't work
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen if binary find was broken we'd have localization issues long before
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but that seems to have been broken for 2 years, probably not the cause of the new problem
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> will fix
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe bcs many skin names, but yeah
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if that guy can reproduce it, he's on linux
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he could just valgrind it
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 ok
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I hate these unreproducable bugs
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> understandable
