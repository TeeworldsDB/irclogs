17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Roman> hi guys, i found a possible bug today with the DDNet client
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Roman> connection/dummy issues with the newest version in 0.6.4, 11.4.6
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <painn> why do i only lag on ger server while everyone else seems to be fine
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <painn> also only lagging while playing, if im in spec everything is fine
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Roman> me too, but only under certain circumstances
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Roman> altough i have a ping of 7
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <painn> my ping is fine too
18:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Roman> do u have usual laggs or input packet loss?
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <painn> what do u mean by usual laggs
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Roman> idk, if the "Connection problems..." text occures and you see everyone else also lagging
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <painn> i dont get connections problem thing
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <painn> just feels like 500ping
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <painn> everyone going through walls and stuff
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Roman> okay, then it's something different
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <painn> also its only on ddnet ger servers every other server works fine for me
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Roman> i see everything fine, but half of my inputs are not sent or not received by the server lol, i mean, i can't move, but only if my dummy is connected
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Roman> sounds like a provider problem
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <painn> could be but my routing seems to be fine
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> how do we deal with unicode in ddnet/teeworlds?
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Roman> so, anyone feeling responsible for handling my issue?
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <painn> i wish i could
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @painn i have the same problem on GER btw, not just you
19:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <painn> good to know
