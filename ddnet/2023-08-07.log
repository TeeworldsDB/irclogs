16:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why the red channel
16:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and not green or blue?
16:05 < bridge_> <patiga> fun to see how you can make out the history of the client a little by looking at the atlas
16:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> true
16:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lol epic
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Because because. It has no reason XD. Probably BCS u usually say rgb
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In earlier OpenGL in was the alpha channel

16:54 < bridge_> <ikizuu> where do i modify the server tickrate?
16:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's no use
16:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If u do, you change the physics
16:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If you don't care. U can find it in protocol.h I think
16:55 < bridge_> <ikizuu> yeah its in protocol.h but it glitches out when there are 2 players in the server
16:55 < bridge_> <ikizuu> and makes them teleport all over the map
16:56 < bridge_> <ikizuu> so i was wondering how to change that
16:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The client needs to change it too
16:57 < bridge_> <ikizuu> then where do you change the client tick

17:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks look im a active  dev
17:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> now ur turn
17:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> After holidays I continue with ddnetpg. And then i rq ddnet and only build Vulkan compute shader software xd
17:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
17:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6839
17:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this seems important
17:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> For Heinrichs quic impl maybe
17:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'd favor putting network in a different thread
17:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think it'd generally be good for correctness
17:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the code as it currently is looks like it's attempting something but not doing it
17:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'd say having to rely on it isn't really correct
17:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> net on a thread means lot of sync right?
17:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't think alternative implementations are that important to whether this particular issue should be fixed or not
17:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Better than sys calls
17:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why is that an issue tho
17:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The client should simply have min 50fps
17:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In minimized u probably don't care
17:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> currently, this thing does:
17:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```
17:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> while(total wait time has not passed)
17:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> {
17:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991>     sleep_unless_a_network_packet_is_waiting()
17:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> }
17:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```
17:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> this seems incorrect no matter how I look at it
17:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah bro BCS u wanted it xd
17:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I said just sleep
17:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's not what I wanted
17:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it should sleep and check if total right?
17:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it should sleep and wait for a network packet
17:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if there's a network packet, process it
17:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It should just sleep. Nothing more
17:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> then continue sleeping
17:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> why do you think that's better than what I propose?
17:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> BCS network should not rely on main thread
17:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No sys calls
17:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> sleep is a syscall. no network sys calls?
17:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> why not?
17:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> anyway
17:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> this is orthogonal
17:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the current code is wrong for the current architecture
17:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> hence I opened the issue
17:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```cpp
17:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki>             do
17:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki>             {
17:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki>                 net_socket_read_wait(m_aNetClient[CONN_MAIN].m_Socket, SleepTimeInNanoSecondsInner);
17:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki>                 auto NowInnerCalc = time_get_nanoseconds();
17:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki>                 SleepTimeInNanoSecondsInner -= (NowInnerCalc - NowInner);
17:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki>                 NowInner = NowInnerCalc;
17:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki>             }
17:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki>             while((SleepTimeInNanoSecondsInner / std::chrono::nanoseconds(1us).count()) > 0ns);
17:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
17:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> should it be a do while?
17:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no need to wait if the wait time already passed
17:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no
17:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> A sleep has almost deterministic runtime tho
17:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rly?
17:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i heard it doesnt
17:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Network syscalls create laggs
17:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Almost = as good as it can
17:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> even if this is a problem, it seems orthogonal to the issue. unless the architecture is changed, the main thread does the network
17:21 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yes, that's the filled glyph atlas with my change, I added a temporary debug feature to render it for testing
17:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> hence the code is currently wrong. network syscalls will happen on the main thread
17:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> hence the code is currently wrong. network syscalls will happen on the main thread anyway
17:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But the current network code seems fine, and as described in the issue, there are other problems
17:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So if u fix it, fix it everywhere
17:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And if u fix it everywhere fix the architecture
17:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> we can discuss the architecture separately
17:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yet another useless discussion opened
17:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> or we can also not discuss it if you want
17:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sounds good
17:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I prefer to just code my style and then rq
17:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
17:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but if we don't change the architecture, I think that the issue I created describes a bug with the current code
17:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> by architecture u mean the code structure?
17:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> design
17:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But also fixes one tbf
17:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> One that imo is more drastic
17:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> current architecture = network on main thread
17:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> after fixing the issue I opened, the bug you fixed should still be fixed, no?
17:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> after fixing the issue I opened, the bug you fixed should still be gone, no?
17:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes, go ahead
17:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i wont do it cuz idk much
17:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki try xd
17:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> basically you'd need to invert the logic, I think
17:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> sleep at the end of the main loop, go through it again if an event happened, but only render if the next render target has passed
17:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it returns 1
17:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if it read?
17:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> net_socket_read_wait is undocumented
17:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yea, looks a bit complicated to get this right ^^
17:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yeah i cant wrap my head around this rn xd
17:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yea, seems to return 1 if a network packet is waiting
17:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah net_socket_read_wait doesnt block?
17:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> >  go through it again if an event happened,
17:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what is an event here
17:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > but only render if the next render target has passed
17:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what is a render target
17:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Better only handle network packets of possible. The whole main loop creates extra noise again
17:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If
19:05 < bridge_> <hamidreza6> Does 17.2 client support 128 slots?

19:20 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> sometimes it makes the game play audio 10 times louder, sometimes it breaks my tee like in the screenshot after rejoining
19:23 < bridge_> <robyt3> Does it happen only when you set `cl_multiview_zoom_smoothness` to a low value? Or any time you change this variable? Or is it unrelated?
19:23 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> only low values
19:23 < bridge_> <Voxel> LOL
19:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Nice fps drops
19:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think this happens when cursor is at 0,0
19:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Causing Nan in float calc
19:38 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> also u cant multiview when theres no one near but u can remove everyone from multiview so it does this weird thing idk lol
19:38 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1138164239467544718/DDNet_Client_2023-08-07_19-35-09.mp4
19:39 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> idk if its intended
19:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Xd
19:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Totally intended
19:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If u got GH account just add it to the issue
19:53 < bridge_> <Ewan> good afternoon
19:53 < bridge_> <Ewan> no it's still morning technically
19:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: cool video btw
19:56 < bridge_> <avolicious> We could do default colors, but we tried to apply custom colors, which is harder than we've guessed üôÇ Sometimes its failing, but there are some good ones too
20:02 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> is there a way to create a random skin with the console
20:03 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> ive been trying to find it rn for a bit
20:04 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> a nvm there is no console command
20:04 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> makes sense
21:04 < bridge_> <vy0x2> > also u cant multiview when theres no one near
21:04 < bridge_> <vy0x2> Yes, if there is nothing you are looking at, it wont turn on. Thats intended.
21:04 < bridge_> <vy0x2> > but u can remove everyone from multiview so it does this weird thing idk lol
21:04 < bridge_> <vy0x2> Yes, if no tee is selected it will spectate the whole team instead
21:05 < bridge_> <vy0x2> I will look into it thanks.

22:27 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 the debugger talk?
22:28 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 yea robsti did not get a warm welcome by Oy
22:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: yes, the debugger talk
22:34 < ChillerDragon> @scrumplex a seems to be a selfcompiled issue you probably dont ship the proper creds/config for the ms stuff
23:35 < bridge_> <scrumplex> uh we do :O
23:36 < bridge_> <scrumplex> our client id is this though: https://prismlauncher.org/.well-known/microsoft-identity-association.json
23:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> another multimc fork? why
23:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> prism is dope
23:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> multimc is a bad author
23:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> what does it have over multimc
23:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a not angry dev for publishing it on arch aur
23:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> anyway its good
23:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> paired with modrinth
23:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it also handles curse anti user rights quite well
23:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> he's mad that he can't publish it on extra or what
23:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> he is mad he used a free software license and someone other than him published a aur package
23:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or smth
23:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> he is stupid
23:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh
23:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol
23:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think it was this, this drama
23:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i forgot
23:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> hmm
23:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> can u get curse modpacks from within the prism client
23:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> i remember reading that without a per-user key it wouldn't be possible
23:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> i hate overwolf & all the other clients
23:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> i hate overwolf & all the other big $$$ clients
23:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> having to use the twitch app to download modpacks was prob the reason i didn't get into them earlier
