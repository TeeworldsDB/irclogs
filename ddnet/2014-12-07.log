00:00 <@heinrich5991> yes, makes sense
00:07 <@deen> would need to create a template for teeworlds packages for that and I don't really feel like doing that

01:02 <@deen> laxa: i see your TS server being overtaken by Chileans :P
01:03 < laxa> not only
01:03 < laxa> I have a friend who make his guild come on TS
01:03 <@deen> nice
01:03 < laxa> average users the evening : 30
01:03 <@deen> i only watch ddnet.tw/status^^
01:03 < laxa> I really like TS
01:03 < laxa> it doesn't take any ressources beside bandwith
01:04 < Learath2> mumble master race :P
01:08 < Learath2> im stuck on 20 users at peak ;/
01:42 < Maple> !twp Broken
01:42 < Nimda> No Broken found online.
02:46 < xrothx> deen: 
02:46 < xrothx> are you there? 
02:46 <@deen> hi xrothx 
02:46 < xrothx> will you stay for 20 more minutes? 
02:46 <@deen> actually I wanted to go to bed, not sure now^^
02:47 <@deen> what do you want?
02:47 < xrothx> Well
02:47 < xrothx> At this moment 
02:47 < xrothx> Its the least impact on the server to update things
02:47 < xrothx> So I wanted to update the map on the royal server 
02:47 < xrothx> & you can update the mod
02:48 < xrothx> but @ once
02:48 < xrothx> not too much downtime
02:48 <@deen> well, mod update is never necessary
02:48 <@deen> we will just do a map reload
02:48 <@deen> then all players stay connected
02:48 < xrothx> okay
02:48 < xrothx> Great
02:48 <@deen> mod update will happen automatically when server goes empty
02:48 < xrothx> Bip made a new version
02:48 <@deen> and that will definitely happen some time^^
02:48 < xrothx> I edited a little aswell
02:49 < xrothx> But Candysclan is credited like they asked for weeks now.. --'
02:49 < xrothx> :P
02:50 <@deen> never liked candys clan
02:50 < xrothx> Well, he was threatning me
02:50 < xrothx> to close my servers if I don't update the credits and shit
02:50 <@deen> you're giving them credit because they're threatening you?
02:50 < xrothx> No lol
02:50 < xrothx> I give them because Bip asked me
02:50 <@deen> they actually deserve credit, then give them
02:50 <@deen> otherwise not
02:51 < xrothx> Yes
02:51 <@deen> independent of any threats
02:51 < xrothx> But I didn't do exactly how he wanted
02:51 < xrothx> he wanted his site url all over the map ? 
02:51 < xrothx> Don't like that
02:51 <@deen> haha
02:51 < xrothx> No publicity on my server. --'
02:51 <@deen> and why do they need credits?
02:51 < xrothx> I deleted the www. & the .de
02:51 < xrothx> His name is more then enough
02:52 <@deen> what's his name?
02:52 < xrothx> CandysClan
02:52 < xrothx> oh that guy..
02:52 < xrothx> Got him on skype
02:52 < xrothx> But how do I send the map? 
02:52 < xrothx> Mail/upload? 
02:53 <@deen> see PM
02:53 <@deen> the leader of candys clan?
02:56 <@deen> candysclan.de?
02:56 <@deen> that site is totally filled with spam...
02:57 < xrothx> yes.. 
02:57 < xrothx> :P
02:57 < xrothx> lol
02:57 < xrothx> uploaded
02:57 < xrothx> you can change
02:57 <@deen> and the leader is called "Hard Candy"?
02:57 < xrothx> yes
02:57 <@deen> what an idiot...
02:58 < xrothx> :p
02:58 < xrothx> haha
02:58 < xrothx> can I reload? 
02:59 < xrothx> deen: 
02:59 <@deen> now
03:08 < xrothx> thank you for your time
03:08 < xrothx> Will you stay 5 more minutes? 
03:08 < xrothx> They really do not accept any changes.. lol
03:09 < xrothx> I will just fix the spawnblock.. And let the map do the rest 64players often.. Should be enough to make it work good
03:09 < xrothx> deen: 
03:09 <@deen> ok
03:10 <@deen> i know they don't
03:10 < xrothx> deen:  Can you send me the older version? 
03:10 < xrothx> The one online a moment ago
03:10 <@deen> have to search it
03:10 < xrothx> Ok thank you
03:10 < xrothx> I have 1 minute mapping work.. 
03:12 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/maps/blmapV3ROYAL.map
03:13 <@deen> i hope that's it
03:13 < xrothx> ok thx
03:13 < xrothx> moment, I ll upload soon
03:14 <@deen> EastByte: players are better at fuzzing than my tools I guess
03:14 <@deen> caught a segfault in a coredump!
03:15 <@deen> I'm wondering if you have anything special set on EUR, because it always segfaults while no other server does
03:17 < xrothx> deen:  2nd one
03:17 < xrothx> 3:17 last edit
03:17 <@deen> ?
03:17 < xrothx> uploaded it
03:17 < xrothx> but I did a wrong first I think
03:18 <@deen> doesn'T matter, gets overwritten
03:18 <@deen> feel free to reload

14:32 < Archangel_> Hello
14:32 <@deen> hi Archangel_ 
14:33 < Archangel_> I just want to ask how do i connect a ddnet server to a sql database
14:33 <@deen> you create the database, create the user in mysql/mariadb
14:33 <@deen> then look here for the sql settings: http://ddnet.tw/settingscommands/
14:33 <@deen> set them correctly
14:33 <@deen> and compile your own sql capable server with bam server_sql_release
14:34 <@deen> (the one distributed with regular release is non-sql)
14:34 < Archangel_> ok thanks deen
14:35 <@deen> What are you trying to do?
14:37 < Archangel_> Save Aip Race Times and Open Fng Kills To Databases So I Can Create A Website To Display Rankings
14:39 <@deen> Aip Race and OpenFNG, you're clearly South African :P
14:39 <@deen> is this for AfriGamer?
14:40 < Archangel_> Yes
14:40 < Archangel_> Im the owner
14:40 <@deen> ah, nice
14:40 < Archangel_> Lol how did you know
14:41 <@deen> Because Aip Race and OpenFNG are popular in South Africa
14:41 < Archangel_> Thats true so i wanted to ask are you interested in joining teamspeak and maybe helping us out a bit:)
14:41 <@deen> I don't really do Teamspeak, sorry
14:41 < Archangel_> Chilled:)
14:41 < Archangel_> skype?
14:42 <@deen> or anything where you talk to people
14:42 < Archangel_> ah chilled man:)
14:43 < Archangel_> Well thanks for the help anyway man much appreciated
14:43 <@deen> You're welcome, nice to see someone running DDNet mod =)
14:43 < Archangel_> :)
14:44 < Archangel_> Yea well ill pop in now and then if i get stuck
14:44 <@deen> Oh, there are over 50 servers running ddnet mod that are not official, nice
14:46 < Archangel_> what you mean not official?:P
14:46 <@deen> Official servers: http://ddnet.tw/status
14:46 <@deen> They're run by DDNet and all ranks are connected worldwide
14:46 <@deen> with http://ddnet.tw/ranks and so on
14:47 < Archangel_> Awww man thats the system i want to set up
14:47 < Archangel_> lol
14:47 <@deen> Yeah, have been working on it for a long time now
14:48 <@deen> It's grown a bit recently^^: http://ddnet.tw/players http://ddnet.tw/mappers http://ddnet.tw/releases
14:48 <@deen> But this kind of system is already running in South Africa, you know?
14:48 <@deen> DDNet South Africa
14:48 < Archangel_> Awesome man
14:48 < Archangel_> yea
14:48 < Archangel_> but i wanna get something wage was running
14:49 <@deen> what do you mean?
14:51 <@deen> btw: nice, a south african made the most points on ddnet last week: http://ddnet.tw/players/Lem0n/
15:01 < Nimda> DDNet South Africa went down!
15:03 <@deen> Well, talking about DDNet South Africa^^
15:12 < Nimda> DDNet South Africa went back online!

15:17 < Savander> Hi
15:17 < Savander> !:)
15:33 < Savander> YEA
15:33 < Savander> 30 players on zCatch!!
15:34 <@deen> nice!
15:34 < Savander> awesome :>
16:32 < niceonetee> hi all
16:33 < niceonetee> can u help me? i compiled server with custom gametype and when i login into rcon
16:34 < niceonetee> i dont have acces to commands
16:38 <@deen> niceonetee: hi
16:38 <@deen> niceonetee: you changed the gametype of ddnet server?
16:38 < niceonetee> yap
16:38 <@deen> what you're seeing now is a security measurement
16:38 <@deen> you can disable it somewhere in the source, let me see
16:39 < niceonetee> in server.cpp
16:40 <@deen> in src/engine/shared/protocol.h you can just set VERSION_DDNET_RCON_PROTECT to 9999
16:40 <@deen> without the last underline
16:40 <@deen> it prevents others from taking over rcon from you, but the client only enables it on DDNet servers
16:40 <@deen> because it looks terrible on servers that don't support it
16:43 < niceonetee> oh!
16:43 < niceonetee> big thx for support!
16:43 <@deen> you're welcome
16:43 <@deen> we probably need a way for the server to tell the client what features it supports
16:43 <@deen> same as the other way around
16:46 < niceonetee> deen, now u make me totally happy! :3 big big big thx
16:50 < Maple> haha
17:17 < Learath2> deen: does the debug build work fine on windows 
17:17 < Learath2> not sure if you are on windows tho
17:19 < Learath2> i can only get it to compile if i mv json.c json.cpp
17:50 <@deen> Learath2: weird, I'm not on windows so no idea =/
17:50 <@deen> Fixes very welcome
17:52 < Learath2> deen: well if i compile debug with optimization that seems to work too
17:52 < Learath2> just not sure if its only my computer
17:52 <@deen> strange
17:52 <@deen> I noticed that DDNet doesn't compile with -O3 either
17:52 <@deen> should be fixed now
17:53 < Learath2> the inline functions in json.h somehow get fixed by the -O2 on release build 
17:53 <@deen> it's probably our fault
17:54 <@deen> if you can get it fixed, do so please
17:54 < Learath2> i can but just need one more person to verify its not my specific setup
17:54 <@deen> Savander is on Windows, but he just left
17:58 <@deen> Woo, libyaml segfaults, looks like a buffer overflow!
18:02 < Learath2> still fuzzing stuff ?
18:02 <@deen> yes
18:03 <@deen> with rare successes
18:03 < Learath2> btw only had to fix one SIGSEGV before getting the autoupdate to start up so thats nice :)
18:03 <@deen> libyaml looks like the main YAML library so a buffer overflow in there is nice
18:04 < Learath2> afl seems pretty intelligent for a 5000 line program :P
18:04 <@deen> it intelligently steals the logic from GCC
18:05 <@deen> gcc marks the paths through the program and afl-fuzz uses that information
18:05 <@deen> hm, why is my buffer "optimized out" in gdb even though I use -O0
18:15 <@deen> Ok, pretty sure this is security relevant, that's a first for me
19:29 <@deen> EastByte: from EUR I can't reach mysql database on GER, you know why?
19:31 <@EastByte> deen: did you use HH before?
19:31 <@deen> ?
19:31 <@EastByte> it's because of the firewall
19:31 <@EastByte> HH isn't affected by the firewall
19:31 <@deen> aaah
19:31 <@deen> ^^
19:31 <@EastByte> because it's at ovh
19:31 <@deen> true, ok
19:31 <@deen> because I wanted to use GER database for EUR
19:31 <@EastByte> maybe you can bind to the third (firewall less) ip ? :D
19:32 <@deen> HH goes down too often
19:32 <@deen> no, i won't do that :P
19:33 <@EastByte> I don't want to change the firewall rules right now
19:35 <@EastByte> I think I'll let EUR run out, only ~20% off ddnet ist playing there
19:35 <@EastByte> it's not worth it
19:54 <@deen> ok
19:57 <@deen> apparently GER is under attack
20:32 <@deen> xrothx: any ddos attacks on GER today?
20:33 < xrothx> Not yet
20:33 < xrothx> let me check 
20:33 < xrothx> Or it should be filtered already
20:33 < xrothx> they can't use 2x the same method
20:34 < xrothx> None today deen 
20:36 <@deen> ah, ok
20:36 <@deen> they reported some lags on GER for a few minutes
21:07 < Nicos> hey deen
21:07 <@deen> hi Nicos 
21:08 < Nicos> You, know, about 5 week ago i said you if i can be a tester
21:08 < Nicos> ...

21:08 < Nicos> with the testers rules?
21:08 < Nicos> plss

21:25 < Nicos> are you in @deen ?
21:26 < Nicos> ...
21:27 < Nicos> must go. tomorrow
22:59 < Savander> Hi :)
22:59 <@deen> hi again
23:07 <@deen> found another nice segfault in libyaml
23:07 <@deen> not even sure how that works, backtrace in gdb doesn't even work anymore
23:11 < Learath2> Savander: are you on windows ?
23:11 < Savander> yes
23:11 < Learath2> MSVC or MinGW ?
23:11 < Savander> both
23:12 < Learath2> nice could you do a favor for me? does the client debug build work for both 
23:12 < Savander> idk which i using
23:13 < Savander> but i guess
23:13 <@deen> set it in config.bam I think
23:13 < Savander> i using mingw
23:13 < Savander> ahm
23:13 < Savander> so i'll check
23:13 < Savander> wait
23:13 <@deen> config.lua*
23:14 < Savander> compiler.driver = 'gcc'
23:14 < Learath2> mingw
23:15 < Savander> so?:)
23:16 < Learath2> can you try bam client_debug
23:17 < Savander> ye siure
23:17 < Savander> give me a code
23:17 < Learath2> you have the ddnet code ?
23:17 < Savander> not updated
23:17 < Savander> but wait
23:20 < Savander> woah new branch
23:20 < Savander> 128players
23:20 < Savander> :P
23:25 < Savander> Learath2:  http://pastebin.com/APDDyFuf
23:26 <@deen> Savander: =)
23:26 < Learath2> yeah nice 
23:26 < Learath2> thank you :)
23:27 < Learath2> Savander: could you give it a go with MSVC too ?
23:27 < Learath2> want to be sure if this applies to mingw only or the whole of windows
23:31 < Savander> weird
23:31 < Savander> i compiled bam
23:31 < Savander> to mscv
23:32 < Savander> and it's still gcc ;p
23:33 < Learath2> uhm you know the msvc command line ?
23:33 < Savander> nope
23:33 < Learath2> check your start menu
23:33 < Learath2> it should be around
23:33 < Learath2> you need to "bam config" with msvc command line
23:37 < Savander> ok
23:38 < Learath2> Savander: worked ?
23:38 < Savander> compiler.driver = 'cl'
23:38 < Learath2> nice
23:39 < Savander> http://pastebin.com/GH9AFF7Q
23:40 < Savander> such different
23:41 < Learath2> oh wow didnt expect that at all
23:41 < Learath2> Savander: does the client_release seem to work ?
23:41 < Savander> idk
23:41 < Savander> wait
23:42 < Savander> nope
23:42 < Learath2> same COFF stuff ?
23:43 < Savander> it looks same
23:43 < Savander> to client_debug
23:43 < Savander> in MSCV now
23:43 < Savander> i'll try gcc
23:43 < Savander> ok
23:43 < Savander> gcc
23:43 < Savander> works
23:43 < Learath2> yeah i think thats your msvc i fixed that by instaling SP1 for Visual studio
23:43 < Savander> mscv nope
23:43 < Savander> maybe
23:43 < Savander> i always use
23:44 < Savander> gcc
23:44 < Savander> :p
23:44 < Learath2> dont bother mingw > msvc anyways :D
23:44 < Learath2> Bear  seems to use msvc so ill ask him when he is around
23:44 < Savander> ok :)
23:44 < Savander> gcc works for me
23:44 < Learath2> thanks for the help tho :)
23:44 < Savander> np, i have to go
23:44 < Savander> bye :)
23:44 < Learath2> bye
