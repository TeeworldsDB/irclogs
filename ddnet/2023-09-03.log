00:01 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Gotta do git conflict driven development
00:01 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Reduce git conflict surface and merge often. Pr as much as possible upstream.
00:02 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> Make new organisation for every commit possible
00:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea
00:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> they should just start over
00:03 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Bombay is still closed src is it?
00:03 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> Yep
00:03 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> I think there was a leak few times, so you can actually get old sources
00:03 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Imo the don’t talk about bots rule should be replaced by don’t talk about closed src projects
00:04 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> Don't talk about closed src bota
00:04 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> Don't talk about closed src bots
00:05 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> Thats why they are looking for someone to help them i guess :hm:
00:05 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> So much developer time gets wasted on developing 8 block mods in parallel.
00:05 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> Dafuq
00:05 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> I can recall ddpp and f-ddrace
00:05 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> BW
00:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> And Nudels new mod
00:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> And the Russians
00:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Two Russians
00:06 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> :okSanya:
00:06 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Faulty and s-ddrace
00:07 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> What are other two
00:07 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> Actually 3 russians then
00:07 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> Kio faulty and altameda
00:07 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> Kio, faulty and altameda
00:07 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Altameda idk never heard of it but yea I don’t know all
00:07 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea
00:08 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Imagine them all working together on a open fork of ddnet that gets maintained and is free to use by all
00:08 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> honestly id call it bootleg blockworlds :troll:
00:08 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> Its not rly populated but it had tournament few month ago and even own twitch streamer kekw
00:08 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> the name is uh
00:08 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> like something stupid
00:08 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> ddfightnetwork or something
00:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> lmfao
00:08 < bridge_> <teero777> then wed just run out of ideas after some time xd
00:08 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> Sounds awful:troll:
00:09 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Oh no
00:09 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> So horrible all ideas being implemented
00:09 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> fokkonaut is already bloated enough
00:09 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> I think idea of dropping 07 and vanilla support is good, lets start with it
00:10 < bridge_> <teero777> ddnet underground fight club :o
00:10 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Yea it probably won’t work due to different ideas
00:10 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> But people could still fork a base block mod
00:10 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> also some of them are closed source cause like um so others dont have servers and steal it = less players, also a lot of the servers happen to have donor which means less money
00:10 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> im pretty sure
00:10 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> :troll:
00:10 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> The issue is more that people are super protective and do not want to share any code that could be used by others
00:11 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Yea cyber
00:11 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I mean sure competition can be cool and so on.
00:11 < bridge_> <teero777> as long it doesnt hurt other people like bots or smth and doesnt have anything ground breaking like sentient tw ai then ig it should be opensource
00:12 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Agreed
00:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> they are insecure
00:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> free software is better
00:12 < bridge_> <teero777> aha their afraid other people will laugh about their code 😂
00:12 < bridge_> <Anime.pdf> Free software is cool, you can take it, edit a little and make it proprietary
00:12 < bridge_> <teero777> aha theyre afraid other people will laugh about their code 😂
00:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no, they are insecure about others taking over and improving
00:13 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Imagine ddnet was also closed src. Then there would be 20 different ddrace implementation. And far less mature Block servers.
00:13 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> ddpersian is calling
00:51 < bridge_> <__admin> which part of the code traps and hides the cursor?
00:51 < bridge_> <__admin> btw thx for unmuting me
07:43 < bridge_> <j.0u> Hello
07:44 < bridge_> <j.0u> How can I make a specific bind that can perform the 1 0 "toggle" operation on the same button
07:44 < bridge_> <j.0u> I want it to turn on and off
09:01 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Yes I was working on that. It will hopefully be part of the next update  https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7102
09:02 < bridge_> <marmare_314> Why is it worse for editing individual points?
09:15 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Probably some call to sdl. I would search for sdl.\*mouse also you can have a look at the toggle\_console method it should have the code
09:17 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Bro is making a hack client click hud
09:36 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/3ff799770c91ba2c485d6159f6e6f47cf6badafb/src/game/client/components/console.cpp#L857-L868 @j.0u
09:37 < ChillerDragon> ops wrong bing meant @__admin
09:37 < ChillerDragon> @j.0u on and off in one key press is not possible. On and off in two key presses is possible if the bind rebinds it self.
10:20 < bridge_> <robyt3> @Skin Database Crew Was #5988 already resolved (the default skin being bad)?
10:20 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5988
12:30 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> DDNet is not that much affected by "too small player base" issue. Competition can be good for a mature project with reasonably enough players number.
12:30 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> 
12:30 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Imagine a game mod which requires 8 players for a properly balanced and full-featured round. Add a fact that sometimes the mod have 20 players but usually there are 4-6-8 players. And then add a competition server. Some players join it because it appeared first or e.g. because it has better ping, other players still play on the old server for the same reason. The player base is split => the dev is upset, the mod is dead.
13:44 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5654#issuecomment-1704256268
13:57 < bridge_> <Iza> i really dont like this change
14:31 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> they asked me too since i merged some mods already xd iirc i had no time either
14:31 < bridge_> <__admin> 🤓
15:02 < bridge_> <matodor> What is this even for? So all servers have their own prefix in the name
15:02 < bridge_> <matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147879251878608996/image.png

15:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> can't we simply make it so that there is a `+` - Sign
15:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and you can add custom tabs or predefined tabs and also remove them
15:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `tig` is a nice command-line interface for this 🙂
15:06 < bridge_> <Iza> imo a "DDNet" tab should be the first tab, with only official ddnet.org servers. And then a "Trusted Servers" tab, with its own filters like kog, fng etc.
15:06 < bridge_> <Iza> and last "Internet" tab
15:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
15:07 < bridge_> <Iza> @matodor can you explain why you gave that reaction?
15:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sadly nobody gives reason for this new change
15:08 < bridge_> <Iza> yeah idk, i must be missunderstanding something
15:09 < bridge_> <chairn> i guess it breaks equality for kog
15:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> which equality exactly?
15:09 < bridge_> <chairn> client shouldn't probably favor any mod
15:09 < bridge_> <matodor> it will kill the rest of the unpopular gamemodes
15:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> we can add gores to ddnet, no problem
15:09 < bridge_> <chairn> the one that is currently on with kog and ddnet tabs
15:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that doesnt require kog to exist
15:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think ddnet doesn't have to have its own tab, it should compete on its merits
15:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> being open by default at first start should be enough
15:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bad opinion
15:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet is just ddrace
15:13 < bridge_> <Iza> it's fair to assume that non-ddrace gamemodes are dying because of the ddnet client, but have you asked each playerbase and network what modes they like the most?
15:14 < bridge_> <Iza> and by having a ddnet tab, we're certainly not excluding other communites
15:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> is that true tho?
15:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> for some reason ppl still play on my fng server, even if it get's ddosed 24/7 and is only in internet tab xD
15:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet also hosts other mods
15:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> open source mods
15:15 < bridge_> <Iza> and just by having a ddnet tab, we're certainly not excluding other communites
15:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and that's something we should promote
15:15 < bridge_> <Iza> yes, and from the activity of those servers, i can make out a vague picture that non-ddrace modes aren't as liked as ddrace
15:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes that's true anyway
15:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if u have some friends in the community u might play other mods with these friends
15:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but i barely play other mods with randoms
15:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it'd be amazing if we could do some structural changes so that other mods can also get players
15:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but this seems orthogonal to the ddnet/kog/whatever tab business
15:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so why did zcatch die even tho it was in ddnet tab?
15:18 < bridge_> <Iza> maybe have a few tabs for some of the most popular modes?
15:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i simply think other mods are not interesting to play for longer times
15:18 < bridge_> <avolicious> Correct, lack of content
15:18 < bridge_> <Iza> yeah the fun is definitely not as long lasting, as the fun in playing ddrace
15:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the wario ware mod is a good example.. it had huge player count for a few weeks
15:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then it was basically dead
15:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> could also be some sort of network effects
15:19 < bridge_> <avolicious> What do you mean?
15:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> say some people want to play a mod, they join a server
15:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but since they're at the bottom of the list, no one else will join
15:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> so mods that require some more players to play, like warioware, cannot get past the playability threshold
15:20 < bridge_> <avolicious> Ah, yeah
15:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> unless they're super hyped for some reason
15:20 < bridge_> <avolicious> Makes sense
15:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> versus ddnet which can be enjoyed almost alone, sometimes needs 2 or 3
15:21 < bridge_> <avolicious> I thought you talk about network effects like, there is no good server in their location so they wont even connect to the server
15:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah no
15:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but that's only your claim tbf
15:21 < bridge_> <Iza> what i can suggest is that you run some tests with the client, and pin "featured" modes/server to the top of the ddnet tab, "players are allowed to unpin". And then you watch if the servers get active, and if it dies after some time
15:21 < bridge_> <avolicious> But its true in most cases 😄
15:21 < bridge_> <Iza> what i can suggest is that you run some tests with the client, and pin "featured" modes/server to the top of the ddnet tab, (players are allowed to unpin). And then you watch if the servers get active, and if it dies after some time
15:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> have u ever joined a mod with few players?
15:22 < bridge_> <avolicious> Yes
15:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm not sure what to do with this sentence ^^ ofc it's my claim. what would you like to have instead?
15:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> often some noobs play and it's boring
15:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> my experience
15:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> because of that we should just put ALL servers into a internet tab?
15:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> to me it's simply to extreme
15:23 < bridge_> <avolicious> I offered to host some less known modes on the KoG network aswell
15:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no, I'm not sure what to do with the sentence "that's your opinion" ^^
15:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ofc it's my opinion. what else do you want?
15:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> is this supposed to be an argument? ^^
15:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> apparently someone implements it, even tho there is a huge divergence, so yes
15:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i prefer you do arguments
15:24 < bridge_> <avolicious> But you're right heinrich. After we launched the accounted servers and people started to play on our non-accounted ones our playercount raises
15:25 < bridge_> <avolicious> because we have more people on one server & its more likely that other players join them aswell
15:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but KoGs player base didn't really increase lately did it?
15:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i see just as many ppl as always
15:26 < bridge_> <avolicious> It did
15:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> from which to which number daily users?
15:26 < bridge_> <avolicious> 1 sec
15:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dislike talking about such closed source software
15:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and even if.. how does that make sense @avolicious 
15:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> kog isnt even in ddnet tab 😄
15:26 < bridge_> <avolicious> Internet tab
15:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so why should we remove it, if apparently it's unrelated to that
15:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> why should there be a ddnet tab?
15:27 < bridge_> <avolicious> Our servers are now always in the top
15:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> why should we be open source?
15:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because I like open source software
15:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i think there should be a "offical" tab
15:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and I would have never worked on DDNet if it hadn't been open sourcee
15:27 < bridge_> <Iza> To remove confusion and to make it easier for the majority of the teeworlds playerbase to navigate throught the browser and play
15:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why are we supporting a closed source software?
15:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> why shold there be an "offical" tab?
15:27 < bridge_> <Iza> To remove confusion and to make it easier for the majority of the teeworlds playerbase to navigate through the browser and play
15:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> can we already remove the special tab on a closed source software on our open source client?
15:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> because the official tab makes sure the users play on open source servers
15:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> controlled by ppl that like open source
15:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no scam
15:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ddnet*, "remove confusion" sounds like a weak argument to me
15:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no money
15:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no donations for features
15:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (we host closed source mods btw)
15:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (which I don't like)
15:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
15:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> (i was also against that )
15:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
15:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> we often said move noby to community tab
15:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that also applies for kog?
15:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes, just to be clear
15:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> kog > no teeworlds
15:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but ddnet > kog
15:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not to me
15:29 < bridge_> <Iza> Depends, how do you understand that argument? For me one of the main points when creating software for casual users, is to have the least amount of confusion in my ui as possible
15:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ddnet > tee worlds > any other open source mod > abandon tw > kog closed source
15:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but I don't see why it's "confusion" to join community servers
15:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
15:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's great we have a community that allows for and supports community servers
15:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's not "confusion"
15:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :BASEDHALT:
15:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's a great feature
15:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its not great to support closed source software
15:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> we don't have to do it like valve etc. to suppress community servers
15:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but supporting everyone equally would be nice, no?
15:31 < bridge_> <Iza> but when stating that argument, have you accounted for the fact that ddrace is the most played teeworlds gamemode?
15:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it would also be nice to mark mods on server  browser
15:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> as open source  or closed source
15:31 < bridge_> <avolicious> Technically speaking, you could host gores servers with the latest ddnet source
15:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and ability to filter closed source  mods
15:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> out
15:31 < bridge_> <avolicious> How to verify if its closed source?
15:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> simply provide a link to the source code
15:31 < bridge_> <avolicious> I could simply fork ddnet & do an open project
15:31 < bridge_> <avolicious> and host another version on the server
15:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but why should `we` support others
15:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i mean we already do support other servers.. with the internet tab
15:31 < bridge_> <avolicious> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
15:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> why should we actively promote closed source servers?
15:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> we can investigate you and master ban you
15:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> they dont support us
15:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because we're a community project. we don't have to protect our "profits" like valve etc.
15:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ofc we do
15:32 < bridge_> <avolicious> That would lead to massive overhead
15:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> without maintainers this project is dead
15:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yes a community that thrives on free software and kind contributions from likeminded people, not from closed source software
15:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> without open source maintainers*
15:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if all mods would be closed source it would split the community
15:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't think we get more maintainers by having an "official" tab
15:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's that simple
15:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> we alreay get them by having the most used client
15:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but it makes staying open source more attractive
15:33 < bridge_> <Iza> i see alot of arguments that have different origins. Not sure how to come to a conclusion here
15:33 < bridge_> <Iza> i see alot of arguments that have different origins and intentions. Not sure how to come to a conclusion here
15:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> happens all the time
15:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not really. we don't host a lot of open-source mods. lots of open-source clients died and there aren't even mayn left
15:34 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> "just make fng on top that'll solve all of the problems" -- definately not noby
15:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i wish ddnet took a strong stance against closed source mods
15:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its sad
15:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> there arent many projects like this thriving in open source
15:34 < bridge_> <avolicious> AGPL would have solved this issue
15:34 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> but to be serious I kinda agree that ddnet server should have it's own tab
15:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> how about a test.
15:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 6 months with internet tab
15:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 6 months without any closed source servers lsited
15:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then we'll see if ddnet would die because of no equality
15:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> indeed, too bad the original author didnt use it
15:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the original author didn't want it
15:35 < bridge_> <Iza> i was suggesting tests alot of times. I think we really should do that
15:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well its still my opinion
15:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> too bad
15:35 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> Most ppl find ddnet from steam and they watch the trailer they expect to find something familiar which would be either ddrace or kog (gores maps)
15:36 < bridge_> <Iza> in the end: if there's no data on certain arguments, then why not just run a test
15:36 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I find removing kog from the server list a complete non-option
15:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> just dont make them special
15:36 < bridge_> <Iza> in the end: if there's no data on certain arguments, then why not just run a test. Instead of implementing something that we're not even sure if its gonna work out as intended
15:36 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> ok but when are we getting a new pve mod like hmh monster
15:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> put em back only in internet tab
15:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dont promote closed source projects
15:37 < ChillerDragon> hmh monster sooo good
15:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i bet they are faster open source than u could start your potato pc
15:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> HMH was a nice dev too
15:37 < bridge_> <avolicious> agreed, I do play hmh sometimes too
15:37 < ChillerDragon> HMH the best
15:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i remember him around
15:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> he also learnt RUST
15:37 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> its good but outdated imo
15:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i hope u take that as joke
15:37 < bridge_> <avolicious> I guess we would get faked by other servers and then player data would be at risk
15:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/H-M-H/Weylus
15:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 ur not hmh right
15:37 < ChillerDragon> tru cyber hmh moster is still 0.6
15:38 < ChillerDragon> very outdated indeed
15:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> this can also happen with internet tab only
15:38 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> when was hmh monster even made
15:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/H-M-H/Monster_HMH
15:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 2014
15:39 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> jesus
15:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and thanks to it being open source
15:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it can be updated

15:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> inspected
15:39 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> idk about updating
15:39 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> probably just remake
15:39 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> I find that the biggest issue for me would be not knowing which servers are "trusted" aka won't do malicious stuff with your ip
15:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i would suggest avoiding block servers the most
15:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> they are always the script kiddies
15:40 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah I don't and haven't played block at all
15:40 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> i always use a vpn when i join block servers other than fokkonauts
15:40 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> :troll:
15:40 < bridge_> <Iza> block players are just something different
15:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nice pfp
15:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its the only "pvp" remaining
15:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and pvp means toxic brewery
15:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 let's leave the tabs beside:
15:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> What if ddnet would promote (in their ddnet tab) mods which are open source, and have few players... e.g. by moving them up in the list
15:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Wouldn't that be fair enough.
15:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It gives new mods a chance to create a player base.. if it's successful it can live on it's own.. like kog and block
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> make  a rotating featured mod
15:41 < ChillerDragon> @Mr.Gh0s7 what malicious stuff are you scared of?
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and just a easy button to filter by that mod
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> every week changes
15:41 < bridge_> <robyt3> Then you can select all communities except "None" to see all servers that are trusted enough by us
15:41 < ChillerDragon> what malicious can one even do with your ip?
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> spoofing attack
15:41 < bridge_> <Iza> more than you're comfortable with
15:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> against servers
15:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> with ur ip
15:42 < ChillerDragon> thats not too bad
15:42 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> ChillerDragon idk that's why I am scared of it like leaking my ip to others who can and will do those
15:42 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> chiller can i have your ip
15:42 < ChillerDragon> @Iza like?
15:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if u have a static ip it might be a bit bad
15:42 < bridge_> <Iza> find out your general location and blackmail you
15:42 < ChillerDragon> ok yes static agree
15:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> thats a stretch
15:42 < ChillerDragon> @Iza i live in munich center
15:42 < ChillerDragon> go block mail me 
15:42 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> location is not accurate at all lmao
15:42 < ChillerDragon> good luck
15:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i live in barcelona
15:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> come
15:43 < bridge_> <Iza> maybe for you
15:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> <a:aPES2_Fight:525486745790185481>
15:43 < bridge_> <murpi> The game is promoted as a cooperative racing game, and people installed it based on that premise. I strongly doubt that the server browser change will impact the lasting appeal of these game modes. Removing the DDNet tab is like shooting ourselfs in the foot imo. ^^
15:43 < ChillerDragon> city:"Frankfurt am Main",
15:43 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> my ip says my location is like  3km away from my actual location
15:43 < ChillerDragon> according to ipinfo im in farnkfurt
15:43 < ChillerDragon> hf gl blackmail me in frankfurt
15:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> chiller i visited ur airport
15:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> when i went to tokyo
15:43 < bridge_> <Iza> murpi said it
15:43 < ChillerDragon> pog
15:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im a frankfurter
15:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in a perfect world we would have another tournament
15:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> fun times
15:44 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> another ddos

15:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://tenor.com/view/god-pray-jesus-christ-sign-of-the-cross-gif-5701179
15:44 < bridge_> <avolicious> after the ip discussion, i will go touch some grass now
15:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/knoppix-linux-gnu-gnulinux-penguin-gif-25687924
15:45 < ChillerDragon> static ip is annoying because once leaked it stays leaked. Spoofing my ip doesnt sound too bad. The blackmail makes no sense at all. Im not convinced that i need a vpn to join sus tw servers
15:45 < ChillerDragon> id leak my ip to any of you :3
15:45 < ChillerDragon> uwu
15:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> owo
15:45 < bridge_> <Iza> do it then
15:45 < bridge_> <Iza> here and now
15:46 < ChillerDragon> ofc not in this chat that is sent to discord
15:46 < ChillerDragon> and microsoft
15:46 < ChillerDragon> but host a server ill join
15:46 < bridge_> <Iza> so you do have insecurities about a third-party having your ip?
15:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> teesmash
15:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> is open source
15:46 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> i know that hoster. See you soon.
15:46 < ChillerDragon> @Iza i do have insecrutites about discord yes
15:47 < ChillerDragon> i use tor when clicking discord cdn links
15:47 < bridge_> <Iza> not sure what discord has done to u
15:47 < ChillerDragon> they asked me for my number
15:47 < bridge_> <Iza> alot of services do
15:47 < ChillerDragon> posting my ip in this channel allows everyone grepping the logs to fingerprint me based on my internet provider
15:48 < ChillerDragon> i would prefer to avoid this 
15:48 < ChillerDragon> but do not mind revealing it to any tw server
15:48 < bridge_> <Iza> i don't think that discord is acting in such offensive ways to find out info about a singular person
15:49 < bridge_> <avolicious> Are you verifying the version that runs on the server?
15:49 < ChillerDragon> what version?
15:49 < ChillerDragon> avo did you reply?
15:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if the gameplay is the same it probably doesn't matter if closed source or open source
15:50 < ChillerDragon> @Iza thats what discord is about isnt it?
15:50 < ChillerDragon> or are you saying its a regular for profit company making billions with discord nitro? :D
15:50 < bridge_> <robyt3> ChillerDragon: It's about Ryo only wanting to join open source servers, how does he verify that the server is actually open source?
15:50 < ChillerDragon> rosbtni
15:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if the gameplay feels different and u cant find the source, then that's what makes it suck imo
15:51 < ChillerDragon> i love u robi
15:51 < bridge_> <Iza> im secretly getting free nitro for playing discords advocate
15:51 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> can i have some too
15:52 < ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ trol so kog and onbgy fng in da open source list because there is ddnet and openfng on github xd
15:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no
15:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> let's say DDPER adds awesome rainbow skins that everyone ever wanted
15:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and ddnet dies bcs of this
15:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and now teeworlds is controlled by DDPER
15:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> would u say this is community friendly game?
15:54 < ChillerDragon> omg not the persians!
15:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that's what fair competition would look like
15:55 < ChillerDragon> teeworlds has to stay controlled by the germans
15:55 < ChillerDragon> everything else is community unfriendly
15:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it will simply destroy contributions of ppl here
15:55 < ChillerDragon> ok sori for troling jopsti
15:55 < ChillerDragon> i admire your effort to embrace open source
15:56 < ChillerDragon> suprising for a windows user
15:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well i just want to make clear, that ddnet either has own interests or it could simply go yolo.
15:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i could also quit my job and make the best closed source game with lots of features and maybe ppl would adapt
15:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but the idea behind ddnet is then dead
15:57 < ChillerDragon> thast why you dont push to ddnet2 so often?
15:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xDDDDDDDDDD
15:57 < ChillerDragon> ddnet2 on steam when you quit your job?
15:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
15:57 < ChillerDragon> sadge
15:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but i name it teeworlds2
15:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs cooler name
15:58 < ChillerDragon> teeworlds > ddnet but ddnet2 > teeworlds2
15:58 < ChillerDragon> 2 doesnt fit on teeworlds
15:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i bet kog for example even depends on us.. simply bcs ddnet offers the client with updates etc.
15:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> doing that is also quite a bit of work
15:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno how many devs kog has
15:59 < ChillerDragon> they have 30 man dev team from fiver
15:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @chillerdragon then convice oy to give me the name
15:59 < ChillerDragon> where do you need it?
15:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's so sad that the name is now bound to a dead project xd
15:59 < ChillerDragon> the domain?
16:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> he should transfer the rights
16:00 < ChillerDragon> dw ill poke oy until he wakes
16:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> epic
16:01 < bridge_> <learath2> KoG Inc. should add ads and microtransactions to hire devs
16:01 < ChillerDragon> xd
16:02 < ChillerDragon> so jopsti can quit his job and work for kog
16:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ok les go
16:03 < ChillerDragon> thats how fast dis guy sells his soul
16:03 < ChillerDragon> closed src kog by jopsti
16:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> kog2
16:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
16:04 < ChillerDragon> xd
16:04 < bridge_> <learath2> Ew, working for closed source project with accounts and ads

16:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not rn but we should
16:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but i can google teesmash and find the source
16:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> made by yours truly
16:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> eww indeed
16:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/kyoukai-no-kanata-nase-hiromi-ew-disgust-gif-11102640
16:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> talking about close source, motivates to do it better and work on open source
16:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> for better future
16:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> thanks everyone
16:27 < bridge_> <Voxel> would it support modding
16:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ofc
16:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet2 already allows to completely rewrite the physics with automatic client side preidiction
16:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that's very important to me, bcs i hate that freeze in fng sucks, and hammer prediction etc.
16:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and i want it bloat free
16:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so no if(is_fng()) do extra edge case
16:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that's why it's all in WASM modules
16:30 < bridge_> <Voxel> :bluekitty:
16:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 @jupeyy_keks @heinrich5991 remember the iceberg sql meme i posted?
16:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> they made a full explanation
16:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme
16:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if sql wouldn't be so boring i'd continue with account stuff xDDD
16:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> after adding the new columns complete downer

16:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
16:54 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> :O
16:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> @jupeyy_keks Should we just add an assert in graphics and always use 4 since we only use RGBA internally?
16:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> ```cpp
16:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> size_t CCommandProcessorFragment_GLBase::TexFormatToImageColorChannelCount(int TexFormat)
16:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> {
16:55 < bridge_> <robyt3>     if(TexFormat == CCommandBuffer::TEXFORMAT_RGBA)
16:55 < bridge_> <robyt3>         return 4;
16:55 < bridge_> <robyt3>     return 4;
16:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> }
16:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> ```
16:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i guess for now it's ok.. i don't plan to change that any time soon
16:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> The function is only used once in vulkan backend anyway
16:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> nice
16:58 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> how would that work?
16:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what exactly?
16:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the overwriting, or the prediction or what?
16:59 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> yes rewritting physics and the client automatic prediction
17:00 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> bruh zogtib said "type: yes" so instead of `the` I typed `yes`
17:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the current model, subject to change, works like this:
17:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> all game physics is cleanly seperated into a lib shared by client and server (generally), all files are mods (rust modules).
17:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> So what you do if u want to mod a file is, have a shadow lib, that implements all files again, but instead of having to copy paste everything, u have a rust macro that loads the "real" source code. additionally that macro allows your to overwrite any variable, function or struct definition of the real source.
17:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> You compile this new lib into WASM.
17:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If you don't modify anything u basically simply have the game as WASM module instead of native.
17:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> The game state has a interface the server & client use to get all info they need, or start new ticks etc.
17:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> And the WASM manager basically implements this interface but calls these function inside the WASM module
17:04 < bridge_> <teero777> ddnet2 is full rust?
17:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's not even called ddnet2 XD that's just some naming i didnt give it
17:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i call it ddnet playground. bcs i test out stuff that 100% is not compatible to what we have now
17:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and yes, pure rust
17:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but WASM allows ANY language
17:05 < bridge_> <teero777> so ddnet2 is compiled to wasm? im confused? ddnet is now some kinda browser game?
17:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no
17:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the base game will be 100% rust, compiled to native binary
17:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but since the physics are cleanly seperated with an interface => physics don't know ANYTHING about the rest of the game
17:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and this advantage makes it easy to have an extra layer: WASM modules
17:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so u have two choices
17:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> load a WASM module, or run the native one
17:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the native is ofc hardcoded, cannot be changed
17:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the WASM one supports hot reloading.. so u can change it while playing
17:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> (just need to reset the game state)
17:07 < bridge_> <teero777> yea i see everyone needs to change the physics while playing xdd
17:08 < bridge_> <teero777> troll feature
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's awesome
17:08 < bridge_> <teero777> xD
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's much easier to do some prototyping
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if u dont need to restart the whole game
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> & server
17:08 < bridge_> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks and you already did all of that or is it just theory?
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the thing above already exists
17:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but the "native" physics currently are really limited
17:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u can basically move around, shoot projectiles
17:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so i am still far away
17:09 < bridge_> <teero777> send github
17:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i don't have an up to date version online rn
17:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> give me 5 minutes
17:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then i send
17:10 < bridge_> <teero777> :brownbear:
17:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/Jupeyy/dd-pg/tree/test3
17:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> note, rn i don't want any bug reports, suggestions or anything else
17:13 < bridge_> <teero777> 500 issues incoming
17:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Dabtw here u can see, i modified the "mod"-lib.. this is no tune change
17:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but actual source code change
17:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it automatically compiles the wasm module over cargo-watch
17:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> btw here u can see, i modified the "mod"-lib.. this is no tune change
17:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dont confuse this, wasm isnt a browser only thing
17:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> wasm is a target compilation, its like compiling to the java vm bytecode
17:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> there are non browser wasm "vms"
17:23 < bridge_> <teero777> yea and wasm use usually executed by a browser right?
17:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but not limited to
17:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i say this cuz it looked like u added some bad connotations to that xd
17:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://wasmer.io/
17:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://wasmtime.dev/
17:28 < bridge_> <teero777> yea so everything that can execute wasm can execute wasm
17:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @teero777 this is funniest project i did yet xd
17:41 < bridge_> <teero777> do you know the tee cloud?
17:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no, you?
17:42 < bridge_> <teero777> i mean it literally
17:42 < bridge_> <teero777> wait ill upload
17:45 < bridge_> <teero777> takes a bit
17:47 < bridge_> <teero777> https://streamable.com/qxbgk3
17:47 < bridge_> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks i present to you the tee could
17:47 < bridge_> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks i present to you the tee cloud
17:48 < bridge_> <teero777> its kinda small but its cool
17:48 < bridge_> <teero777> i made a serverside gui where you can drag and drop tees and stuff
17:51 < bridge_> <bencie.> wtf
17:51 < bridge_> <bencie.> thats cool xd
17:53 < ChillerDragon> @teero777 the realest

17:59 < bridge_> <teero777> ah xD
17:59 < bridge_> <Voxel> i wonder if you can do this to actual people
17:59 < bridge_> <teero777> yes i can
17:59 < bridge_> <teero777> xd
17:59 < bridge_> <Voxel> i wanna be dragged around
17:59 < bridge_> <Voxel> LOL
18:00 < bridge_> <teero777> sadly i just did this locally and i would need to port this to the web and make it somehow interact with the server
18:00 < bridge_> <teero777> idk how
18:01 < bridge_> <teero777> just streaming the application over ssh is very slow
18:01 < bridge_> <Voxel> ah
18:01 < bridge_> <teero777> so i could push you around but it would be very laggy
18:02 < bridge_> <Voxel> my middle name is lag
20:41 < ChillerDragon> @teero777 web? as in website? streaming ssh? what you talkin about
21:20 < bridge_> <teero777> x11 forwarding over ssh
21:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> damn murpi you're a real one u rly just saved me $70-80 bucks
21:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no
21:55 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> note that every website you connect to gets your IP address
21:55 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that sounds like a nice idea 🙂
21:56 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> I mostly connect to "trusted" websites and open links that are suspicious in torbrowser only
21:58 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> trusted aka search engine result with "normal" prompt
21:58 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> trusted aka search engine results with "normal" prompt
21:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> awesome idea
21:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> you seriously use tor
21:59 < bridge_> <Ewan> are the feds after your location or are you just sorrily misinformed
21:59 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> I don't have a vpn so tor ^^
22:01 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> btw can you explain further what you mean by that?
22:06 < bridge_> <totar> I still like the gmod solution, it just auto generates a game mode list from the gamemode reported by servers. No manual selection required
22:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea but open source >>
22:06 < bridge_> <totar> Also all players get directed through the gamemode selector before picking a server
22:09 < bridge_> <totar> feels like an intentional discrimination against kog
22:09 < bridge_> <totar> I don't think players care
22:10 < bridge_> <totar> ddnet should change license if we want to prevent closed source projects
22:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> i don't think anyone wants to prevent their existence, just encourage them to be open source
22:11 < bridge_> <Ewan> kog should go open source then
22:12 < bridge_> <Ewan> also it still has its own tab...
22:12 < bridge_> <totar> open source is inconvenient if you are using any kind of anti cheat, ddnet wastes a lot of dev effort maintaining a side loading antibot module
22:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> my point is about disallowing closed source in any kind
22:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i literally don't care
22:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i just don't understand why we should actively promoting closed source
22:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> is not*
22:14 < bridge_> <totar> there could atleast be documentation for using the antibot system
22:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> my point is not about disallowing closed source in any kind
22:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i literally don't care
22:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i just don't understand why we should actively promoting closed source
22:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> in my personal opinion it's naive to think ddnet has no interest in trying to make most mods open source if possible.
22:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> This keeps mods alive, even if the original creators loose interest
22:15 < bridge_> <totar> yeah that's fair, thats why I like letting servers create their own "tabs" in a gamemode like permissionlessly
22:17 < bridge_> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147988813579309197/image.png
22:17 < bridge_> <totar> like all garrys mod players go through this list
22:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> mhh, but tbh that looks really overwhelming
22:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> it is
22:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> i would so much rather search for server name as a player
22:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> gmod just has too many
22:18 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> https://tenor.com/view/happy-fathers-day-images-gif-25998110
22:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> true
22:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> when f client oss fokkonaut?
22:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that came unexpected xD
22:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> and f ddrace
22:19 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> ??
22:19 < bridge_> <totar> is it really more overwhelming than this?
22:19 < bridge_> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147989230434394235/image.png
22:19 < bridge_> <Ewan> yes
22:19 < bridge_> <totar> how?? xd
22:19 < bridge_> <totar> you're just wrong
22:19 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> selectedServer--;
22:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> i don't wanna have to pick category of game to then find a server
22:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> i go where the hearts are
22:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> categorizing them past this is an extra click for no reason
22:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so i didnt play garry's mod since 10 years.
22:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I see the DarkRP has most players. click on it
22:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what happens now.. did i download the server list?
22:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> or if you mean tabs then fine i'm ok with that
22:20 < bridge_> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1147989591152918640/image.png
22:20 < bridge_> <totar> basically the same
22:20 < bridge_> <totar> as ddnet
22:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and next time you start the client?
22:21 < bridge_> <totar> idk
22:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> when will you open source f client and f ddrace. it will have to happen eventually
22:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> or they will die along with your interest
22:21 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> https://tenor.com/view/my-eyes-wash-out-eyes-augen-desinfizieren-gif-22214608
22:21 < bridge_> <totar> ddnet is already tied for clicks because you need to press "play" on the main menu
22:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u can skip it
22:21 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> F-Client is open source
22:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> o i didnt know
22:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and i really wish we would have merged the "skip main menu button"
22:21 < bridge_> <Ewan> sweet
22:22 < bridge_> <totar> how?
22:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2877
22:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sadly it was closed, because deen disliked it
22:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it's a config
22:22 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> F-DDrace was open source until people used it other than I expected/wanted it => Closed source again
22:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> in settings->general
22:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> i guess this is a little bit abrasive to read if you don't have any context. we were talking about how all these block mods are wasting man hours developing towards the same goal
22:22 < bridge_> <totar> ok well 0.1% of players use that anyway xd
22:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i know, i also think this sucks
22:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> extra clicks are always annoying
22:22 < bridge_> <totar> default settings will always be king
22:23 < bridge_> <totar> no one changes anything

22:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> this is an enforced no fun zone

22:29 < bridge_> <Ewan> he just doesn't like seeing things that aren't text

22:35 < bridge_> <totar> did chiller get banned
22:36 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> yes
22:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> can u ban chiller?
22:36 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> he used tater client and got banned for botting

An “agent” plugin architecture is used by systemd for disk encryption where a request for a system-wide password can be answered by a pool of different responders, including a script automatically supplying a password and the usual method of just “asking the user”.

22:42 < bridge_> <learath2> I'll allow it
22:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i just read the article super fast
22:42 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> oh you know s6?
22:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sometimes i think u are AI anyway
22:42 < bridge_> <totar> it's very important the FBI does not access my 4k tee skins
22:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs u post the right article after 1 second
22:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im watching a movie about a mathematician
22:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> "the man who knew infinity"
22:42 < bridge_> <Ewan> silly title
22:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> sometimes i wish there existed movies where they went deep into the real content
22:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but they always focus on human things
22:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> anyway
22:43 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea
22:43 < bridge_> <learath2> I've read about all possible alternatives to systemd that are feasible
22:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well its relevant
22:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its about Ramanujan
22:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > , he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable.
22:43 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> nice why did you choose openrc over s6-rc?
22:44 < bridge_> <learath2> OpenRC is the default on gentoo and was easier to set up
22:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> s6, that sounds like taters github account
22:44 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah when I read Tater's github acount I think of it too xD
22:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xDD
22:44 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> makes sense ;)
22:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> > Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation.
22:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> awesome
22:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @totar u use windows right
22:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> isolated research is awesome
22:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> like uhh
22:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> allan holdsworth
22:45 < bridge_> <totar> on my main desktop yes
22:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> wrote down phonebooks worth of scales

22:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> considering purchasing
22:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> are pcie gen 5 drives good yet
22:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> or should i wait some months
22:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u should check if it has a cache
22:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> I would be astonished if it doesn’t
22:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> That’s only a concern for low end drives isn’t it
22:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, i often see m2's advertising their awesome speed
22:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and then they can hold it for like 1 second
22:56 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah
22:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then they rip xd
22:59 < bridge_> <matodor> lua?
22:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> can u stop
23:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> not seeing anything about a cache on the site
23:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> quick search showed german news sites that say it has two
23:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> SLC and dram
23:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but there is a 2TB version
23:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so not sure xd
23:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> anyway. Out of interest. is your Mobo pcie5 ready already?
23:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> is that already so standard?
23:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i kinda wonder why there were like 10 years on pcie 3. and then almost skipped pcie4 in like 2 years now xD
23:07 < bridge_> <learath2> more bandwidth needed for ai which is profitable?
23:07 < bridge_> <Ewan> Yeah
23:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i mean i am the person to contact when it comes to more perf xdd
23:07 < bridge_> <Ewan> i have 1 5.0 slot
23:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and ur m2 slot is also pcie5?
23:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i hope for you that it's a dedicated slot
23:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> that’s what i mean yeah
23:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> sometimes motherboard manufacturers are really doing weird things normal users don't understand
23:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> which u then have to read in their manuals
23:09 < bridge_> <learath2> 4 16x ports but if you plug a card in any one of them the rest become 8x 😄
23:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> jesus
23:09 < bridge_> <learath2> Or my m.2 port disabling 2 sata ports
23:12 < bridge_> <Ewan> i heard about that
23:12 < bridge_> <Ewan> tela's does that too
23:15 < bridge_> <learath2> I also saw one motherboard that has an x8 sized port but only half of the pins are connected so it's actually x4 😄
23:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> i could buy the drive or i could buy the shoes i've been wanting to buy
23:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> hmmmmm
23:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> i already *have* a drive but it's a wd black sn770
