01:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @jxsl13: you work on ddnet-insta stat boards? I am half done with that .\_.
01:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> rude @bencie. I will no longer accidentally read your name as ‚Äûbe nice‚Äú
01:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> the pause command was used in ddnet tournaments to allow everyone to download the map before starting. And we use it heavily in ddnet-insta to pause pvp games and it works well c:
01:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes every windows version is bad and gets a bad rap. Spying increases with every version as far as I know. But every somewhat second version is especially bad. So windows 8 and windows 11 have a worse rap than 7 and 10.
01:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> This is why we have to build foss league of legends using ddnet game engine. To give lol gamers a choice that respects their privacy and freedom.
01:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> wtf I did not know that. But now system.c makes more sense hehe. Do you have some links for that event happening?
01:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What‚Äôs vanilla support?
01:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah physics nvm
02:45 < bridge> <headshotnoby> league of tees
04:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hmm i implemented the habit of adding todo comments i wonder if it gets out of hand
04:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i created a simple method that takes a string does one for loop and returns a value. Only for that method I added two TODO comments and one issue on github ..
04:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> somehow i started using it to justify writing bad code and pushing it straight to master :D 
04:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``// TODO: at least i know its bad``
04:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut @Jupstar ‚ú™ @milkeeycat showing messages on https://chat.zillyhuhn.com/ is now an optional plugin make sure it is activated if you want to see messages.
04:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> since displaying messages in a chat app is clearly bloat and should be made configurable to not happen at all
04:15 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah the main functionality of a chat app would be to see who's typing
04:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> uhm .. that can also be turned off <:justatest:572499997178986510>
04:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> the main functionality of a chat app should be to collect data*
04:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :)
04:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that indeed can not be turned off! :D 
04:17 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> gotcha
06:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: did u see those replies? xd
07:13 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> chillerdragon:
07:17 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> chillerdragon: remember i registered on your files hosting service? That account should rly work for chat as well :Pepechill:
07:17 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> Pls fix
07:17 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> Or maybe it works and i just don't remember credentials
07:17 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> Can't tell
07:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> file hosting? you mean opentube video thingy @Anime.pdf ye i have like a zillion dbs with passwords. I am procrastinating to build my own zentral account solution maybe even oauth
07:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just use the same password for now on register and it also works lmao
07:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's funny that you actually use the web chat more now

08:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ your approach to blazingly moddable insipired me to write modular code :3 
08:55 < ws-client> <Animepdf> your message pinging jupstar pinged me too
08:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wtf?
08:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah ye
08:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because its one message
08:55 < ws-client> <Animepdf> fix fix fix or else....
08:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no bug
08:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its a feature
08:55 < ws-client> <Animepdf> <:pepedead:773232467658145822> 
08:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Basically everything is a plugin. And now plugins can say what they implement and other plugins can request plugins that implement a certain thing. The user can then toggle competing plugins.  @Jupstar ‚ú™ 
08:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1706774011.png
08:57 < ws-client> <Animepdf> send plugin api
08:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> here we have a crash logger plugin sending an error to the first alert plugin that is active it can find
08:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so the user could turn off the alert plugin and turn on another alert plugin that maybe only prints to the console or something like that

09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sometimes it's very hard, never give up
09:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Animepdf frameworks are bloat. Vanilla is where its at.
09:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ notin is hard if you use nob language like js axaxax
09:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Lmao. JavaScript, the language known for great software xd
09:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it is web scale
09:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> JS goes brrrrr

10:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > 200ping ssh can just not compete with locally predicted browser textboxes
10:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> have you tried mosh? üôÇ
11:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes mosh was the first thing i tried it did not help at all
11:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i used mosh 24/7 at home because my ssh would cut off due to internet bugs but here its useless
11:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> This looks funny somehow https://sketch.metademolab.com/
11:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Internet bubbles are such a facinating thing. I scrolled through the comments section on 3 videos on yt featuring the same viral clip. With totally different moods. But all were agreeing
12:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 when i first heard about mosh i thought its amazing for ping. But the prediction code just sucks hard.
12:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there are a few things that are hard to predict like curses applications. But not even the prompt works properly. Ideally it would emulate tab completion and history search etc. But it can not even do letter typing or deleting in a usable way
12:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> It feels like maybe 100 ping instead of 200. But imo if this was done correctly it would feel like 0
12:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> And then it comes with misspredictions as well. So its worse than normal ssh actually.
12:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: i cant connect to server in ur chat :justatest:
12:25 < bridge> <remakepower> ChillerDragon: There is a server settings in 0.7 : m_SpecVote, it allow 0.7 client vote when spec
12:37 < bridge> <Iza> was there something changed in how loading skins works, since latest nightly? because when activate and deactivate `cl_vanilla_skins_only` it now loads for a long time and sometimes my game even crashes
12:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @remakepower ? could you link the line of code
12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat wot? you want your local dev front end attached to my backend or what? Or whats breaking

12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @MilkeeyCat do you have the plugin to load messages active :D 
12:43 < bridge> <remakepower> Oh no
12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you probably want "message_loader"
12:44 < ws-client> <MilkeeyCat> oh my god
12:44 < bridge> <remakepower> I think i need to see a doctor about my eyes
12:44 < bridge> <Iza> the margins look beautiful

12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> weeb designer
12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @remakepower ye thats not it is it? :D  but would have been nice
12:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> make a design for ddts :owo:
12:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wats ddts
12:45 < bridge> <cyberfighter> why ddts
12:45 < bridge> <cyberfighter> why not moabs

12:45 < bridge> <remakepower> That's not it
12:45 < bridge> <remakepower> I got a wrong meaning from my eye
12:46 < bridge> <remakepower> Maybe i should be more carefully
12:46 < bridge> <remakepower> May i should be more carefully
12:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon you should be ashamed of yourself by not knowing what ddts is

12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Nice, good project. But never used it ^^
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I also never used it. But I can see my self switching at some point when its more polished. And never looking back.

13:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: 2025 the year when u leave irc and start using discord?
13:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yikes
13:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea my response times on discord are low. You can reach me much better via different channels @diariesvexar for example right here or in game
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Chiller isn't it clear
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no!
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dms are also possible via irc/matrix/email/wire @diariesvexar o.O
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Your user name in discord even includes it
13:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chilllerdragon: who mentioned go daddy yesterday?
13:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1202588321763688500/image.png?ex=65ce00a6&is=65bb8ba6&hm=706942049b80ea26837aee126b7387604aa3c7ae9d5066e083bc700046f38a26&
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i did
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Your client does too
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> THEY ARE LISTENING
13:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> OMG
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ so i guessed it ez
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its "bo"
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> t
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i go kms
13:17 < bridge> <diariesvexar> Ok then I'll talk to you on irc later and any tips or idea about that errors on ddnet 16.9 ?
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> No need to kill yourself
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat google is clearly reading this chat and targetting us with ads!
13:18 < bridge> <matodor> guys urgently send me a Discord webhook for this channel, I'm creating another cool Discord bridge: I use notepad.exe for this, write a message in the text area, press CTRL + S and the messages are sent. Written in Rust language, there is support for servers 0.7 \ü§°
13:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> once i had an ad where they wanted to teach me drawing korean hentai
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @matodor wtf xd
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @MilkeeyCat i get them too all the time
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @matodor here is a discord webhook https://ws-irc.zillyhuhn.com/webhooks/1/61263761231283
13:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> Chiller how good are your project naming skills?
13:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> chiller see what you get people to come up with, just to avoid using irc/matrix
13:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 took me about 5 years to pick the name Prudrugtiq judge me on that
13:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> every single one of his projects starts or ends with chiller, so i guess it's decent
13:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> perfect
13:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> xD
13:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1706790136.png
13:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> melon has a point
13:22 < ws-client> <MilkeeyCat> @ChillerDragon ngl i didnt even try to read that name, i just saw prud... and it was enough
13:23 < bridge> <jxsl13> TeeworldsEconVPNDetectionGo needs a better name üòâ
13:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no thats good @jxsl13 also its already a established brand
13:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe cut the Go but thats all u can do
13:24 < bridge> <jxsl13> hmhm
13:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> :greenthing:

13:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my fav

13:26 < bridge> <melo∆û> profile pic and banner made by insanity
13:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> mostly with gimp some with a bit of inkscape and some even in my own js drawing tools
13:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> oh, you refer to your profile picture
13:26 < bridge> <matodor> ChillerDragon: why by the way did you decide to use webhooks, you could use the discord api and write your own client, since for some reason you don‚Äôt like using the official one
13:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> or the melon pepe?
13:26 < bridge> <melo∆û> AH GG

13:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> b
14:49 < bridge> <murpi> Does anyone know any free & lightweight HTML-focused IDEs?
14:52 < ws-client> <fokkonaut> vscode is lightweight and probably has html plugins?
14:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (it's not open-source by default though)
14:53 < ws-client> <fokkonaut> who is talking about open source? :D
14:56 < bridge> <murpi> That's exactly what im trying to avoid, having to setup an entire IDE with plugins and such.
14:56 < bridge> <murpi> "HTML-focused" ^^
14:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Sublime text 3 with some plugins
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What features do you need tho?
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Vscode includes basic web tech by default
15:08 < ws-client> <fokkonaut> @murpi it's literally no entire IDE + 1 plugin u can search and install in 30 seconds.
15:08 < ws-client> <fokkonaut> If it requires a plugin at all
15:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what html-specific features would you like to have?
15:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> basic syntax highlighting should be available in notepad++ already
15:16 < bridge> <murpi> A preview of the site would be nice, a split view and something that formats the code to a proper tree automatically
15:16 < bridge> <avolicious> vscode is the way to go, atleast its maintained üòÑ
15:17 < bridge> <murpi> Alright alright, VSCode it is
15:18 < bridge> <murpi> Might as well move away from pycharm and use vscode for everything python üò¨
15:18 < bridge> <avolicious> Both are good, used PyCharm in the past
15:18 < bridge> <avolicious> But I am used to VSCode and I dont have to setup key mappings everywhere. VSCode is my fav. editor
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And vscodium for enjoyers
15:20 < bridge> <murpi> I really like pycharms inlay hints
15:20 < bridge> <murpi> not sure if VSCode has that
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What is an inlay hint? A hint that is always visible?
15:25 < bridge> <murpi> https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/viewing-reference-information.html#inline-quick-documentation
15:25 < bridge> <murpi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1202620762175832104/image.png?ex=65ce1edd&is=65bba9dd&hm=069d107a2061ceb0334af75bd52456e6fffc47f731134e96fda07dfc27d17ad7&
15:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I like them generally. I'm not sure what to do with the author hints though
15:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> You know who to blame when something breaks
15:27 < bridge> <ar1gin> what are these inlay hints üíÄ
15:28 < bridge> <ar1gin> these are proper inlay hints
15:28 < bridge> <ar1gin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1202621590609727498/image.png?ex=65ce1fa2&is=65bbaaa2&hm=3bfc67f73a60b2c0b0755d1386efe4fdfe812a1e9406513b57e8f556101d287e&
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah yeah I know them as phantom code or phantom text
15:29 < bridge> <murpi> That's only useful in a team environment I'd say
15:30 < bridge> <murpi> Co-op coding üëÄ
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I guess just start a Python project and see
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Rust and CPP have them
15:31 < bridge> <ar1gin> it depends on lsp implementation
15:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> these are proper hints üòº
15:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1202623030950371338/image.png?ex=65ce20fa&is=65bbabfa&hm=3c92d227a2d271a097907609d064cf5e688a4f9bced745c5bf8712e3fa86fccb&
15:35 < bridge> <ar1gin> these are just hints, not inlay ones :pepeW:
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'd call that ghost text
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's mrghosy sitting in ur ide and giving you tips
15:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is he sitting in my neovim too?
15:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :justatest:
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In your highly tuned text editor that has all features a ide has? Yes
15:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> the he has to work harder when i write rust
15:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> then he has to work harder when i write rust
16:05 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> don't I make it hard enough? ok I'll do my best!
16:33 < bridge> <melo∆û> nvim is great, if the setup wouldnt be so harsh, i'd say its one of the best web dev tools
16:33 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
16:33 < bridge> <melo∆û> split terminal by just echoing the webpage, and auto-formatting + LSP server's widely available
16:33 < bridge> <melo∆û> screams in rust
17:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1706804354.png
17:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can you spot the suddle differences between real discord and the clone?
17:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Chillerdragon
17:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Irc question time
17:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Can i send a message in a channel but that only 1 user can see it
17:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> just send a private message like a normal person
17:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> ,/MSG or ,/QUERY ig
17:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It shouldn't be in a new tab
17:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Or whatever u call it
17:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It has to be in the same channel
17:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> chiller i wanna know aswell
17:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> wakey wakey
19:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> the discord clone seems to be a youtube video, nearly got mr.
19:17 < bridge> <jxsl13> me
19:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> it does have them, i often find em more annoying than useful in any editor tho xd too much clutter
19:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I like the discreet type hints of intellij ides

21:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> there should really be some kind of changelog for server modders to keep up with important and breaking changes.
21:19 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ddnet's development pace is really high these days
21:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what kind of changes do you want to see in the changelog? can you give an example?
21:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> e.g. the change for target being sent zoomed
21:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> or the change with colors for teams
21:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> those are changes that can break things on serverside
21:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I see. could you open an issue for that? I like the idea
21:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> sure
21:34 < bridge> <avolicious> And chillerdragon's stuff always breaks üò¶
21:35 < bridge> <avolicious> ```
21:35 < bridge> <avolicious> if(!str_comp(Config()->m_SvGametype, "mod"))
21:35 < bridge> <avolicious>     m_pController = new CGameControllerMod(this);
21:35 < bridge> <avolicious> else
21:35 < bridge> <avolicious>     m_pController = new CGameControllerDDRace(this);
21:35 < bridge> <avolicious> ```
21:35 < bridge> <avolicious> 
21:35 < bridge> <avolicious> The change is nice, but it was nasty without any notice haha
22:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Does anyone have a quick idea of what's the best way to detect whether a tee crossed a line of tiles, or whether it might have touched it but went out of the line of tiles in the same direction it came from? I want to detect, whether a tee entered an area without placing two different rows of tiles next to each other (e.g. detect going through a laser door)
22:19 < bridge> <learath2> Codewise you can treat two halves of the collision box differently basically the two tile thing but in one tile
22:21 < bridge> <fokkonaut> how would that work for independent rotation?
22:23 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hm, i think i'll try your approach
22:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> but i really dont know how exactly it should be done, especially considering the fact that i would like to keep the possibility for it to be horizontal aswell (while i currently only use vertical line)
22:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i might take a look at the directional hook blocker/through
