00:11 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
00:12 < bridge> <Ewan> where is the file
00:12 < bridge> <lukron55> so what IS the way to update the stuff then
00:12 < bridge> <lukron55> this
00:12 < bridge> <Ewan> please move it
00:13 < bridge> <harrynfr> again, i just cloned the repository from github directly into ddnet-harry
00:13 < bridge> <Ewan> can't help you if you're not gonna try what i propose
00:14 < bridge> <lukron55> i‚Äôm so confused
00:14 < bridge> <harrynfr> cant try what you propose if you dont elaborate
00:14 < bridge> <lukron55> where should it be moved to
00:14 < bridge> <Ewan> yea sass me that's gonna help XD
00:14 < bridge> <Ewan> melon can help u
00:14 < bridge> <Ewan> im gonna go do other things
00:15 < bridge> <lukron55> i just want to update the config file to change the name what am i meant to do? i‚Äôve updated at that path and it doesn‚Äôt do anything. i‚Äôve added a myServerconfig file and that doesn‚Äôt do anything
00:17 < bridge> <yrrr_> @heinrich5991 do you think there is a proper way to disable whispers? i thought about maybe whispering back that the player does not receive whisper messages but that would need to be translated.
00:30 < bridge> <lukron55> where should i put maps
00:30 < bridge> <lukron55> i downloaded this repo
00:30 < bridge> <lukron55> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps
00:43 < bridge> <lukron55> i‚Äôve given up with config files i just want maps now icl
01:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > what do you think of vim motions in the f1 console? xdd
01:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 I added emacs motions but they got removed with new line inputs :(
01:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i still keep pressing them without anything happening :( 
04:55 < bridge> <zhn> -j option will work as -j$(nproc), no?
06:17 < bridge> <Ewan> -j is usually ideal
07:47 < bridge> <peter0x44> Not with make
09:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> :monkaStop:
09:45 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
09:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> At this Point He should Just give remote Access so i can do it :gigachad:
10:10 < bridge> <avolicious> Student & able to figure it out üòÑ I know a lot of students who are studying CS and they dont know how to use Linux or even more worse: Microsoft Excel
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> ah
10:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i don‚Äôt know students
10:11 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe i will next semester
10:11 < bridge> <avolicious> I'd say 35% of my bachelor's degree class were like this xD
10:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> I'd expect them to know bash basics If they call themself Cybersecurity smth xD
10:11 < bridge> <avolicious> Assumptions over assumptions. They know how to fill out forms with XSS
10:11 < bridge> <Ewan> my mom‚Äôs friend took a cybersecurity class and she was telling me that she learned how to make a DNZ
10:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Im studying at uni computer science and am a neanderthal üò¨
10:11 < bridge> <avolicious> And they got the info from stackoverflow
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> im like idk what a DNZ is but do u mean a DMZ
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> and she was like oh yea
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> bless her
10:12 < bridge> <avolicious> xDDD
10:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> Lol
10:12 < bridge> <avolicious> Typical CS student
10:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> Hahahah
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> u  got ur own language bro ur chilling
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> im over here with my little scripts and PRs
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> nothing like a real project
10:13 < bridge> <sans._.> I finished the 0.7 tee renderer, now I can do cool stuff like this :kek:
10:13 < bridge> <sans._.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1240215345495674922/image.png?ex=6645c00c&is=66446e8c&hm=144a151e141e43dfcc3d9e644e23d50aa323b577cf2d29c64a707af33f77b2cd&
10:13 < bridge> <Ewan> but i don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a knowledge thing just depression
10:13 < bridge> <avolicious> I was invited to a cybersecurity class once, it was horrible
10:13 < bridge> <avolicious> Looks nice üëç
10:14 < bridge> <avolicious> Is it able to render 0.6 aswell?
10:14 < bridge> <sans._.> ty <a:nod:604500081114087434>
10:14 < bridge> <sans._.> yup, first message is 0.6
10:14 < bridge> <sans._.> and for the second i joined using the 0.7 client
10:14 < bridge> <avolicious> Oh, nice
10:14 < bridge> <avolicious> You get the info from ddnet master, no?
10:14 < bridge> <sans._.> yea
10:14 < bridge> <avolicious> Ah so its unified already, thats good tho
10:15 < bridge> <sans._.> I need to make stricter types for the master data, but so far this looks clean-ish
10:15 < bridge> <sans._.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1240216017821630504/image.png?ex=6645c0ac&is=66446f2c&hm=fe79f96d5ec9bcc7df99149412ec804e2673e116663e7c9d7a5fc2994d0cd8f2&
10:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> write some docs!

10:16 < bridge> <sans._.> https://sans3108.github.io/DDNet
10:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I mean about how to render a 0.7 tee ^^
10:16 < bridge> <sans._.> it's all there
10:16 < bridge> <sans._.> ohh
10:16 < bridge> <sans._.> uhm
10:16 < bridge> <sans._.> I kinda winged it
10:16 < bridge> <sans._.> I'd say it looks close enough tho
10:18 < bridge> <sans._.> I tried my best to make the code for the 0.7 renderer be as easily understandable as I could
10:18 < bridge> <sans._.> https://github.com/Sans3108/DDNet/blob/master/src/classes/skins/TeeSkin7.ts

10:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
10:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> Are you cheating on me
10:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes :justatest:

10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> bought it on ebay
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> for 250‚Ç¨ with equipment
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a steal
10:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> this usually costs 750‚Ç¨ or more
10:35 < bridge> <learath2> I just noticed how heavy water is üòÑ
10:35 < bridge> <learath2> That acquarium would be 240 kilos just with water in it
10:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> yep
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> it also came with the thing u put the aquarium on
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> you also need a layer of substrate/ gravel
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> of 5cm
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> atleast
10:36 < bridge> <learath2> LOL good idea. I think it would break my table. I didn't even think about it
10:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> and if u make it pretty some rocks and wood
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes with big aquarium u need to take lot of care where you place it
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> also it should be leveled
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> or u put more pressure in 1 place
10:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw the bigger the aquarium the easier to maintain
10:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> because parameters stay stable against changes for longer
10:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz more buffer
10:40 < bridge> <learath2> That sounds sensible
10:40 < bridge> <avolicious> Lessons learned: Think big
10:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> nano aquariums are the hardest
10:41 < bridge> <avolicious> Learath plans his own waterpark now üòé
10:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> some teaching: a aquarium needs a cycle, fish waste turns into amonia, so u need a filter where bacteria live and turns it into nitrite and then nitrate (or the other way around i forgot) then it's safe for fish and plant food
10:45 < bridge> <avolicious> As a natural filter, you could get something like this: https://www.donauauen.at/en/facts/nature-science/fauna-engl/freshwater-mussel
10:46 < bridge> <avolicious> My parents bought a few of them, so the fishies have a great place. Some fish also use this as "lovehotel"
10:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye but thats not viable in a closed aquarium xd
10:50 < bridge> <avolicious> There might be some species for closed aquariums
10:51 < bridge> <avolicious> but you need atleast 1m^3
10:51 < bridge> <avolicious> but you need atleast 1m^3 of water
10:51 < bridge> <avolicious> but you need atleast 1m^3 of water for one mussel üòÑ
10:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
10:56 < xjh> How to set up a KOG server on Ubuntu
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw the cycle is why you should never ever put fish in a aquarium you just set up
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> you need to let it cycle for some weeks so bacteria live
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> or ur fish die
10:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think kog is private
10:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> @avolicious u can answer xd
10:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they're apparently planning on open-sourcing it, but it's not done yet
10:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> see this
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> did i miss news? is kog dying?
10:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no. see surroundings
10:58 < xjh> I can't understand the tutorial on github
10:59 < xjh> Can someone teach me or is there a tutorial
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> i think u can still run custom kog servers
11:00 < bridge> <avolicious> Gores*
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> don‚Äôt they provide a server binary somewhere?
11:00 < bridge> <avolicious> not KoG
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> ah
11:00 < bridge> <avolicious> Old one tho
11:00 < bridge> <avolicious> Windows, DDNet 9 binary is available on our website
11:01 < bridge> <avolicious> Windows, DDNet 9 based binary is available on our website
11:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah. I'd suggest you open-source the variant you're actually running (i.e. don't strip the non-bare metal parts, at most make it runnable on bare metal, but even that is not necessary). otherwise it's bound to get out of sync
11:06 < bridge> <avolicious> But you cant chat nor use commands nor login into rcon
11:06 < bridge> <avolicious> You cant add sql
11:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm asking from a preservation angle, I guess. it could be made to work if someone wants to restart kog after it dies
11:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. the work you want to do could be done after a disaster, doesn't have to be done now
11:09 < bridge> <avolicious> Mhmmm, I would need to open source everything then
11:10 < xjh> There are still many people who play ddrace in China
11:12 < bridge> <avolicious> Terraform, Ansible, Descriptions of how to setup staged vault, how to setup kubectl, how to build & deploy, CI/CD
11:12 < bridge> <avolicious> So the easier way even after KoG would die is to move the gameplay parts to ddnet instead
11:12 < bridge> <avolicious> so you can run vanilla ddnet
11:12 < xjh> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts Is this URL the code deployed by the kog server?,There's no readme file.
11:12 < bridge> <avolicious> no, its ddnet
11:12 < xjh> this one ? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
11:12 < bridge> <avolicious> its also ddnet
11:13 < xjh> Em
11:13 < xjh> So which one is kog's
11:14 < xjh> Thank you for your help
11:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but that could also be done after the fact, if you'd open-source your current game server implementation. even if it's not runnable on its own
11:16 < bridge> <avolicious> The current implementation implies to open source everything. You basically cant run it, there are no commands, no rcon, no database
11:18 < bridge> <avolicious> you cant even load cfgs like votes
11:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but the gameplay is completely in the game server, is it not?
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> kog does not have one. it‚Äôs a closed source product
11:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so you don't have to open-source everything, just the game server. even if it's not runnable
11:18 < bridge> <avolicious> Yes, gameplay/physics are handled by the gameserver
11:18 < bridge> <zhn> +1
11:18 < bridge> <zhn> this guys did their best on some icpc kind thinga and cant even use anything properly
11:21 < xjh> That is to say, there is no kog server now, and those previous kog servers are the shell of ddnet?
11:23 < xjh> I don't really understand what you mean, it's a bit of a barrier to comprehension because I don't speak English very well
11:26 < bridge> <zhn> hey xjh, idk if kog has their irc bridge or something similar to interact, but yep, ddnet is not affiliated with kog directly
11:29 < xjh> yes, I thought kog was just a special mode of ddnet
11:31 < xjh> Thank you guys, thank you very much for your help, I'm going to ask how other people in China set up servers
12:11 < bridge> <avolicious> Sure, but all the data is coming from other services like Agones/K8s
12:11 < bridge> <avolicious> So the gameserver just handles physics
12:11 < bridge> <avolicious> We are also using quilkin
12:12 < bridge> <avolicious> We also use SpiceDB for permissions
12:12 < bridge> <avolicious> And map votes are being retrieved from keydb ( redis )
12:13 < bridge> <learath2> Well that doesn't mean you can't open source the ddnet server part with the modifications actually interesting to the wider community. You don't need to make it functional or provide any of the stuff around it if you don't want to. No?
12:14 < bridge> <avolicious> But you have to provide proper documentation atleast
12:14 < bridge> <avolicious> otherwise the open source project is useless for me
12:16 < bridge> <learath2> Mh, not everything we do is documented either. Look at the jumble of scripts that run ddnet. Anyway, just wanted to get a better understanding of why you operate the way you do
12:16 < bridge> <avolicious> because its easier to scale
12:17 < bridge> <learath2> Whether the ddnet part of your code is open source or not doesn't really have much to do with scaling
12:17 < bridge> <avolicious> It does. Software has to be adopted to be scalable
12:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm confused. how does the scalability of kog depend on whether you open source the kog game server?
12:18 < bridge> <learath2> I don't even understand that argument
12:18 < bridge> <melo∆û> Oh god
12:20 < bridge> <avolicious> because you cant operate the KoG GameServer. You cant run it on your machine.
12:20 < bridge> <avolicious> 
12:20 < bridge> <avolicious> You said its totally fine, which I agree on. But if people cant run it to develop, where is the benefit for KoG?
12:20 < bridge> <avolicious> To run it, we need proper documentation, so people can develop stuff & test it
12:20 < bridge> <learath2> Why don't you just say that from the start? It makes sense now
12:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's no immediate benefit to kog. there's a benefit for the community. it can try running kog servers 10 or 20 years into the future
12:21 < bridge> <learath2> That's a weak argument. The answer is always, we'll release before our project dies
12:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> when the project dies, it no longer has the resources to open source
12:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in the common case
12:22 < bridge> <avolicious> In case kog dies, you can have the gameserver as is. Then I dont care about any documentation anymore üòÑ
12:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> see e.g. teerace. or teedata
12:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> teerace's DB vanished
12:22 < bridge> <learath2> What we ask of them is in essence ideological, if he doesn't agree with the ideology there isn't much of a way to convince them
12:22 < bridge> <avolicious> The database will not be open source
12:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> teedata doesn't publish their DB anymore
12:22 < bridge> <avolicious> never
12:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not even after kog dies?
12:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the rank db?
12:23 < bridge> <avolicious> No, maybe redacted
12:23 < bridge> <avolicious> Yeah, just the finishes maybe
12:23 < bridge> <zhn> :feelsbadman:
12:23 < bridge> <zhn> the real thing is gone
12:23 < bridge> <avolicious> but all the tickets, emails and whatsoerver will be removed
12:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ofcc
12:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ofc
12:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but I'm telling you from experience that it doesn't work. if you don't open something while the project, it will usually be gone when the project is dead
12:24 < bridge> <learath2> Those are of no value to the community anyway
12:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I've seen plenty of teeworlds projects vanish
12:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's why I try to archive stuff while the projects are still running
12:29 < bridge> <learath2> These discussions always boil down to a couple of core values. In this case it's benevolence. Liking the community doesn't mean you contribute to it with no expectation of return, unless you are benevolent
12:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ok. maybe kog is benevolent to the community
12:30 < bridge> <learath2> Well we can hope üôÇ
12:34 < bridge> <learath2> After getting involved with more career and business minded people, I've noticed that this small community we have gathered here is more an exception than the norm. We are far too open compared to anyone else I see
12:35 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe kog will understand that as teeworlds players a lot of their user base will understand what it means to be open source and why that‚Äôs good
12:35 < bridge> <Ewan> think of how many contributions ddnet has gotten thanks to ppl browsing free games on steam
12:35 < bridge> <Ewan> and eventually making some stuff
12:35 < bridge> <peter0x44> Why is "too open" a bad thing?
12:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I woudln't necessarily expect contributors popping up at kog's door step just because the code is out there
12:36 < bridge> <Ewan> you‚Äôd he surprised
12:36 < bridge> <Ewan> you‚Äôd be surprised
12:36 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of ppl just want to make a name for themselves in open source work now
12:36 < bridge> <learath2> It's not IMO. But I've been among people with this mindset since I was 10. I'm obviously extremely biased
12:37 < bridge> <peter0x44> Yeah, I would say it's an anomaly
12:37 < bridge> <peter0x44> Even among the related free games developed for decades
12:37 < bridge> <teero777> is your gf foss? :troll:
12:38 < bridge> <learath2> :pepeW:
12:38 < bridge> <learath2> I should have become a cool investor
12:38 < bridge> <Ewan> jesus
12:38 < bridge> <Ewan> how do u cope lerato
12:39 < bridge> <learath2> Hyperfocusing on work so I don't have time to think
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> god if only
12:39 < bridge> <learath2> Lots of music so I can't hear my own thoughts when not working
12:39 < bridge> <teero777> Tunnel vision is actually good many times
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> i like the tunnel vision
12:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i sort of realized lately that my adhd tendencies are terrible for trying to keep working at something
12:40 < bridge> <learath2> It's very scary how focused I can get sometimes yet sometimes I can't focus on anything and waste entire days
12:42 < bridge> <Ewan> always hyperfocused and then burnout for increasing periods of time
12:42 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
12:42 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of it is life
12:42 < bridge> <teero777> yea I have the same experience
12:42 < bridge> <Ewan> u need multiple facets
12:42 < bridge> <learath2> I definitely need a very understanding and flexible boss. I will get things done, just on my timetable not yours :/
12:42 < bridge> <learath2> Some days I write 5 lines. Some days I get 3 days of work done
12:42 < bridge> <Ewan> most days i wake up at 3 pm and listen to music and don‚Äôt eat and play games until my body tells me to sleep
12:42 < bridge> <Ewan> now I get work done one in ten days at best
12:42 < bridge> <Ewan> idk how it got like this
12:42 < bridge> <learath2> I was like indoctrinated now that I think about it üòÑ The people who helped me while I learned programming were all almost militant open source enjoyers
12:44 < bridge> <learath2> You are me, but 3 years ago. I don't have any idea how I snapped out of it, but it just randomly fixed itself. So no advice
12:44 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
12:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i think it would be pretty easy to get out if an employer gave me a chance
12:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i tend to do well with a schedule
12:45 < bridge> <Ewan> but it is near impossible to keep one with nothing to do
12:45 < bridge> <learath2> Waking up and seeing the sky dark was when I fixed my sleep. That is very upsetting to see
12:45 < bridge> <Ewan> the very worst
12:46 < bridge> <teero777> Somedays I can wake up at four am and be productive for like 8hrs straight and one some days I can't even manage to wake up at noon
12:46 < bridge> <teero777> And then I'm kinda depressed that I wasted so many hours
12:46 < bridge> <learath2> Oh wait this isn't #off-topic
12:47 < bridge> <learath2> We derailed heinrich's attempt at getting avo to open source kog
12:47 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs not happening anyway
12:47 < bridge> <teero777> Just the mod or everything
12:47 < bridge> <Ewan> avo would rather make sure his product is scalable as it sits on his hard drive than usable by others in any capacity
12:48 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, I fear it's a more fundamental disagreement on values that won't be resolved over a conversation
12:48 < bridge> <Ewan> i wouldn‚Äôt be upset if kog died
12:48 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe the ranks would be missed
12:48 < bridge> <learath2> I care about just the mod
12:49 < bridge> <Ewan> honestly the mod adds like 3 things which could be reimplemented in less than a week by a knowledgeable developer
12:49 < bridge> <Ewan> all strong, no buffer hammer, moving freeze
12:49 < bridge> <Ewan> what else‚Ä¶
12:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> U dont like kog that much huh üò¨
12:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a valid point
12:50 < bridge> <Ewan> my resume is 100% open source experience
12:51 < bridge> <Ewan> but it‚Äôs not enough for these snotty ski jackoffs
12:51 < bridge> <learath2> Good luck in the job market bozo. 5 years of professional experience required
12:51 < bridge> <Ewan> if u didn‚Äôt spend at least 5 figures on tuition you can say goodbye to any glimpse of a career u had
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet helped me find the job i have
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> did the market change that much in 3 years
12:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i already have 3y xp lol
12:51 < bridge> <Ewan> seems you live in a less saturated market
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> or maybe my projects are more interesting :EZ:
12:52 < bridge> <Ewan> but what about your first job
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw they aproached me for the job
12:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt search for it
12:52 < bridge> <Ewan> rub it in xd
12:52 < bridge> <learath2> Didn't you have a paypal wrapper or something? Companies love anything that involves money and payments
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> was like a internship u have to do
12:53 < bridge> <Ewan> have to?
12:53 < bridge> <learath2> I've considered putting up a repo called "libdollar" or "libmoney"
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> in spain its called "grado superior" and to get the title u have to do 4 month internship
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> unpaid or paid
12:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> usually unpaid
12:53 < bridge> <learath2> Probably part of his education, it's called a curricular internship.
12:54 < bridge> <Ewan> ah education
12:54 < bridge> <Ewan> good one
12:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> easiest way to get 1st job is via education
12:54 < bridge> <learath2> Or connections
12:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> my first job got me connectionts
12:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> to the second job
12:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> and then i had xp to get aproached by current job
12:54 < bridge> <Ewan> so funny
12:55 < bridge> <learath2> I'll hire you dw
12:55 < bridge> <Ewan> don‚Äôt tease me
12:56 < bridge> <peter0x44> This catch 22 is just ridiculous, and I can't tell who it benefits
12:56 < bridge> <Ewan> employers want devs with field experience because the standard of education is getting lower and lower
12:56 < bridge> <peter0x44> It doesn't seem like a matter of convenience, or necessity for anyone
12:56 < bridge> <learath2> HR costs are lower when you can just discard a lot of resumes outright
12:57 < bridge> <peter0x44> I guess the filters are for me
12:57 < bridge> <learath2> And yeah universities produce horrible software engineers
12:57 < bridge> <learath2> But thank god they learned electromagnetism and chemistry
12:57 < bridge> <Ewan> right
12:57 < bridge> <peter0x44> This is how all the "get a job" advice feels
12:57 < bridge> <peter0x44> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1240256844073537597/GNZItEzawAAQmAn.jpg?ex=6645e6b2&is=66449532&hm=ea51dd265b8828d4664f29ce1fe6f52d10e4400ad56a8ecd0ca2bc0682ec330b&
12:58 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
12:58 < bridge> <Ewan> 10 keywords for your resume
12:58 < bridge> <learath2> But have you considered building one?
12:58 < bridge> <Ewan> not so easy without experience
12:58 < bridge> <learath2> Then you'll get web development job offers üòÑ
12:58 < bridge> <Ewan> :feelsbadman:
12:59 < bridge> <peter0x44> Or I see "the cloud"
12:59 < bridge> <learath2> It's all AI this cloud that
12:59 < bridge> <peter0x44> Exactly what am I supposed to learn about "the cloud"
12:59 < bridge> <peter0x44> Programming I can get and learn, I can see what it means, the cloud seems like just learning what each of Google, oracle, Amazon, Microsoft's marketing buzzwords mean
13:00 < bridge> <peter0x44> It's not... Anything
13:00 < bridge> <peter0x44> It's all overwhelming and I don't know what to begin or do
13:00 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs mainly a corporate circle jerk
13:00 < bridge> <Ewan> yes there are some things that might separate the cloud from other established techs but it‚Äôs mostly marketing built on top of web tech
13:01 < bridge> <learath2> If you want a devops or it job I hear cloud certifications can help. And btw you do need some experience with those things to get a job in that area, the AWS and GCP consoles were created for a different breed of human
13:01 < bridge> <learath2> It feels like operating a spaceship, mostly so you lose track of what you are doing and spend thousands
13:02 < bridge> <peter0x44> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1240257902678380626/GLP1Y-PWcAA65za.jpg?ex=6645e7ae&is=6644962e&hm=11660b314dc1e17f5ca31cb901b357b81a41572938ec684c7e9f67bc007b16d8&
13:02 < bridge> <peter0x44> How many words can they make up for the same thing
13:02 < bridge> <Ewan> they have teams of people whose only job it is to come up with said names
13:02 < bridge> <learath2> Another friend of mine works at a mid-large company, a colleague of his made a configuration error that cost almost 200k$ over the weekend
13:02 < bridge> <Ewan> where do u think those billions go
13:03 < bridge> <peter0x44> Yeah it does seem like the purpose is to swindle you at least slightly
13:03 < bridge> <peter0x44> Not even slightly
13:04 < bridge> <learath2> I only know the GCP names of things, and a couple AWS equivalents
13:05 < bridge> <Ewan> this stuff kinda turns my stomach
13:05 < bridge> <peter0x44> Me too
13:05 < bridge> <peter0x44> I see this and feel anxiety
13:06 < bridge> <Ewan> seems like a lot of it is created for the sole purpose of giving people something to do
13:06 < bridge> <Ewan> more people need more jobs
13:06 < bridge> <Ewan> and i get it
13:06 < bridge> <Ewan> but damn
13:06 < bridge> <learath2> I like the ideas behind some of it, I'm not the biggest enjoyer of how corporate is though
13:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know MLIR so i got my niche
13:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> and LLVM
13:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> someone from intel.com aproached me
13:07 < bridge> <Ewan> u told us
13:07 < bridge> <learath2> Like serverless architectures (Lambda, Cloud Functions) are a cute idea or Event driven architectures (pub/sub)
13:07 < bridge> <Ewan> no need to flex more
13:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
13:08 < bridge> <learath2> Ur depressing Ewan with your job prospects
13:08 < bridge> <Ewan> i rly am happy for u but the last thing i wanna hear about is how well ur career is going
13:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> do more projects
13:08 < bridge> <Ewan> impossible
13:09 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly, I agree. Do more projects and apply to smaller places where they can actually take time to look at your portfolio
13:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> but not typical web projects
13:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> do something more interesting
13:09 < bridge> <peter0x44> I've been trying for a month, submitted 15, and am still yet to talk to a real person
13:09 < bridge> <Ewan> give up and get a job at the grocery store
13:09 < bridge> <Ewan> this market is not for us
13:09 < bridge> <learath2> Because amazon, google, facebook and those kinds are just mass discarding resumes with some algorithm
13:10 < bridge> <peter0x44> It might be okay if it were just Amazon, Google, and Facebook
13:10 < bridge> <Ewan> unless u come from some kind of money or incredible willpower to work on projects nonstop there‚Äôs basically no way
13:10 < bridge> <learath2> Some mid sized local companies still respect decent university names, so you can try the education route
13:11 < bridge> <learath2> The earlier friend I mentioned who doesn't shell without gpt submitted a whopping 400 applications before landing his job
13:11 < bridge> <learath2> He always tells me I'm not applying enough. He must be right üòÑ
13:14 < bridge> <peter0x44> I'm straight up unable to do that
13:14 < bridge> <peter0x44> I don't have the mental stamina required to write 400 cover letters
13:14 < bridge> <Ewan> The fucking cover letters
13:14 < bridge> <Ewan> God
13:14 < bridge> <peter0x44> I might as well give up already if that's what it takes
13:14 < bridge> <Ewan> i can‚Äôt even write one
13:14 < bridge> <peter0x44> All of that effort for 99.75% of them to go in a shredder
13:14 < bridge> <learath2> Not all jobs require them. But he is a gpt enjoyer, he probably wrote like 5 cover letters and made gpt remix and adjust them per job
13:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i am taking a kind of employment counseling from someone who says otherwise
13:15 < bridge> <Ewan> apparently millennials were taught they don‚Äôt matter as much but when many of them went to apply employers were looking for them
13:16 < bridge> <Ewan> and they‚Äôre still ‚Äòin‚Äô
13:16 < bridge> <Ewan> market differs in places tho
13:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats true, apply everywhere even if u dont meet
13:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> requirements
13:16 < bridge> <learath2> I didn't say they don't matter. I said not all places require them
13:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i never wrote a cover letter
13:16 < bridge> <Ewan> well it‚Äôs hard to tell where it will and won‚Äôt matter
13:17 < bridge> <Ewan> and 9 times out of 10 it strengthens your application anyway
13:17 < bridge> <Ewan> yes they reached out to u
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i applied to jobs too
13:17 < bridge> <Ewan> üëç
13:17 < bridge> <learath2> For big big companies it might be a waste of your time. Their ai hr will discard your resume immediately when it can't spot your 5 years of work experience. But in general yeah just apply everywhere
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> they also play the big game
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> they bot the messages
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> so u play the game too
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> the hr guy wont notice
13:18 < bridge> <learath2> Exactly. If you need a cover letter. Just gpt it. They wont hesitate to have gpt read it
13:18 < bridge> <Ewan> the recruiter definitely will notice a cover letter
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> gpt it
13:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i hate this world
13:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i don‚Äôt wanna play that fucking game
13:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i just wanna be honest
13:19 < bridge> <meeu> it doesn't matter for big companies
13:19 < bridge> <meeu> for smaller companies, maybe
13:20 < bridge> <learath2> (I don't mean gpt it as the zoozers do it for their homework, do it properly, use it as a tool, dont make it so the entire thing)
13:20 < bridge> <peter0x44> I had one point where I had to record videos talking into a camera
13:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i did one of those
13:20 < bridge> <Ewan> terrible vibes
13:20 < bridge> <peter0x44> The rejection I got said something like "due to volume of applicants, we don't give feedback to candidates we don't interview"
13:20 < bridge> <learath2> Hahahah, me too, we applied for a couple startup accelerators so we had to make a video for those
13:20 < bridge> <Ewan> and if you fail you‚Äôre likely to be weeded out from that company forever
13:21 < bridge> <Ewan> retailers are notorious for that
13:21 < bridge> <peter0x44> I don't think so
13:21 < bridge> <peter0x44> But I don't know
13:21 < bridge> <learath2> This no feedback thing is awful. There should be a law forcing them to tell you what's wrong imo
13:21 < bridge> <peter0x44> Here's the wording in the email:
13:21 < bridge> <peter0x44> ```
13:21 < bridge> <peter0x44> We regret to advise you that the position you have applied for has been filled and we will not be progressing with your application on this occasion. We have really enjoyed finding out more about you, your skills and experience and appreciate the time you have taken to apply.
13:21 < bridge> <peter0x44> 
13:21 < bridge> <peter0x44> Due to the volume of applications we receive, we only provide feedback for candidates who reach the interview stage.
13:21 < bridge> <peter0x44> ```
13:21 < bridge> <Ewan> nobody watched your application
13:21 < bridge> <peter0x44> "has been filled" you mean to tell me they already interviewed people by the time I got the rejection?
13:21 < bridge> <peter0x44> Was this position even real?
13:22 < bridge> <peter0x44> Probably not
13:22 < bridge> <meeu> it could be an internal transfer, i had that happened to me once
13:22 < bridge> <peter0x44> And discussing this with family is like "the world doesn't owe you" and similar irritation
13:23 < bridge> <Ewan> you talk to your parents about this? xd
13:24 < bridge> <learath2> This is something I've been pondering a while. It sounds sane when people say it, but my opinion is that it's actually false. I do believe the world does owe me some things to a certain extent
13:24 < bridge> <peter0x44> I think the world owes everyone everything
13:24 < bridge> <peter0x44> class warfare is real
13:24 < bridge> <peter0x44> but that debate I won't elaborate here
13:25 < bridge> <learath2> I'll disagree with the everything part, but things like healthcare, elderlycare, fulfillment in ones existence, etc are imo things the world/society does owe you
13:25 < bridge> <peter0x44> agree
13:26 < bridge> <peter0x44> that's basically what I meant by "everything" anyway
13:26 < bridge> <peter0x44> and the world is currently failing at this, on an enormous scale
13:28 < bridge> <Ewan> the truth
13:28 < bridge> <Ewan> ppl love to think it‚Äôs all about hard work
13:28 < bridge> <Ewan> but there are simply no realistic paths for growth at places where the lower class starts
13:29 < bridge> <learath2> (I also believe you owe the world some work, that's the deal I believe in, I contribute so that you take care of me)
13:29 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
13:29 < bridge> <Ewan> there are too many people on this damn planet
13:31 < bridge> <learath2> For your specific case, I suggest you find what niche you want to do and really do some portfolio projects, something you can point at if you get employment. And try smaller companies as small and local as possible, the faster you can get to a face to face or phone interview the better
13:31 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe
13:31 < bridge> <learath2> For your specific case, I suggest you find what niche you want to do and really do some portfolio projects, something you can point at if you get an interview. And try smaller companies as small and local as possible, the faster you can get to a face to face or phone interview the better
13:31 < bridge> <Ewan> but everyone in my family has worked hard their whole adult life and still has to work for the rest of their existence
13:32 < bridge> <Ewan> to live a sub par life
13:32 < bridge> <learath2> Our kinds of CVs are very niche. They look awful to big corpo hr. You need to get to someone with technical knowledge to look at it somehow
13:32 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, that is a little beyond the scope of what us here can hope to fix. That's the new deal
13:33 < bridge> <Ewan> this is probably why the U.S. military is so successful
13:33 < bridge> <Ewan> so many people struggle badly enough where they grasp for something that just gives them direction no matter the consequences
13:33 < bridge> <peter0x44> a lot of people choose it for funding for univerisity degrees and such
13:33 < bridge> <peter0x44> no one with options would choose that, it's the "poverty draft"
13:33 < bridge> <learath2> The US military isn't actually a horrible career track if you don't mind contributing to turning poor people in the middle east into pink mist
13:35 < bridge> <Ewan> I talked to a relevant professional about my experience and he pointed to his nephew who lived with him and joined the military, who now is in the middle of some heavily guided training for a career
13:35 < bridge> <Ewan> which sounds fine but i don‚Äôt want to turn people into mist
13:35 < bridge> <Ewan> or be affiliated with that at all
13:36 < bridge> <Ewan> fuck me for being driven by principle i guess
13:37 < bridge> <learath2> Have you considered an injection of patriotism?
13:37 < bridge> <Ewan> no but i have considered milking this country for what I can and just going to prison for a long time
13:37 < bridge> <Ewan> they feed you and give you a routine
13:37 < bridge> <Ewan> what more do u rly need
13:38 < bridge> <learath2> US prisons suck, first migrate to norway
13:38 < bridge> <Ewan> yea well i commit a crime there and I‚Äôll be returned to U.S. most likely
13:38 < bridge> <learath2> Or become extremely rich, then commit tax fraud. Those prisons are really nice
13:38 < bridge> <Ewan> if only
13:50 < bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/N64Recomp damn, someone took my idea and made it a thing
13:50 < bridge> <learath2> Well not exactly what I had planned but still very close
13:50 < bridge> <Ewan> sad
13:50 < bridge> <Ewan> 3k already
13:51 < bridge> <Ewan> was at 1.4 or something when i starred it like 2 days ago
13:51 < bridge> <learath2> It emits C per instruction, then relies on the compiler to reoptimize it
13:51 < bridge> <Ewan> hmmm
13:51 < bridge> <Ewan> is that safe
13:51 < bridge> <learath2> I was planning to lift the assembly into LLVM IR
13:52 < bridge> <learath2> It is, because of the "as-if" rule. The compiler isn't allowed to change the observable behaviour of the program when optimizing
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan> well good
13:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's kinda like good ol' php files. just drop them via some file transfer protocol
13:53 < bridge> <learath2> I'm unsure how well it optimizes though. Already optimized code does lose context that might make it hard for the compiler to reason about it
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan> what does it do about what are usually hardware subsystems
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan> video, input, sound
13:53 < bridge> <learath2> Heh, perhaps that's why I find it cute. I'm used to thinking in the PHP manner
13:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the php deployment is honestly just insanely good
13:54 < bridge> <learath2> Probably not supported, iirc those things are mmio controlled in the N64
13:54 < bridge> <Ewan> Uch
13:55 < bridge> <learath2> Lamba functions are kinda like a php script running on a server that can spin down and spin up for requests
13:56 < bridge> <learath2> Lambda*
13:56 < bridge> <Ewan> bedtime
13:57 < bridge> <learath2> @heinrich5991 do you know if there is any way to manipulate the virtual memory mappings of a process from userspace? I know `mmap` can allow some things
13:58 < bridge> <Ewan> in linux?
13:58 < bridge> <learath2> Yes
13:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> of your own process? or of others?
13:58 < bridge> <learath2> I'm wondering if I can do things like map a physical piece of ram twice in a row e.g.
13:58 < bridge> <learath2> own process
13:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, should be able to map the same memory twice
13:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> mmap
13:59 < bridge> <learath2> mmap requires it to be backed by a file though, no?
13:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's `MAP_ANONYMOUS`
13:59 < bridge> <learath2> but I can't refer to a `MAP_ANONYMOUS` again without there being a file that refers to it iirc, no?
13:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but according to stackoverflow, you want a shm object as FD: https://stackoverflow.com/a/71781135/870079
14:01 < bridge> <learath2> `memfd_create` looks interesting
14:01 < bridge> <Ewan> in windows you do this with named memory mapped objects
14:01 < bridge> <Ewan> they exist in a global namespace
14:01 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs quite hacky
14:01 < bridge> <Ewan> can also share handles
14:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what do you need it for? üôÇ whatever it is, it sounds interesting
14:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (and tricky wrt. compilers)
14:04 < bridge> <learath2> First time I pondered this question was when I was thinking about abusing it to make a ring buffer without having to do a division
14:04 < bridge> <learath2> If the ring buffer truly appears to be infinite to the process, then there is no need to modulo üòÑ
14:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> infinite isn't really possible though
14:06 < bridge> <learath2> Second time I had mappings come up was when I was thinking of how I would map a gameboy cartridge inside memory, it would be nice if all memory access didn't require me to map the address in userspace
14:08 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, I did notice that later, but just having two of them in a row would allow writing blocks that can cross the discontinuity
14:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yup
14:08 < bridge> <learath2> So I wouldn't get my no modulo one, but I would get a cute ringbuffer that actually appears continuous üòÑ
14:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i think llvm can still optimize more if the target is different from the original right
14:10 < bridge> <learath2> It can, the only problem I can think of is that llvm if given the original code may have taken a different branch of optimization that is now no longer obvious
14:12 < bridge> <learath2> I don't know enough about how llvm optimizes code and about compiler theory to know if the optimal form of a program is unique or whether llvm can backtrack when optimizing
14:13 < bridge> <learath2> Say whatever they compiled with unrolled a loop, but it's more optimal to vectorize that code on the new target. Can it roll it back up and vectorize I wonder
14:55 < bridge> <sans._.> How would I go about offering to re-make the @DDNet bot :heh: in typescript
14:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I see no reason for a rewrite
14:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> From one interpreted language to another
14:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Huge change
14:57 < bridge> <sans._.> I see a couple
14:57 < bridge> <sans._.> mainly, the bot being out of date
14:57 < bridge> <sans._.> $points Sans3108

14:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is that somethign that cannot be fixed with an incremental update?
14:57 < bridge> <sans._.> im not sure, it's all written in python
14:58 < bridge> <sans._.> also it could be made nicer :p
14:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Why doesn't it show correct data btw?
14:58 < bridge> <sans._.> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
14:59 < bridge> <sans._.> also I could make a version of the bot which has user installable commands
14:59 < bridge> <sans._.> which look like this and can be used anywhere
14:59 < bridge> <sans._.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1240287368951631962/image.png?ex=66460320&is=6644b1a0&hm=3f6e713a31975872720775c16c4de08407ea16ba5a57c596ba54bfff8490e49b&
14:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this all doesn't sound like a reason for a rewrite
14:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can write a bot in typescript if you want
15:03 < bridge> <sans._.> I didn't know that lol
15:03 < bridge> <murpi> because i'm not done yet üòÑ
15:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Oh, ure still writing it
15:03 < bridge> <sans._.> I'm pretty sure most libs for python are lacking some features
15:03 < bridge> <sans._.> I'm pretty sure most discord libs for python are lacking some features
15:03 < bridge> <murpi> I mean, the points and everything is pretty much done since last month, but I keep finding more stuff that could be changed/improved
15:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> interesting. why do you think so? python is a very popular language, probably also for writing discord bots
15:05 < bridge> <murpi> @heinrich5991 gave me more ideas to implement just yesterday which im currently working on
15:05 < bridge> <sans._.> After the stuff with discord.py I'm not so sure
15:05 < bridge> <sans._.> pretty sure at some point the dev just didnt want to implement slash commands
15:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> How about rewrite in COBOL :poggers:
15:05 < bridge> <murpi> That was true maybe 2 years ago xd
15:05 < bridge> <sans._.> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
15:06 < bridge> <sans._.> I don't trust python with anything discord related every since
15:06 < bridge> <murpi> im actually converting all commands into slash/app commands btw
15:06 < bridge> <sans._.> neat
15:07 < bridge> <sans._.> you planning to use message components, or context commands?
15:07 < bridge> <murpi> They'd be all ephemeral too, resulting in significantly less server spam
15:07 < bridge> <sans._.> that's sorta bad, how are people supposed to know there's a bot xd
15:07 < bridge> <murpi> Both, some commands are hybrids
15:07 < bridge> <murpi> We have #bot-cmds?
15:14 < bridge> <sans._.> alright ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
15:55 < bridge> <patiga> does anyone know why I can't find the simd function `_mm_shuffle_pi8` in rust? (http://intel-intrinsics.dpldocs.info/inteli.tmmintrin._mm_shuffle_pi8.html)
15:55 < bridge> <patiga> I even found an old usage of it in `packed_simd`: https://github.com/gnzlbg/packed_simd/blob/7486a9c3425c1e90d591214f9f86156d8f7865ac/src/codegen/shuffle_bytes.rs#L35
15:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> according to `git log -S _mm_shuffle_pi8` in the rust repository, it has never existed
15:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't know specifics about simd in rust. perhaps just and oversight?
16:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I generally see no `_pi8` functions in the list on the left: https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.78.0/core/arch/x86_64/fn._mm_shuffle_epi8.html
16:01 < bridge> <patiga> hm that occurence in `packed_simd` is probably not from rust's core
16:01 < bridge> <patiga> I didn't notice that it doesn't use the full path with `core::`
16:02 < bridge> <patiga> I guess I'll open an issue and ask
16:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds good
16:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> apparently the one in rust comes from https://github.com/rust-lang/portable-simd
16:07 < bridge> <patiga> uhm
16:07 < bridge> <patiga> I think this is relevant: https://github.com/rust-lang/stdarch/pull/890
16:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so not supported on x86_64?
16:13 < bridge> <patiga> it appears so
16:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol
16:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> @ryozuki my wiki entry was accepted :o

18:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Did something regarding map changes change on the network side?
18:00 < bridge> <learath2> Only thing I can think of is the early flush robyt3 added
18:00 < bridge> <fokkonaut> suddenly map design switching (sending a map change) doesnt seem to work reliably anymore and client is stuck in sending initial client info
18:01 < bridge> <learath2> mh, that wouldn't be related then
18:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> weird
18:01 < bridge> <learath2> is it for all clients?
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://formal.land/blog/2024/04/26/translation-core-alloc-crates
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> was this shared?
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks imagine formally verified ddnet
18:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> no, ddnet only, got reported recently and i just experienced it the first time in 18.2
18:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> after i updated
18:02 < bridge> <fokkonaut> in 18.1 it worked
18:03 < bridge> <fokkonaut> you can try it on my server, `/design dark`
18:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8271
18:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> possibly this @learath2 ?
18:06 < bridge> <fokkonaut> well idk, might not be related
18:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> unlikely that
18:06 < bridge> <learath2> mh, I don't think it's related either
18:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> unlikely to be that
18:07 < bridge> <zhn> RIIR is da reason :P
18:07 < bridge> <learath2> I guess when you have a minute the fastest way to figure this out is just a bisect
18:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> do inital PR :gigachad:
18:07 < bridge> <zhn> also im sorry for interrupting you guys, but had anyone experience with cross-building docker images for raspberry pi?
18:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> true yea
18:08 < bridge> <learath2> 300~ commits between 18.1 and 18.2 that's only 8-9 steps to bisect
18:08 < bridge> <zhn> i just don't want to compile 1000+ c/cpp files on this lil thing
18:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no experience
18:09 < bridge> <zhn> sad
18:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> are you looking for a way to do it or how to do it efficiently? i did that with docker Buildx, because my VPS was weak as hell and compiling ddnet would've taken approx 10-15 minutes :D
18:11 < bridge> <zhn> both, since rpi is arm based
18:11 < bridge> <zhn> and it not such a nutcracker for compiling huge projects :p
18:11 < bridge> <zhn> my host machine is x86_64 and rpi is arm64
18:12 < bridge> <zhn> i tried to use tutorial guide from docker documentation but its outdated lulz
18:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> you'd just do `docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t container:latest` or smth ig
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that would be insane. and insanely hard üòÑ
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe even harder than the rust stuff
18:12 < bridge> <zhn> it hangs on not finding /bin/sh, idk why
18:13 < bridge> <zhn> ill try one more time though

18:42 < bridge> <nytebk201> My 18.2 win x64 client crash every time even with a fresh download. Is that a common problem? I did not find the crash log if there is any
18:43 < bridge> <robyt3> There should be a crash log in the `dumps` folder in your config dir
18:43 < bridge> <robyt3> $configdir
18:43 < bridge> <nytebk201> I know. It is empty.
18:43 < bridge> <nytebk201> Already checked it the very first moment
18:43 < bridge> <nytebk201> Sth is wrong before the log system works
18:44 < bridge> <robyt3> Hmm, maybe a driver problem then. Update your graphics drivers, install all available windows updates, then reboot
18:50 < bridge> <louis> hmm i can't find it even in .local/share/ddnet
18:50 < bridge> <nytebk201> In which version was the config folder moved?
18:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> which path does it use there for you
18:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno long ago.. smth with 15 or 16
18:51 < bridge> <louis> .teeworlds/maps
18:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 16.1
18:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well then that path exist
18:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it uses ~/.teeworlds
18:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it uses teeworlds dir when it already existed before
18:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else it uses the new paths
18:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> $configdir
18:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's why there is Old and New
18:52 < bridge> <louis> it doesnt exist
18:52 < bridge> <nytebk201> I c. Did not even realize the move
18:53 < bridge> <louis> i think im not schizo but i dont see it
18:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh
18:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> open terminal do
18:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ls -l ~/.teeworlds
18:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> open terminal do
18:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
18:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ls -l ~/.teeworlds
18:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
18:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe it's hidden by your file explorer
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u use KDE
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> CTRL + H

18:54 < bridge> <louis> tbf i'm using the version from gnome software tools because i wanted to see if it was any different
18:55 < bridge> <louis> it might be some dumb thing w that
18:55 < bridge> <louis> tbf i'm using the version from gnome software library because i wanted to see if it was any different
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when u start the client it should tell which path it uses actually
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1240346788662214686/image.png?ex=66463a76&is=6644e8f6&hm=f7bb65a467dd8d4693171b27eea8d25cb259c461e6c531b10c72beebd6adb96e&
18:56 < bridge> <louis> ye none of them exist
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao how buggy is that version
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe they use some kind of sandboxing
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so it ends up in some very weird directory
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u could try to find it manually
18:56 < bridge> <louis> ye thats what i was thinking
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> locate settings_ddnet.cfg 
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
18:58 < bridge> <louis> i think flatpak puts it in some obscure ass container -.-

18:58 < bridge> <nytebk201> u can use
18:58 < bridge> <nytebk201> ls -lt | head -n 6
18:59 < bridge> <nytebk201> to list the last 6 modified file after a new demo or sth
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> are you on linux btw?
19:02 < bridge> <nytebk201> No, not now. I am using a server to train machine learning model. Linux desktop is not handy
19:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I disagree with the last part but anyway:
19:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Did earlier versions worked? Do they still work? Do you use steam or website?
19:06 < bridge> <nytebk201> Do you mean client on linux? It worked back in 2018. IDK now, i am inactive
19:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok, i just wondered if u played a few days ago before 18.2 dropped
19:17 < bridge> <nytebk201> Uh, you mean client crash? Well, it worked just fine 5 min ago and sth is wrong after I hit the update button in settings. It showed "no update" after that but without restart and I knew something was wrong. Then crashed after restart
19:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ffs ddnet wont build anymore rn xd
19:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @learath2 could u try to bisect
19:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh ok that's weird, was your old client rather old or new?
19:20 < bridge> <nytebk201> I believe it is early 17. After the crash, I downloaded a fresh 18.2/17.2 from website but all crash.
19:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh maybe rename DDnet/Teeworlds in appdata
19:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and maybe try nightly:
19:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://ddnet.org/downloads/DDNet-nightly-win64.zip
19:23 < bridge> <nytebk201> Tried. Still crash. Will try nightly
19:23 < bridge> <nytebk201> Nightly crash
19:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What are your computer specs?
19:23 < bridge> <nytebk201> really weird
19:31 < bridge> <nytebk201> I guess there should be a log when updating client in-game. Sth must happened during that
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u use a fresh client and fresh config directory then the ingame updater is irrelevant
19:31 < bridge> <learath2> I'm not in the mood to get up and get to my computer rn, sorry
19:32 < bridge> <fokkonaut> np
19:33 < bridge> <learath2> Whats the issue anyway?
19:33 < bridge> <nytebk201> IDK. When the crash happened, I switched to ddnet.old and it worked. And I pressed update again :<
19:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> client doesnt reconnect properly after /design
19:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it stays in "sending initial client info" after downloading the map
19:33 < bridge> <learath2> I meant with the bisect
19:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ah
19:33 < bridge> <fokkonaut> my ddnet doesnt build
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but here u said a fresh 17.2 still crashed
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway i assume something fixed it?
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what was it
19:34 < bridge> <learath2> I can't really fix that üòÑ
19:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xdxd
19:36 < bridge> <nytebk201> Not really. I just download a even older version of ddnet. 15.4 works.
19:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf
19:36 < bridge> <nytebk201> Surprice
19:37 < bridge> <nytebk201> Surprise
19:40 < bridge> <nytebk201> Ok, I will press in-game update. Let's see what will happen
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dont do it lmao
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> clearly new versions are broken for you
19:45 < bridge> <nytebk201> WTF, it works! Hahaha Why!?
