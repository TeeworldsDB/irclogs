02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> So if I were to edit the run cycle to be better, I want to build a tee builder that supports these animation containers, in such a way where you can see your changes live.
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> good idea
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> https://tenor.com/view/get-to-work-work-simpsons-smithers-trendizisst-gif-15496843
03:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <peterson21> Thank me later https://t.me/+kaz97seJgx9jNTNh
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Is dbg_dummies deprecated I get segfault D:
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> U can only use it before starting the server
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Don't change it mid run
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Ah I see tahnks
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Ah I see thanks
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> why dont you do it :)
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> lmao I made some changes to fng2-06 and I won and I got segfault rip players
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Probably has to do with `cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fsigned-char"  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-fsigned-char"
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> ` or smth because I don't get segfault locally
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Probably has to do with `cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fsigned-char"  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-fsigned-char"
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> ` or smth because I don't get segfault locally
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> edit: not a segfault but probably a inf while loop

11:06 <+ChillerDragon> deen gnomie confirmed hehe https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1664096737.png
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I just like DDNet related projects, even if I don't use them myself
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> sure sure

13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Typical modern programmer behaviour
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as long its not slower
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xd
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In 2085 all games will be compiled into finite state automata. All possible states will be inside the binary. 1 exabyte games
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ez
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> help?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1023584185010638939/screenshot_2022-09-25_16-16-31.png
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if you are sure its not a permission problem create github issue and tag robyte, i dunno if brackets & spaces work, but why not ^^
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> if i relaucn client its latest version so update did perform
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> BUT
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> CAN I ASK WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1023585098127384618/screenshot_2022-09-25_16-19-56.png
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> New sitting animation for when people are paused / afk
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Voxel I have a few suggestions. For the sitting I think hooking shouldnt disturb it, afk is afk. For the running reference, how about using a map with speeders and 0 friction? The tee would run infinitely and reproducibly at the same speed
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can couple that with a couple config values to play with. I tested the freeze particles that way, you can adjust the values without recompiling
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its when you are stopping your inline skaters
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> full brake
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> oh its just custom animation if u afk or pause
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> lel on first i thoat animations got broken
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> can i do my own animations?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> like smoking if in pause or asleep if afk
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> sure, if you make your own client, otherwise no
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> how do i make animation?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> its just positions of body and feet?
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> or i need to make anim in other programm?
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> would be nice to add animations variations in to assets
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I have no clue, I know nothing about coding or anything of the like
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> me too but i want that
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> that means i go study rn
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> c++?
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I guess so
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> ok ty
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/792324740824039475
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> All of the tw animations are in code. So you'd need to learn a bit of coding atleast
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> did we try this and test some skins? xd
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Some skins just look ridiculous
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> have u tested it or just assume it?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> so i learn C then c++?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> in coding im 0
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it's the patch I'm thinking of, I did test it. It looked bizarre with stuff like tank
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> @Learath2 Off topic: I swapped to using antiping, it's op. Come to the dark side
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm about to get back into studying 69 hours per day ðŸ˜­
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No time to use antiping
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> rough
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can directly learn C++
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> @Learath2 yo bro
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> can you code small thing?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> "join empty server with lowest ping"
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sorry, no time :/
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> ok when i learn c i try it
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Is it possible to increase the MAX_CLIENTS to let's say an absurd number 2028?
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Is it possible to increase the MAX_CLIENTS to let's say an absurd number 2048?
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for the fng mod?
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> No in ddnet
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mh then probs no, bcs it uses uint64_t for many stuff
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I want to have bots not registered to the master but players still be able to join
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> What would be the theoretical MAX_CLIENTS number I could use
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> What would be the theoretical MAX_CLIENTS number I could use?
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> rn 64, but with some tweaks there is no limit except your CPU dieing
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> xD so there's no limit for the MAX_CLIENTS for the clientside?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i used 512 on fng once for testing with bots (so not 512 players, which would also send packets and increase CPU usage etc.)
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and it worked pretty good on a pretty weak VPS
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so you can probs use a very high number if u just want to target bots
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> client side always 64
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> I see thanks!
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u cannot change that except changing the client which probs wont happen
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> Not gonna need any more than 16 so probably 64 is fine :D
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the current physics code which is O(n^2) in many places starts to break down at around 256 players
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't remember who experimented with it, but it was probably either fstd or eeeee
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> @Learath2 there are many guys on rus who dont like new animations(i like it tho)
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> can you make it possible to on/off it?
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> offical ddnet server 65535 players support update when?
17:31 <+ChillerDragon> yes pls
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> this community 100% need that
17:33 <+ChillerDragon> not that many
17:33 <+ChillerDragon> but more than 64 for sure
17:33 <+ChillerDragon> full servers are a thing
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> only servers with multeasymap ig
17:34 <+ChillerDragon> and the occasional t0 hype map
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> imagine if servers allow 128 players when map is on multeasymap and go back to 63 when map changes to something else
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <APFFF> twice the amount of blockers
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> yes
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bomba2834> ~~thats what we all want~~
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Talk to @heinrich5991 about it. I'd add an option just so I don't have to hear complaints about it every 10 minutes
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks the new rx 5090 TI just dropped

18:59 <+ChillerDragon> Yo Ryozuki i just figured out that @scrumplex is on this discord and plays ddnet xd he is the dude from polymc
18:59 <+ChillerDragon> did anyone else know that? o.O
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i knew
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur late as always
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he contributed to ddnet too
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd buy xd
19:01 <+ChillerDragon> wot
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:01 <+ChillerDragon> he did
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea

19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> his web looks cool tho
19:04 <+ChillerDragon> wait Ryozuki did u post that here alr?
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> me?
19:05 <+ChillerDragon> its such a smol world moment for me rn
19:05 <+ChillerDragon> ye
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what did i post?
19:05 <+ChillerDragon> about the poly dude
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the day it was made
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz multimc drama
19:05 <+ChillerDragon> yes u said polymc
19:05 <+ChillerDragon> but u also said scrumplex?
19:05 <+ChillerDragon> i must have missed that
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i told him when i found out
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:05 <+ChillerDragon> him?
19:05 <+ChillerDragon> not me -.-
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i asked if he was a contrib
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz he is in this discord

20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm about to get seriously annoyed
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess see discussion in https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=66425
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> When is it a good idea to ignore the result of write?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When you can't do anything about it
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can assert if you want, there is no recovering from that write failing.
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> 2137?
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> :0
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a long long file
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean asserting is better than ignoring, no?
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> except maybe for the longer code
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1023697879539400734/unknown.png
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm? ^^
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> just something funny I found
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where is that? ^^
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> idk i just found it in a random discord
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i might have used the wrong channel but
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah nevermind, sorry
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's explicitely cast to (void), the standard idiom for ignoring error values
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think the compiler is very wrong about ignoring the explicit (void) cast
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe we should just turn off that warning if they don't intend to fix it
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> could be used for fast testing, so that you don't have to comment a big chunk of code
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> or just write if (true) LOL
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah, you just have to remove the `!` instead of rewriting false or true everytime you change it
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't really know all the situations where it can happen, if we don't assert there is(tm) a chance that it might just work the next call
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why ipv6 only servers?
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont have ipv6 sadly
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my isp is retarded
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could try an IPv6 tunnel
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does ipv6 offer ddos protection?
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why do that?
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> makes no sense to me
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> independent of why we have it, I like that we have a server that offers IPv6
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> hurricane electric offers ipv6
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> but I don't recommend since they block cloudflare which powers a lot of websites
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> who blocks whom? ^^
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, but it's something we haven't tried yet and since I have a new ISP since this week I can connect to ipv6, so I thought good timing
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but only ipv6?
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats bad
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i now cant play there
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe make the client prefer ipv6 over ipv4 when connecting
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Most routers support ipv6 tunnelling
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If we make the server ipv4+ipv6 we don't win anything with regards to DoS
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> When we have proxy support we can have same server and separate ipv4 and ipv6 proxies in front
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I know the solutions I'm trying now aren't ideal, trying to get at least some people to be able to play well
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> rsync: [receiver] write failed on "/mnt/backup2/media/teehistorian/data/rus4/571430c1-76f8-44df-bc91-430bd865b5b8.teehistorian.xz": No space left on device (28)
