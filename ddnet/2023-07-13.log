00:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (1 / 1 + (high_number / x))**high_number tends to e^x as high_number tends to infinity
00:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> hmm
00:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> i wonder how i would write it to make it not an approximation
00:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> short answer: `2.718281828459045`
00:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> long answer: you can't represent e exactly, e is an irrational number
00:16 < bridge_> <Ewan> i see
01:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @learath2 are empty compilation units forbidden by the C standard?
01:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> why is C2183 a thing and why is it only being thrown when you disable MS extensions?
01:15 < bridge_> <learath2> an empty file? It should be fine iirc
01:15 < bridge_> <learath2> Atleast in c99
01:18 < bridge_> <learath2> Well let me clarify, atleast I don't remember reading anything that forbids it
01:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-errors-1/compiler-error-c2183?view=msvc-170&viewFallbackFrom=vs-2017
01:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-errors-1/compiler-error-c2183
01:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> thanks, ms?
01:21 < bridge_> <learath2> MS is very well known for their non compliant C compiler, no?
01:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I need to enable `/Za` for `stdlib.h` not to define `min`/`max` macros
01:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `/Za` means "turn on standard compliance"
01:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but `/Za` also turns on this error
01:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> very funny
01:22 < bridge_> <learath2> Huh, interesting, maybe I remember wrong, let me take a look at the standard
01:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> why can’t you define NOMINMAX before including Windows.h?
01:26 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah I don't see any issue, 5.1.1.2 even has a mention about "A source file that is not empty" implying if it is empty it's fine (IMO)
01:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it comes from `stdlib.h`, not `windows.h` for whatever reason
01:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> took me quite some time to debug where this stupid macro is coming from
01:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> hmm
01:26 < bridge_> <learath2> gcc -E?
01:26 < bridge_> <learath2> msvs should have something similar
01:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> what if you just -D?
01:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://stackoverflow.com/q/26541150/870079
01:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> doesn't help, that strips all macros
01:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `-D` what?
01:27 < bridge_> <learath2> but it should show where includes start
01:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> NOMINMAX
01:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> doesn't in cl.exe
01:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the equivalent flag
01:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> sry, gcc -D. dunno what it is in cl
01:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `stdlib.h` doesn't check for `NOMINMAX`
01:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> hmm
01:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> also `-D`/`/D`
01:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's just /D on cl?
01:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> -D also works
01:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
01:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @learath2 gcc apparently also thinks so; seems like this might actually be something
01:35 < bridge_> <Ewan> they are the same
01:46 < bridge_> <learath2> I actually don't see it, weird
01:46 < bridge_> <learath2> Maybe it's an indirect result of another rule because I took a look at all the sections that I think governs translation
02:02 < bridge_> <learath2> @heinrich5991 apparently it is a real thing, took someone in #C to tell me but 6.9, the syntax for a `translation-unit` is:
02:02 < bridge_> <learath2> ```
02:02 < bridge_> <learath2> translation-unit:
02:02 < bridge_> <learath2>   external-declaration
02:02 < bridge_> <learath2>   translation-unit external-declaration
02:02 < bridge_> <learath2> ```
09:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah. annoying
09:50 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 poggers new docs
09:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: I described the ddnet token protocol and also updated the wireshark-dissector to finally have support for it
09:56 < ChillerDragon> yes im currently reading through it i really appreciate it
09:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nice docs
09:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> thanks
10:07 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1689235639.png
10:07 < ChillerDragon> whats new?
10:09 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> have you recompiled it?
10:09 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i deleted my plugins folder and recompiled master i was expecting to see a TKEN note here
10:09 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it should show the token and the token magic
10:09 < ChillerDragon> did you test it?
10:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
10:10 < ChillerDragon> woah
10:10 < ChillerDragon> how does it not show for me
10:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> send me the pcap pls
10:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> have you fetched and merged master?
10:10 < ChillerDragon> i compiled master
10:10 < ChillerDragon> and fetched yes
10:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and merged?
10:11 < ChillerDragon> ou shit 
10:11 < ChillerDragon> im outdated :D
10:11 < ChillerDragon> forgot to pull -.-
10:11 < ChillerDragon> omg sori
10:12 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1689235929.png
10:12 < ChillerDragon> pog
10:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> \o/
10:13 < ChillerDragon> ok so when docs on the uuid extension thingies?
10:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> these are quite easy :p
10:13 < ChillerDragon> -.-
10:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> message ID 0, put the UUID as bytes after it
10:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> done
10:13 < ChillerDragon> ok nice
10:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> here's your doc :p

10:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (note you still need to set system/game flag in the message ID. you can also observe it in the dissector btw)
10:20 < ChillerDragon> ok yea no idea when i get to that anyways i will first look into my snap crc being wrong again :c
10:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: what are you doing again?
11:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> botting
11:30 < ChillerDragon> no proof
11:30 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 ddnet 0.7 support breaks on crc as soon as the server starts splitting up the snap into multiple messages
11:30 < ChillerDragon> client support*
11:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> your PR?
11:31 < ChillerDragon> yes
11:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> have you verified that you receive the same bytes in total?
11:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> e.g. check length and sha256sum of the complete bytes
11:32 < ChillerDragon> im still on a side quest to get a proper local testing setup
11:33 < ChillerDragon> flooding my localhost with tees
11:33 < ChillerDragon> but sounds like a good debug start :) 
12:10 < ChillerDragon> is uuid considered a alternative to system and game?
12:11 < ChillerDragon> oh no u just said
12:11 < ChillerDragon> a uuid can be system or game i see
12:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what do you need it for? ^^
12:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I wonder in what kind of project this is needed
12:13 < ChillerDragon> bot
12:13 < ChillerDragon> wops wrong chat
12:13 < ChillerDragon> xd
12:13 < ChillerDragon> Im now tinkering with my python network parser
12:14 < ChillerDragon> I want it to not crash for now when it receives a uuid
12:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> why does it crash on unknown packets?
12:14 < ChillerDragon> because i made it do so
12:14 < ChillerDragon> to ensure i can parse all properly
12:15 < ChillerDragon> haven't decided what i want to do when it gets more mature
12:15 < ChillerDragon> if i force users to call try catch or return some error object or silently ignore
12:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you can have that as a parameter
12:15 < ChillerDragon> how to handle errors?
12:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> in tests, you might want to have the error
12:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if it talks to other impls over the network, you likely want to ignore messages that you can't parse
12:16 < ChillerDragon> https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/
12:17 < ChillerDragon> Errors should never pass silently.
12:17 < ChillerDragon> Unless explicitly silenced.
12:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> receiving an unknown message is not an error in the tw protocol
12:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you're supposed to ignore the message
12:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's like an unknown http header
12:18 < ChillerDragon> i see
12:20 < ChillerDragon> quoted you on that :p
12:20 < ChillerDragon> https://gitlab.com/teeworlds-network/twnet_parser/-/issues/2
12:23 < ChillerDragon> A regular client for sure should ignore it. I was just wondering because I want to offer a flexible low level network lib not a client.
12:24 < ChillerDragon> i could see low level http parsers used by high level http clients also handling unknown headers but idk 
12:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but they're never going to error on an unknown one
12:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> almost all http servers also ignore unknown query parameters
12:26 < ChillerDragon> Yea okay
12:27 < ChillerDragon> Im just thinking I might want to use that lib to also investigate unknown traffic like an dissector and would want to see the errors
12:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yea, makes sense
12:27 < ChillerDragon> for example the !p command of the irc bot when i dump some packet dump in here to see if its ddos or something
12:27 < ChillerDragon> i dont want to paste in 512 bytes and then get back its a valid 0.7 packet with two messages
12:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> makes sense
12:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> so two different modes?
12:28 < ChillerDragon> or force users to use try catch to avoid complexity on my side
12:29 < ChillerDragon> but yea a option that by default does not crash would be nicer
12:29 < ChillerDragon> only power users want to crash anyways
13:09 <+breton> hi folks. Could you please help us identify the person who spams across ddnet inviting people to join an infclass server? We do not condone this kind of stuff and would like to ban them on our side too.
13:35 < ChillerDragon> didnt see any
13:35 < ChillerDragon> breton: what servers do you host?
13:35 < ChillerDragon> or why do you care
13:40 <+breton> ChillerDragon: i care about infclass and moderate the server @ 195.123.214.91
13:41 < ChillerDragon> so they do ads for your competition on official ddnet and your server?
13:43 <+breton> they do spam for the server that i moderate
13:43 < ChillerDragon> which makes you look shady
13:43 < ChillerDragon> i see
13:44 < ChillerDragon> just take the free ad :D 
13:46 <+breton> i would rather not
13:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i noticed i didnt have valgrind installed on my gentoo
13:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i installed it and turned on glibc debug symbols
13:56 < ChillerDragon> ou i just realized the crc is shared accross all snap parts
13:59 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1689249563.png
13:59 < ChillerDragon> and once again the dissector carried my ass
14:24 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> i'm so wet
14:25 < ChillerDragon> e wot
14:26 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> it's too hot
14:26 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> 35c right now
14:27 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> i'm soaked in sweat
14:31 < ChillerDragon> ye same here
14:31 < ChillerDragon> but pog progress
14:31 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1689251447.png
14:31 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> aren't german houses very good at staying confortable
14:32 < ChillerDragon> doesnt feel like munich was prepared for the heat
14:32 < ChillerDragon> we dont do ACs here
14:33 < bridge_> <salmonzik> what are you guys doing?
14:33 < bridge_> <salmonzik> (<@749222324980416602_=43hiller=44ragon>)
14:33 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> 👀
14:35 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> guangzhou doesn't have heating. it's very cold for me to live here in the winter even tho my hometown have much colder winter.
14:35 < ChillerDragon> @salmonzik ddnet 0.7 client
14:36 < ChillerDragon> who needs heating when u got a blanket
14:36 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> em
14:36 < bridge_> <TsFreddie> me
14:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> funny thing
14:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> llvm crashes with segfault giving it valid mlir ir
14:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> c++ things you know
14:39 < bridge_> <salmonzik> Interesting, are planned making any drastic changes to gameplay or additions in just terms of code?
14:39 < bridge_> <salmonzik> (<@749222324980416602_=43hiller=44ragon>)
14:40 < ChillerDragon> me? no
14:40 < ChillerDragon> i just wanna allow the ddnet client to join also 0.7 servers
14:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks did u prepare tomorrow friday rust talk
14:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 please become a c++ llvm engineer and fix their segfaults
14:46 < bridge_> <learath2> Segfaults are a part of the joy of using C++. I wouldn't dream of depriving you of them

14:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 😬
14:51 < ChillerDragon> hax
15:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I'll think about a topic later xd
15:17 < bridge_> <deen> If it only gets hot for a day and cools down at night they are great since lots of heavy bricks, and they take a while to get warm. But once you have tropical nights it becomes impossible to cool them down again. The houses are built for "there is only 1 week over 30°C per year, so we can survive it being unbearable for a bit". But this 1 week turned into 3 weeks already.
15:24 < ChillerDragon> ye my flat was still 30 degree at 2 in the night the last few days unless it starts to rain
15:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Now that deen is dad, he has to take climate change double as serious 😎
15:25 < ChillerDragon> haha
15:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> is he dad already
15:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dont live in a house but apartment
15:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and barcelona has stupidly high humidity
15:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u just sweat shitloads
15:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> during morning which is when humidy reaches its high it can go to 95$
15:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 95%
15:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Well the day after tomorrow its 2 months since the msg @ryozuki 
15:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> So it happens very very soon
15:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ok in 5 days lol
15:49 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Hi devs, what do you think about "shadow" mute/spam? I mean the mute/ban without a notification to the target.
15:49 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> I see you want to be clear for the players but let's be fair — we're not capable to deal with all spammers. They use "unfair" techniques and we have to spend a lot of energy fighting with them.
15:49 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> 
15:49 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> For example, I suggest to add text-based shadow mute. This way we can add an advertising message to an auto-mute list and calm down the spammers. It is much easier for them to detect 'clear' bans and 'mutes' and rotate IPs / join another servers. On the other hand, it is hard for us to manually mute all the bots. 
15:49 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Instead on the ddnet level it can be "`for server in all_servers: econ block_message "EVERYONE GO TO THIS SERVER FAST! LET'S MAKE THE MEAT!!!" 600 "new spam"` putting all whoever say this in a 10 minutes shadow mute, so other players won't see any message from those who are muted but the muted players 'll receive proper chat respond from the server.
15:49 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> 
15:49 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> It 'll take time for the spammers to beat it (though I see how to overcome it).
15:51 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Another "unfair" feature is name-based shadow autoban.
15:51 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Use-case: there was a racist person (maybe you
15:51 < bridge_> <learath2> @ryozuki do you know if there is something like `str_utf8_forward` in Rust?
15:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> shadow banning
15:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what does str_utf8_forward
15:52 < bridge_> <learath2> Skips n utf8 codepoints
15:52 < bridge_> <learath2> I guess I could (ab)use an iterator
15:52 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Another "unfair" feature is name-based shadow autoban.
15:52 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Use-case: there was a racist person (maybe you've seen/remember him — `elban`). I banned him, he reconnected from a different IP. And then it repeated like 10 times, until one of us gave up.
15:52 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> He connected with the same username, and noone else used that name, so this could be automated.
15:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 isnt the chars iterator that
15:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dont remember but i think they are graphemes
15:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or smth
15:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.chars
15:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Returns an iterator over the chars of a string slice.
15:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
15:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > As a string slice consists of valid UTF-8, we can iterate through a string slice by char. This method returns such an iterator.
15:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
15:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > It’s important to remember that char represents a Unicode Scalar Value, and might not match your idea of what a ‘character’ is. Iteration over grapheme clusters may be what you actually want. This functionality is not provided by Rust’s standard library, check crates.io instead.
15:53 < bridge_> <learath2> Doubt they are graphemes, graphemes are extremely hard to decode, require a massive table
15:53 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah regular codepoints is what I want anyway
15:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> then its that ye
15:53 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Another "unfair" feature is name-based shadow autoban.
15:53 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Use-case: there was a racist person (maybe you've seen/remember him — `elban`). I banned him, he reconnected from a different IP. And then it repeated like 10 times, until one of us gave up.
15:53 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> He connected with the same username, and noone else used that name, so this could be automated.
15:53 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> "Shadow" part here is the idea to make the spammer spend more time on realizing what is going on. We can just ignore/drop his network packets without a reply.
15:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u can make the iterator peekable()
15:54 < bridge_> <learath2> I need to keep track of my byte position through the string aswell
15:54 < bridge_> <learath2> So I guess a peekable char_indices
15:54 < bridge_> <learath2> Was just wondering if there was a more non-iterator way to do it 😄
15:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.char_indices
15:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i mean good thing about iterator is u dont have to allocate a vec
15:56 < bridge_> <learath2> Problem with iterator is when I read a character there is no going back without making it peekable, but with a peekable iterator I can't use all the cool functions like `.skip_while()`
15:56 < bridge_> <learath2> Anyway, I'll just do one loop and not use the cool functions I guess
15:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 check if itertools has what u want
15:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://docs.rs/itertools/latest/itertools/
15:57 < bridge_> <learath2> Ah, I'd forgotten it was a thing in rust aswell
15:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://docs.rs/itertools/latest/itertools/trait.Itertools.html#method.peeking_take_while
15:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it has some take whiles
15:58 < bridge_> <learath2> Exactly what I'm looking for
15:59 < bridge_> <learath2> Thanks Rustman
15:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> np
16:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> btw a neat thing i discovered recentely
16:00 < bridge_> <learath2> I wonder if there is any overhead fo peekable, it should be free for iterating arrays if specialized enough
16:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if u have a iterator over options
16:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u can filter all nones with .flatten()
16:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its pretty neat
16:00 < bridge_> <learath2> Ah yep, I've used this before
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```rust
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> impl<K, V, S> MyHashmap<K, V, S>
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> where
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     K: Eq + Hash,
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     S: BuildHasher,
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> {
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     fn resize(&mut self) {
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         let new_storage: Vec<Option<(K, V)>> =
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki>             (0..self.storage.len() * 2).map(|_| None).collect();
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         // Replace the storage with the new one, so we can use self.x methods to rehash.
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         let old_storage = std::mem::replace(&mut self.storage, new_storage);
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         self.len = 0;
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         for (k, v) in old_storage.into_iter().flatten() {
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki>             self.insert(k, v);
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki>         }
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     }
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> }
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i used it on my blog post
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and i discovered this thanks to...
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> clippy!
16:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
16:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Did it get Fame?
16:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> What was the Reddit link again
16:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it reached frontpage for some time
16:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/14vtc8f/implementing_a_simple_hashmap_in_rust/
16:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it has some comments
16:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but im lazy rn to address them
16:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> one is rly nice
16:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the one mentioning the cycles
16:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1129050353069998191/image.png
16:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> these are the stats
16:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> from reddit
16:04 < bridge_> <learath2> @ryozuki any idea what the best way would be to consume all?
16:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> google search
16:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1129050886858080349/image.png
16:05 < bridge_> <learath2> I don't need what I take technically
16:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> consume?
16:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> skip?
16:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> technically collect consumes all xd
16:05 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> what does this do
16:06 < bridge_> <learath2> Yes, but there is no `peeking_skip` so I need to discard what I get from `peeking_take_while`
16:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> resizes the hashmap
16:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> using mem replace for minimum copies
16:08 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> weird
16:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dont get it much
16:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe example
16:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> whats weird
16:10 < bridge_> <learath2> ```rust
16:10 < bridge_> <learath2> fn foo(s: &str) {
16:10 < bridge_> <learath2>   let mut it = s.char_indices().peekable();
16:10 < bridge_> <learath2>   it.peeking_take_while(|(u, c)| { c.is_whitespace() })
16:10 < bridge_> <learath2> }
16:10 < bridge_> <learath2> ```
16:10 < bridge_> <learath2> I now need to consume all of the new iterator `peeking_take_while` returned
16:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah
16:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dont u simply want to filter?
16:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> tell me what u want to do with the chars
16:11 < bridge_> <learath2> No, I technically just need `peeking_skip` I need to skip all whitespace without consuming the first non-whitespace character
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> filter doesnt consume non filtered iirc
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> `it.filter(|x| x.is_whitespace() )` with this u have a iterator over non whitespace chars
16:12 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> hi
16:14 < ChillerDragon> coberfita
16:14 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> can we have a public archive for reports since its private rn (unless its already public and i havent found it)
16:14 < bridge_> <learath2> I had this idea aswell but I can't just iterate over non whitespace, I need to know where the whitespaces are. I'm rewriting my lexer
16:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why u writing a lexer
16:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> use logos
16:14 < ChillerDragon> why you writing a hashmap
16:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://docs.rs/logos/latest/logos/
16:14 < bridge_> <learath2> This I why I asked an XY question instead of telling you exactly what I'm doing 😄
16:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
16:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> hmm
16:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe some fold where the acc is a storage of whitespace  indexes or smth
16:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but logos will be faster than anything u write by hand
16:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> atleast thats what they claim
16:15 < ChillerDragon> ethos
16:15 < ChillerDragon> pathos

16:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cute logo too
16:16 < bridge_> <learath2> I'm just trying to get more comfy with rust, using a lexer generator won't help
16:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> just make 2 iterators?
16:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> one for whitespaces one for none
16:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or simply do a for loop
16:16 < ChillerDragon> ryo send like on gh issue pls
16:16 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/PathosEthosLogos/Leave-a-message-beep/issues/1
16:16 < ChillerDragon> i need attention from this guy
16:17 < ChillerDragon> he creator of logos
16:17 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> idk im just dumb
16:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 ur gonna need to save the whitespace indexes so
16:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> make a hashset and save the indexes there
16:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well
16:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a vec
16:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the indexes will be unique anyway xd im dum
16:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no u just need to learn rust
16:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 what about https://docs.rs/itertools/latest/itertools/fn.multipeek.html
16:20 < bridge_> <learath2> I don't need to peek further than one
16:20 < bridge_> <learath2> On a scale of 0-10, how ugly is just doing `.for_each(|_| {})` on the `PeekingTakeWhile`?
16:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i usually use for loops inteast
16:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> instead
16:21 < bridge_> <learath2> So just a for loop with an empty body?
16:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> whait
16:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> thats ugly
16:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im still confused
16:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk if im an idiot
16:22 < bridge_> <learath2> Or I guess I could do this the ancient way, just not have it peekable and have one big state machine handle everything
16:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> you want to save all whitespace ranges?
16:22 < bridge_> <learath2> Noo, it's probably my ancient coding style that doesn't match with your mental image of what I'm doing
16:22 < bridge_> <learath2> I want to skip the whitespace, nothing more
16:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but then why no filter?
16:23 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> wtf LOL
16:23 < bridge_> <learath2> I want to skip the whitespace until the first non-whitespace, then I need to do other stuff that require me to no longer ignore the whitespace
16:23 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> @_voxeldoesart did u make the new banners in welcome channel
16:23 < bridge_> <learath2> If I have a filtered iterator I can't unfilter it after I hit the first non-whitespace
16:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ahh
16:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.skip_while

16:27 < bridge_> <murpi> Yes, just fixed that
16:27 < bridge_> <learath2> Oh, skip_while returns an iterator aswell, I didn't think of that
16:28 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> ok it looks good
16:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @murpi u dont link the wiki anywhere :PES3_Cry:
16:28 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> @murpi btw
16:28 < bridge_> <murpi> 👀
16:29 < bridge_> <murpi> It's linked in multiple places
16:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @murpi i also host this
16:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://codedoc.ddnet.org/
16:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh u link it
16:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im blind
16:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> (the wiki)
16:30 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> not yet
16:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @murpi do only admins see complains or all mods?
16:30 < bridge_> <murpi> Just admins
16:30 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> mods would abuse
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ok nice
16:31 < bridge_> <louis.place> add content creator role 😎
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u could also add this on the for developers section: https://edgarluque.com/categories/ddracenetwork/
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> totally not self inserted
16:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but imho its good for incoming devs
16:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :blobwhistle:
16:32 < bridge_> <louis.place> also wiki curator color would be cool
16:32 < bridge_> <louis.place> i agree actually
16:32 < bridge_> <louis.place> add more posts though
16:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye
16:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i added one last time
16:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> about UI
16:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what could be next
16:32 < bridge_> <murpi> it'd override the Dev color though
16:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nooo
16:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dev is important
16:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for me
16:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its sad discord doesnt detach color priority from role priority
16:33 < bridge_> <louis.place> did u ever finish adidng map tiles?
16:33 < bridge_> <murpi> @ryozuki Maybe pin all the useful resources here?
16:33 < bridge_> <louis.place> iirc last time it wasnt complete
16:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i never made  a post about that iirc
16:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i know how to do it cuz i did telegun so its a good idea
16:34 < bridge_> <louis.place> there was a link about it somewhere on ur site
16:34 < bridge_> <louis.place> or a mention
16:34 < bridge_> <louis.place> but no post
16:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @murpi pin this
16:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Development#External_resources
16:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or should it be without the #
16:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Development
16:36 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> @cyberfighter im gonna do the concepts and stuff in clip studio paint and then probably hand it to someone like ravie or pipou so they can make it look game accurate
16:36 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> wtf is studio paint
16:37 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> clip studio paint
16:37 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> my art program
16:37 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> the art program i use
16:51 < bridge_> <louis.place> is the skin channel discord integration finished?
17:06 < ChillerDragon> Did anyone ever use the client console command ``callvote`` ? Seems kinda cool but super unused.
17:07 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> yes i used it a day ago
17:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i used it a second ago
17:08 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> btw chiller ur switch spectate command is good
17:08 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> when add it to official ddnet
17:08 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> I used it a few times a while ago. It is not really convenient for immediate use but works fine with binds or scripts (econ).
17:13 < ChillerDragon> wowo i have been missing out
17:13 < ChillerDragon> i could also see that being super helpful on city servers where vote options are menus to bind something
17:14 < ChillerDragon> @cyberFighter yea i also use it from time to time i forgot why i never prd it to ddnet maybe because i was too lazy to clean up the code to get it merged
17:15 < bridge_> <quarpit> wtf

17:23 < bridge_> <learath2> @ryozuki `assert_eq!(lexer.get_token(), Ok("hello"));`
17:23 < bridge_> <learath2> `fn Lexer::get_token() -> Result<String, Error>`
17:23 < bridge_> <learath2> 
17:23 < bridge_> <learath2> Is the correct thing to do here just doing `.to_string()` on the `"hello"`? I thought `String`s could be compared with `&str` np
17:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no
17:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> do the opposite
17:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> as_str() on the token
17:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> map it ofc
17:24 < bridge_> <learath2> It's in a result though, I'd need to map
17:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> whats wrong with map
17:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> map on a result is not lazy, u get another  result
17:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe .as_ref works but probs not here
17:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lexer.get_token().as_ref()
17:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @murpi why don't I see  the first channel in #announcements
17:26 < bridge_> <learath2> Actually can you even map this? Can't get that ref out of the mapping closure, no?
17:27 < bridge_> <murpi> because of bugs and debugging on production servers is hell and takes forever
17:27 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> How is info stored inside demo files? And where can I find how kill messages are stored inside them?
17:27 < bridge_> <murpi> should be visible now
17:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> try it
17:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u can most probs
17:30 < bridge_> <learath2> ```rust
17:30 < bridge_> <learath2> error[E0515]: cannot return reference to function parameter `s`
17:30 < bridge_> <learath2>    --> src/lexer.rs:105:48
17:30 < bridge_> <learath2>     |
17:30 < bridge_> <learath2> 105 |         assert_eq!(lexer.get_token().map(|s| { s.as_str() }), Ok("a'b'bb"));
17:30 < bridge_> <learath2>     |                                                ^^^^^^^^^^ returns a reference to data owned by the current function
17:30 < bridge_> <learath2> ```
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> true true
17:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> just save the get_token in a var
17:31 < bridge_> <robyt3> Demos contain the snapshots and messages that the client has received from the server
17:31 < bridge_> <learath2> That doubles the size of my test function to avoid allocating a couple strings 😄
17:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but it doesnt allocate
17:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
17:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its ur call
17:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> to_string is shorter but allocs
17:32 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> I see. I found a strange bug where teamkills don't bring over the tees
17:32 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1129072947164889128/image.png
17:33 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> I'm trying to fix it but I'm not sure where it could be located.
17:34 < bridge_> <robyt3> Maybe it's related to #3795 or #4545
17:34 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3795
17:34 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4545
17:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> Maybe the demo doesn't contain all the information because recording starting too late
17:35 < bridge_> <robyt3> Maybe the demo doesn't contain all the information because recording started too late
17:36 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> Oh dang. Well I'm going to publish my fix for #6838 right now, because I think this is too complex for the time I have LOL
17:36 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6838
17:38 < bridge_> <learath2> My obsession with using less memory is usually restricted to runtime, but it does sort of annoy me
17:41 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> I'll post this issue on github for futureproof purposes
17:41 < bridge_> <learath2> `.as_ref()` doesn't but `.as_deref()` does, someone on the rust dc gave me the tip 😄
17:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> as true
17:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh*
17:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i forgot about it
17:49 < bridge_> <learath2> I can not believe this, I wrote a lexer in one try without any issues that can parse a ridiculous string like `"hello w\"o\"rl'd' a'\"a\"a'a a\"'b'b\"b \"a a\" 'b b'"`
17:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 ping me if u have trouble with setup 😬
17:50 < bridge_> <learath2> tell me where find the key for the skin thing
17:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the key for the skindatabase crew role?
17:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or the password?
17:51 < bridge_> <learath2> the username and pw for the http auth thing
17:52 < bridge_> <learath2> I guess it's somewhere in nginx configs now that I think about it
17:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @ravie_ravie pm learath the user and pw pls
17:52 < bridge_> <learath2> I didn't think it was just basic_auth
17:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> for skin database
17:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> not?
17:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rust power
17:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well that sucks xd
17:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this lexer also has no segfaults
17:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no out of bounds
17:52 < bridge_> <learath2> I don't think you'd like what I created, it's very oldschool
17:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its ok
17:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if it doesnt have  unsafe
17:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ur lexer is memory safe tm
17:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lexers are prone to segfaults iirc
17:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in cpp xd
17:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> where can i check
17:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and what does clippy say
17:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :troll:
17:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i know heinrich disagrees, but clippy often makes ur code idiomatic
17:54 < bridge_> <learath2> https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=9e857abceed853aac445b547371b4c2d
17:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> does it rewrite code even at the cost of perf?
17:55 < bridge_> <learath2> I didn't do fmt or clippy on it yet, let's see if it hates anything
17:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> clippy doesnt rewrite code as is
17:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and clippy has lints for perfomance
17:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it makes ur code faster usually
17:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: how can i demoativate you? XD
17:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> by pointing out perf errors
17:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but why should heinrich disagree xd
17:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#?groups=perf
17:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i soon want to use all clippy warnings too
17:55 < bridge_> <learath2> huh, clippy doesn't complain
17:55 < bridge_> <learath2> Maybe I'm holding it wrong
17:56 < bridge_> <learath2> how do you run clippy?
17:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 try this `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
17:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if u want to be daring
17:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> do
17:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ` `cargo clippy -- -D warnings -D clippy::nursery``
17:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> more daring
17:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> `cargo clippy -- -D warnings -D clippy::nursery -D clippy::pedantic`
17:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i see, but welcome now looks fancy af, good job
17:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> `cargo clippy -- -D warnings -D clippy::nursery -D clippy::pedantic clippy::all`
17:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> `cargo clippy -- -D warnings -D clippy::nursery -D clippy::pedantic -D clippy::all`
17:57 < bridge_> <murpi> Thanks 🙂

17:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> fix fix
17:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> read the eq thing
18:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but most probs u need eq
18:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or makes sense*
18:00 < bridge_> <learath2> Read the Eq thing, it doesn't really matter for now, but no reason not to derive that aswell

18:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 have you looked for .htaccess inside www/skins/edit
18:01 < bridge_> <learath2> Do you like the way I wrote it? Would you do it differently?
18:01 < bridge_> <learath2> let me look
18:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i guess u dont have pub methods? otherwise it would tell u to add lots of docs XD
18:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh
18:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i didnt check ur code  yet
18:02 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah, I'll make it pub and it'll annoy me about that
18:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> was making weird shenanigans at work
18:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> allocating a hashmap in rust and using it in mlir
18:02 < bridge_> <learath2> `get_token` is self documenting, no? It gets a token 😄
18:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```rust
18:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> #[no_mangle]
18:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> pub unsafe extern "C" fn blabla__alloc_dict() -> *mut std::ffi::c_void {
18:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     let map: Box<HashMap<[u8; 32], NonNull<()>>> = Box::default();
18:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     Box::into_raw(map) as _
18:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> }
18:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
18:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :justatest:
18:02 < bridge_> <learath2> it has unsafe in it, you are officially exiled from rust
18:03 < bridge_> <learath2> no such luck, let me check the nginx conf
18:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> LETS GO
18:04 < bridge_> <learath2> found it
18:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> EPIC
18:04 < bridge_> <learath2> Oh it seems everyone has their own key
18:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> uff, but as long its basic auth
18:04 < bridge_> <learath2> Hm, I guess the bot can get a key and we can use the #📬submit-skins channel as a sort of audit log
18:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 btw if only ppl with skin db crew role can write in #📬submit-skins , u also have ot give that role to the bot
18:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> (write stuff other than skins)
18:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if u need a name for the bot:
18:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ✪✪Net
18:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
18:06 < bridge_> <learath2> It'll be `YAYADDB`
18:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> even better xD
18:07 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> SkinDB makes more sense
18:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> CSGOSkinTrade
18:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 why allocate a string tho? why not keep track of a range
18:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> start end idx
18:09 < bridge_> <learath2> That was my initial idea, but I hadn't thought about quotes, I need to be discarding them
18:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh i see
18:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> btw if u  want ur code to be panicless, use .get instead of slicing
18:10 < bridge_> <learath2> Aha, that's a good idea
18:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 btw does the upload bot already check if a 256x128 skin is present?
18:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> like can u upload 512x256 only, or does it throw an error?
18:10 < bridge_> <learath2> The current bot? Don't we disable that part of it when we deploy yours?
18:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no
18:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> mine is fancy af ez upload only
18:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 btw in ur test u dotn need to escape
18:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```rust
18:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> let mut lexer = Lexer::new(r#"a "b" sadsa "#);
18:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
18:11 < bridge_> <murpi> It does:
18:11 < bridge_> <murpi> ```py
18:11 < bridge_> <murpi> def check_image_resolution(message: discord.Message):
18:11 < bridge_> <murpi>     for attachment in message.attachments:
18:11 < bridge_> <murpi>         if (attachment.height != 128 or attachment.width != 256) and (attachment.height != 256 or attachment.width != 512):
18:11 < bridge_> <murpi>             return (False, 'One of the attached skins does not have the correct image resolution. Resolution must be 256x128, and if possible provide a 512x256 along with the 256x128')
18:11 < bridge_> <murpi>     return (True, None)```
18:12 < bridge_> <learath2> Wait, it doesn't check anything?
18:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i added a few checks
18:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but murpi told me it also checks
18:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> to me that doesnt look like it prevents 512x256 only tho does it?
18:12 < bridge_> <learath2> Two bots need to coordinate to ensure proper operation, that's ddnet engineering 😄
18:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs the database refuses to upload this
18:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well i think i check all stuff except this
18:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and i only noticed that the database script refuses it by luck
18:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs actually the database _can_ handle hd skins only
18:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but we disallowed this purposely
18:13 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> if you make it SkinDB can you make the icon this? (It's the same tee design from #📍info
18:13 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1129083195510509608/SkinDB_Logo.png
18:13 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> true i agree with you voxel
18:14 < bridge_> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks can you link me the source again btw?
18:14 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> holy shit its the mega tee @_voxeldoesart
18:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 also in worst case the skin will simply not be uploaded, nothing more
18:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/discord-skin-upload-bot
18:14 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> holy shit its the mega tee @_voxeldoesart (i meant to ping keb what a brainfart)
18:17 < bridge_> <murpi> It prevents all images not equal to 256x128 or 512x256
18:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but the db would also need no hd always
18:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> not hd only skins
18:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ^ @learath2 git pull xd
18:26 < bridge_> <louis.place> is having accepted pull requests the only criteria for dev role 👀
18:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lous like lynn inc
18:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> which did 1 commit to get the role and done
18:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> imho u should atleast be semi active  xd
18:27 < bridge_> <louis.place> maybe if theres only 512x256 the bot can just downscale it
18:27 < bridge_> <louis.place> role collector
18:28 < bridge_> <louis.place> like me
18:28 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> I think it should work the same way as the Discord Dev badge
18:28 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> where if you don't make a valid PR in a month the dev role gets removed
18:28 < bridge_> <louis.place> what even was her pr
18:28 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> (i still get to keep mine because i did a bug fix ha ha!)
18:28 < bridge_> <louis.place> no
18:28 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> ok fine
18:28 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> yeah why doesnt louis have dev role wtf
18:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd, i doubt @ravie_ravie likes automatic downscale, so i better wont touch it now
18:29 < bridge_> <louis.place> my prs were pretty ez
18:29 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> same-ish
18:29 < bridge_> <louis.place> as long as u use correct downscaler idt it matters
18:29 < bridge_> <louis.place> and if a skin guy rly cares for good quality they can uplaod 2 vers
18:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks im gonna make a pr to ur crate
18:30 < bridge_> <louis.place> not
18:30 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> wdym
18:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> now comes the rust gang xD
18:30 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> I do, just use a good interpolation
18:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but anyway, for now its ok to not do it right?
18:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i prefer to finally have the bot running
18:30 < bridge_> <louis.place> yes
18:30 < bridge_> <louis.place> it shouldnt be hard to add later anyways
18:31 < bridge_> <louis.place> is it a separate bot?
18:31 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> uploading one file is always better than 2
18:31 < bridge_> <louis.place> one of us could probably add it later anyways
18:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what do u mean?
18:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the skin upload bot is an own bot
18:31 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> also better to have a consistent way to downscale them than however someone decides to do it
18:32 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> someone might pick a terrible interpolation or somehow introduce artifacts
18:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> first of all i'd like to have feedback if u even like the bot xD
18:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> except me nobody ever used it xD
18:32 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> duude i LOVE the idea of not having to download like 30 skins to manually upload them
18:32 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> this is going to be worth it
18:33 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> where is the bot?
18:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then lets cheer @learath2 
18:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> show him love in his quest to start the bot after his exams
18:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> learath is setting it up rn
18:33 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> ah thought I was supposed to give feedback on something already
18:34 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> yay!

18:34 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> "noby to the rescue" is something I never expected deen to say LOL
18:34 < bridge_> <learath2> um massive roadblock
18:34 < bridge_> <learath2> ddnet.tw ran out of disk space 😄
18:35 < bridge_> <louis.place> delete some maps
18:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> why do u even read these issues xD
18:35 < bridge_> <louis.place> ive got some suggestions
18:35 < bridge_> <louis.place> :troll:
18:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> are u subscribed to whole repo?
18:35 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> because im bored and reading issues is kinda fun
18:35 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> NO WAY XD rip
18:35 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> no i just kinda    read new ones
18:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks weird mutex usage
18:36 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> "yeah let's upload all bad skins, we have plenty of space"
18:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> where
18:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```rust
18:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki>  let mut skins_to_upload = item.skins_to_upload.clone();
18:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki>                 let upload_lock = data.get_mut::<SkinUploads>().unwrap().upload_lock.clone();
18:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki>                 drop(data);
18:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
18:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki>                 let _g = upload_lock.lock().await;
18:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
18:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a lock around nothing
18:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its not rly idiomatic
18:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> Arc<Mutex<()>>
18:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i complained about heinrich
18:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well its only that only one person uploads skins at a time
18:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so it holds no data
18:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but i think ur code might be uglier
18:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> its no lock around nothing
18:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u also make insanely big methods
18:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xdd
18:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it locks the whole process
18:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah ok
18:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i dont usually do that
18:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i wrote that bot to have it, not to win a coding contest xD
18:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
18:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 did u try rm -rf /*
18:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> should free some space
18:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> as seen on chillers VM
18:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what data even fills the storage?
18:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ops wait
18:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> now
18:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh wait
18:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u had vscode files
18:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
18:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> got wtf is that
18:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1129091129103630437/image.png
18:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its to read the number easier
18:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno xD
18:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i can revert that xd
18:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i guess this number aint meaninful to read anyway
18:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> its a discord id for emojis
18:46 < bridge_> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks can it use a .env file?
18:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the bot?
18:46 < bridge_> <learath2> yes
18:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, i guess not
18:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well actually
18:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno xD
18:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i simply never tested
18:47 < bridge_> <learath2> can you sneak a `dotenv::dotenv()` somewhere?
18:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so does the file need to be actively read?
18:47 < bridge_> <learath2> No, just read it once at the start
18:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yeah ok
18:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ok i fixed the pr
18:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> god
18:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://crates.io/crates/dotenv
18:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> this?
18:48 < bridge_> <learath2> yep
18:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 3 years not updated. thats what i call stable lib
18:49 < bridge_> <learath2> it's a trivial thing, doubt it needs updating much
18:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 @jupeyy_keks no
18:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> use dotenvy
18:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://crates.io/crates/dotenvy
18:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> A well-maintained fork of the dotenv crate.
18:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
18:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> This crate is the suggested alternative for dotenv in security advisory RUSTSEC-2021-0141.
18:50 < bridge_> <learath2> Sure, use that one
18:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
18:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ok wait
18:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
18:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki 
18:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ```rs
18:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if matches!(&skin.database, SkinToUploadDB::Normal) {
18:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ```
18:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> would u use that macro?
18:53 < bridge_> <learath2> I don't remember how to invite bots 😄
18:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it doesnt even look better to me xD
18:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> discord developers
18:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then it generates a link on oauth
18:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye
18:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i mean its more verbose
18:53 < bridge_> <learath2> Ah, does it need any scopes?
18:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so why xd
18:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> permissions:
18:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> send messages
18:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> edit messages (for reactions only)
18:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk about that
18:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ah scopes
18:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> only bot
18:55 < bridge_> <learath2> Hm how do I compute permissions?
18:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well honestly some of these fixes are really good, some are rather meh xD
18:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1129093922707218462/image.png
18:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lmao now u can invite my bot
18:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> tell me which u dont want and ill fix it
18:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> why u so tryhard rn xD
18:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> can i merge this for v2 or smth xD
18:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> how am i tryhard lol XD
18:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im just asking cuz i want this merged and forget
18:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and its ur project
18:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im not gonna push to much to do things my way
18:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> my way is: obey clippy
18:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> tbh i dont even care, but i dunno if i have clippy set up
18:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> my pr doesnt pass clippy pedantic
18:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i just dont want the warnings to spam me, if github auto parses them or smth xD
18:58 < bridge_> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks how does it find the #📬submit-skins channel?
18:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> due to ur locks, it suggest to put some early drops somewhere
18:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but its more than a simple fix
18:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it does not require that, bcs it doesnt create publicly visible messages
18:58 < bridge_> <learath2> 👍
18:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks u can set in 1 click a rust action with clippy
18:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> as long it doesnt change behavior i dont care 😄
18:59 < bridge_> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks can you give it a go? @SkinDB is here
18:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> nice, i am not in skin database crew
18:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> maybe  @ravie_ravie wants to test?
18:59 < bridge_> <learath2> You are for now
18:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> oh ok
19:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @ravie_ravie what skin can i upload?
19:00 < bridge_> <learath2> Pink jupstar looks wrong
19:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
19:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> thats the thing, idk enough of the code to change  it with certainty
19:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cuz i didnt look at it that much xd
19:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so i didnt do it
19:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 soon we are truly lgbtr
19:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @ravie_ravie ping me when u decided
19:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rainbow dev chat
19:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so
19:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks wat u gonna do
19:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i need a special role
19:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the rust spreader
19:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nice
19:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> closer to perfection
19:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> debatable xD
19:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
19:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i simply dont care enough
19:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
19:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> thats good
19:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. this
19:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1129096566339293334/image.png
19:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dont care which style
19:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> to me its the same xD
19:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think the let involves a drop of the inner error
19:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> while the is_err doesnt
19:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cuz u dont fetch it
19:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but im not sure
19:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> as if the compiler doesnt see through this xD
19:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
19:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @Skin Database Crew
19:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im sur echecking a boolean is cheaper
19:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> than pattern matching
19:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> else i just upload one with many upvotes 😬
19:08 < bridge_> <learath2> @ryozuki accessing one past the end of a string is illegal in rust right?
19:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> there is nothing there
19:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> wdym
19:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
19:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> r u doign unsafe
19:09 < bridge_> <learath2> In C/C++ you are allowed to hold a pointer to one past the end of an array, it's explicitly not ub as long as you don't dereference it
19:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a string doesnt have end as is, just the length of allocated memory
19:09 < bridge_> <learath2> I guess I could check at the very start if the index is > len
19:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a string is a slice which is a ptr, usize, usize
19:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ptr, length capacity
19:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> hmm u need to check the ptr docs then
19:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this has nothing to do with strings
19:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki do /upload and tell me if u have no permissions
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.offset
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Safety
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > If any of the following conditions are violated, the result is Undefined Behavior:
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> >     Both the starting and resulting pointer must be either in bounds or one byte past the end of the same allocated object.
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> >     The computed offset, in bytes, cannot overflow an isize.
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> >     The offset being in bounds cannot rely on “wrapping around” the address space. That is, the infinite-precision sum, in bytes must fit in a usize.
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 u can be one byte past
19:12 < bridge_> <learath2> There is no null termination though, right?
19:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nope
19:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the ptr thing is about pointers
19:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> upload where what
19:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> how
19:13 < bridge_> <learath2> I guess I'll do the responsible adult developer thing and check the length
19:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> im too impatient, so i'll do it now with one of coke, since it will ping the author its better to test with ppl i know xdd
19:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> discord command
19:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ./upload
19:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 u can do wrapping_offset
19:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but u shouldnt
19:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the author doesnt recommend using it
19:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its the safe counterpart to offset
19:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why u want to be one past tho?
19:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 worked, thanks
19:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> HYPE
19:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1129098676338446507/image.png
19:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> epic
19:15 < bridge_> <learath2> I'm just thinking about where to park the last offset in the lexer, I need to have a last history entry
19:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @Skin Database Crew after /upload the bot should be self explaining, else ping me and ask
19:15 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but are u using unsafe now?
19:15 < bridge_> <learath2> In C/C++ I'd have the last offset point to the null character
19:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @learath2 u can remove my role
19:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i want purple back
19:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> XD
19:15 < bridge_> <learath2> No no, I'm just considering my options, I don't think I'll go with that
19:15 < bridge_> <learath2> I almost accidentally kicked you
19:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 😬
19:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> XD
19:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬 😬
19:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @Skin Database Crew after /upload the bot should be self explaining, else ping me and askf (use the command in #📬submit-skins  only)
19:17 < bridge_> <louis.place> rly nice bot, thank you!!
19:18 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> did you see the icon suggestion
19:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ping murpi with the msg
19:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> learath has done enough for today
19:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> deserved retirement
19:19 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> @murpi can you make the icon of the SkinDB bot this
19:19 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1129099841448984607/SkinDB_Logo.png
19:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 「For Developers」
19:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @murpi nice! using japanese
19:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> they are obsessed with these symbols for titles
19:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
19:21 < bridge_> <learath2> Ah, I can put it at `len(self.str)` that'll get me an empty slice np
19:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 「Rust Development さび 」
19:22 < bridge_> <learath2> I forgor you can have `s[i..i]`
19:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and i..
19:22 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> oop
19:22 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> XDDDDDDDD
19:23 < bridge_> <learath2> yes, I just forgor the start and end can be same
19:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @murpi would be cool to extend #✉-create-a-ticket or maybe another channel to report bugs in standarized way?
19:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what happened?
19:23 < bridge_> <learath2> hm, I did change it but it didn't really update
19:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> iot does
19:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> restart
19:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i see it too
19:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> without restart
19:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1129100969322483722/image.png
19:24 < bridge_> <learath2> I guess linux discord is just garbage
19:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i use web
19:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> on linux
19:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> me2
19:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> also on linux just to name it again
19:41 < bridge_> <learath2> @ryozuki I have a question, can I get rust to crash on an error? It exits very cleanly and I don't get to catch it in gdb 😄
19:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1129105455428407497/image.png
19:42 < bridge_> <learath2> It doesn't even panic tho 😄
19:43 < bridge_> <learath2> The error goes all the way to main, `fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()>`, and that just exits normally
19:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
19:44 < bridge_> <learath2> With exit code 1 ok, but still 😄
19:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if u add errors but not errors handling xD
19:46 < bridge_> <learath2> I guess this is why everyone is using packages like eyre and color_eyre, to get backtraces at all
19:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> unwrap?
19:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> panic!
19:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah
19:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> thats the problem with anyhow
19:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think eyre
19:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> has backtraces
19:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> color_eyre

20:22 < bridge_> <scar17off> works for me
20:23 < jxsl13> no less stress*
20:25 < bridge_> <majefamous> check inbox
20:25 < bridge_> <majefamous> (@jupeyy_keks)
20:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> thanks, you pm'd a fake account that was created by the discord bridge
20:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
20:28 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> @jupeyy_keks what are the arguments for uploading a skin?
20:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ./upload
20:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the msg that will be created should tell you everything.. the msg also gets updated
20:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> as soon as u react to a skin
20:29 < bridge_> <majefamous> The management of this company is simply the best and they have shown to be reliable
20:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @zwelf2 can u ban this lost soul? ^
20:30 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> ah I see, so we use /upload at the start and then use reactions?
20:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yep, then check if everything is correct
20:30 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> I thought it's something like /upload [skin] [database]
20:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> its meant to make it ez 😉
20:30 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> yeah nice
20:31 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> is it ✅ ☑️ to upload or something else?
20:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 🆗  button
20:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> to upload all selected skins
20:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u basically batch the upload first
20:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> to check for errors etc.
20:31 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> yeah but I mean, which reaction to add for normal or community db?
20:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> doesnt the msg say?
20:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i think blue for community
20:32 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> I don't see any info, I might be being blind
20:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> after /upload
20:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> there is a msg
20:32 < jxsl13> hm, how was the chatgpt game called where you try to get it to reveal some secret phrase
20:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> are u on some old discord? 😄
20:32 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> idk it updates when it wants to, so like everytime it launches
20:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @ravie_ravie
20:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1129118290803953869/image.png
20:33 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> I just see this
20:33 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1129118299599425598/image.png
20:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> dont u see this?
20:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ah u have to execute the upload
20:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> command
20:33 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> ah
20:33 < jxsl13> re:scam does not exist anymore, sadly.
20:33 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> the whole thing is fancier than I thought xD
20:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i wasted 5h of my sunday for this 😬
20:38 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> ah but for now we have to manually correct licenses I guess
20:38 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> I asked murpi to make the other bot require correct formatting without a dash after CC but older messages still have it wrong
20:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> mh yeah
20:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well all skins have it wrong lmao
20:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> maybe its easier to rewrite the skins.json
20:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://skins.ddnet.org/skin/skins.json
20:41 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> I recently went over the whole database and fixed this on existing skins
20:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> for the new bot u'd need to edit the discord messages
20:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if u have edit permissions for msgs
20:42 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> it's not really a problem to fix on a few skins
20:42 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> but the sooner we force the correct format the less work it will be
20:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/07/13/Rust-1.71.0.html
20:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 @jupeyy_keks rust update time
20:46 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> rust update :poggers2:
20:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @ravie_ravie btw the bot times out after 2min afk
20:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> just that u are aware
20:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> the msg it posts always tells u the current state
20:48 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> yeah I saw
20:48 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> seems a little short tho
20:48 < bridge_> <murpi> @ravie_ravie I haven't deployed the license thing yet. Did you talk to heinrich?
20:49 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> yeah he's not sure if we should allow more restrictive licenses, but we should at least fix the format on current ones
20:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> mh yeah, probably bit short
20:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> also notice discord has a char limit of 2000. so the bot gets less verbose if u add too many skins at once.. its not a bug xd
20:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> (this does not affect the after upload msg)
20:50 < bridge_> <murpi> I'll fix the old ones then and wait until you and heinrich come to an agreement
20:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> open only
20:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ddnet
20:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :ddnet:
20:51 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> it just might take a moment to take a look at the preview of each skin and make a decision, could take longer than 2 mins if there are a lot of skins
20:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well its 2mins of being inactive
20:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah i can increase that
20:52 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> ah nevermind then
20:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks Const-initialized thread locals
20:52 < bridge_> <ravie_ravie> thought we have 2 mins to complete the upload
20:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dont like global variables
20:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u cant convince me
20:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xD speedrun

21:33 < ChillerDragon> > 17:55:16       bridge_ | <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: how can i demoativate you? XD
21:33 < ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪
21:33 < ChillerDragon> irc reply moment
21:33 < ChillerDragon> i assume you mean me going strong on 0.7 today?
21:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xDDDDDDD
21:33 < ChillerDragon> think u have to give up.
21:34 < ChillerDragon> you did a good job sending me to side quests
21:34 < ChillerDragon> but nothing will hold stand
21:34 < ChillerDragon> if you keep pushing forward
21:35 < ChillerDragon> you can not stop me to work on my very persistent intrinisc motivation to unite this cute owo game
21:35 < ChillerDragon> into one shared protocol
21:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> soon i have the best client anyway
21:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> then idc and go full ego
21:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks make sure it passes clippy
21:37 < ChillerDragon> as long as it is 0.7 compatible all good
21:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/anime-angry-gif-22001303
21:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> currently it doesnt even pass unused xD
21:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> XD
21:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> what do u think how long it took to convert vk backend
21:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and then fix all the fucking warnings xD
21:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xD
21:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs the clippy --fix broke somewhere
21:39 < ChillerDragon> i really can not tell if you work on some flopping toy project
21:39 < ChillerDragon> or if you will disrupt the industry jopsti
21:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> industry ofc
21:39 < ChillerDragon> as much as it would suck to break protocol. if its blazingly fast it would be very pog
21:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> its not only that
21:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but also blazingly moddable
21:40 < ChillerDragon> poggable
21:41 < ChillerDragon> i wonder if deen, heinrich, robi, lerato and so on are flexible enough to replace the codebase
21:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> my plan is to coup oy
21:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and take the name "teeworlds" back
21:41 < ChillerDragon> you going for vanilla?
21:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs its the best name
21:41 < ChillerDragon> woah
21:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> vanilla is my first goal yes
21:41 < ChillerDragon> thats epic
21:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> based on that i want to implement FNG
21:41 < ChillerDragon> so its pvp first game?
21:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> without modifying the vanilla code base
21:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> with client side prediction
21:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> without modifying the client code base
21:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> blazingly moddable
21:42 < ChillerDragon> thats not a thing
21:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i am not kidding 😄
21:42 < ChillerDragon> im hyped
21:42 < ChillerDragon> and emotionally confused
21:43 < ChillerDragon> but tbh you know what needs a rust rewrite more than teeworlds?
21:43 < ChillerDragon> minecraft!
21:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1051479327117693010
21:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u can read my monolog from here
21:43 < ChillerDragon> all the open source rust minecraft rewrites are uselessly wip
21:43 < ChillerDragon> sends a discord link
21:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> "The main purpose i want this merged is, that we can merge server code with client code again."
21:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if u want to scan ur irc logs

21:45 < ChillerDragon> now thats a chat link
21:56 < bridge_> <chairn> iirc, there was a quine winner with a filesize of 0 byte (https://www.ioccc.org/years-spoiler.html#1994, winner smr)
21:58 < bridge_> <chairn> you can also try `gcc -xc -E -v -`
22:01 < bridge_> <chairn> inside or outside? Inside would be unbearable, outside is fine 🙂
22:09 < bridge_> <chairn> get a glimpse into the exciting realm of rust
22:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this reminds me
22:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> when is ddnet bday
22:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 10 years ddnet
22:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> epic
22:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 3 days ago was 10y of dota
22:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> or was that last year xd
22:13 < bridge_> <chairn> i guess teehistorian
22:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 2013-07-18: Beginning of DDNet with first finisj
22:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 2013-07-18: Beginning of DDNet with first finish
22:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> OMG
22:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki
22:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> OMG
22:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye
22:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> deens kid will be born
22:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its around this date
22:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> exactly in 5 days
22:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> OMG
22:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rly?
22:13 < bridge_> <_gwendal> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/985717921600929872/1129098463204868186 maybe the bot could link to Coke's coala brown upload message to see easily which skins are uploaded to the db ?
22:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> HE FCKING PLANNED IT
22:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> kek
22:14 < bridge_> <_gwendal> wait it does wtf mb
22:14 < bridge_> <learath2> nah, it's the database and the downloads folder on the website, it's getting out of control 😄
22:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> OMG i die if the kid is born at 18. july
22:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> that would be the best irony of life ever
22:17 < bridge_> <chairn> 18th or 19th i think
22:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> this is literally quoted from wiki lmao
22:18 < bridge_> <louis.place> deen is having a kid??
22:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> IN EXACTLY 5 DAYS AS PLANNED BY HIm
22:19 < bridge_> <chairn> does the #✉-create-a-ticket really ping murpi everytime ?
22:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i also tested it xDD
22:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it pinged murpi and heinrich and someone else
22:19 < bridge_> <louis.place> jesus of teeworlds incoming
22:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> did he rly say 5 days
22:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no need for peekable. just clone the iterator if you want to peek
22:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> no but he said in 2 months on 18th of may
22:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
22:20 < bridge_> <chairn> yeah, but it's rougly in 2 months
22:20 < bridge_> <learath2> I ended up not needing this. But what use would be cloning?
22:20 < bridge_> <chairn> yeah, but it's roughly in 2 months
22:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i guess cloning is cheap? but idk why not peekable  then
22:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `.as_ref().map(Deref::deref)`
22:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
22:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> reading a chat in order without reading everything is kind of annoying in this context
22:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cuz we already went over this
22:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> your PR did quite a few sensible things 🙂
22:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> usually not
22:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nice
22:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> reading a chat in order without reading everything is kind of weird in this context
22:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> do u agree with matches!
22:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I got notified on my phone that the masterserver crashed due to that
22:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> restarted it within 15 min 😉

22:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> where? 😄
22:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that seems like it decreases readability, because discord displays these numbers as one
22:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i reread and idk why i said that XD
22:31 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @davide55\: sos im stuck in firewall \:c
22:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> url
22:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ger10.ddnet.tw
22:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ger10.ddnet.org
22:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the code is equivalent
22:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> nope. after optimizing, it's the same. before optimizing, the pattern match is cheaper
22:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> is is_err const?
22:34 < bridge_> <learath2> What exactly do you need to restart in this case btw? I took a quick look but there were so many services starting with `httpmaster-` 😄
22:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1129148951602401480/image.png
22:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i guess this one is quite opinionated
22:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but imho it looks more clean is_err
22:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> break `rust_panic` or so. need to get the current name of the day
22:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 iirc rust-lldb works better for rust btw
22:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> heinrich is still far in the backlog
22:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
22:36 < bridge_> <davide55> I had some unexpected events and I still couldn't update the UDP filter after the massive change in the netcode of the new update, I'll do it as soon as possible, in the meanwhile use the URL as @ryozuki said 
22:36 < bridge_> <davide55> 
22:36 < bridge_> <davide55> https://ger10.ddnet.org/
22:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xD chatgpt is slow today 🇬🇷
22:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> lol
22:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
22:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 🇬🇷
22:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bad discord
22:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xD
22:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
22:39 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `clone().next()` for peek
22:39 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because peekable is less cheap IIRC
22:40 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think both are fine. the good thing about pattern matching is that it works with every type
22:41 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> massive change in the netcode? what did I miss?
22:41 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> done \o/
22:41 < bridge_> <davide55> Deen sent me this:
22:41 < bridge_> <davide55> 
22:41 < bridge_> <davide55> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6823
22:41 < bridge_> <learath2> huh interesting that that's cheaper, anyway, didn't end up needing it
22:43 < bridge_> <davide55> (I didnt checked yet the changes, but I'll do in the next days)
22:43 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's just an `it[1]` with a bounds chec
22:43 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> k
22:46 < ChillerDragon> @davide55 ye ger10 works fine but not fokkos server :(
22:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> an standard iterator is just a pair of two pointers. it doesn't cost anything to clone
22:46 < bridge_> <learath2> @murpi I have an improvement idea for tickets
22:47 < ChillerDragon> i verified here https://tw.fokkonaut.de/
22:47 < bridge_> <murpi> What is it?
22:47 < bridge_> <davide55> WTF?
22:47 < ChillerDragon> ?
22:47 < bridge_> <davide55> They have both same filter
22:47 < bridge_> <davide55> Let me check
22:47 < ChillerDragon> i checked with tcpdump
22:48 < ChillerDragon> none of my ips packets arrive on port 8303
22:49 < ChillerDragon> marking startinfo as flush breaks your filter? o.O
22:49 < ChillerDragon> now im super curious how it works
22:49 < ChillerDragon> i didnt expect it to be that close to the protocol
22:49 < ChillerDragon> when open src firewall
22:50 < bridge_> <davide55> I didnt check the changes in the code, I just saw the pull description
22:50 < bridge_> <learath2> When we close tickets, maybe just lock it for a couple minutes and not allow the opener to create any new tickets meanwhile
22:50 < ChillerDragon> a
22:50 < ChillerDragon> its flipping one bit davide
22:50 < bridge_> <learath2> Ah no, I was more confused about why peekable can't do the exact same thing
22:50 < ChillerDragon> :D 
22:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @davide55 r u the guy with a company? and do u rent servers?
22:51 < bridge_> <davide55> Ye
22:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> how much
22:51 < ChillerDragon> moni u have
22:51 < bridge_> <davide55> Try now ChillerDragon
22:51 < ChillerDragon> leak bank balance
22:51 < bridge_> <davide55> I'll send you the URL in PM, write me
22:51 < ChillerDragon> it work
22:51 < ChillerDragon> thank
22:51 < bridge_> <davide55> Oh
22:51 < ChillerDragon> davide u such hacker
22:52 < bridge_> <davide55> Then give me your IP in PM, I have to check a thing
22:52 < ChillerDragon> fixin da bugs in seconds
22:52 < ChillerDragon> dm
22:52 < ChillerDragon> be like
22:53 < ChillerDragon> @davide55 go buy irc i send ip
22:53 < bridge_> <davide55> Wut
22:53 < ChillerDragon> i cant send dms on discord
22:54 < bridge_> <murpi> Hmmm, not easy
22:55 < bridge_> <murpi> I could delay the closure of a ticket though

22:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> troll
22:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> peekable creates a weird construct where it remembers the element the iterator got. it's just a lot harder for the optimizer to see through, if it can at all
22:58 < ChillerDragon> i dont have telegram :c
22:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it basically converts your iterator into a
22:58 < bridge_> <murpi> I could keep count of all bot interactions, but monthly stats? idk 😄
22:58 < bridge_> <murpi> $commandstats
22:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```rs
22:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> struct Peekable<I: Iter> {
22:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991>     inner: I,
22:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991>     peeked: Option<Option<I::Item>>,
22:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> }
22:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```
22:58 < bridge_> <davide55> Btw fixed the UDP filter, it is now working with the new versions
22:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if u save t odb its ez
22:59 < ChillerDragon> pog
22:59 < bridge_> <davide55> It was not a big change seems afterall haha
22:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's okay for expensive iterators, but for cheap ones you should really just use `.clone().next()`
22:59 < bridge_> <learath2> But why doesnt it just do the clone thing? Is it maybe not possible with all kinds of iterators for some reason? Maybe involving side effects?
22:59 < ChillerDragon> @davide55 you got ssh on fokko srv?
22:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> side effects, basically
22:59 < ChillerDragon> or any other server i can connect to to leak my ip @davide55 =
22:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and missing specialization I guess @learath2
22:59 < bridge_> <davide55> Can you send it to someone you trust in IRC that has Discord too and he shares it with me?
22:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> send it to me ChillerDragon

23:08 < ChillerDragon> omagawd the update has no new packets xd
23:09 < bridge_> <davide55> Can you try now? Chiller

23:10 < ChillerDragon> xd
23:10 < bridge_> <davide55> Can you send me the full pcap too?
23:10 < bridge_> <davide55> 😄
23:11 < ChillerDragon> client or server side?
23:11 < bridge_> <davide55> Client
23:11 < bridge_> <davide55> Ye, a new packet, lenght 12 seems (and not the first one), never seen it before
23:12 < ChillerDragon> !p 0000   10 00 00 01 54 4b 45 4e ff ff ff ff
23:12 < bridge_> <YADDB> Command not found!
23:13 < ChillerDragon> !ping
23:13 < bridge_> <YADDB> Command not found!
23:13 < ChillerDragon> wot
23:13 < ChillerDragon> bot ded
23:14 < ChillerDragon> its from client to server maybe some bug in my susy client idk
23:17 < ChillerDragon> hm its TKEN
23:18 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: send pcap already :p
23:18 < ChillerDragon> nono
23:19 < ChillerDragon> this is the the 12 byte packet
23:19 < ChillerDragon> 10 00 00 01 54 4b 0030  45 4e ff ff ff ff                                ....TKEN....
23:19 < ChillerDragon> its always the same
23:19 < ChillerDragon> !p 10 00 00 01 54 4b 0030  45 4e ff ff ff ff
23:19 < bridge_> <YADDB> Command not found!
23:19 < ChillerDragon> !p 10 00 00 01 54 4b 00 30 45 4e ff ff ff ff
23:19 < bridge_> <YADDB> Command not found!
23:20 < ChillerDragon> the pcap is full of nudes not gonna send it
23:21 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: file -> export specified packets
23:21 <@heinrich5991> then you can export only the displayed packets in a pcap
23:21 <@heinrich5991> i.e. the teeworlds packets
23:21 < ChillerDragon> ``10 00 00 01 54 4b 00 30 45 4e ff ff ff ff``
23:21 < ChillerDragon> those are the only bytes u want anyways
23:22 < ChillerDragon> but i wouldnt worry too much maybe there is some bug in my client
23:22 <@heinrich5991> can't import that into wireshark
23:22 <@heinrich5991> looks like a bug though :D
23:22 < bridge_> <davide55> @heinrich5991 send me the Chiller pcap when you have it
23:22 < ChillerDragon> bruv
23:22 < bridge_> <davide55> Wut
23:23 < ChillerDragon> just connect to foko srv ur self and record it
23:23 < bridge_> <davide55> It works for me 😄
23:23 < bridge_> <davide55> That's the issue
23:23 < ChillerDragon> xd
23:24 <@heinrich5991> why not share the censored pcap? ^^
23:24 <@heinrich5991> you can open it yourself to see that it doesn't contain anything bad
23:24 < ChillerDragon> :c
23:25 < ChillerDragon> you can send those bytes w python and record it im too tired to properly censor a pcap rn
23:25 < bridge_> <learath2> Your ! is triggering the other bot
23:26 < ChillerDragon> sorry guys but ima go sleep now :c if you so hyped about the pcap and for whatever reason can not work with the relevant bytes i can give it a go again tomorrow
23:26 < ChillerDragon> lerato my bot clearly was here before
23:28 < ChillerDragon> i assume the client got in a weird state due to the server acting all firewall and it failed to send the TKEN package correctly
23:34 <@heinrich5991> give pcap before sleep, ChillerDragon
23:34 <@heinrich5991> :D
23:34 <@heinrich5991> hype hype
23:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> is this real heinrich
23:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also i thought netcode was supposed to not change
23:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or is this a fokko sv thing
23:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> just buy a new computer ::3Head:
