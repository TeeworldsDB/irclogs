01:42 < Maple> oh
01:42 < Maple> skeith posted it
01:43 <@deen> ah, need to test the 60fps videos
01:52 < xrothx> deen: 
01:52 < xrothx> Trace the DDNET GER Server
01:52 < xrothx> Is goes to the UK 
01:53 < xrothx> Might be the cause of the lags 
01:55 <@deen> ?
01:55 <@deen> not for me
01:55 < laxa> deen: the last 5 videos or something are 60 fps
01:55 < laxa> only 1 is fucked up, I should reupload it with good bitrate and sound I think
01:55 <@deen> yeah
01:59 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] trml opened pull request #112: Prediction weapons (DDRace64...prediction_weapons) http://git.io/Z1e1dw
02:09 <@deen> love the 60fps video
02:28 < xrothx> deen: 
02:28 < xrothx> You got a moment to explain me how to add sound to a map? :)
02:41 <@deen> xrothx: there's a tutorial
02:41 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=582
02:57 <@deen> nuborn: did you see the comment by eeeee : https://github.com/def-/ddnet/pull/112
03:00 < nuborn> hi, yes
03:01 < nuborn> I agree that code can be put into functions
03:02 < nuborn> the sharing/reuse of code is a bit more complicated (for me), I can write about it there
03:03 < eeeee> yeah you can write wherever you feel like
03:03 < eeeee> prolly only people from this channel would be interested
03:04 < nuborn> ok, I can copy it here (long text)
03:04 < nuborn> I thought about reusing code. But this would require sharing code between client and server. For characters, this is done by having a CCharacterCore which is shared and CCharacter which is unique to the server, but for projectiles, the server only uses CProjectile, which includes variables/things that are unique to the server. So I believe the alternatives are duplicating (parts of) the code like I've done, or rewriting the server code to use
03:04 < nuborn>  two classes, maybe a "CProjectileCore" and CProjectile (with reduced code), but I think the latter would be very complicated.
03:07 < eeeee> can't you just share CProjectile without creating CProjectileCore?
03:08 < nuborn> I tried that, but CProjectile needs acces to CCharacter and other classes which are server only
03:08 < eeeee> or maybe edit CProjectile to extract the parts of code that you're copying into static functions or something
03:08 <@deen> eeeee: we had these problems before with other prediction code
03:09 < eeeee> and then call those from gameclient
03:09 <@deen> and couldn't find a nice solution, so we also copied code =/
03:09 < eeeee> D:
03:09 <@deen> would have to reorganize the code and no one wanted to do that
03:09 < eeeee> if 0.7 ever releases, how would you merge it
03:09 < nuborn> eeeee: I havent thought about that
03:10 <@deen> eeeee: ddnet code would never merge well with 0.7
03:10 <@deen> the code is a huge mess
03:10 < eeeee> hm okay, nevermind then
03:14 < xrothx> Last question before I leave
03:14 < xrothx> If TW 0.7 comes out, 
03:14 < xrothx> DDNet will die? 
03:14 < xrothx> DDNet will die/stop? 
03:14 < xrothx> or you will rewrite? 
03:14 < eeeee> more like tw will die
03:14 <@deen> why not just keep it running on 0.6?
03:15 < xrothx> lots of players will go to 0.7 
03:15 < xrothx> what would be the sence of continueing an old version?Âµ
03:15 < eeeee> there's no ddrace on 0.7
03:16 < xrothx> not yet, Won't any coder update any mod?
03:16 < eeeee> so only hardcore vanilla guys might adopt it
03:16 <@deen> xrothx: there are active coders?
03:16 < xrothx> When I quited  2-3 years ago, there was
03:17 < xrothx> Didn't really searched again
03:17 < xrothx> It used to be kind of competition to bring out new mods with nice features.. 
03:17 < eeeee> there was always like a only couple coders working on ddrace
03:17 <@deen> i wanted to contribut to ddrace in the start
03:17 <@deen> but no one was active from the ddrace team
03:17 < eeeee> everyone else was just adding small useless features like rainbows and stuff
03:18 < xrothx> Is ddnet the only actively developed mods left? 
03:23 < xrothx> http://prntscr.com/5cbazt uhuum..? 
03:24 < xrothx> Aight, Goodnight everybody

10:42 < laxadedi> bad manipulation of irssi :(
10:58 <@deen> thanks laxa
11:11 < laxadedi> boah, can't find anything on sharepoint framework for C#
11:11 < laxadedi> so I got nothing to do at work
11:12 < laxadedi> it's annoying
11:12 < laxadedi> I don't like to be bored
11:12 < laxadedi> give me some work :p

11:49 <@deen> seems like the problems with -O3 only happened on Brazil server
11:50 <@deen> it's the only 32bit server we're running, so I just tested with a 32bit compilation, but it looks fine
11:53 < laxadedi> deen: what smartphone do you have ?
11:53 <@deen> laxadedi: Nokia 6310i, the first phone with Java!
11:54 < laxadedi> so no smartphone :D
11:54 < laxadedi> Like me :p
11:54 <@deen> yeah
11:55 < laxadedi> I am still trying to understand how a smartphone could be usefull to me
11:56 < laxadedi> I am not in front of a computer : when sleeping, when being away from work/school/home
11:56 <@deen> Just found a funny bug^^
11:56 < laxadedi> so, around 1h30/2h a day
11:56 < laxadedi> but then I sleep
11:56 < laxadedi> what bug oO ?
11:57 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/stuck.png
11:57 <@deen> played around with 64 dummies
11:57 <@deen> they came out of solo part, maybe 30 of them
11:57 <@deen> and now they're stuck in the air like that
11:57 <@deen> just hanging there
11:57 < laxadedi> how you doing that oO ?
11:58 <@deen> udp relay
12:00 <@deen> just clones the udp packets and sends them 64 times
12:00 <@deen> from different ports
12:02 <@deen> so, if you don't need one, don't buy one?
12:03 < laxadedi> Yeah....
12:03 < laxadedi> I am bored, I don't know what to do :x

12:15 < eeeee> deen: can you try tw.qwe123.info/DDNet_x86_d.html in firefox once again?
12:15 <@deen> yes, looks better
12:16 < eeeee> ^^
12:16 <@deen> good job

12:20 <@deen> stuff like that
12:20 < eeeee> nice

13:19 < laxadedi> oh deen 
13:20 < laxadedi> I have a request for you if you did that for the guy on the forum
13:20 <@deen> ...
13:20 < laxadedi> for demo recording, I would like to have the time being displayed if possible :p
13:20 < laxadedi> when hud is disabled
13:23 <@deen> just disable each part of the HUD individually?
13:24 < laxadedi> oh, that's possible ?
13:24 <@deen> cl_showchat 0; cl_showkillmessages 0; cl_showhud_healtammo 0; cl_showhud_score 0
13:24 < laxadedi> oh nice
13:24 <@deen> maybe, I've never tried
13:24 < laxadedi> I need to try that then
13:25 <@deen> i made the change not because he asked, but because centiseconds have always been inaccurate and it drives me crazy
13:25 <@deen> the counter just shows random numbers
13:25 < laxadedi> ok :D
13:25 <@deen> and no one seems to notice...
13:26 < laxadedi> it's not like it matters, I don't even know where it's displayed :p
13:27 <@deen> hi BeaR 
13:27 < BeaR> hey
13:27 <@deen> thanks for the new sound stuff!
13:27 < BeaR> just saw the glorious cl_show_centisecs 
13:27 < BeaR> np (:
13:28 <@deen> haha
13:28 <@deen> 13:25 <@deen> i made the change not because he asked, but because centiseconds have  always been inaccurate and it drives me crazy
13:28 <@deen> 13:25 <@deen> the counter just shows random numbers
13:28 <@deen> 13:25 < laxadedi> ok :D
13:28 <@deen> 13:25 <@deen> and no one seems to notice...
13:28 < BeaR> lol :D
13:28 < laxadedi> it doesn't display time from server ?
13:28 <@deen> nope
13:29 <@deen> only the seconds are accurate
13:29 < laxadedi> that's why it's innnacurate ?
13:29 < laxadedi> ok
13:31 <@deen> EastByte: your json parsing leaks!
13:31 <@deen> laxadedi: i guess so, didN't really check how it works
13:32 <@deen> i think it's some internal tick counter

13:35 < BeaR> ah you host an own version srv
13:36 < BeaR> now that global chat stuff makes sense 
13:36 <@deen> ^^
13:36 <@deen> BeaR: any idea why -O3 makes the server misbehave in Brazil?
13:36 <@deen> all others are fine
13:37 < BeaR> what kind of misbehave oO?
13:38 <@deen> you get stuck in walls
13:38 <@deen> it's really weird
13:38 < BeaR> lol
13:39 < BeaR> all servers running with the same build?
13:39 <@deen> it's a x86 32bit server
13:39 <@deen> no, each compiles its own
13:39 <@deen> but when i do a 32bit compile here it works fine
13:40 <@deen> there's also an issue with a misbehaving boost on one map, don't understand what's happening there
13:40 <@deen> but that seems unrelated^^
13:41 < BeaR> hm not sure probably some optimization option goes crazy
13:41 <@deen> i thought it's some undefined behaviour we're using
13:41 < BeaR> need to turn of one by one
13:41 <@deen> but couldn't find any for now
13:41 <@deen> BeaR: I've been thinking about participating in the Haskell contest this week^^
13:42 <@deen> the game is pretty fun
13:42 < BeaR> ^^
13:42 < BeaR> didnt check the source (:
13:42 <@deen> I'm wondering if they intentionally didn'T tell the name of the game
13:42 <@deen> had to google a bit to find literature about it
13:43 < BeaR> liked this game when I was a child :D
13:43 <@deen> it's cool to write an AI for a game where humans are better than AIs
13:43 <@deen> not like for teeworlds...
13:43 <@deen> should tell that to the bot writers
13:44 < BeaR> well if it would be c++ I would participate but haskell huehue (:
13:44 <@deen> write it in c++ and make a haskell wrapper?^^
13:44 < BeaR> haha
13:45 < BeaR> dunno a neural network approch would be interesting (also for teeworlds)
13:45 <@deen> the most successful approach is monte carlo tree search
13:45 <@deen> fed with all the best hex games ever played
13:46 < BeaR> :P
13:48 < BeaR> hm is the brazil server also compiled with  -Ofast ?
13:49 <@deen> tried that as well as -O3
13:50 <@deen> just copied the binary over and buggy on my computer as well
13:50 <@deen> my guess would be that it's the compiler version
13:51 <@deen> same compiler options, same architecture on gcc 4.9 works fine
13:51 <@deen> and that's 4.8.1 on Brazil
13:54 < BeaR> possible, would be still interesting too see what's going on there
13:55 <@deen> how to find out?

14:46 <@deen> BeaR: from a c++ template guru I heard that haskell is pretty similar to c++ template metaprogramming^^
14:47 < BeaR> well c++ template metaprogramming is hell :D
14:47 <@deen> The guy is in my exerercises, but I heard a talk by him about c++ template metaprogramming^^
14:47 < BeaR> but yeah it's a bit similiar
14:49 <@deen> hm, eeeee's online demo viewer seems to work. maybe i should try automated server demo recordings again
14:49 <@deen> they worked, but performance was too bad, let's see if i can optimize a bit
14:50 <@deen> i have 2 ideas:
14:51 <@deen> 1. the header + map is the biggest part, write them not at the start of demo recording, but after the demo is saved (because most demos are never finished anyway)
14:51 <@deen> 2. io_writes in a thread
14:52 <@deen> oh!
14:53 <@deen> Even better, nonlocking io_write!
14:53 <@deen> ehm, non-blocking*
14:53 <@deen> does that exist?^^
14:55 <@deen> hm, there seem to be no flushes happening
14:55 <@deen> might be okay with idea 1 and regular io_write

15:48 < Learath2> deen: could use some non blocking write
15:48 <@deen> Learath2: how?
15:51 < Learath2> tbh no idea but its most likely possible as someone prolly needed it before :D
15:53 <@deen> i did that for the logger
15:53 <@deen> and it wasn't nice to write
15:54 < Learath2> maybe move writing to another thread deen

16:44 < laxadedi> well, I don't know, that's why I am asking :)
16:45 < BeaR> well should be 50
