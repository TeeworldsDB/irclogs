03:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh yea since i did the uhhh demo buttons thing can i have the dev role
03:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ask @murpi
03:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> thanks!
05:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> did I see typescript
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no :bluekitty:

08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> Hello, good time, can anyone compile Source FNG for Windows?
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Mahdiyar which repo are you using
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> Windows
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> @ReiTW
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Mahdiyar nono I mean where's the source code you're using
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> in github
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> I really need you to help meگ
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> I really need you to help me
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> https://github.com/Jupeyy/teeworlds-fng2-mod
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> @ReiTW
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> looks like u can compile it for windows tho
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> Yes, it is possible, but I don't have the ability to learn
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> can you help
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> @ReiTW
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> just install Visual Studio Community Edition
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> and https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.24.1/cmake-3.24.1-windows-x86_64.msi
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> I tried
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> @ReiTW
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I'm at work at the same time, just try to install both, And proceed like it is written in the README file
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> It should work, if not just give us a screenshot of errors you have
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> Ok
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> Thanks
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @Mahdiyar https://aliveclan.de/#downloads
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> ow meeen
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> thankssss
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mahdiyar> What is the problem of not opening the procedure of VPS Windows?  @murpi
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> wdym by that
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://youtube.com/shorts/NDLvLSMHPu8?feature=share
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> does anyone recognize that voice
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> It's yours?
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Definetly not
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> I know, I have plenty videos and voice audios from you
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Heh
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> But it's because an old joke because with the child if you remember
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> No
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Lol think about it smarty
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Can't remember a shit ur sayin
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> It's not shit, don't use these words in a friendly conversation
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> I never understood why the blocking scene is toxic as hell
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Cuz it's blocking
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> That's not a valid reason to be toxic
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Because of the block scene, the game is suffering to certain attacks
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Tell that to your good old friend who started everything
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> How if I don't have contact >> I don't want contact ?
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Dunno
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Also even if he started with did you agree and go on with the fight
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> I guess everyone was too young back then
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I never went in his fight, only fought back when he targeted my srv
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Uhm Rei, that's exactly what you should not do, that's exactly fighting back :saddo:
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I've stopped since lmao, lot of people knows I'm an old ddoser
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Since you stopped with that your server seems to be fine, maybe that was the solution like a few years ago?
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> That doesn't make it better at all
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> My srv is fine since noby and me worked on a solution
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> You're still flagged as a known DoSer
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Yeah, I know and idc, some people can trust me now, some still doesn't
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> I know, you throw away the other stuff and focused on protection and not attacking
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> DoSing is cringe
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> At least I've learned things, so idc too lmao
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Was that even worth it xd
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Sure it was
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Then vali is learning a lot over the years :monkaS:
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Doesn't seem to be right, knowing him
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> *epic sarcasm music*
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x526f6d656f> you are surprised why a toxic playstyle led to a toxic community? :CatWhat:
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> It's not a toxic "playstyle" if the server is dedicated to it
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> doesnt seem like, if he only uses your tools
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We don't dos anyone, no fighting back yet we still get attacked. It's not really much of a factor
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> +1
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We literally have no monetary gain. Playing on the servers is free. All our contributions to teeworlds is public. Yet they still ddos non stop. It has nothing to do about the kind of actor the victim is. It's just the attackers personality
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> I meant the TCP case
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> That was directly to Rei, not you
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No value in that then tho
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I meant to generalize. Whether rei fought back or not might not really be much of a factor at all
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> His server still regularly gets attacks too. Not like they stopped. He just has enough bandwidth and a good filter
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> You don't get my point
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> wait till someone reaches my bw limit :IYS_pepoStress:
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fwiw this is technically futile. You can rent botnets that deliver even hundreds of gbit. As long as you save up for special events, you can always be annoying
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yeah, that's sad
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> May not be cheap enough for everyday ddosing but when a special event is happening, just go ham with your 300gbit botnet of IoT toasters
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :thonk: 😂
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Ravie Senpai but yeah, being tagged as an old ddoser is nothing to me, I completly acknowledge it and I've changed since
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Dont even argue Rei
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> he's chill
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1016331790484512848/IMG-20220827-WA0019.jpg
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1016332031887691802/unknown.png
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> <a:zoozpepe:708147692370657301>
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> It's not an argument, just his point of view which is totally okay. I was just saying that they are maybe some people that still go with his old "image"
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> didn't get it tho
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> rick
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Wouldn't it be better to just scan by himself and building it up with his own hands, hard work pays off if I'm correct
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> since when?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> took me 5mins to fucking find it
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 💀
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> That's a private conflict and information, no need to publish it
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I just wanted to know since when you dont have contact anymore.
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://tenor.com/view/frodo-keep-your-secrets-alright-then-lotr-gif-12907121
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If he is capable of it, sure. A lot of these >100gbit botnets use many many different exploits. Some in the wild even seem to be using 0days to gain access to these devices. I'm not sure he has the skillset to build one of significant size
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Especially capacity wise there is only a finite set of vulnerable devices on the web. I'm sure most of the easy fish are already part of like 40 botnets 😄
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> As long as I know, most of the current DoS guys won't have that skill. They barely know cyber security. But I know that some people saved up github links from groups that published their work
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> fun fact some people were like "damn you're a hacker" just cuz I told I built my own shitty coded tool, that was a bit pissing me off
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> But they will need special services such as servers that allow to scan, CnCs and much more to be safe
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> scanning isn't an issue, avoiding honeypots is
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> If you're going with a botnet the scan server should probably be bulletproof at the edge of the world, with powerful specs and enough bandwidth I guess
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Finding a service for that is nearly impossible, most of the people are using resellers but they are expensive and horribly
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Honeypots can be easy if you're an expert but eh... I mean they are feeling good because downing a cheap server so...
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You are a hacker in the original meaning of the word
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> :IYS_pepoStress:
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> does watching diy hacks makes me a hacker
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I love this web
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> True hacker spirit
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Not a cracker or script kiddy
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> so u mean the 1st point
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> All of them
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Less the deprecated
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well I still have low skills lol, but at least I tried to learn things
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> RFC1392, the Internet Users' Glossary, usefully amplifies this as: A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Beautiful
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> damn that's cool
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2. No problem should ever have to be solved twice.
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 3. Boredom and drudgery are evil.
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 4. Freedom is good.
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 5. Attitude is no substitute for competence.
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 4. is written by Stallman
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> obviously
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i disagree with 2 and 3
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Read the text
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> He goes further
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 3. Boredom and drudgery are evil.
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hackers (and creative people in general) should never be bored or have to drudge at stupid repetitive work, because when this happens it means they aren't doing what only they can do — solve new problems. This wastefulness hurts everybody. Therefore boredom and drudgery are not just unpleasant but actually evil.
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> To behave like a hacker, you have to believe this enough to want to automate away the boring bits as much as possible, not just for yourself but for everybody else (especially other hackers).
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (There is one apparent exception to this. Hackers will sometimes do things that may seem repetitive or boring to an observer as a mind-clearing exercise, or in order to acquire a skill or have some particular kind of experience you can't have otherwise. But this is by choice — nobody who can think should ever be forced into a situation that bores them.)
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not my fault if you only quote "morceau choisi"
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> What is that
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Xd
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I iust didnt want to spam too much
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> im looking for the expression, it's just choosen pieces
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but i remember there was an idiom in english about that that sounded very french
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> This is more like an attitude
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Or philosophy
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The hacker one
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zig> guys what do u think about this
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zig> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1016338996420431942/godot.windows.opt.tools.64_sfYuR4ftoN.gif
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> are u making portal 2D
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> looks cool tho
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Are you using zig?
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zig> no
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Rust > zig change my mind
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> what is zig
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ziglang.org
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zig> didnt know about zig when i used this nickname
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> A "modern" C
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> With good compile time stuff
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> maybe u inspired the founder without knowing
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But doesnt solve things like rust
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its unsafe
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ah
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ziglang.org
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> hoo I've seen it somewhere
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Don't we have hook teleport already?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I remember implementing that at the start of DDNet
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> there is
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but ig this is smth else
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> you can chain hook teleports
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> so you can already achieve that
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> imagine a ddnet client with effects akin to a flashy terraria mod
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> just like so
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1016353269456588881/chain.mp4
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> id imagine itd be very hard to make
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> like animated weapon/fire effects?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zig> its a bit different visually
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> you could make endless cool shit with that
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> once i **know** how to memory manage and be independent in c++ im 100% doing that
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zig> its more about hookline displaying how hook will teleport
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> does hook collision display it
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> would be nice
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I think it doesn't, could be cool
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> no, but it shows whether there's a hookable / player on the other side of the hook teleport
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it's a required skill for c++ indeed, but i don't think it's a must have in our code base
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> --no, but it shows whether there's a hookable / player on the other side of the hook teleport--
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> im wrong, it shows green always if you're looking at a hook teleport tile
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, we keep as much as possible as member and auto duration objects. You rarely need to allocate on your own while tackling simpler stuff
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You should rather learn shaders
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> To do that
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Efficiently
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> E.g a warm dessert effect
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Go to a desert in terraria
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U will know what i mean
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what kind of dessert ? chocolate fudge 😋
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what kind of dessert ? chocolate fudge 😋 ?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluestripe:
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Yeah, shaders will be important too... I'm thinking though, would that mean we could add a shader layer into maps? Where it would overlay everything and give it that subtle touch? 
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Would probably not be in any real maps, but it's a nice thought
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You understimate the power of shaders
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Not just subtle
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Not just overlays
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You have total control on how things are rendered
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Mostly
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> We could add shader layer or add shader to quads i guess
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but i don't know anything about these. Would it work with opengl 1 and following as well?
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Opengl3+
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 3.3*
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And vulkan ofc
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ah yes debugging people's shaders would add a fun new layer to testing maps
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I mean shaders cant change physics
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But yeah
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think we need to keep opengl 1 compatibility
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You could make lights with shadows over tees
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so that potato pc and raspberry can still run the game
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And mirrors
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> raspberry has vk support 😄
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> then potato pc only
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> time to learn shaders then LOLOLOLOL
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> a good way to start is shadertoy, you can try shaders live in your browser
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> https://www.shadertoy.com/
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> its actually quite fun and not that hard
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i LOVE shadertoy, i just havent touched it in ages
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> well then you know shaders lol
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i should do more things in it
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> and also i would need to think of what type of shaders ddnet would have
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> sunshine
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TheKolyian4ik> How do I start coding something?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> what os do u use
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> depends on your end goal, there is a lot of different things behind the word coding
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> my end goal is to make things look pretty :brownbear:
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @TheKolyian4ik read this to follow the good path
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Took an exam. I either passed with exactly 18/30 or failed. 10 questions answered exactly 6
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Turns out learning all of vector calculus and complex analysis in a month studying an hour every other day doesnt really work well
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you needed more deadline mode activation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFvbXZAaHTY
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i would just derive the entire subfield of vector calculus and complex analysis during the test to arrive at the correct answers
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i knew a guy who did that
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> he passed the exams easily...
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually derived perseval's identity on the fly because I forgot it
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Back when stuff was easier I could actually get by with just a handful of theorems and derived stuff on the fly
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But analysis is just a beast of a lesson. Can't come up with integration methods while you are knee deep in a triple integral
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Things got hard way too quickly 😄
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> :kek:
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> poor parseval 😦
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sometimes the proof just makes more of an impression on me than the fact
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: cool that the 0.7 dissector helped you 🙂 what's the current state of 0.7 support? (reading backlog 2022-08-19, not sure if there's newer info available later)
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why is it bad to do it based on client version? it seems easier to support and to test, as you don't have an exponential explosion of possible client capabilities
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let me try: `int execvpe(const char *executable, const char **argv, const char **envp)`
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> You reading whole channel of 2 weeks of messages right now?
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> wtf
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we actually do that (with stun)
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> gotta keep busy 🙂
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now I'm even back to discord 🙂
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 4 weeks
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ❤️
