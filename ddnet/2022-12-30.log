00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> does it really work :D?
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it was headshots screenshot, but yeah it worked back then
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u remove discord sdk, u can still run it probably with opengl 1
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ïƒâ„“Ã­â™¡> It hasn't worked for me lately either
02:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Treatment> same^
02:59 < Jim2> Bored? irc.twistednet.org Channel Twisted
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> 172 FPS
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> with that type of window style
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Please don't. There have been no security updates for a long time now
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And if you have to, you can keep using an older DDNet version, the current one doesn't work anyway
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he's just trolln
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You should use ReactOS if you want to use old-school Windows: https://reactos.org/
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm wondering if DDNet runs, but probably should since they work closely with the Wine devs
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> They have a Teeworlds screenshot on their page, so should work ðŸ˜‰
14:24 <+ChillerDragon> @Patiga bruv @fokkonaut and I were debugging for way too long why the dark design was generated wrong. Seems like twmap 0.3 generates different (hash missmatch) map files than twmap 0.4 oof
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> could you provide me the different files? I don't see a commit which could cause that
14:26 <+ChillerDragon> oh woot ur not aware?
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> do you mean simple map resaving or with editing inbetween?
14:27 <+ChillerDragon> not resave its editing
14:27 <+ChillerDragon> applying this darkmode edit script https://github.com/DDNetPP/maps-scripts/blob/master/BlmapChill/dark.py on this map https://github.com/DDNetPP/maps/blob/master/BlmapChill.map
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that is curious
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> could you send me the two map files?
14:28 <+ChillerDragon> i think i deleted the old sec
14:28 <+ChillerDragon> ye i did :(
14:29 <+ChillerDragon> how do u downgrade pip stuff sec
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah right you are talking about twmap python
14:29 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea
14:29 <+ChillerDragon> i py nob
14:31 <+ChillerDragon> @Patiga here u go :) https://maps.zillyhuhn.com/
14:31 <+ChillerDragon> BlmapChill_817.. is the input map both _dark_ ones are generated using the same dark.py script
14:32 <+ChillerDragon> dark_3c3aa is twmap 0.4 and dark_d9ff is twmap 0.3
14:36 <+ChillerDragon> I used 0.3.0 and 0.4.1 to be specific
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> 0.3.0 -> 0.4.0 definitely had the breaking change of switching many things to fixed point numbers which are represented as floats in python
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but the things you edited shouldn't fall into this category
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> for example things like offsets and positions are now all represented with 1.0 = 1 tile
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ChillerDragon: I think I got it
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> twmap adapted the thing from 0.7 where upon saving, all air tiles are un-rotated and un-mirrored
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that will probably be the difference
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Ah nice Good catch
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Patiga)
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea I guess I gotta keep versions in sync if I depend on hash matching
