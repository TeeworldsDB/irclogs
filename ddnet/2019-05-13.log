00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the only way to figure that out is profiling sadly
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or you can stare at  the diff really hard
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> wait, it is fixed somehow
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> probably I need to hang sometime ingame to reproduce those drops
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> nvm, I will let you know when I find something
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/compare/12.3.1...master
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the only changes in scoreboard.cpp is color stuff, which shouldn't(tm) introduce any new code
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Hmm I just downloaded the irclogs and had a lill grepping fun :)
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yo sure we want to keep that public? Maybe protect it atleast with a pw that is shared on discord and irc to keep like real stranger and evil datat collectors away
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Im not sure if everyone knows that every single letter that is written here is published and probably analyzed by evil scrapers
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon lmao u think discord doesnt sell ur data, ur completly wrong
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> having public irc logs is common
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not like u will have a private chat on a channel suposed to be about development
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ya true
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but still. Discord probably doent sell it to the pulci more likley to people that pay
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> @deen ok ty
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> This is a public chat anyway, even if *we* don't make it public, how do you know that someone else isn't logging every channel and doing whatever grepping they want?
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> everybody in this channel is fine i think. Its more like non tw people i guess.
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I am talking about a public password
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that blocks the people that really dont care
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, that's stupid, not gonna add public passwords
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmkay
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> irclogs don't need a noobfilter
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @deen somebody fake you 164.132.203.155:8304
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 is orange not an option for color?
19:55 <+Learath2> Ryozuki: console.cpp GetColor()
19:55 <+Learath2> I don't think I have orange there though
19:55 <+Learath2> I only added the 6 main colors RGBCMY
19:56 <+Learath2> (because they are easy to find on the hsl hexagon)
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yellow looks good
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> magenta looks pink
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:00 <+Ryozuki> mind if i do a pr adding more colors
20:02 <+Learath2> Ryozuki: I was wondering whether that was the best way to do the constant colors
20:03 <+Learath2> should we maybe have a std::map, or maybe use constexprs to construct them
20:04 <+Learath2> (std::map because as we add more colors to that list that linear lookup becomes more and more inefficient)
20:05 <+Ryozuki> doesn't std::map has o(1) for direct access
20:05 <+Ryozuki> i didn't look at code yet
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> this moment when you try to fuzz your server and ddnet client crashes all the time and server survives xxd

20:37 <+Ryozuki> and why would we help you try to ddos a sv
20:37 <+Ryozuki> r u dumb
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DingusFighter> script kiddie :troll:
20:40 <+Ryozuki> Learath2: is the color cast working?
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol stress testing my own server for stabillity is totaly legit
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the client dies if the server sends a messed up position
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im not sure if we should trust the server to gain performance or sanitize this input to avoid client crashes on crazy servers
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> save people from going on crazy servers
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> client crashes are bad imo because you can loose demo and mapping data :c
20:43 <+Ryozuki> don't join servers u dont trust
20:44 <+Ryozuki>  ucant control other ppl servers
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what is a messed up position
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DingusFighter> this is why i join persian ddnet servers :troll:
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you can make the client more stable tho
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> What if no other server has players in the map/gametype i want other than haxxor onbgy fng and bombay with client crashers in their mod implemented. And if you then take to much crack and spin flick the aimbot detection the server might decide to crash your thick demos.
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @jao i was working with tile indexes i might have gone out of boundaries on the server side and sent it to client idk exactly
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> client failed at:
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> #0  0x00005555557d9f6f in CCollision::GetMapIndices[abi:cxx11](vector2_base<float>, vector2_base<float>, unsigned int) (this=0x55555589d718 <g_GameClient+2296>, PrevPos=..., Pos=..., MaxIndices=0)
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>     at /home/chiller/Desktop/git/ddnet/src/game/collision.cpp:787
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ya but im not sure if we should fix that
20:56 <+trotero> someone here to help me pls?
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> not if u dont tell us how to help^^
22:32 <@heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon in general, we want to fix all crashbugs that the server is able to abuse
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki if the color cast wasn't working we'd know ðŸ˜›
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon I think we always fix crashes on the client that can be caused by the server
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki if you feel like it you could also add rgb(r, g, b) and hsl(h, s, l) format to GetColor btw, or I'll do them sometime
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ok i guess ill create an issue then
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 while i was experimenting with 256p, until i finally got it crashsave, i ran into many client crashes xd

23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> just askin, the hook has an alpha when you spec ?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> if so, then everything is fine, else there's a bug?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> normal hook
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/577603644099395585/unknown.png
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> alpha (?) hook

23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 wym when you spec?
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> while you are specing other people?
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> just when i'm spectating
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> whether its someone or not
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm, I don't get how clientid ends up -1
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 mind helping me test it ?
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> i can help you ye
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 spectatorID == -1 in Spec freeview
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not that
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's how we figure out OtherTeam in players.cpp
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not consistent between the Render functions
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so RenderHook thinks we are OtherTeam if either of us is in solo
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but RenderTee doesn't
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
