02:15 < bridge> <Ewan> goodmorning
05:56 < bridge> <teero777> that's sad ðŸ˜­
05:57 < bridge> <teero777> ig I'll start the long long int revolution
10:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i used a different executor now, which does exactly what i wanted to have:

10:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
10:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> hai
12:30 < bridge> <cyberFighter> what for
13:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we should limit map sizes. `size_t` is a red herring, I think
13:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @patiga didn't you have some statistics about plausible max sizes?
13:15 < bridge> <robyt3> yes, I agree with Patiga that 8192x8192 would be a sensible limit for layer sizes. I considered maximum 5000 when I added validation on teeworlds at some point
13:15 < bridge> <patiga> 5000 would also be good
13:16 < bridge> <patiga> I would've loved 4096, however there already are maps on ddnet bigger than that
13:20 < bridge> <robyt3> I would use `size_t` for the parameters anyway, so we can check if `Size > MAX_INT` and fail the saving
13:24 < bridge> <patiga> all tilemaps over 4096

13:25 < bridge> <patiga> not really sure how how to decide on a good limit, maybe 5000 is the next best conservative size
13:28 < bridge> <patiga> huh, I didn't know chill let's climb 2 and 3 have the same height
14:03 < bridge> <teero777> why would you limit them?
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it should at least not cause overflows
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> overruns
14:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> memory safety
14:33 < bridge> <teero777> so it should atleast be this no?
14:35 < bridge> <robyt3> That's just one limit in the map format, there could be more limits elsewhere. And it makes no sense to allow maps that cause crashes due to out of memory for the majority of the users
14:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Even if you can load a map that has a game layer of size 23170x23170, the editor would probably crash if you added a few tile layers to the same group
14:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Even if you can load a map that has a game layer of size 23170x23170, the editor would probably crash if you added a few tile layers (of the same time) to the same group
14:36 < bridge> <teero777> ehm no?
14:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Even if you can load a map that has a game layer of size 23170x23170, the editor would probably crash if you added a few tile layers (of the same size) to the same group
14:36 < bridge> <teero777> 20x20k works fine in the editor
14:36 < bridge> <robyt3> How many tile layers did you add?
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> Idk 3 maybe 4
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> New technique to avoid map piracy just dropped :poggers2:
14:39 < bridge> <robyt3> It's simpler to add more than 1024 small items to the map though, then the editor can no longer save it
14:39 < bridge> <robyt3> That's an arbitrary limitation that I'll eventually remove
14:42 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks hey is there a reason why we don't have every gfx backend store things like we do with OpenGL 1.x?
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it doesnt store anything
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and i answered it yesterday alraedy
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> besides any memory corruption, physics will be less deterministic anyway
14:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I would add the same limit to loading maps
14:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> generally, any limitation that is present solely in the editor is probably a bug
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> generally tho, limits suck indeed
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> they not future ready
14:55 < bridge> <teero777> we need live editing of maps.
14:57 < bridge> <teero777> Procedurally generated maps :owo:
14:57 < bridge> <teero777> Would also open a new world for mods
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mineworlds
15:13 < bridge> <teero777> I suggest a tile that can spawn more tiles
17:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if not, maybe we should not make it look like an announcement channel
20:32 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> @jupeyy_keks fakes on ALIVE

20:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> hobbyless kiddos xd
20:41 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah :/
21:01 < bridge> <teero777> they dont even put effort into names ;(
