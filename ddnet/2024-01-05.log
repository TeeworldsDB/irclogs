07:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> early morning
07:20 < bridge> <teero777> helo
07:21 < bridge> <teero777> okay lets start off the day by programming some bots
07:23 < bridge> <Ewan> morning

07:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/anime-coffee-gif-24657578
07:55 < bridge> <teero777> im actually drinking tea but i dont like the discord emoji for tea
07:56 < bridge> <teero777> so coffee it is
07:59 < bridge> <Ewan> I‚Äôm drinking water
08:00 < bridge> <Ewan> about to go to bed
08:42 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hi everyone
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> hi
08:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is there a program or command or something that i can run beside my server to show what function will get called on variety of event like; kill, tile collision, projectile ......
08:46 < bridge> <teero777> i assume you mean something like a debugger?
08:46 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> yes
08:46 < bridge> <teero777> what IDE are you using?
08:46 < bridge> <teero777> depends what IDE are you using?
08:46 < bridge> <teero777> depends on what IDE are you using?
08:47 < bridge> <teero777> depends on what IDE are you using.
08:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> vs code
08:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but
08:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i want something that i can run it beside my ./DDnet-Server command on my shell
08:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> don't care about vscode
08:48 < bridge> <teero777> you can use gdb. you can also make it visual with vscode. so you can step through your code and check values etc.
08:52 < bridge> <teero777> there are also other frontends for gdb such as 
08:52 < bridge> <teero777> https://github.com/nakst/gf
08:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what do you use for debugging ?
08:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> for c++
08:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Explain emoji pls
08:55 < bridge> <learath2> Gdb is the very best
08:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And asan is epic too if the gdb backtracked are not making sense
08:56 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is it stands for gnu debugger ?
08:57 < bridge> <learath2> Very rarely I‚Äôll also enable the tui using `tui enable` in gdb, it‚Äôs useful if you have only one screen
08:57 < bridge> <learath2> Yes
08:58 < bridge> <learath2> Asan, ubsan and valgrind are also indispensable yep
08:58 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> thank you guys
08:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: dat was a horse
09:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> lldb is nice too
09:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u debug rust use rust-gdb or rust-lldb wrapper
09:04 < bridge> <learath2> Lldb is acceptable, I‚Äôll allow it
09:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use gdb with that plugin tho
09:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> gef
09:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Thanks but why horse
09:07 < bridge> <learath2> Gef I only use when I‚Äôm doing reverese engineering

09:37 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> when a player suicide, his character will be deleted before the function Die() get called ?
09:40 < bridge> <reitw> no, the Die() function is ran before
09:40 < bridge> <reitw> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/player.cpp#L575
09:43 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hah
09:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i implement Extra Life :
09:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
09:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> void CCharacter::Die(int Killer, int Weapon, bool SendKillMsg)
09:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> {
09:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     //my stuff
09:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     if(m_ExtraLives && m_pPlayer)
09:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     {
09:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         // dbg_msg("m_ExtraLives", "called");
09:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         Rescue();
09:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         m_ExtraLives--;
09:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         return;
09:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     }
09:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
09:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's working when the player get spiked, but not working when suicide
09:47 < bridge> <reitw> what are you trying to achieve$
09:47 < bridge> <reitw> what are you trying to achieve
09:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> players can buy Extra Life with theyr Scores
09:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's a block server
09:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i implemented Extra Life :
09:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
09:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> void CCharacter::Die(int Killer, int Weapon, bool SendKillMsg)
09:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> {
09:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     //my stuff
09:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     if(m_ExtraLives && m_pPlayer)
09:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     {
09:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         // dbg_msg("m_ExtraLives", "called");
09:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         Rescue();
09:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         m_ExtraLives--;
09:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         return;
09:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     }
09:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
09:50 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's working when the player get spiked, but not working when suicide
09:59 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and i wanna make the person who reached the maximum points, a god, give him 9 lives in exchange of all of his scores üòÇ
10:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and i wanna make the person who reached the maximum scores, a god, give him 9 lives in exchange of all of his scores üòÇ
10:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> btw, maximum scores are 6969
10:01 < ChillerDragon> cl_kill calls KillCharacter
10:01 < ChillerDragon> which calls Die() and afterwards deletes the character
10:01 < ChillerDragon> u can return in Die() all u want if the obj is deleted
10:02 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/424d789f471c0926878d4431ee655232ff575a7f/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L2742-L2744
10:02 < ChillerDragon> this is where selfkill happens
10:02 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/424d789f471c0926878d4431ee655232ff575a7f/src/game/server/player.cpp#L575-L584
10:03 < ChillerDragon> the ``delete`` and the set to 0 and the ``Respawn()`` are all things you do not want. 
10:03 < ChillerDragon> I would put something in gamecontext.cpp where also the selfkill protection from ddnet is. And return there if the player has god mode
10:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i just return whenever is ExtraLive is more than 0
10:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
10:05 < ChillerDragon> <3
10:06 < ChillerDragon> disallowing selfkill might be annoying 
10:06 < ChillerDragon> imagine the trollings you can do in a block server to a tee that can not respawn
10:06 < ChillerDragon> @mamad_melanin
10:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> a the worst senario if he became a god, he needs to suicide 9 times
10:09 < ChillerDragon> Ah i see
10:09 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> I worry about the others üòÇ
10:09 < ChillerDragon> axaxax true
10:09 < ChillerDragon> But if i see a god i would never spike him then. Only put him in a freeze pit and wait until he suicides 9 times hehe
10:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> yeh me too
10:10 < ChillerDragon> depends on the map and playerbase i guess how the gameplay meta works
10:11 < ChillerDragon> I wonder if microsoft reads the irc logs and in chatgpt 5 you can ask ddnet codebase specific questions o.O
10:20 < ChillerDragon> omg the last few todos of ddnet 0.7 are fakin hydras. While solving one two new ones pop up.
10:20 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1704446411.png
10:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
10:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if(pChr->m_ExtraLives && pPlayer)
10:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     {
10:20 < ChillerDragon> unedited picture of me coding
10:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         pChr->m_ExtraLives--;
10:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         pChr->Rescue();
10:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         return;
10:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     }
10:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     pPlayer->m_LastKill = Server()->Tick();
10:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     pPlayer->KillCharacter(WEAPON_SELF);
10:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     pPlayer->Respawn();
10:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
10:20 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> now it's working like a charm
10:21 < ChillerDragon> nice
10:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> player having extra lives and disconnect üòÇ
10:22 < ChillerDragon> just disallow disconnect axaxaxax
11:10 < bridge> <teero777> this func is used 4 times haha

11:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> }
11:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
11:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> why the player not getting unfreezed ?
11:49 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> sometimes it gets unfreeze and sometimes not
11:49 < ChillerDragon> @teero777 its one of the most expensive funcs that is used during gameplay
11:49 < bridge> <teero777> xD
11:49 < ChillerDragon> but tbh idk how to make it smarter
11:50 < ChillerDragon> using intersectline for my hax clients drops my rapsi even without graphics down to fps where it cant even walk straight
11:50 < bridge> <teero777> i thought GetMapIndices was the most expensive
11:51 < ChillerDragon> isnt that free?
11:51 < bridge> <teero777> no?
11:51 < bridge> <teero777> ```cpp
11:51 < bridge> <teero777> std::vector<int> CCollision::GetMapIndices(vec2 PrevPos, vec2 Pos, unsigned MaxIndices) const
11:51 < bridge> <teero777> {
11:51 < bridge> <teero777>     std::vector<int> vIndices;
11:51 < bridge> <teero777>     float d = distance(PrevPos, Pos);
11:51 < bridge> <teero777>     int End(d + 1);
11:51 < bridge> <teero777>     if(!d)

11:51 < bridge> <teero777>         int Nx = clamp((int)Pos.x / 32, 0, m_Width - 1);
11:51 < bridge> <teero777>         int Ny = clamp((int)Pos.y / 32, 0, m_Height - 1);
11:51 < bridge> <teero777>         int Index = Ny * m_Width + Nx;

11:51 < bridge> <teero777>         {
11:51 < bridge> <teero777>             vIndices.push_back(Index);
11:51 < bridge> <teero777>             return vIndices;
11:51 < bridge> <teero777>         }
11:52 < bridge> <teero777>         else
11:52 < bridge> <teero777>             return vIndices;
11:52 < bridge> <teero777>     }
11:52 < bridge> <teero777>     else
11:52 < bridge> <teero777>     {
11:52 < bridge> <teero777>         int LastIndex = 0;
11:52 < bridge> <teero777>         for(int i = 0; i < End; i++)
11:52 < bridge> <teero777>         {
11:52 < bridge> <teero777>             float a = i / d;
11:52 < bridge> <teero777>             vec2 Tmp = mix(PrevPos, Pos, a);
11:52 < bridge> <teero777>             int Nx = clamp((int)Tmp.x / 32, 0, m_Width - 1);
11:52 < bridge> <teero777>             int Ny = clamp((int)Tmp.y / 32, 0, m_Height - 1);
11:52 < bridge> <teero777>             int Index = Ny * m_Width + Nx;
11:52 < bridge> <teero777>             if(TileExists(Index) && LastIndex != Index)
11:53 < bridge> <teero777> basically the same logic
11:54 < ChillerDragon> rip irc
11:54 < ChillerDragon> yea thats basically a fakin bitcoin miner i see it now
11:56 < ChillerDragon> @mamad_melanin maybe the unfreeze has to happen in the next tick otherwise the player is still in the freeze
11:57 < ChillerDragon> i assume setting some m_PlsDoUnfreeze = true which then in character tick unfreezes it should work but there might be a nicer way
11:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> so i make it the firs tick it could unfreeze then
11:57 < ChillerDragon> does /r unfreeze?
11:58 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i didn't see any unfreezing in it
11:58 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> so i make it the first tick it could unfreeze then
11:59 < bridge> <teero777> rescue should be unfreezing automatically

12:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> sometime it is sometimes not
12:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> problem fixed
12:05 < bridge> <teero777> ok
12:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp

12:05 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i just added this to character::Tick() üòÇ
12:06 < bridge> <teero777> that will unfreeze the character every tick :justatest:
12:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if needed
12:07 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hum
12:07 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i think youre right
12:07 < bridge> <teero777> yea since it quits if UnfreezeNeeded is false instantly and doesnt call UnFreeze(). very ugly imo
12:07 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> brah
12:07 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> nah its cool
12:09 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's not ugly
12:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's not ugly, it's cute :owo:
12:15 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is there a function to retract all the hooks attached to a player ?
12:19 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> rewriting it will be fun tho
12:30 < bridge> <remakepower> Will the community filters add more server organization?
12:33 < ChillerDragon> @remakepower that seems to be the plan why?
12:36 < bridge> <remakepower> Is it means "That seems to be the plan, why?"?

12:49 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I just wrote it for context. I mainly wanted to share about rofi but that's the backstory
12:50 < ChillerDragon> epic backstory
12:51 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> This is rofi https://github.com/davatorium/rofi and this is the super duper configs https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi.
12:51 < bridge> <remakepower> In fact, i found community filters just today
12:51 < ChillerDragon> yrfzf looks amazing
12:52 < bridge> <remakepower> So i want to know is it true
12:52 < ChillerDragon> there is huge open source drama about communties :D
12:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> It does. But after writting the backstory I feel like ytfzf and rofi aren't as cool anymore :(. here's a cool picture of rofi used as launcher https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adi1090x/rofi/master/previews/launchers/type-6/6.png

13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> assuming i don't use any global variables. Do you know any lib that parses all variable names of a closure (only from syntax, so || { whatever ... })
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that are bound to it?
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean u can probably create some weird edge cases like let a: fn() = somefunc;
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>

13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i basically need the captures of a closure by name
13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am 100% sure one of your quadtrillion tabs must have had the same weird problem i have rn üòè
13:04 < ChillerDragon> have you tried using C++?
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does it have proc macros?
13:05 < ChillerDragon> dont think so
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sad
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rust is always the opposite of cpp
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in cpp captures are explicit, in rust not xdd
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i fear that i have to write a rust compiler now, to find out this are non local variables so i know their name
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rip me
13:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or rust parser*
13:10 < bridge> <deen> ctrl-x ctrl-a is faster
13:16 < ChillerDragon> hacker deen
13:18 < ChillerDragon> how can i see where a method is called from?
13:18 < ChillerDragon> in my ide
13:18 < bridge> <deen> what ide?
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Shift + Alt + F12
13:18 < ChillerDragon> vscode vim grep
13:19 < bridge> <learath2> TIL
13:19 < ChillerDragon> ah nice jopsti
13:20 < ChillerDragon> is this bug free?
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> pretty, but if u have traits, or interfaces it can suck a bit
13:21 < ChillerDragon> i use c++
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> better use the base definition
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's why i mentioned interfaces
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
13:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm interested what you need it for ^^
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> virtual functions, if u prefer that
13:22 < ChillerDragon> ``int CSnapshotStorage::Get(int Tick, int64_t *pTagtime, const CSnapshot **ppData, const CSnapshot **ppAltData) const``
13:22 < ChillerDragon> for this heinrich
13:22 < ChillerDragon> seems to be called in 2 places
13:22 < ChillerDragon> usually i search the func name but searching ``Get`` is no fun and idk how many snap storages are there
13:22 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how to tell a character to retract his hook ?
13:23 < ChillerDragon> hookstate retracted
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's the last missing piece in my safe Rc<RefCell> impl
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:23 < ChillerDragon> gamecore
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> instead of having a RefMut and work on it, you give a closure.. but a normal closure has to few restrictions.. so i want ALL captures to have this restriction instead
13:23 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i tried m_HookState = HOOK_RETRACT
13:23 < ChillerDragon> u mean == ?
13:23 < ChillerDragon> for a check
13:23 < ChillerDragon> a
13:23 < ChillerDragon> tell
13:23 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> no
13:23 < ChillerDragon> not check
13:23 < ChillerDragon> ye i see
13:24 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> the hook just disapear but still attached
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xDD chiller IRC moment
13:24 < ChillerDragon> .awdkawd
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> turn on replies
13:24 < ChillerDragon> m_TriggeredEvents |= COREEVENT_HOOK_HIT_NOHOOK;
13:24 < ChillerDragon> idk man
13:24 < ChillerDragon> i would also have to try and error i never cut a hook
13:25 < ChillerDragon> but also wanted to code some powerup once that gets rid of all hooks attached to you
13:25 < ChillerDragon> is nice for endless nobs
13:26 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1704457553.png
13:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i tried reset() in character core, i found out character will spawn at x:0 y:0 , but hook still attached üòÇ
13:26 < ChillerDragon> i needed that powerup here
13:26 < ChillerDragon> this is a real pvp screenshot not staged
13:27 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> did i said i made a server ?
13:27 < ChillerDragon> wot?
13:28 < ChillerDragon> yea u buildin a server side blox mod we know
13:28 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> its on the internet tab <<< SkyBlock
13:28 < ChillerDragon> virus ip grabber
13:28 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1704457729.png
13:28 < ChillerDragon> nice skyblock map
13:29 < ChillerDragon> eww telegram ads
13:29 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> yeh looks like my map
13:29 < ChillerDragon> u recognize it? xd
13:30 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> the telegram is the only app which is still working here in iran üòÇ  beside discord
13:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what about signal?
13:30 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> no
13:30 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i didnt try it tho
13:30 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and we use telegram with proxy, it's the only way
13:31 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it has builtin proxies
13:35 < ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/id
13:35 < ChillerDragon> epic
13:35 < ChillerDragon> this ddnet patch causes no crashes client or server side
13:35 < ChillerDragon> i have breaking my brain on this line of code wat to do with it and its fakin unused
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> (?)
13:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> yoho, made it working
13:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
13:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> void CCharacter::RetractAttachedHooks()
13:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> {
13:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     CPlayer *pPlayer;
13:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     CCharacter *pChr;
13:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>     for(int i; (i < MAX_CLIENTS) && (pPlayer = GameServer()->m_apPlayers[i]) && (pChr = pPlayer->GetCharacter()); i++)
13:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         {
13:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>             if(pChr->Core()->HookedPlayer() == m_pPlayer->GetCID())
13:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>             {
13:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>                 pChr->m_Core.SetHookedPlayer(-1);
13:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>                 pChr->m_Core.m_HookState = HOOK_RETRACT_START;
13:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>             }
13:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin>         }
13:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> }
13:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
13:52 < bridge> <teero777> cool
13:55 < ChillerDragon> pro
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok i guess i'll simply write my macro so, that it forces to write out the captures explicitly, problem solved üòè
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> compile time panic-free safe Rc<RefCell>
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> take that borrow checker
13:59 < bridge> <p_p5120> discord.gg/teensleaks
14:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yikes
14:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Discord Mod :banhammer: needed
14:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> u always have weird ideas
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am just biggest RAII & hierarchy + macro abuser üò¨
14:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> dyn dispatch?
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that was just for chillerdragons thing xd
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no related to the problem
14:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which restriction?
14:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds interesting
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have a derive macro that implements a "hierarchical value" to determine if your component is higher level than another one => you can safely use Rc without leaks
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but if you go even further and also restrict Rc<RefCell> to never allow RefMut outside of your class, then you can restrict all paramters of your function to only allow lower level components => no higher level component is used inside your function.
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and thus it's not possible to borrow mut twice (this component at least)
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the component itself also has wrapper that hides Rc<RefCell> so it cannot be acccessed.
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So basically the goal is to never call borrow_mut, only the macros do it.
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and the same macros apply the restrictions to the func parameters
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hiarc best crate
14:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sub to it on crates.io üòè
14:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> cool üòÆ
14:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> classic squatting crate on crates.io though üòÑ
14:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/rustls-performance/
14:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> looks nice
14:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the title says "on track to" because it doesn't
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I hope they drop c compiler requirement soon
14:54 < bridge> <learath2> What do they even use it for?
14:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ring uses code from boringssl from openssl for crypto primitives
15:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law
15:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 @learath2 @jupeyy_keks real or nah
15:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> unfortunately real
15:31 < bridge> <learath2> Very real
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> depends xd
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> average software for sure
15:35 < ChillerDragon> web
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well with wasm it kida gets faster again xd
15:36 < ChillerDragon> electron
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but adoption takes years
15:36 < ChillerDragon> rust
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> runtime checks
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
15:36 < ChillerDragon> gigachad C devs in 1999 had speed and segfaults
15:37 < ChillerDragon> soydev rust devs in 2024 have checks and memory safety
15:37 < ChillerDragon> there is a crate for that!
15:37 < ChillerDragon> has become the new rust developer slogan
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i always wanted to see a java runtime that disables all safety checks, not for production
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> simply to see perf benefits xd
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ofc this wont really work bcs u can catch the exceptions thrown, but would still be a funny project
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in rust, disable all "hidden" panics
15:38 < ChillerDragon> which he uses for checking if numbers are even. That crate then depends on two other crates
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so those u cant unwrap
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> would also be cool
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well the funny thing about rust vs c is
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that rust theoretically has perf optimizations that c can't directly have
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so it's harder to write faster c code than rust
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but in reality it's not the case anyway
15:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> if llvm didnt have bugs

15:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Originally, no implemented constant folding can handle constant global aggregate-type values with variable index access. This was the first issue I tackled on LLVM. Throughout the project, I decided to split the problem step by step and make the patch as small as possible.

15:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
15:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> > LLVM function arguments can have attributes, i.e. noalias shows there is no other pointer variable that points to the same as the argument, and readonly shows that the argument is not modified in the function. Functions attributed noalias and readonly at the same position show invariance during the execution of the functions. If it‚Äôs also attributed with nocapture, we can omit the memcpy of argument to pass for such functions. But to completely

This can be addressed by SimplifyCFG and InstCombine/InstSimplify. For the former SwitchToLookupTable on SimplifyCFG is the place to handle this.
15:44 < bridge> <fokkonaut> its ez
15:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 4. Stack Move Optimization, which merges the allocas neither captured nor simultaneously used
15:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
15:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Rust‚Äôs move semantics introduce memcpy when values are 1) rebind to the variables, 2) passed by value to the functions. But for most cases, also due to the property of the Rust references, both pointers aren‚Äôt used simultaneously. By using alias/dataflow analysis, we could find such patterns on LLVM-IR. Originally, liveness-analysis approach was proposed, but it stalled for a long time. So I pushed forward by splitting it‚Äôs patch.
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not only that
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> expensive optimizations take longer the more code you have
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so huge code bases would be really slow to compile
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u already see this with LTO
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> which is probably not the best you could get
15:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> U use BlmapChill? üòÇ
15:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki btw do u also do optimizations at job?
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> for llvm?
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> or for our code
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess for the code translation
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> most projects we have consistently have benchmarks and we track if there are regressions
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i c
15:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> also flamegraphs etc
16:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks i got a new project at work
16:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a language our company will use
16:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> more xp with compilers kek
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cool
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'll soon work at chillerdragon.corp
16:14 < bridge> <gerdoe> at grindr?
16:14 < bridge> <gerdoe> jkjk xd
16:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "Grindr is the world's largest social networking app for gay, bi, trans, and queer people."
16:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller u gay?
16:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> never heard about it before tbh xD
16:15 < ChillerDragon> i am not gay
16:15 < ChillerDragon> who says im gay?
16:15 < bridge> <gerdoe> your pfp
16:15 < ChillerDragon> ah fair xd
16:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well supporter or LGBTQ dont need to be part of it i guess xd
16:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but at least it increases the chance
16:16 < ChillerDragon> jopsti u fr dont know grinder?
16:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no soz
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am not the social networkist guy u'll find
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> discord is my socialist network
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> socialister network
16:17 < bridge> <waxuel> hi
16:17 < bridge> <waxuel> how to protect my server against bots
16:17 < ChillerDragon> wat bots
16:18 < bridge> <gerdoe> don't make your server ip public
16:18 < bridge> <gerdoe> nice option
16:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> only protection against bots is doing a nacked LAN party with metal detectors on your own PCs
16:19 < bridge> <waxuel> there must be a better option
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u should answer the question of the guy that is tagged with "bot"
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what kind of bots
16:19 < bridge> <gerdoe> xdd
16:20 < bridge> <gerdoe> kinda ironic
16:20 < bridge> <waxuel> Think of it as real people taking up space in the game, but they're all afk
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if they are bot connections a first would be collect their IPs
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> additionally, try to block known VPS and/or VPN IPs

17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> amazing
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> factorio is my top 3 game
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> - ddnet

17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> - factorio
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> - terraria
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> they all different genre so they are all top 1 in each
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
17:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> have you played stardew valley?
17:46 < bridge> <cyberfighter> i dont like that game

17:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 does modulo has same precedence as mul?
17:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> on most languages i mean
17:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems like it's the default in "C style" languages for mult/div/mod to have the same precedence
18:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what @robyt3 says
18:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it kinda makes sense, too, it's a similar operaton
18:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (in python: `i == i // 3 + i % 3`)
18:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I like requiring parentheses instead of setting a precedence for `&` and `|` btw üòâ
18:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. `(a & b) == c` is fine, `a & (b == c)` is fine, but `a & b == c` is a syntax error
18:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in C, `0 & 1 == 0` evaluates to `0`, but in python, it evaluates to `True`
18:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> much fun
18:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Activate inactive kick option
18:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @learath2 let's get https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7683 over the line?
18:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm okay with the busy waiting
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> omg
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> 1.63
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> its old but not as old!
19:50 < bridge> <learath2> Do we have anyone from dusseldorf here?
19:51 < bridge> <learath2> I can fix the stuff Robyt mentioned tomorrow. Do you have anything you want fixed yourself?
19:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i know one xd
20:06 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> im tired of this shitass mf bloatware, what should i use instead of VS or CLion, vim or nevim or emacs or maybe vscode(not big fan)? preferably it should work on windows and linux
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> vscodium
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in 20 years you can finally use lapce
20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when it's stable and feature rich
20:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> neovim :greenthing:
20:08 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> so this is just vscode without telemetry?
20:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's open-source vscode
20:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and without telemetry maybe(?)
20:09 < bridge> <saviam> üòÇ
20:09 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> vscode is open-source
20:09 < bridge> <saviam> i use vscodium and sometimes helix
20:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> helix deez nuts :justatest:
20:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> nope. but microsoft tries telling everyone that, but it's not
20:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> vscodium is the open-source part of vscode
20:10 < bridge> <saviam> where's the problem ?
20:11 < bridge> <gerdoe> vscode or neovim with shitton of plugins
20:12 < bridge> <gerdoe> yep and funny part that you can use microsoft extension marketplace instead of vscodium default one
20:12 < bridge> <gerdoe> yup
20:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> is that some hogwarts place? xdd
20:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> D√ºsseldorf
20:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's a big city in germany
20:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> it reminds me of harry potter
20:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> im sry
20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> angst potter
20:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I probably wouldn't know a city of this size in other countries üòÖ
20:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
20:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> funny thing this reminded me japanese love german stuff
20:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> they use it in animes
20:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> names
20:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ye, that's funny ^^

20:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> "german"
20:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok the intro :d
20:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 lol
20:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> i googled japanese german
20:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_people_in_Germany
20:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> dusseldorf is first
20:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yep
20:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1192912211606245458/image.png?ex=65aacd12&is=65985812&hm=0c0cf5fa1a4e6623eab7eb3d691be0ea6a80d316d421a12d4e6426578d03cdde&
20:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> my friends with japanese roots have family in d√ºsseldorf
20:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > Sind sie das essen? Nein, wir sind der J√§ger!
20:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > Angriff auf die Titanen
20:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > Der Junge von einst wird bald zum Schwert greifen
20:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > 
20:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > Wer nur seine Machtlosigkeit beklagt kann, nichts ver√§ndern
20:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > Der Junge von einst wird bald das schwarze Schwert ergreifen
20:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > Hass und Zorn sind eine zweischneidige Klinge
20:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > Bald, eines Tages, wird er dem Schicksal die Z√§hne zeigen
20:33 < bridge> <learath2> I'll be in dusseldorf for a day or two if any of you live there
20:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Do german ppl rly can hear "Sind sie das essen? Nein, wir sind der J√§ger"? Sounds more like shhcjdhajzichshxhsg :justatest:
20:37 < bridge> <learath2> Is this attack on titan op1?
20:42 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah it is op1. I can only hear "Having the sex with the bees and the eagles" there üôÉ
20:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> xDDDDD
20:44 < bridge> <learath2> Btw lots of AOT ost is german completely. Like Vogel im K√§fig and T:T
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> anybody used https://mixxx.org/
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill become a dj
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> its open source
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> linux
20:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> does it use rust?
20:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> c++
20:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1192916709154230342/latenight-palemoon-3840x2160.png?ex=65aad142&is=65985c42&hm=d4ea54467db6e5186a654dd2a239afc481cc6c27f479c1db54851b983fdd5cc1&
20:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> looks cool
20:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> it has a gentoo package
20:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> no rust, red flag :santatrollet:
20:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> by "german completely" you mean "uses german words"
20:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not necessarily in an order that produces a meaning
20:45 < bridge> <learath2> Are you sure? The lyrics look like full sentences to me
20:46 < bridge> <learath2> Not that I speak german
20:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or pronounced in a way that native speakers can understand them
20:46 < bridge> <aegisub> it's lyrics that come up later in the full song but they're not in the tv size OP
20:46 < bridge> <gerdoe> looks better than virtualdj ngl
20:46 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> you forget mindustry and principia
20:47 < bridge> <gerdoe> factorio > mindustry
20:47 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> mindustry != factorio
20:47 < bridge> <learath2> Probably not understandable to native speakers the way they pronounced, but the written lyrics themselves look more than just random words thrown in
20:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the written stuff does look somewhat intelligible, yea‚Ä¶
20:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm
20:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe I was wrong about that
20:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > are they food (maybe prey?)? no, we're the hunters/predators.
20:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > 
20:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > attack on the titans
20:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > the boy of yore will soon reach for the sword
20:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > hate and wrath are a double-edged sword
20:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > soon, one day, he'll show fate his teeth
20:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure whether "to show someone one's teeth" is an idiom in english, too, but maybe? https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/show_one%27s_teeth
20:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> with subtitles, I can hear it
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bro i hate that rustfmt is breaking so often silently, no errors, nothing
21:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you mean in macros?
21:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno it often has trouble with long lines etc.
21:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah currently it is broken in a proc macro (so not inside a macro)
21:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> normal rust syntax
21:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it might not touch anything in macros
21:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which is pretty annoying üò¶
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well it worked 2 days ago
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i dont always notice when it breaks xd
21:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah üò¶
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and "left behind trailing whitespace" is also a common bug i have
21:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and that one is at least written to cmd line
21:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok no
21:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's just the thing it would fix
21:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i got that wrong, but it's not fixing it xD
21:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just find it weird that it simply does nothing.. --verbose also shows nothing
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it could at least say "no i can't do that and skip" or smth
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rustfmt --edition=2021 --verbose lib.rs 
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Formatting src/lib.rs
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Spent 0.001 secs in the parsing phase, and 0.013 secs in the formatting phase
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
21:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's all i get xd
21:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```rust
21:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hi_closure!([a: i32, b: &i32], |arg: i32| -> i32 { arg + a + *b + 1 })
21:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
21:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my custom explicit closure syntax xdd
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well if you missing a item the error is a bit useless:
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can't capture dynamic environment in a fn item
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> use the `|| { ... }` closure form instead
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i guess i'll just add to docs and call it a day xdd
21:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well if you missing a item the error is a bit useless:
21:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
21:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can't capture dynamic environment in an fn item in the capture list
21:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> use the `|| { ... }` closure form instead
21:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
21:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i guess i'll just add to docs and call it a day xdd

21:27 < bridge> <learath2> Why do you need it?
21:27 < bridge> <learath2> Are you injecting stuff?
21:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i want all captures to have a trait implemented
21:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i need to make sure they do
21:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else the closure is not panic-safe for Rc<RefCell>
21:28 < bridge> <learath2> Can't have that with Fn?
21:28 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, they are probably also not fixed form closures
21:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> gimme a second
21:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i give u an example
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```rust
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> struct MyStruct {
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>     a: i32,
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> }
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> impl MyStruct {
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>     fn test<F>(&self, a_normal_closure: F) where F: Fn() {
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>         a_normal_closure();
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>     }
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> }
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> fn main() {
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>     let a = Rc::new(RefCell::new(MyStruct {a: 1}));
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>     let b = a.clone();
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>     
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>     let c = a.borrow_mut();
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>     c.test(|| b.borrow_mut().a += 1);
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> }
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs i passed b into the closure and have a borrowed mut
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> => panic
21:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but if MyStruct implements Hiarc trait
21:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it can't pass itself into that function call, bcs the hirarchical value must be smaller
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's not 100% how i did that, bcs actually there is a wrapper around it
21:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but u could imagine it similar to this
22:27 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ChillerDragon I found yet another useful program https://github.com/mwh/dragon but only if you use terminal file managers
22:27 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> So now I can drag and drop files from lf (https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) without needing to open thunar :)
23:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im a Gnomie I use nautilus
23:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You there now?
23:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> did u know u can use port 0 to use free port ü§Ø
23:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
23:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> üê¥
23:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ggffgrgrg
23:14 < bridge> <teero777> horse
23:15 < bridge> <teero777> cool terminal file manager
23:15 < bridge> <teero777> https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi
23:15 < bridge> <teero777> im sure ryo would like it
23:16 < bridge> <teero777> im sure ryo will like it
23:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> epyc
23:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need a epyc cpu
23:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> same
