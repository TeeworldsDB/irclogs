15:31 <+quinerr> hi, any dev here?
15:33 <+quinerr> I'm worried about the license of DejaVuSansCJKName.ttf
15:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Why?
15:36 <+quinerr> its copyright field is simply 'DejaVu changes are in public domain'
15:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> that should be fine
15:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/License.html
15:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> "Note that the Vera copyright is incorporated in the fonts themselves. The License field in the fonts contains the copyright license as it appears below. The TrueType copyright field is not large enough to contain the full license, so the license is incorporated (as you might think if you thought about it) into the license field, which unfortunately can be obscure to find. (In pfaedit, see: Elemen <message clipped>
15:43 <+quinerr> ok i stole the license header from another package
15:43 <+quinerr> thank u
16:08 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> is it normal that my velocity on the x-axis = 1 when i am standing still
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Fin> Where did you check? In the client with ctrl+shift+d?
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> when i enter the game it is 0
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> but when i move and then stand still it is 1
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> lol
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> @Fin i print it on console
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Fin> what if you jumed?
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> @Fin  from m_Snap.m_pLocalCharacter->m_VelX;
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Fin> aha
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Fin> What does it shows after a jump?
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> @Fin the same
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> oops
16:17 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> after i walk left and then stand still it shows -1
16:17 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> m_snap doesnt update?
16:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Fin> Seems like
16:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Fin> Looks like it is only updating if you move...
16:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> what happens if you hold down the key
16:18 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> @Ram then its like 2560
16:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> check snap i guess fin is right
16:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Guys, let's make some bitcoin miners
16:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Fin> But you can change the updater and modify it so it updates if by a slow clock as well (just try to keep actions low)
16:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> But why would u send useless packets?
16:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> If you dont move why would u need to update then anyways
16:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Fin> No I mean traceing actions
16:28 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> i just set it to 0 manually when its -1 or 1
16:28 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> it wont matter in the end
16:53 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> sure
16:53 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> it is a float
16:53 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> and it only gets diveded
16:53 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> and it only gets diveded on slowdown. So it never will be set too zer0. If you just stop moving
16:53 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i think it gets set to zero if u walk agianst a wall
16:54 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> @Savander what do you mean by "making bitcoin miners" hehe? writing some or setting up some mining rigs?
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> rigs
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> @ChillerDragon nice thanks botmaster
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I have power plant near to me
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i have 8 computzer running
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> let's make money
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> im mining since months lel
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> we need good hardware ! and money for a start
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> lol
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> 100 gtx1080
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ZimE while i mede my serverside bots i had an ugly check where i checked if x vel was smaller than 0.00xx and bigger than -0.00xx something to check if the tee is standing still
16:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> One guy from poland, has one 1milion $ worth equipment, and do 250$ of pure profit
16:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> üòÆ
16:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> on bitcoins
16:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 250k$*
16:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no 250
16:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :D:D
16:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> you could also check if velocity does not change @ChillerDragon
16:59 <+nemo2> 10:53 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> and it only gets diveded on slowdown. So it never will be set too zer0. If you just stop moving
16:59 <+nemo2> printf("%.1000f",DBL_MIN/DBL_MAX);
16:59 <+nemo2> ? ‚ò∫
16:59 <+nemo2> I have no idea if that is pedantism or not. depends on your code
17:00 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i could ye
17:00 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but it works
17:09 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> @ChillerDragon never change working system!
17:41 <@heinrich5991> nemo2: we "quantize" after each tick, casting to an integer and back
17:41 <@heinrich5991> to become more deterministic, I believe
17:41 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon mining isn't profitable
17:41 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> at least not with graphic cards
17:41 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you should rather buy bitcoin if you want some
17:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it is, if you have enough money to start
17:42 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> not if you mine with graphic cards
17:42 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you'll pay more on electricity than you get back
17:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> he's doing it
17:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> with 4k cpus
17:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i mean, i talking about one guy up
17:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> before
17:42 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> then he's throwing money away
17:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no, he has profit
17:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 250k$ a month
17:43 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> well, then he doesn't do cpu mining
17:43 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> YOu assume, he's lying? ^^
17:43 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> no
17:44 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I assume he doesn't use CPUs for mining
17:44 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but rather custom hardware
17:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://gyazo.com/58fc6e5553dd0fa11ae07d49716a0371
17:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://gyazo.com/83a55ba0890c172b46ff14cc8ccf91c4
17:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it looks, horrible
17:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> But, i trust him that he uses CPU's üòõ As he said
17:46 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> do you also trust facts?
17:46 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> or will you still believe him if I back my statement that CPU mining cannot be profitable for bitcoin?
17:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> depends on the electricty cost ma friend
17:47 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes
17:47 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but it's poland
17:47 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> we here in india dont pay too much
17:47 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but still
17:48 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> graphic cards are probably 100x cheaper or so, if not more
17:48 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> (probably even more)
17:48 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> (in terms of bitcoin / kWh of electricity)
17:50 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Savander you can probably just search with google. search about the profits of CPU-mining bitcoin
17:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I see that I didn't mention one thing ( I was sure that I do)
17:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> His place is near to wind power plants, where he has cheaper costs
17:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> then tell him to mine with GPUs or ASICs for improved returns üòÉ
17:53 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I'll take of 1% the improvement for the advice üòâ
17:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> People asked him
17:53 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I mean he can't be that stubborn if he has that much money, can he?
17:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> He said, that GPU's are good for Etherum
17:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no idea, probably he has more experience than we
17:54 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> and for bitcoin
17:54 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> just google it, ok?
17:54 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I'm afk
17:54 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I can give you the referneces later
17:54 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but I think you're being a bit bold if you now say that you don't have the experience
17:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> bold?
17:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Why
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> https://youtu.be/_S1tUnb64CU pls fix hehe
17:58 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ddnet client can be haxxed
18:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like what
18:02 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ?
18:11 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> :D
18:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> CPU mining really is a waste, I mean if he is making that much profit with CPU mining, imagine the returns on ASIC mining
18:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ram> its not hacking
19:08 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> @ChillerDragon is the position of a tee right in the middle of the tee?
20:17 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i think so
20:17 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but i didnt test it yet but it would make sense i guess
20:18 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> ye it is
21:08 <+nemo2> heh. yeah. kinda kicking myself at this point for the many many lost opportunities over the years
21:08 <+nemo2> (WRT ‡∏ø )
21:09 <+nemo2> I mean FFS I had folks obsessed w/ crypto linking me to it almost from day one, when all I had to do was download client and fire it up
21:09  * nemo2 ‚Üê idiot
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I wanted to buy in at 240$ 500$ 1000$ 2400$ each time someone told me it's a bubble
21:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I didn't buy it skyrocketed
21:18 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> @Learath2 BUY NOW
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> already did
21:19 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> @Learath2 its going down next month
21:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> yeah waiting to buy more at the dip
21:22 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> @Learath2 how about some http://dogecoin.com/
21:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> should get some of those in the unlikely event they ever worth sth
21:23 <+ddnet-discord> <ZimE> xDDD
21:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it's actually pretty stably worth nothing
21:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://deeponion.org/
21:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> :)
21:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Monero best
21:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> that one is good
21:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> "DeepOnion An anonymous and 100% untraceable cryptocurrency sent through the TOR network."
21:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> 1 GPU = ~28 CPUs
21:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> 1 ASIC first-gen = ~33 GPUs
21:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> 1 ASIC today = ~212 ASICs first-gen
21:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> (at mining)
21:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://hackernoon.com/oh-bitcoin-is-still-a-thing-should-i-start-mining-then-f5c015adc1f4
21:42 <+eeeee> serious question: are there any coins that are only cpu mineable? meaning they are designed in such a way that GPUs or ASICs are not applicable because there's too much branching or sth.
22:25 <@deen> eeeee: sure, there are gpu-only coins (high memory use) as well
22:26 <@deen> the cpu-only ones should be popular for javascript mining on websites
22:27 <@deen> at least until someone makes a webgl miner
