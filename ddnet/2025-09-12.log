00:07 < bridge> <Assa> nah I found a bug, me stupid
00:07 < bridge> <Assa> time to redo everything again fml
00:12 < bridge> <kebscs> @chillerdragon after this whats going to be left is just <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10850> and `bugprone-crtp-constructor-accessibility` and `modernize-use-override`
00:15 < bridge> <kebscs> can check `modernize-use-override` maybe tomorrow
00:16 < bridge> <kebscs> and crtp is some jank idk how to fix that
06:03 < bridge> <blazulite> The DDNet repo reached 700 stars!! :owo:

08:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'm surprised you still think i care about benefits. I only care about having a general solution over a special cased one. And if they basically perform the same, perfect
08:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yay thanks for working on that @kebscs
08:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> !remind 60 send order to rob after coffee
08:46 < chillerbot12> Helo chillerdragon I will remind you at Fri Sep 12 2025 09:46:26 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.
08:49 < bridge> <jxsl13> Jupstar - destroyer of hopes and dreams.
08:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @robyt3: without looking at the list (which I would actually need) I assume you reviewed most anyways. Except the bug fix that changes physics :D the start of my planned projectile bug fix series
08:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That one I would really like to get into ASAP
08:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10399
08:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That one I would really like to get in ASAP
09:11 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon I believe you can take a look on the rotation clipping PR, it's really simple üòÆ
09:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @essigautomat 
09:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> > The calculations are done as you suggested, with the green bounding box.
09:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> > But only if the envelope contains rotation at all. Otherwise it resumes to the old behavior
09:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This is btw exactly what i wanted to prevent.. having a special case üòÇ
09:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well anyway, you don't need to revert it now
09:19 < bridge> <Assa> idk why I should calculate this, if 99% of all quads never rotate <.< this just makes the bounding box worse
09:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes, and code readability too
09:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You should first do the general case, and then hyper optimize
09:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You started with hyperoptimized without even having the general case
09:21 < bridge> <Assa> do you think the current code is too complicated? I find it quite readable
09:22 < bridge> <Assa> the grouping makes it maybe a bit unreadable, due to hyperoptimization üôà
09:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> idc anynow now
09:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my main goal was you to now skip rotated quads
09:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and that is achieved now
09:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üèÖ
09:25 < bridge> <Assa> I love four boundry box skid btw, it has some flavor to it
09:46 < chillerbot12> Elo @chillerdragon I just wanted to remind you that: send order to rob after coffee

10:20 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon can we merge #10864 ?
10:20 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10864
11:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes its close to ready. Maybe I have one final look tomorrow morning.
11:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or ping lerato he will merge it with eyes closed now xd

17:01 < bridge> <rehoboamrulit> 1. Does anyone have any developments of anti tas system? Well, like a ready-made solution that creates micrologs
17:01 < bridge> <rehoboamrulit> 2. Is it possible to make it so that I can distribute the command to all my servers running on ports 8303 8304 and so on
17:01 < bridge> <rehoboamrulit> so that it is executed on all of them at once?
17:02 < ChillerDragon> @rehoboamrulit which servers are yours? do you have a lot of tas users?
17:03 < ChillerDragon> there is nothing public as far as i know
17:05 < bridge> <kebscs> tasers are really lazy, just compare if 2 finishes have exact same time or really close time, then get few random positions from 1st run, and compare if same positions were visited in 2nd run
17:06 < bridge> <kebscs> thats what i would do, simple and would detect some
17:06 < bridge> <kebscs> on ddnet this check could be applied to only top10 times and really make cheaters life harder
17:06 < bridge> <kebscs> but admins afk

17:16 < bridge> <louis> devs afk*
17:17 < bridge> <teero777> and who has access to the antibot? and who can delete times? only admins xd
17:18 < bridge> <louis> u dont need antibot or ssh to ask learath for teehistorian files to test tas detection scripts tho
17:18 < bridge> <kebscs> no access to antibot or teehistorian
17:19 < bridge> <louis> i think learath is ok with sending teehistorian files with tassed ranks to contributors who are interested in them
17:19 < bridge> <kebscs> if its not accessible doubt anyone will ask
17:19 < bridge> <kebscs> for the files
17:20 < bridge> <melon> we have multiple terabytes of teehistorian data
17:20 < bridge> <kebscs> share some for the players/devs
17:20 < bridge> <kebscs> or just wasting storage space
17:21 < bridge> <louis> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1395540008496140288
17:21 < bridge> <louis> 
17:21 < bridge> <louis> u can probably dm learath
17:21 < bridge> <louis> i also asked for some a while ago but never did anything with it xd
17:22 < bridge> <kebscs> so if learath's pc dies, all data is lost?
17:22 < bridge> <kebscs> not sure if thats good for the game
17:22 < bridge> <louis> wat
17:22 < bridge> <melon> it's obviously not saved locally xd
17:22 < bridge> <kebscs> if its gatekept it could be saved locally noone would know
17:23 < bridge> <melon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1416081671597326489/image.png?ex=68c58c54&is=68c43ad4&hm=016ab59b0cc8f7ea636b5b7d815e719820df691608c4aa8e2908079520820744&
17:23 < bridge> <melon> from #
17:23 < bridge> <melon> is it gatekept if all it takes is to ask ._.
17:23 < bridge> <kebscs> yes
17:25 < bridge> <learath2> Not only okay, I've given multiple people many files
17:27 < bridge> <learath2> Deen keeps a full archive, heinrich keeps a full archive, I keep just a sample. So if deen and heinrich suffer catastrophic multiple harddisk failure yes it would be lost
17:28 < bridge> <learath2> Deen keeps a full archive, heinrich keeps a full archive, I keep just a sample. So if deen and heinrich suffer catastrophic multiple harddisk failure at the same time yes it would be lost
17:28 < bridge> <louis> oh interesting, whats the full size?
17:28 < bridge> <learath2> More than 3TB compressed, I know because that's where I ran out of storage
17:30 < bridge> <kebscs> maybe the situation with the wiki could tell thats not a good idea of storing data
17:30 < bridge> <learath2> I think one of Patiga or Zwelf also might have a full mirror now
17:31 < bridge> <learath2> I mean it's as secure as it gets, both deen and heinrich have it on RAID storage. There would need to be a catastrophic event
17:31 < bridge> <learath2> At the size it is I highly doubt anyone else would be interested in syncing a full mirror themselves anyway
17:32 < bridge> <melon> if i ever decide to set up my NAS properly with the 20TB HDD, i might :Pepega:
17:32 < bridge> <melon> if i ever decide to set up my NAS properly with the 20TB HDD (i want to get at some point), i might :Pepega:
17:33 < bridge> <pilonpl> Full mirror would be too much for most people
17:34 < bridge> <pilonpl> But if there was a system for contributing for example 100gb of redundancy that would be cool
17:34 < bridge> <rehoboamrulit> k gores , There are users of tas and their normal
17:34 < bridge> <kebscs> exactly
17:35 < bridge> <kebscs> even a lot smaller
17:35 < bridge> <kebscs> idk why theres not even a small sample
17:35 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe a top10 pruned version
17:35 < bridge> <pilonpl> I was thinking of something more robust
17:36 < bridge> <pilonpl> Like bittorrent but you set a limited amount of storage
17:36 < bridge> <pilonpl> And it could choose chunks which have the keast redundancy
17:36 < bridge> <pilonpl> And it could choose chunks which have the least redundancy
17:37 < bridge> <pilonpl> It would be very useful actually
17:37 < bridge> <pilonpl> Preserving things by a shared effort is a concept i really like
17:38 < bridge> <learath2> Bigger problem is that the community doesn't seem to agree on whether the runs should even be public at all
17:40 < bridge> <learath2> Overall, don't be worried about redundancy and/or if you need a sample (or even the full archive for a larger project). Samples of whatever size your project needs is always provided upon request and both the archives we have are in fairly redundant storage
17:42 < bridge> <pilonpl> What can this data even be used for
17:42 < bridge> <pilonpl> What does it even include
17:42 < bridge> <learath2> Many cool things. It's pretty much every single input ever performed on ddnet within the last half a decade
17:43 < bridge> <learath2> Lots of data analysis, bot detection, AI research possible
17:43 < bridge> <learath2> You can also do cool data visualization projects for cool videos and gifs
17:44 < bridge> <pilonpl> So like is converting it to a demo technically possible?
17:44 < bridge> <pilonpl> Is there some like public sample that i can just download?
17:44 < bridge> <learath2> There are 2 tools that already do it
17:45 < bridge> <learath2> Zwelfs tee-hee creates pretty accurate demos
17:45 < bridge> <Dreamless> That's very good marketing..I'd like to have 2 copies please
17:45 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, idk if we have any public samples, maybe we can pick a handful to have available for curious people
17:45 < bridge> <pilonpl> Is chat included
17:46 < bridge> <learath2> No chat
17:46 < bridge> <pilonpl> Right i guess it might have not been legal to just share chat data
17:46 < bridge> <pilonpl> Idk
17:47 < bridge> <pilonpl> So how quickly does the archive grow?
17:47 < bridge> <louis> are there emotes?
17:48 < bridge> <learath2> I don't remember
17:48 < bridge> <learath2> Probably
17:48 < bridge> <kebscs> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/1272531556183048253
17:48 < bridge> <kebscs> 90 votes vs 10
17:48 < bridge> <learath2> Didn't keep track
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think this is actually a bug in my kernel or os lol.
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i remember seeing failed http requests in my browser.. probs similar reason
17:49 < bridge> <louis> 88 vs 12 :thonk:
17:49 < bridge> <pilonpl> Okay but like some useful value like X gb per month
17:49 < bridge> <pilonpl> Or per time per server
17:50 < bridge> <pilonpl> Or per time per person
17:50 < bridge> <pilonpl> I am actually interested in a sample now lol
17:50 < bridge> <learath2> I don't have the full archive to check, we can ask @0xdeen to give a rough estimate when he is around
17:51 < bridge> <pilonpl> I guess me first joining a server is also saved
17:52 < bridge> <pilonpl> Also how is the data stored anyways
17:52 < bridge> <pilonpl> Probably in chunks
17:53 < bridge> <learath2> At what level? It's a stream of inputs, input changes and player positions, for each tick
17:53 < bridge> <learath2> + some extra data needed for reproduction. Like team changes and other chat commands
17:53 < bridge> <pilonpl> On the high level can you find a specific time or server?
17:54 < bridge> <learath2> Yes you can, we have it indexed by time, server, port, map
17:54 < bridge> <learath2> Also we keep track of what teehistorian file every finished run ends up in
17:55 < bridge> <pilonpl> And how big are the individual files
17:55 < bridge> <learath2> Differs from 1kb to I think 300G
17:55 < bridge> <learath2> Uncompressed that is
17:55 < bridge> <learath2> Differs from 1kb to I think 100G
17:56 < bridge> <pilonpl> It's interesting
17:57 < bridge> <learath2> The smallest ones are where someone changes the map immediately
17:58 < bridge> <learath2> The most annoying thing about working with the files is that you need a working physics simulation to get a demo
17:59 < bridge> <learath2> Teehee uses twgame which is pretty accurate nowadays but still isn't perfect
17:59 < bridge> <pilonpl> What if physics change?
18:00 < bridge> <learath2> We change the teehistorian version to keep track of physics changes
18:00 < bridge> <pilonpl> But is that manual
18:00 < bridge> <learath2> Basically anything that would affect reproducibility we mark with a teehistorian version bump
18:00 < bridge> <pilonpl> What if there is a change that no one knew about
18:01 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, if we somehow forget to then we have to parse the files further for the git hash the server was running
18:01 < bridge> <pilonpl> Floating point is weird too
18:01 < bridge> <pilonpl> The compiler might compile it differently technically
18:01 < bridge> <pilonpl> And change the behaviour
18:02 < bridge> <pilonpl> Git hash should be good enough i guess
18:02 < bridge> <pilonpl> But still technically not prefect if you can't reproduce the server binary
18:03 < bridge> <pilonpl> I guess it doesn't really matter
18:03 < bridge> <pilonpl> In practice
18:03 < bridge> <learath2> If we get some bizarre frankenbug that only happens on CHN we also store the server
18:03 < bridge> <pilonpl> So all the data is there
18:03 < bridge> <pilonpl> But it might be next to impossible to get out all of it
18:03 < bridge> <learath2> It should be unless we missed something
18:04 < bridge> <pilonpl> I am really curious about the physics
18:04 < bridge> <learath2> Very early teehistorian files suffer from non-deterministic teleports iirct
18:05 < bridge> <learath2> Those need a special case to resolve the destination with player position in the next tick instead
18:06 < bridge> <pilonpl> Yeah
18:06 < bridge> <pilonpl> So is there any documentation of this format
18:08 < bridge> <pilonpl> And i guess the format itself doesn't have compression and files are compressed using standard methods
18:09 < bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/doc%2Fteehistorian.md
18:09 < bridge> <learath2> Yep, the entries are very compressible. We used to use xz for a while, then moved to zstd
18:10 < bridge> <pilonpl> Great
18:11 < bridge> <pilonpl> What are those UUIDs?
18:13 < bridge> <learath2> Extra messages for stuff we added later
18:14 < bridge> <pilonpl> But why use 16 bytes?
18:14 < bridge> <pilonpl> Isn't that a bit much
18:15 < bridge> <pilonpl> I guess those additional messages aren't emitted often
18:16 < bridge> <pilonpl> Also what are namespaces
18:17 < bridge> <pilonpl> Like wtf is teehistorian@ddnet.tw
18:18 < bridge> <learath2> You should read up on uuids
18:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no way
18:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i thought that would never get merged
18:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 1 step closer to google play xd
18:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> servers and clients may add netmsgs in random order so their id cant be depndent on the order so it does the magic (hash) to some strings that describe the type to generate a number (16 bytes) of [very likley to be a univerisally unique] (UU) identifier (ID)
18:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> a space often named to put other names, idk what the email format is called when its not referring to emails but it uses that and ddnet.tw is the namespace and teehistorian the name
18:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (i tried)
18:39 < bridge> <learath2> Wrong uuids. These are the teehistorian ones not the netmsg ones
18:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oops!
18:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> same thing tho right
18:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> servers  may add teehistorian msgs (?) in random order so their id cant be depndent on the order so it does the magic (hash) to some strings that describe the type to generate a number (16 bytes) of [very likley to be a univerisally unique] (UU) identifier (ID)
18:40 < bridge> <pilonpl> Yeah but what do those mean in the tee historian spec
18:40 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah the exact same idea. There is one last teehistorian entry type called EX, that extends teehistorian the same way
18:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> a teehistorian entry, which i dont know what they are but a unit of data of some kind
18:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> a teehistorian entry, which i dont know what they are but a unit of data of some type
18:41 < bridge> <pilonpl> Like why do i need the string "teehistorian-save-success@ddnet.tw"
18:41 < bridge> <pilonpl> How does it help me with anything
18:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you know the data in that msg is a teehistorian save success msg
18:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh
18:42 < bridge> <pilonpl> Okay but the string isn't saved in the file right
18:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no the 16 bytes are
18:42 < bridge> <pilonpl> The uuid pf that message is saved
18:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the string is much longer than the 16 bytes
18:42 < bridge> <pilonpl> So why is the string necessary
18:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but both are almost garunteed to be unique
18:42 < bridge> <pilonpl> Why does it exist
18:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the string is human readable, the uuid isnt
18:43 < bridge> <pilonpl> Well i guess
18:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> people wont naturally avoid eachother generating random uuids, but they will with strings
18:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> especially when they uses namespaces
18:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> people using the ddnet.tw namespcae will be cooporating so wont collide
18:43 < bridge> <pilonpl> So is just to have a stabdarized way of refering to messages?
18:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> standard way of making smaller uuids from bigger uuids
18:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> standard way of making smaller uuids (called uuids) from bigger uuids
18:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think we use uuids v2
18:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no we use 4

18:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ~~standard way of making smaller uuids (called uuids) from bigger uuids~~
18:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i hate discord so much, it lags and it doesnt even replay my inputs in the same order when it catches up
18:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> telegram is basically discord minus server management and spyware and their client is butter smooth
18:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> uses qt6
18:51 < bridge> <pilonpl> Okay so those uuids are generated from the namespace + a name?
18:53 < bridge> <pilonpl> Weird but ok
18:53 < bridge> <pilonpl> So why are UUIDs used for extra messages?
19:17 < bridge> <pilonpl> What interesting statistics could we pull out
19:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> > servers  may add teehistorian msgs (?) in random order
19:31 < bridge> <pilonpl> and so what?
19:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> > so their id cant be depndent on the order
19:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> > so their id cant be depndent on the order [they are added]
19:31 < bridge> <pilonpl> okay but it could just be a random number

19:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> > people wont naturally avoid eachother generating random uuids, but they will with strings
19:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> > especially when they uses namespaces
19:32 < bridge> <pilonpl> okay
19:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the hasing algorithm is optimized to avoid collisions
19:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the namespace and name are probably hashed seperatley and combined
19:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the namespace is quite likely to be unique since people use domains
19:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> something they are confident will remain theirs forever
19:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (rip ddnet.tw)
19:35 < bridge> <pilonpl> i guess i have to record a teehistorian file and look at it
19:35 < bridge> <pilonpl> seems fairly easy to parse
19:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it is not
19:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it is not
19:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> FUCKING DISCORD STOP LAGGING
19:36 < bridge> <pilonpl> stupid discord
19:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i ahte discord
19:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> might become robo
19:37 < ws-client> **<SollyBunny2>** im robo now
19:37 < bridge> <pilonpl> discord should allow you to insert messages in the past
19:37 < ws-client> **<SollyBunny2>** eh
19:37 < ws-client> **<SollyBunny2>** replying and deleting and editing is fine
19:38 < ws-client> **<SollyBunny2>** if i could do it in a reasonable timeframe
19:38 < ws-client> **<SollyBunny2>** or discord would relay my inputs in the correct order after its done lagging
19:39 < bridge> <learath2> ```cpp
19:39 < bridge> <learath2> #beinhalte <cstdea>
19:39 < bridge> <learath2>

20:46 < bridge> <learath2> Also today at class they polled how many people has read the C standard and I was the only one in a class of like 50 people
20:46 < bridge> <learath2> So many people writing C without even knowing what the standard is, shameful
20:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Did you get respect or weird side eyes?
20:47 < bridge> <learath2> They know I'm the ancient one
20:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Soon there will be ppl in cs master that never read docs or specs ever in their life. Cuz llm.

20:51 < bridge> <blazulite> plz stick to english or I'm baningn you ‚òùÔ∏è
20:51 < bridge> <learath2> There are people in my software security class asking chatgpt where the bug is. It is so joever
20:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
20:51 < bridge> <learath2> You are paying money to learn how to do this stuff, why are you asking gpt??
20:51 < chillerbot12> You can see donors and how to donate here https://ddnet.org/funding/

20:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Is university expensive in ams?
20:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I would have expected it to be free-cheap
20:52 < bridge> <learath2> I'm banning your bot
20:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> .\_.
20:52 < bridge> <learath2> Cheap for europeons, very expensive for internationals
20:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That sounds discriminatory xd
20:53 < bridge> <louis> thats how it is in murica too
20:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wait what do students really get different prices based on where they are from?????
20:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Murica is expensive for everyone isn‚Äôt it
20:54 < bridge> <louis> yes, but internationals even more
20:55 < bridge> <learath2> Well, it's because the govt subsidizes europeons. So technically the uni is getting paid the same either way
20:57 < bridge> <learath2> The thinking is that internationals and their families haven't been paying taxes in the eu for years, so why should the eu use taxpayer money for them?
20:57 < chillerbot12> You can see donors and how to donate here https://ddnet.org/funding/
21:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I see
21:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2: sober October? Yes? No? Maybe?

22:05 < bridge> <blazulite> crazy
22:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> !remind 600 add issue with milestone of next release to either polish profanity filter or comment it out to avoid releasing wip features
22:08 < chillerbot12> Helo chillerdragon I will remind you at Sat Sep 13 2025 08:08:01 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) about your matter again.
22:46 < bridge> <Assa> > If we enable the "Show Info" option in the editor and change it to Dec or Hex then we are able to see the road our quad takes
22:46 < bridge> <Assa> Wtf is that hidden feature
22:48 < bridge> <soulyvevo> xd thats why i explained it first
22:48 < bridge> <soulyvevo> not many ppl seem to know about it
22:53 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, I already have a WIP branch to make it a distinct setting and other fixes, because it's really hidden behind "Show info" for no reason
22:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i wish to feel this powerful in a room of 50 people brb
23:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> theres alot of things not elaborated on which is a bit wack
23:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> theres lots of out of order and not defining things going on so far
23:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> a parameter is "paramater"
23:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thank you
23:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but it defines floor with examples
23:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and talking about headers and preprocessor directives at the start
23:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> bit weird
23:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i guess its a bit hard to do c from principle
23:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> > Each instance of a backslash character (\) immediately followed by a new-line
