01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> Is there some kind of keycode standard ddnet client uses for binds?  Not sure if i'm saying that right.  Like grave, kp_3, mouse1, etc.  Is this some kind of standard where I could find a reference for each key?  I know you can test keys in the controls settings but I'm wondering if there's some sort of reference or name for the standard for my binds guide.
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ah yea
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i thought there was one but im pretty sure it eventually deviates
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <stnwtr> dump_binds
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <stnwtr> (standard if you never changed anything)
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <stnwtr> or in the ddnet settings file
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> Ah thats not what I mean, maybe i'm not explaining correctly
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> nah that's not what they were asking
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> they mean like, is there a pattern or standard naming convention for all of the keybinds, not what binds they have
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> they mean like, is there a pattern or standard naming convention for all of the bindable keys, not what binds they have
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <stnwtr> oh
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <stnwtr> sorry hehe
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it would be cool to put noop binds for shit that you dont have bound yet
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so you can read the names in dump_binds
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> ya but i'd need every type of keyboard i'd imagine lol
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ill toy around with that
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> o well i just mean for qwerty
02:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> assumin that's what you use too
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> ya but we USA as hell
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lol
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah a client command that just returns all locale-aware bindable keys
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that would be soo cool
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> i feel like i'd either reference an actual page that shows every possible keycode or else just say you can find the keycodes by testing in the control settings
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> no reason to include a half list or something
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it would be cool tho if it only showed for your keyboard locale
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> ya tru
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but a lot of dev work for something so easily replaceable with a page like you said
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> going to bind all my shit to ANY_UNICODE and control ddnet with the windows 10 emoji keyboard
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is that a real target
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> in MPV it is anyway
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> a video player i use
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> o interesting
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> http://xahlee.info/linux/linux_show_keycode_keysym.html
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> "The naming roughly follows an internal scheme (?). "
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> according to the just bind it forum post
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> maybe no way to get a dump of all available codes
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/keysymdef.h
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> so i guess this but without the XK_ prefix
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> nvm i found it i think
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/client/keynames.h
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh so it's just x11
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> idk why that forum post links to a random page about x11 keysyms when the generator is using sdl scancodes
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Scancode
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ah nice
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> use the source luke
02:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> lol
02:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> i think the keynames file is a better reference
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> okay im terrible at commands
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> `curl https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/client/keynames.h | grep 'pl-pds">&quot;'`
02:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> how can i cut out the extra shit in the same line
02:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> shit im not good at curl
02:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> there's so much basic bash shit that i never bothered to get good at
02:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it just spits out every html line
02:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> like i still see 'awk' in places i have no idea why its there
02:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and i grepped only the stuff with quotes in it
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but now i gotta trim away all the other stuff but idk how to use sed
03:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lol
04:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> with aimbot , and others things bot
04:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> can be so much possible play than phone<aðŸ†’773232479191957524>
04:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkaS:
04:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> move on phone can be hard but with bots can be just some buttons
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> when you think your ddnet fork is merge safe... and jupeyy the madlad yeets out some big ass refactor
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Jupstar âœª\:  would be cool if you refactor the code to also apply it in vanilla so the code bases do not diverge further and further
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> XD
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <rick> sup
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hey :)
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <rick> whats up
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DiveGamerV2> @Moderator i wanted to say something i'm banned for evade i was completely off afk la e du nothing i'm banned for evade 1440 minutes for no reason multeasymap
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nexusrf> all these ghostpings smh
