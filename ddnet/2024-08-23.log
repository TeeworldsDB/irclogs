02:09 < bridge> <gumbatw> does this mean that junping converts a part of the x speed to y speed?
02:43 < bridge> <louis> no, iirc any sort of velocity in any direction makes your ramp value non-zero
02:43 < bridge> <louis> a higher ramp means your horizontal speed gets dampened (basically, you have a 'raw' horizontal speed which stays the same as long as you're still holding a/d, and a higher ramp will make that horizontal speed actually contribute less to your actual character's movement)
02:43 < bridge> <louis> that's why if you're falling down super super fast you can't move left or right as fast
02:44 < bridge> <louis> it also causes those weird movements with shotgun bug, etc.
02:44 < bridge> <louis> so i assume when you jump while moving rightward, since your overall speed increases just a bit (you're adding an upwards velocity), your ramp increases just a tiny amount, making your horizontal speed just a little lower
02:58 < bridge> <squeezy4813> it doesnt run

09:51 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hello everyone. I'm making a space simulation game with pure c and raylib. I'm currently stuck in delta timing, and making the game fps independent from calculating stuff. 
09:51 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> my question is:  how does ddnet handle all of this precisely.

09:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> my question is:  how does ddnet handle all of this precisely.
09:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> thank you for your replays.
10:09 < bridge> <teero777> ddnet doesn't use any kind of delta time logic since the server runs independently of the client so it will basically never drop blow 50 ticks per second.
10:10 < bridge> <teero777> the tick speed is constant at 50tps
10:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what will happens if your computer wasn't strong enough for 50 tps ?
10:27 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what will happens if your computer wasn't strong enough for 50 tps ? to run a server on it ?
10:27 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what will happens if your computer wasn't strong enough for 50 tps to run a server on it ?

11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe you cannot do it
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then your phone is buggy
11:32 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Some specific phone doesnt support the client, maybe you can find some logs about that, will be useful

11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it seems like older Mali GPUs are the bad ones in this case.

12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> other than that, no problems as far as i see
12:12 < bridge> <zhn> maybe its problem with error handling and not vulkan part initializing
12:12 < bridge> <zhn> :justatest:
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it crashes during initialization
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> at least for milkeeycat who was the only one that sent logs yet
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there is basically nothing we can do at that moment tho xD
12:13 < bridge> <zhn> huh
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> apparently it does have vk 1.0 support.
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and apparently it is 32-bit.
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I actually thought we dont even compile vk in 32 bit
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and does it work on yours? üòÑ
12:16 < bridge> <zhn> didn't test
12:17 < bridge> <zhn> should i :pepeH:

12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if one of you uses a custom rom while the other doesn't, maybe the result differs xD
12:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice found another tablet :lol:
12:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how many tablets do we have in our house man
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Samsung Exynos 9610
12:22 < bridge> <robyt3> @jupeyy_keks Maybe you could use Firebase Test Lab with a debug apk to test the devices that are reported to not work but where we didn't get any crash reports. Seems like there is a free tier that allows a few real device tests per day. A robo test would just have to click the quit button after 15 seconds to check if launching works. https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh yeah i used that once

12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> works on vk

12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is really the question if they also have outdated android versions
12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if milkeey has bugs while i dont on a similar gpu, then we probably simply have different drivers
12:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no, i speak in vulcanian üññ

16:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Yea i have read that in the issue/pr, but i'm specifcally talking about the overlap with long times, sorry
16:29 < bridge> <robyt3> not sure how to solve that
16:30 < bridge> <robyt3> maybe not showing the maximum if it's as large as the maximum number of clients would work in the common case, like `1\n(2/)` or `1\n(2)`
16:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Idk, i think im not a too big fan of the whole team indication on small scoreboard anyways

17:22 < bridge> <ar1gin> hi devs üëã, the ddnet client doesn't recognize remapped keys, is there a way to fix this/a workaround?
17:22 < bridge> <0xdeen> f1, inp_translated_keys 1
17:22 < bridge> <ar1gin> does nothing B)
17:22 < bridge> <0xdeen> Then no üòÑ
17:23 < bridge> <ar1gin> :nouis:
17:23 < bridge> <ar1gin> guess I will try to edit the code myself...
17:41 < bridge> <robyt3> Currently not, see #7544
17:41 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7544
17:42 < bridge> <ar1gin> for clarity, I have swapped caps and escape in kde keyboard options
17:43 < bridge> <ar1gin> seems to work in most apps
17:44 < bridge> <robyt3> I think we are using scancodes for binds and hotkeys, which describe the physical location of that key, so swapping in software is ignored
17:45 < bridge> <robyt3> For example if you bind to `√ñ` on a german keyboard the actual key is `semicolon` because that's the key at that location on the US keyboard I guess
17:45 < bridge> <ar1gin> isn't this what `inp_translated_keys` tries to fix?
17:47 < bridge> <robyt3> It doesn't do anything for me, so maybe SDL changed something at some point
18:19 < bridge> <zhn> do u ask me to unfollow :kek:
18:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> no xd
18:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got 119 now
18:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got 118 now
18:27 < bridge> <ar1gin> weird, when I press caps(which is bound to escape), `SDLK_ESCAPE` gets passed into `SDL_GetScancodeFromKey` which returns `SDL_SCANCODE_CAPSLOCK` for some reason
18:27 < bridge> <ar1gin> looks like SDL does its own keyboard translation?
18:32 < bridge> <ar1gin> SDL wiki says that `SDL_Keycode` is the **virtual** key representation while `SDL_Scancode` is the **physical** one
18:32 < bridge> <ar1gin> Why does DDNet use scancodes for input then?
18:35 < bridge> <ar1gin> Is it because of actual keyboard layouts?
18:35 < bridge> <robyt3> It always did, I think. Teeworlds changed to keycodes in 0.7
18:35 < bridge> <robyt3> It allows default binds to always use the same physical key
18:36 < bridge> <ar1gin> So if we were to use keycodes, would switching keyboard layout break the input?
18:37 < bridge> <ar1gin> Anyways, if we use physical keys, why isn't rebinding a "back" button an option?
18:38 < bridge> <robyt3> If we switch now it would change existing binds
18:38 < bridge> <robyt3> What do you mean with back button?
18:39 < bridge> <ar1gin> The escape button
18:40 < bridge> <ar1gin> Aren't keys serialized to strings?
18:40 < bridge> <robyt3> It should always have to default behavior so menus are always usable
18:42 < bridge> <robyt3> For example, if you previously bound `y` for chat you would now have to press the actual key `Y` instead of `Z` to activate this bind with a QWERTZ layout
18:42 < bridge> <robyt3> It wouldn't change the binds but the behavior
18:42 < bridge> <ar1gin> I see
18:43 < bridge> <ar1gin> So we ain't switching to keycodes until ddnet 2.0? :thonk:
18:43 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe if it's possible as an option cleanly
18:45 < bridge> <ar1gin> I'll go search to rebind my caps on a lower level to make it think that i'm pressing actual escape button
18:45 < bridge> <ar1gin> :greenthing:
19:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 can you explain please how this `<type>` thingy works, my brain doesn't work recursively and I don't understand how the hell it parses `u8***` for example(ye it also parses just stars, for example `***`, it's a feature btw) https://bnfplayground.pauliankline.com/?bnf=%3Cpointer_type%3E%20%3A%3A%3D%20%3Ctype%3E%3F%20%22%2a%22%0A%3Cprimitive_type%3E%20%3A%3A%3D%20%22u8%22%20%7C%20%22u16%22%0A%3Ctype%3E%20%3A%3A%3D%20%3Cpointer_type%3E%20

22:17 < bridge> <Ewan> I really think it should continue to use scancodes for binds
22:18 < bridge> <zhn> whats different?
22:18 < bridge> <Ewan> well on my kb I can use my original binds while still having the ability to type in colemak
22:19 < bridge> <Ewan> if they changed it I'd have to switch to qwerty or rebind dozens of keys
22:19 < bridge> <zhn> oh
22:20 < bridge> <zhn> ye sounds sane
22:20 < bridge> <robyt3> Would have to be an option I guess, or we somehow only figure it out for the UI. Having the Ctrl+Z bind consistently perform Undo in editor would be nice.
