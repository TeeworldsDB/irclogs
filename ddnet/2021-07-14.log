04:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RyÅ«> Weird keyboard
06:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its about the layout, thats a typical qwertz layout
06:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> basically most germans have this
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> keeb
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> when starting the ddnet server in windows in a terminal, I don't get any output, why is that?
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the server starts like I expected it to, however without the lines with the password and so on
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> it just doesn't print anything
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmm
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I tried some older versions down to 13.0, however that didnt seem to change much
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, if thats important: I used the git bash, not the native cmd
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds important
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> okay yup in the native cmd it does print stuff
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you try starting it by doubleclicking the server?
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> consoles on windows are a mess. idk where to start debugging this ^^
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, yeah that also does the same, thanks :)
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> vscode running a server also spawns a terminal window but the output is printed in integrated debug console.

12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh i wonder if there's just a good  console implementation, that we can use and don't bother with windows console at all ðŸ˜„
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On windows we output utf16, mintty (git bash) probably expects utf8
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :monkalaugh:
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RyÅ«> still weird  : D
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RyÅ«> so germans can't do
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RyÅ«> SHIFT + 2 to make @  : D
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RyÅ«> ?
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> ðŸ˜…
