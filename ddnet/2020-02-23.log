09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis even if you disagree with someone (which is rather easy with rms), these kinds of personal insults don't help anyone.
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 mattermost is great, discourse I don't quite like, mumble I do
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think he is over exaggerating security
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is wrong signature in maps a critical thing?

16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/blob/master/src/engine/shared/datafile.cpp#L114
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> seems to be a header thing hm
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen you used the converter cracked into the full client for maps huh? The one from the pr? Because i used that exact pr to convert all kog maps but it seems like all of them now throw this warning. They work but it does not look good to have a warning. But on official ddnet servers i do not get that error only on kog.
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, the command line one works fine now
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh nice
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol, i dont have to use the self pointer from ddracecommands.cpp when calling a static int function? (i use it for listdirectory callback)
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is it because its static?
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is that static func defined in a class? Then it does not need a instance.
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea its gamecontext
