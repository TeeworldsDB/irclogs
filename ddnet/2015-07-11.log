17:00 < goo> Hi, how goes?
17:05 <@deen> hi goo
17:05 <@deen> I think the new south african server is running well
17:05 < goo> very smooth and nice
17:05 <@deen> at least i'm getting fewer complaints now
17:06 < goo> ping stable
17:06 < goo> where is the hositng?
17:06 <@deen> no idea^^
17:06 <@deen> it's a server lordtheuns just had
17:06 < goo> ah okay
17:06 < goo> the ping is low, but i think im getting packet loss
17:08 <@deen> that's bad =/
17:10 <@deen> i get 0 packet loss from germany
17:13 < goo> it was only temporary, prob someone on my side
17:33 <@EastByte> deen: the vps provider proplay is sooo dead, I ordered a plan and the vps hasn't been set up one week afterwards
17:36 <@deen> ok?
17:36 <@deen> don't know anything about proplay
17:37 <@EastByte> well about a year ago we discussed this hoster while searching for new hosters
17:38 <@EastByte> and I've been using it because of the 1eur vps plan
17:38 <@deen> yeah, that's always one of my worries
17:38 <@deen> volatile market, hosters disappear and appear all the time
17:38 <@EastByte> well it's not like proplay will disappear, it's online since 2008 I think
17:38 <@EastByte> but there seems to be only one administrator
17:39 <@EastByte> who manages the tickets aswell^^
18:10 < KinG__> hi all
18:10 < KinG__> been a long time
18:10 < Anonymouse> hi
18:10  * Anonymouse is new here with a temporary nick
18:10 < KinG__> is deen here?!
18:11 < Anonymouse> anyway, leaving :p
18:27 <@EastByte> hellow KinG______
18:28 <@EastByte> deen was here about two hours ago
18:49 <@deen> hi
18:50 <@deen> KinG__: what's up? Got an Iranian server for DDNet by any chance?
18:50 <@deen> Because I wrote about that on http://ddnet.tw/funding just yesterday
18:50 < KinG__> yeah :D
18:50 <@deen> nice!
18:50 < KinG__> there is a chance that server is ready in like an hour or by tommorow idk
18:51 <@deen> nice!
18:51 <@deen> so, what are the terms?
18:51 <@deen> I just get a server and set up DDNet Persian on it?
18:51 < KinG__> yeah kinda and a few other mods
18:52 < KinG__> edited block so no boters could enter it players gonna need a special clietn we made for that
18:52 < KinG__> client*
18:53 <@deen> that sounds strange
18:53 <@deen> i don't think you should forbid other clients
18:54 <@deen> and people will figure out how to join it anyway and make a bot client for it
18:54 < KinG__> well we actually give players DDNet client but we are sure they don't cheat
18:54 <@EastByte> not the best idea^^
18:54 < KinG__> there are 3 ppl in iran that can break into it and they are my friends so no problems at all 
18:54 < KinG__> iranian players are just kids
18:55 < KinG__> don't know anything about coding or clients
18:55 < KinG__> they just download bot cleints
18:55 < KinG__> that's all
18:55 < KinG__> client* ^_^
18:55 <@EastByte> how exactly do you prevent normal clients from joining?
18:56 < KinG__> hmm
18:56 < KinG__> client give a code to server and if that's true then they shall join
18:56 <@EastByte> and you can get people to actually use it?
18:56 < KinG__> www.persian-protee.ir
18:57 < KinG__> they made ppl do it
18:57 <@deen> nice, based on ddnet client^^
18:57 <@EastByte> in the end you might lack of players
18:57 <@deen> they have a pay for win system it seems to me =/
18:58 < KinG__> pro players in iran are just mad of boter kids so yeah they will use and since we are going to be 100% antibot we are gonna have stable players
18:58 < KinG__> i asked ppl about that 
18:58 < KinG__> and they said yeah do it
18:58 < KinG__> ^^
18:58 <@EastByte> okay, good luck then
18:59 < KinG__> if u could just come and see how we play in here :D
18:59 <@EastByte> way to big latency I guess :D
18:59 < KinG__> 30 players online 27 uses bot
18:59 <@EastByte> not nice
18:59 <@deen> EastByte: it's probably not even on the internet, but in the iranian intranet
18:59 <@EastByte> oh
19:00 < KinG__> yeah deen  that's it
19:00 < KinG__> we are going to run a tunnel service too so if anyone is intrested to see how is iranian servers just tell me :D
19:01 <@EastByte> teeworlds has great potential in every country it seems
19:01 < KinG__> i'm gonna be afk for a while i'll be back when they gimme the server ^_^
19:01 <@deen> ok
19:01 < Nimda> Spüli by fikmesån just released on Novice at 2015-07-11 18:55
19:03 <@deen> but i still don't approve of forcing players to use 1 client only
19:06 <@EastByte> for a small community I personally think it doesn't matter
19:06 <@deen> until someone is excluded because he has problems with that specific client
19:06 <@deen> or has an operating system where it doesn't even run
19:06 <@deen> or doesn't trust a closed source client
19:07 <@EastByte> it still is a game and ddnet has wide support
19:08 <@EastByte> not to mention that using the ddnet client is much more safe
19:08 <@EastByte> than falling back to shitty outdated clients like 13x37

20:37 <@deen> someone just donated, i think that was KinG
20:45 <@deen> EastByte: and i disagree that ddnet can be popular everywhere. Iran always had a big TW community
20:45 <@deen> Don't get any players on DDNet China for example
