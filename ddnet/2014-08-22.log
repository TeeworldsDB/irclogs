00:24 < Savander> i'll think tomorrow, now i don't have idea  haha ;p
00:26 < bor> deen do you have ddnet server available in binary format or do you compile it on server?
00:29 < KinG_> deen: u here?
00:33 <@deen> hi
00:33 < KinG_> hi
00:33 <@deen> bor: i compile it on each server
00:33 <@deen> bor: http://ddnet.tw/downloads
00:33 < bor> is there any way you could prepare a pre compiled package ?
00:34 <@deen> bor: why?
00:34 < bor> the server we are about to buy (other than having ddnet) is going to be a reverse proxy for my website 
00:34 <@deen> bor: so what does that mean for me?
00:35 < bor> so its kind of the front end production server and because of stability and simplicity reasons i would prefer not install any unnecessary packages including the ones needed for compiling 
00:36 <@deen> bor: that sounds like this is not going to work then
00:36 <@deen> I'm not planning on installing some weird centos version for whatever architecture that is in a VM somewhere just to precompile this 1 binary
00:36 <@deen> and i need many more packages anyway
00:37 < bor> i can give you a test environment 
00:37 <@deen> and i have not the slightest idea how not having a compiler would increase stability and simplicity in any way
00:38 <@deen> when you want a stable server you shouldn't run a game on it that will be ddosed
00:39 < bor> ok you're the boss , you can install anything needed.
00:41 <@deen> zsh vim htop git g++ libboost-dev msgpack-python python-mysqldb ntp mariadb
00:41 <@deen> i think that's all i need
00:43 < bor> king just asked me if you talked german =))
00:43 < KinG_> :|
00:45 < bor> there is no problem i will have them installed before you start your work
00:45 < bor> just one thing , can mysql be on another server?
00:45 <@deen> bor: sorry if i sounded harsh
00:46 < bor> deen: no i'm sorry , i was unreasonable and asked you to do a lot of work without having any actual benefits 
00:58 < Savander> good night
14:34 <@deen> Releasing 4.8 with real spoofing protection for rcon commands
16:15 < KinG_> hi every one

17:23 < Matodor> deen:  remember my yesterday's problem?
18:13 <@deen> Matodor: yes
18:13 <@deen> Matodor: Savander is fixing it i think
18:14 < Matodor> it's client bug
18:14 <@deen> Matodor: it actually doesn't work in LAN
18:14 < Matodor> in LAN tab not work
18:14 < Matodor> okay)
18:14 <@deen> yeah, Savander said that after you left

18:40 < EastBite> deen: the rcon spoof protection has similarities with the one of teelevision :)
18:41 < EastBite> ehm would you mind to add the github irc bot for your repository into this channel?
18:42 <@deen> EastBite: yes, i know
18:42 <@deen> EastBite: you can do that?
18:43 < EastBite> oh I can?
18:43 <@deen> EastBite: no, i mean, i don't know of any github irc bots
18:43 < EastBite> it's in the settings tab of the repository
18:43 < EastBite> webhooks & services
18:43 < laxa> I can bring my irc bot there.
18:43 < laxa> if you want to
18:44 < laxa> it's noother's bot.
18:44 < EastBite> does it support github?
18:44 <@deen> EastBite: thanks
18:44 < laxa> does it support github ?
18:44 < laxa> he is on github, but I don't know what you mean by : does it support github
18:44 < EastBite> I just want a bot which tells about new commits from the repo
18:45 < laxa> hum
18:45 < laxa> I don't remember if he has such plugin
18:45 < laxa> let me look
18:45 < EastBite> and github has this feature
18:45 <@deen> i only ever saw that in the nimrod channel
18:45 <@deen> and liked it
18:45 < EastBite> :D
18:45 <@deen> actually i thought about adapting nimbot to do that today
18:45 < EastBite> it was on teeworlds-dev aswell
18:45 <@deen> i guess when i was on teeworlds-dev there were no commit
18:45 <@deen> commits*
18:46 < EastBite> maybe...
18:46 < laxa> Well
18:46 < laxa> apparently it has no such plujgins
18:46 < laxa> but should not be too difficult to make one
18:46 < laxa> https://github.com/noother/Nimda3
18:46 < EastBite> no need for that :)
18:47 < EastBite> also his bot is written in php
18:47 < EastBite> you don't wanna run php scripts serverside
18:47 < laxa> Why not ?
18:48 < EastBite> ehh actually php can only run serverside nvm xd
18:48 <@deen> EastBite: you could write a php interpreter in nimrod and compile it to javascript and run php clientside
18:48 < EastBite> ^ YES
18:49 <@deen> disclaimer: I've been working on the javascript backend of nimrod^^
18:49 < EastBite> :)
18:49 <@deen> (it's still very buggy, also I've never written any javascript)
18:49 < EastBite> and I'm going to use it sometime
18:49 < EastBite> so you better not fail
18:49 <@deen> I'll never even use it
18:49 < EastBite> :D
18:50 <@deen> Araq just came and said I could fix it
18:50 < laxa> deen: why show time of players you'r spectating is server sided oO ?
18:51 <@deen> laxa: because the server has to send the client the time
18:51 <@deen> client only ever has 1 time
18:51 <@deen> not of all players
18:51 < EastBite> and without the time of other players you can't laugh at them about their bad time
18:51 <@deen> well there is /saytime
18:51 <@deen> :P
18:51 < laxa> Well, I don't see the time of player...
18:51 < EastBite> which one is not going to use obv. :D
18:51 <@deen> laxa: yeah, didn't restart servers yet
18:52 < EastBite> does /saytime accept parameters?
18:52 <@deen> yes
18:52 < EastBite> ohh
18:52 < EastBite> I thought it's only for myself
18:52 <@deen> saytimeall is only for yourself
18:53 <@deen> so you can't publicly shame others
18:53 <@deen> i only added /saytime recently
18:53 < EastBite> ehm
18:53 < EastBite> okay
18:53 <@deen> so i set up the github irc thingy
18:53 <@deen> the problem is i did everything on my ddnet todo list
18:53 <@deen> so i can't commit anything now
18:54 < EastBite> :(
18:54 < EastBite> did you give him a name?
18:54 < EastBite> it*
18:54 <@deen> yes
18:55 < EastBite> I guess it's ddnetbot
18:55 <@deen> ^^
18:56 <@deen> mode #ddnet -n
18:56 <@deen> or something like that
18:56 < EastBite> :D
18:56 <@deen> meh
18:57 < EastBite> I still have no idea about channel modes
18:57 <@deen> i don't understand irc and don't plan to
18:57 < EastBite> :)
19:01 <@deen> ok, finally
19:01 <@deen> always feels like I'm fighting with Q
19:02 < EastBite> ah it allows messages from outside of the channel
19:03 <@deen> yes
19:04 <@deen> otherwise the bot would join and leave with every commit
19:04 < EastBite> yes minus was talking about this problem
19:04 < EastBite> but -n seems to attract spamers
19:04 <@deen> we will see
19:05 < Chicken_> @deen do you know why a server with fake user will be banned?
19:05 < Chicken_> Like DummyCapture
19:06 < EastBite> the tw mods don't like it
19:06 < Chicken_> SO is there any solution for that?
19:06 < EastBite> the server status has to display real players only iirc
19:06 < EastBite> yep, hide dummys from serverstatus
19:07 < Chicken_> You mean change it from 1/16 to 0/15?
19:07 < EastBite> yes, for example
19:07 < Chicken_> Fine.
19:07 <@deen> Chicken_: yes, because otherwise you sort by player numbers and join because you think the server is full
19:07 <@deen> and then it's actually just filled with bots
19:08 < Chicken_> You're right.
19:17 < laxa> deen: is there a way to always have /showall activated ?
19:17 <@deen> laxa: officially no, but there is a hack :P
19:17 <@deen> well, there are multiple hacks
19:18 <@deen> bind minus "zoom-; say /showall 1"
19:18 <@deen> oooooor you could add "; /showall 1" to your timeout code
19:18 <@deen> haven't tested, but it should work
19:20 < EastBite> don't be too hacky
19:20 <@deen> haha
19:21 <@deen> I could add a client setting for commands to run on joining the server
19:21 <@deen> but it's intentional that /showall is set to 0 by default
19:21 <@deen> to keep traffic for the server down
19:36 < Savander> deen: 
19:37 <@deen> Savander: 
19:37 < Savander> i have a question
19:37 < Savander> or not
19:37 < Savander> i think
19:37 < Savander> i fix 64p player problem
19:37 < Savander> in lan tab
19:37 < Savander> (maybe :P)
19:37 <@deen> nice
19:40 < laxa> Savander: nice to fix bugs, but really, who cares about that one ?
19:40 < laxa> No one will ever organise a lan with 64 players I guess.
19:40 <@deen> laxa: WHY NOT?
19:40 <@deen> ddrace on one of these huge lan parties would be cool
19:40 <@deen> no idea if they still exist
19:41 < laxa> it's called
19:41 < laxa> Dreamhack
19:42 < EastBite> I guess nobody would be able to play because of the low ping
19:43 <@deen> EastBite: huh?
19:43 < laxa> deen: I have idea !
19:43 < laxa> if you need to restart server, just make a script that save positions of all tee on all servers
19:43 < laxa> then reload servers
19:43 <@deen> laxa: nah
19:43 < laxa> client would need to reconnect
19:43 <@deen> laxa: that's horror
19:44 < EastBite> deen: if you are used to play with a ping of 100 for example 
19:44 <@deen> laxa: i have a setting sv_shutdown_when_empty
19:44 < EastBite> the changeover is not that easy
19:44 < laxa> I know
19:44 <@deen> so that's totally fine
19:44 < laxa> so, all empty servers should have the show time feature right ?
19:44 <@deen> laxa: yes
19:44 <@deen> look at server version
19:44 < laxa> You can try with me quickly ?
19:44 <@deen> 4.8.1 has it, 4.7.7 not
19:44 < laxa> where do I see server version ?
19:45 < laxa> Oh right, in server info
19:59 <@deen> Now let's test this!
19:59 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/NBTeYQ
19:59 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 803745f def: Fix: Working 64 player server info in LAN tab (by Savander)
19:59 < EastBite> :D
20:00 <@deen> awesome!
20:01 <@deen> Matodor: tadaaa
20:01 < Matodor> xDDD
20:01 < Matodor> nice fix :D
20:01 <@deen> haha
20:01 < Savander> xD
20:01 <@deen> I know there was a reason I added that IsRefreshing, but i forgot it
20:02 < Matodor> go 40 empty commints for 5000 :)
20:03 < Savander> lol
20:03 <@deen> what?
20:03 < Savander> look
20:03 < Savander> you have 4960
20:03 <@deen> 4960 what?
20:03 < Savander> in you ddnet repo on git
20:03 < Savander> commits*
20:03 < Savander> lol
20:03 < Savander> xd
20:03 < Matodor> yeah
20:03 <@deen> ah, i didn't know
20:06 <@deen> I make really small commits
20:07 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/graphs/contributors
20:07 <@deen> I have more commits than matricks, but only 10% of the lines^^
20:09 < Savander> hah
20:09 < Savander> #4GreYFoX 735 commits / 49,977 ++ / 1,372,346 --
20:09 < Savander> wow
20:10 <@deen> he removed all the non-ddrace stuff i guess^^
20:10 < Savander> a lot of removed lines ;P :D
20:10 <@deen> and something weird maybe
20:10 <@deen> 1 million lines is a bit too much
20:10 < Savander> he's brutal :(
20:12 <@deen> afk
20:42 < laxa> deen: come on teamspeak, everyone is there !
20:44 <@deen> laxa: ewwww

21:33 < laxa> deen: need you to kick a funvoter.
21:35 <@deen> laxa: you know that of all the requests i get every day, over 50% are by you?
21:36 < laxa> Not my fault if a fucking kid tries to funvote me 2 times -_-
21:36 <@deen> so you call me?
21:36 <@deen> why don't you talk to him?
21:36 <@deen> you know i would just go on the server and ask him why he votes
21:36 < laxa> I can't talk to kids
21:36 <@deen> then you shouldn't be a mod
21:37 < laxa> I don't care, still I get funvoted
