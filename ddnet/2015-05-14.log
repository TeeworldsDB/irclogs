03:53 <@deen> wow, the numbers at night are crazy
03:53 <@deen> 210 players on DDNet, 247 online in TW total
09:34 <@heinrich5991> deen: 210+247 in TW totally or 247-210 in non-ddnet modes?
09:37 < eeeee> the latter i guess, wouldn't be crazy wow otherwise
09:42 < eeeee> funny how most people play ddnet despite all the ddos attacks and stuff
09:43 < eeeee> havent heard about any attacks for a while btw, they gave up or what?

11:13 <@deen> eeeee: chile is stil getting attacked, I'm not sure about GER
11:14 <@deen> GER does lag a few times a day, but may also have other causes
17:31 < Spyker> deen, can you give to me a nuclear server for test with saavik?
17:31 < lady> deen
17:31 <@deen> hi
17:32 < lady> give me nuclear server
17:33 <@deen> Hm, 5 nuclear servers running already
17:33 <@deen> give me a few mins
17:33 < lady> 5?
17:33 <@EastByte> they might explode and destroy the whole serverlist
17:33 < lady> I see 2
17:34 < lady> #1 and #3
17:34 < lady> 3 is for zerodin? and 1?
17:34 <@deen> Nuclear #1, Nuclear #2 = DDmaX Test (yours), Nuclear #3, Nuclear #4 = iMTG Test, now #5 coming
17:34 < lady> I don't have 2
17:35 < lady> there is 1 ddmax server
17:35 <@deen> so, what pw?
17:35 < lady> maybe I need even 2
17:36 < lady> I can't say pw here
17:44 <@deen> There goes all the extra memory I freed on ddnet server^^
17:47 < Learath2> what is a nuclear server
17:47 < Learath2> and who it this lady ordering you around 
17:49 <@deen> Lady Saavik obviously, self-appointed dictator of DDNet testing
17:49 <@deen> (and unfortunately the only person who tests that much)
17:49 <@deen> a Nuclear server is a server with another password, usually for testing tournament maps
17:51 < Learath2> she needs some manners ....
17:51 <@deen> Oh yes, she does
17:51 <@deen> But many people tried to talk some into her without any results
17:51 <@deen> So the current plan is to ban her if she overdoes it again
17:52 < Learath2> not a good idea to ban people you cant replace
17:52 <@deen> Have a better idea?
17:53 < Learath2> put up with it until you can find someone to test maps
17:53 <@deen> did that for 2 years, next idea please :P
17:54 <@deen> also, many testers may not be testing because they're afraid of her
17:54 < Learath2> what does testing consist of ?
17:54 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=49
17:56 < Learath2> oh well
17:56 < Learath2> give out some apparent tester benefits i guess
17:56 <@deen> what benefits?
17:56 <@deen> Points?^^
17:57 < Learath2> make a irrelevant ladder of ranks from junior to senior tester and to achieve the next rank the tester needs to test for x hours 
17:58 <@deen> Difficult to rank testing like that
17:58 <@deen> It's not that longer testing means better testing
17:58 <@deen> People would just be spending useless time on test servers, pointing out useless bugs
17:59 < Learath2> appoint me the new dictator of testing so i can hand out points, tags and colorful names :D
17:59 <@deen> we have tags and colorful names already^^
18:00 < Learath2> well no idea what to give but there needs to be somekind of gain from testing to encourage people to do it
18:20 < lady> deen will you announce tournament?
18:36 <@deen> lady: first I need the information about the tournament
18:37 <@deen> like the map, mapper, server type, stars
18:37 < lady> yes
18:37 < lady> you want to make screenshot?
18:38 < lady> Red Avenue by Bixes, Moderate 4*
18:39 <@deen> Yes, screenshot
18:49 <@deen> lady: so?
18:54 < lady> deen did you make nuclear? so I will upload it there
18:54 <@deen> sure, made both
18:56 <@deen> Looks like some more trouble in DDNet land: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1442
18:57 < lady> deen there is cfg with /spec
18:57 <@deen> lady: you can also upload it at the same location
18:57 < lady> deen I will tell you when Aim 10 is done and you can release ok? I have to make credits and animation
18:58 <@EastByte> what hi_leute_gll actually is saying
18:58 <@deen> lady: I guessed 20:00 but ok
18:58 < savander> he want to destroy ddnet?
18:58 < lady> deen thinks so
18:59 < lady> deen yes I just hope it will be done till 20
18:59 <@deen> And this is the dicussion hi_leute is referring to, of course: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=1439
19:00 <@deen> savander: i don't remember saying that
19:00 < savander> nvm
19:03 <@deen> EastByte: hm?
19:07 <@EastByte> he looks kinda helpless arguing about ddnet
19:09 <@deen> I really don't like drama, I just want them to be kind and consider the feeling of the people they talk about and to
19:16 < lady> deen nvm, it's ready, we will do it after release
19:17 <@deen> lady: alright
19:20 <@deen> woah, nice backgroud and logo on Red Avenue
19:20 <@deen> well worth taking a screenshot of
19:21 < lady> deen it's very good map
19:21 <@deen> Only problem, screenshot is 517 KB, haha
19:22 <@deen> really don't want to do lossy compression on that
19:28 < lady> "60 minutes to get the best time! You have as many tries as you want!"
19:28 <@deen> shit
19:28 < lady> sure,m whole map takes 60min
19:28 <@deen> fixed, thanks
19:29 < lady> thanks for being mutti
19:35 <@deen> no idea what that's supposed to mean
19:43 < lady> deen /spec isn't working
19:44 <@deen> typo in the config
19:44 <@deen> it should be sv_pauseable
19:44 <@deen> not sv_pausable
19:44 <@deen> (and a newline at the end, not sure if it matters)
20:00 < Nimda> Aim 10.0 by Aoe & Hindu just released on Brutal at 2015-05-14 19:57
20:02 < savander> newline at beginning matters
20:07 < lady> Aoe and Hindu?
20:08 < lady> it's SickCunt deen 
20:10 <@deen> eeh
20:16 <@EastByte> hehe
20:16 <@EastByte> deen made a mistake
20:36 <@deen> Anyway, Tournament on Sunday! http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1443
20:44 <@deen> Oh, Rust is being released tomorrow, isn't it?
21:42 < lady> deen many maps are ready in forum
21:42 < lady> you can release this novice and one more map tomorrow, ye?
21:43 <@deen> 2 maps per day now?
21:43 < lady> even 5 sometimes
21:43 < lady> then not
21:43 < lady> god, I don't care
21:43 < lady> when you are doing this it is good, when I say it - wtf is wrong with me, now 2 maps?
21:43 < Learath2> calm your tits lad
21:44 < lady> forget it then
21:46 < lady> deen wrong map
21:48 < Learath2> the ragequit tho
21:50 <@heinrich5991> deen: yes! tomorrow is Rust 1.0 release
21:57 <@deen> heinrich5991: I should give it a try soon then
21:58 <@heinrich5991> it will probably feel clunky compared to nim :)
21:58 <@deen> but no GC, better parallel support and safety
22:00 <@heinrich5991> yep. tradeoffs ^^
22:05 <@deen> but yeah, clunkiness, how often stuff changes and compile times are the main reasons I haven't tried Rust yet
