08:45 < bridge> <Assa> In this example I'd have to anyways, because this is only animated with ogl3.3 and vulkan, since this is shader code
08:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> The video you posted gave me annurism
08:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Plz continue to liquify ddnet
08:47 < bridge> <Assa> take a look at #mapping , I have a (more) propper verison there @sollybunny ‚ù§Ô∏è
08:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> O wow, that's what I imagined with something like this
08:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Now need to add another shader effect so we can get dream blocks in DDNet
08:49 < bridge> <Assa> I am thinking about a secondary wave with different settings and I start to understand why we may need tessalation üôà
08:49 < bridge> <Assa> wth are dream blocks?

08:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> They don't look like I remember
08:52 < bridge> <Assa> this reminds me of a map I made üòÜ the preview is scuffed, you might want to look into it ingame: <https://uniqueclan.net/map/run_aquila_rift>
08:53 < bridge> <Assa> also shoutouts to celeste
09:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> I just think that dream blocks would be an epic map feature even for vanilla
09:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> They can provide speed and block projectiles and act as an intersection
10:32 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> send liquid ddnet version
10:49 < bridge> <Assa> you want the client? be warned it's currently scuffed and don't even try to use vulkan on it

13:40 < bridge> <bzork.> What kind of crap game is this? I've only been playing ddnet for 2.7 hours. And I've already gotten banned. How high do you have to be on drugs to do something like that?
13:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I 100% understand why you are banned xD
13:41 < bridge> <bzork.> lol
13:41 < bridge> <bzork.> I was just really upset about what happened.
13:41 < bridge> <bzork.> I've only been in the game for 2.7 hours
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If you think the ban was unjustified #‚úâ-create-a-ticket with ban appeal.
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But if you blocked someone or similar, you have to accept the ban

13:43 < bridge> <bzork.> Okay, thanks for the instructions. I hope it helps me.
14:18 < bridge> <Assa> @jupeyy_keks any opinions? This is more or less what I envisioned: https://youtu.be/dcfhz-woEj4
14:20 < bridge> <kebscs> havent seen water that looked like this
14:21 < bridge> <Assa> this is not written in stone, the tileset is fully interchangable
14:21 < bridge> <Assa> this is not written in stone, the tileset is fully interchangable in this implementation
14:21 < bridge> <learath2> I'm so getting beheaded when we merge the water shader before accounts
14:21 < bridge> <kebscs> the water in water pr looked nice
14:22 < bridge> <kebscs> this looks like some organisms under microscope
14:23 < bridge> <Assa> I have written a list of pro and cons into the issue, the original pr is not thrown out yet
14:31 < bridge> <Assa> feel free to add your opinions to 9973, be aware this is just a fun mock, nothing is written in stone and I didn't do a PR (yet), as I am still discovering what we could do to this issue
14:32 < bridge> <kebscs> already typed there, the only thing that is nice from the water pr is the water
14:32 < bridge> <kebscs> its wavy and handles jumping into it, etc
14:34 < bridge> <Assa> yes, jumping into it and making waves is not easily possible with a shader. Adding particles however is. The physics side is yet another part of that issue not addressed by me at all
14:36 < bridge> <kebscs> you can place tiles behind the water, so it doesnt really matter how it looks like
14:36 < bridge> <kebscs> also its very teeish in the water pr
14:36 < bridge> <kebscs> only the splashing isnt consistent, other than that its good
14:37 < bridge> <Assa> what makes it teeish? As I said, the tileset is free to choose by the mapper with a shader
14:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> looks not bad, did u everp lay terraria? can u look at it, also terraria has a nice shader for desert-like warmth
14:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> looks not bad, did u ever play terraria? can u look at it, also terraria has a nice shader for desert-like warmth
14:40 < bridge> <kebscs> color and the white line for surface
14:41 < bridge> <Assa> good, than let me do this as well
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yo fellow white hat hackers. If i prefix all backslashes and double quotes with backslashes can i safely pass it to a rcon string?
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``str_format(aBuf, sizeof(aBuf), "echo \"%s\", aEscapedUserInput);Console()->ExecuteLine(aBuf);``
14:43 < bridge> <Assa> as I said, I can simply change it in the editor
14:43 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1384513762857582654/screenshot_2025-06-17_14-42-50.png?ex=6852b46c&is=685162ec&hm=d8f91f885994942ecb43a82c0dc22a39946353e5bd5cebe7e3fa2d3a5a4b67c6&
14:43 < bridge> <Assa> I guess you'd have turned the pattern fully off
14:44 < bridge> <kebscs> doesnt look great to me
14:44 < bridge> <kebscs> i like the one from water pr
14:45 < bridge> <kebscs> probably no, test `"; shutdown` as the %s
14:46 < bridge> <Assa> I mean I could make it increasingly similar but whatever
14:46 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1384514548849049600/screenshot_2025-06-17_14-46-12.png?ex=6852b527&is=685163a7&hm=a2a36133b629e492acf92c7991a6b06f194b12926a9f262e3c1867b37c9c9015&
14:47 < bridge> <kebscs> probably no, test `"; logout;"'` as the %s
14:47 < bridge> <kebscs> probably no, test `"; logout;"` as the %s
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is that a animation based on changing textures?
14:49 < bridge> <Assa> no
14:49 < bridge> <Assa> no, just shader magic
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok, looks bit unfluent
14:51 < bridge> <kebscs> also stationary water doesnt move randomly under surfacer
14:51 < bridge> <kebscs> also stationary water doesnt move randomly under surface
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> What was the point of water  over tune based water again?
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> Does this flow?
14:51 < bridge> <Assa> might be coming from missing tessalation üíÄ
14:51 < bridge> <Assa> this is only visual, no physics
14:52 < bridge> <learath2> So a sort of animated tile?
14:52 < bridge> <kebscs> splash animation, bubble particiles for breating
14:52 < bridge> <kebscs> etc
14:52 < bridge> <kebscs> i would say
14:52 < bridge> <kebscs> and physics to projectiles
14:52 < bridge> <Assa> my mock, yes
14:53 < bridge> <Assa> my mock, yes (this is exactly what it is)
14:53 < bridge> <learath2> Should we maybe look into a more generic animated tile solution maybe?
14:54 < bridge> <learath2> Though I guess those would underperform compared to shader magic
14:54 < bridge> <Assa> currently this is generic in a sense, that you can configure "time", "frequency" and "amplitude"
14:55 < bridge> <Assa> side note: I wondered as well, if we could move quad animations into a shader (and if this would make sense)
14:55 < bridge> <Assa> side note: I wondered as well, if we could move quad animations into a shader (and if this would make sense), but I guess envs are too dynamic
14:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kebscs ono ``2025-06-17 14:54:40 I chatresp: No such command: shutdown'.``
14:56 < bridge> <kebscs> ive edited, i guess irc doesnt have that
14:56 < bridge> <kebscs> `"; logout;"`
14:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye i got all of them
14:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it breaks my brain because i have to escape in C++ test strings and in my bash console and in the local console when setting the name xd
14:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah lol i forgot to restart server thats why xd
14:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kebscs ``"; logout;"`` is safe with my naive escape
14:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the semicolon does nothing when quoted
14:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and the quote is prefixed with a backslash so it does not end the string
15:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am more worried about a case where the string ends with ``\"`` and then the escaped backslash unescapes the trailing quote or something
15:00 < bridge> <kebscs> idk how the ending quote works here when you have \
15:01 < bridge> <kebscs> thats why the first quote closes your quoting
15:01 < bridge> <kebscs> so ; logout; isnt quoted and the last one closes the remaining
15:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well if you give me ``"; logout;"`` i turn it into ``\"; logout;\"`` and then wrap it in " cuz of the ``echo "%s"`` so in the chat it prints your string literally and no logout is run thats safe
15:06 < bridge> <kebscs> idk for now but seems brittle
15:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it does
15:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats why i need u!
15:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if nobody can break it its safe
15:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ez
15:07 < bridge> <Assa> I have no idea what you're talking about üôà
15:08 < bridge> <Assa> next we can add shaders to map and select them for a tilelayer/quadlayer /s
15:09 < bridge> <learath2> You know what? Not such an absurd idea. Let people have any shader on any quad üòõ
15:10 < bridge> <learath2> I can only imagine the things people can make with that. Though idk the safety of executing arbitrary shader code
15:10 < bridge> <Assa> map testers already hate me, no reason to let them hate me more
15:10 < bridge> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks comment
15:16 < bridge> <Assa> something something OOVRAM
15:17 < bridge> <Assa> something something OOVRAM, well depends on the interface, I guess a player woudln't have that much control
15:20 < bridge> <Assa> In the case of vulkan the player would need to compile the shader, if the compiler has an issue, there might be your safety issue
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes no chance
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I don't trust driver, I don't trust gpus, I don't trust anything
15:24 < bridge> <learath2> Jupstar said yes. Custom shaders for everyone
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I said yes
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cannot deny
15:25 < bridge> <Assa> I trust this opinion :thonk:
15:26 < bridge> <learath2> It would be a very cool feature. People could make things with raymarching like in shadertoy
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes, but I don't even trust webgl xD
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I reported how I could crash my driver in webgl in mesa once
15:27 < bridge> <learath2> :AnyaSob:
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> With OGL1 support this is not possible anyway
15:28 < bridge> <Assa> ogl3 also doesn't support shaders, right?
15:28 < bridge> <Assa> ogl3.0 also doesn't support shaders, right?
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> All opengl versions support shaders
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Since 2.0 it's a core feature I think
15:28 < bridge> <learath2> Fixed pipeline gang
15:29 < bridge> <Assa> i mean in our backend, or does 3.3 and 3.0 use the same backend?
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 3.0 uses a tile shader else fixed pipeline
15:29 < bridge> <Assa> also we have the gsl(? what was it name again) backend
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> GLES?
15:30 < bridge> <Assa> yes
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That's only interesting for Web & Android
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's also a subset of OpenGL
15:30 < bridge> <Assa> it shows on my laptop btw
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> On Linux yes
15:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I enabled it there bcs GLES is easier on wayland than OGL
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But on linux GLES & OpenGL is kinda the same
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Same drivert
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Same driver
15:31 < bridge> <Assa> but does it use shaders?
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> GLES 3.0 == OpenGL 3.3 in our code
15:31 < bridge> <Assa> okay

16:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> rust pros, I have a question, is there a way to set a starting value for enum variants when the enum is created using a macro? I have a macro which is used like `define_enum!{EnumName; Variant1, Variant2}`, I want `Variant1` to have value `69`. It's possible to do this:

16:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> compile errors acn be ignored, and only premade shaders can be used then it should be fine
16:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and we always got entties if it fucks up
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> since they won't work on ogl1 you need a fallback anyway.
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so why not test the feature on tater client, u're maintainer there or not?
17:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> can the map add random attributes to layers
17:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im only comfortable with letting prewritten shaders be used since i can very easily crash my system with a malicious shader
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can just extend layers why fields yes
17:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> kk
17:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im not really sure how to add shaders to layers
17:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> assa obviously has it working
17:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> r u sure abt that
17:23 < bridge> <kebscs> hm?
17:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 2 issues and a pr and reversion of it
17:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> looks fine to me
17:24 < bridge> <kebscs> wdym?
17:24 < bridge> <kebscs> this was an issue before and after the reverted pr
17:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> related to strongweak with spec
17:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> either way looks fine to me
17:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> theres not really any point to adding it to tater, maps will have to have it
17:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i gues you can retroactively add the shader to layers called water
17:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> eh not really idk how water works in those maps

18:14 < bridge> <Assa> idea: ban yourself channel, if you write there you autoban yourself, honeypot for bots
18:15 < bridge> <Assa> @robyt3 may I help you with the subcomponent PR?
18:19 < bridge> <robyt3> What do you want to help with? I wanted to try extracting at least one more component to make sure it works. I also wanted it as a base for the touch controls editor PR because it adds a lot of members to the menus. I started splitting the demo menus into a separate component when I made the draft, but it got out of hand because the sub-component needs to still influence the parent in various way, like showing demo-related menu popups.
18:20 < bridge> <louis> what is subcomponent pr
18:20 < bridge> <louis> also yeah u should probably squash smaller prs just to not muddy the commit history
18:21 < bridge> <Assa> > What do you want to help with?
18:21 < bridge> <Assa> yeah that's why I am asking, I want it, but I guess I can't help easily üôà 
18:21 < bridge> <Assa> 
18:21 < bridge> <Assa> I need it as a base for refactoring the render layers yet again in order to make a possible followup for the editor more realistic
18:23 < bridge> <robyt3> You could try making your changes based on the current sub-component PR and if it works we can also merge it I guess
18:23 < bridge> <robyt3> I can fix the conflicts later again
18:23 < bridge> <Assa> I am afraid of the rebase hell I'll enter if I do that
18:27 < bridge> <robyt3> It's easy to rebase later.  From your branch do `git rebase -i subcomponent-pr` (with `subcomponent-pr` already updated to the latest commit from the PR) then drop all commits in the rebase except your own to accept the upstream change and apply your commits on top
