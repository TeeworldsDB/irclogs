00:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> For fun, I made PHP Package to get informations from server.  https://packagist.org/packages/savander/twservers  Actually, It's possible to extend it to work with 64 clients, but first i need to figure out how to do it.
00:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> With Laravel support
00:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Compatibility*
02:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Oblikumquat> Nice @Savander ðŸ˜ƒ
02:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Oblikumquat> btw have u seen this? https://code.teele.eu/twrequest
11:33 <@heinrich5991> deen: https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross
11:33 <@heinrich5991> that can apparantly crosscompile to macos
11:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> @Oblikumquat  yes, i used it few years ago :p
12:40 <@Learath2> we could just make package on the CIs and collect that as an artifact heinrich5991
12:40 <@heinrich5991> yes, but deen asked for a macos cross compiler the other day
12:41 <@Learath2> oh yep that's the only thing i could find aswell
12:41 <@Learath2> doesn't instill much confidence tho :D
12:45 <@heinrich5991> huh? looks ok
13:10 <@deen> heinrich5991: i know, i linked that here before
13:11 <@heinrich5991> oh, nvm then
13:13 <@deen> But I wan the cmake build feature
13:14 <@deen> so that it can build the release directly
13:20 <@heinrich5991> cmake build feature?
13:40 <@deen> cmake release
13:43 <@heinrich5991> ah
13:44 <@heinrich5991> I should look at it again
19:53 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/v7Pmb
19:53 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 0b5dcdc def: Disable vsync by default and warn about possible delay
20:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> We should warn also for fsaa too then
20:06 <+eeeee> why is fsaa problematic?
20:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> people maybe don't know it causes lag
20:07 <+eeeee> yeah but why does it cause lag
20:07 <+eeeee> is it really that hard to AA those letters we're blitting
20:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i find it weird too
20:20 <@deen> dunno why, on my system fsaa causes at least 1 frame of delay
20:20 <@deen> warning is in the commit
23:39 <+fstd_> ddnet-discord: u icat?
23:39  * fstd_ eyes Learath2 
23:39 <@Learath2> fstd_: not yet
23:40 <@Learath2> very busy not studying for my exams
23:40 <+fstd_> well if it already works why change it
23:40 <@Learath2> it keeps crashing
23:40 <+fstd_> oh
