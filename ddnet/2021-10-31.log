02:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <z1lo> I have a good suggestion for the server... create a chat for "mods" where people can post their mods or disclose other game mods in the chat, skin mods, textures and among other mods, mods in general
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> why so many 😮
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/alloc/fn.alloc.html
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> alloc::alloc::alloc
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I'm  guilty ^^ https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/903618540232376330
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> why doesnt "cl_eye_duration 1" work anymore?
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> the duration is endless no matter what valuie
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> the duration is endless no matter what value
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> did you update something guys?
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i set "events" to 0 if someones wondering
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> it seems like this halloween event is overriding the "events" status
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> which it shouldnt
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i doubt that the eye emote event is client side
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> but thats what "events" is therefore, to disable eye emote event
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> at least it says that on the ddnet site
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, its listed on server and client commands, it should be split to not create confusion
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> how to i remove the evil eye emote tho
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i see other people dont have it
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> This should do /eyeemote happy duration
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they just dont use /emote with such small numbers
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> emote selector -> normal eyes (right)
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wym?
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just set the duration to 9999
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just play fng for 1 day until this spook is over ;)
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i did it but after 1 sec its evil eyes again
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cl\_eye\_duration 99999
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> but i have cl_eye_duration 1 because of my own eye bind
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, but sadly bcs its a server setting it wont work today
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it doesnt set the emote to the last emote before the command, but to the normal eyes, which is angry on halloween
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> this is so dumb
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> create an issue on github, hope somebody cares, or fix it yourself, i doubt else its gonna be fixed
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> just dont make it server sided
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it wont work on vanilla for example and spams /emote command in the chat
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tw is a mess xd
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i swear the events command was exactly for that
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> from the source code it looks, like its only used for "santa" skin prefix in the client
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> everything else is server sided
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/904382173308674068/unknown.png
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> its even listed under client settings
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as i said its listed in both
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it uses the same string under both, bcs its the same setting used for both
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> but then that is just false
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it wont help that you get angry, just open an issue, hope that somebody fixes it, or fix it yourself
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> so it is a bug?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd say it's defs not nice
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/new
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> there
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thanks ^^
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oguz> I think "wait" command should be added for console. For example after typing [bind d "+right; wait 120; emote 3"] to console, pressing "d" will go right, wait 120 milliseconds and jump.
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> that would change the meta completely
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oguz> why? its just a console command.
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen || @heinrich5991 I'm not really certain how we deploy nowadays can either of you build with asan and deploy this?
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this will allow to cheat, so nope
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (@demoguz)
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oguz> ok.
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I don't really know it myself. you could check out ger1, it seems to have a build script for ubsan and a build folder for asan
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also homebrew doesn't have clang-format-10, this is so extremely annoying to work with for me...
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The person who thought having a non-backwards compatible formatter is a sane idea is an absolute dimwit, like definite headcase
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is there no github bot that can just do it?
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like 
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bors fix-style xd
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no static binaries to download from somewhere? @Learath2
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm certain there are smarter machine learning algorithms than this man on earth...
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I found some static binaries on llvms site, I'll try those, which will give me some linking errors because I'm not on the very latest osx I bet
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/muttleyxd/clang-tools-static-binaries @Learath2
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah perfect, statically linked versions, thanks
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (more direct link: https://github.com/muttleyxd/clang-tools-static-binaries/releases/tag/master-f3a37dd2)
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <3олотое Яблоко> good idea, but bot moment
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it also can't really exist as the console works currently, you'd have to do some weird deferred execution thing
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like put waiting commands in a queue and keep going and check the queue each tick or sth
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> done
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, automating timing will definitely be too helpful
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 do you use a fido2 key? which key should one buy?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I use a yubikey 4
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fairly happy with it, I’d go for a yubikey 5 nfc if I was getting a new one
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is because I use a smart phone though. I don’t remember whether you used a modern phone to care about that tho 😄
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I’ll have to give up my desire for a headphone jack and just get a new phone
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does the nfc part do?
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Just use wireless earphones bro
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> one more device to keep charged
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can use it for 2fa on your phone when logging into stuff
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> You know when you sleep you can just charge stuff overnight
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I already said all the reasons I don’t like this option, won’t go into it again as to not bother people
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @joji yes, that's one more thing I have to do when I go to sleep. also I'm not always sleeping at home
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> I use iphone + airpods and im happier than ever with it
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tldr is I have a great headphone/monitor collection that would cost me a fortune to match wirelessly, I enjoy being able to charge my phone and listen to music at the same time (Very often, i travel a lot)
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> I have to charge my airpods just once a week
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can't forget to charge my headphones
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> There are double dongles for that
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean I’m sorry but those are so damn inconvenient and if you don’t agree with that I have no chance of convincing you of anything and thus this chat is pointless
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> We just have a different use case
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As said even if the dongle was very convenient, I am just not made of money
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> You are
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> You are made of time and time gives you money, therefore you are made of money
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> :thonk:
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My time as a failing computer engineering student is not worth much 😛
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time is money if u are rich enough
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No, time is money for everyone
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> TIL you can't sign your own apps anymore for the google play store
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you have to hand over your keys to google
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Some peoples time is just not worth as much 😛
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lolwhat? They sign it for you?
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye u have to do some weird think that is not a apk
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they make the apk i think
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 yes
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is stupid…
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> since august 2021, this is a apparently requirement for new apps
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> since august 2021, this is apparently a requirement for new apps
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it ensures that google can change your app I guess
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > With Play App Signing, Google manages and protects your app's signing key for you and uses it to sign optimized, distribution APKs that are generated from your app bundles. Play App Signing stores your app signing key on Google’s secure infrastructure and offers upgrade options to increase security.
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Protects it for us lol
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can do my own optimized builds, thank you for the offer friendly huge corporation
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> protection is always the excuse towards total dictatorship/control
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never fails
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Look at china
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unfortunately you can't decline the offer @Learath2
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really don’t like where we are heading with this stuff. The mastercard thing also has me very concerned, same with the UK debate to “end online anonimity”
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mastercard?
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 werent u in favour of using id cards to internet auth
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :admiralMC:
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for*
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Alot of it even is caused by the people theirselves, democracy
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mastercard will soon stop processing all payments for online sex workers unless the porn sites agree to very strict rules by mastercard
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the uk has some battle against porn
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Rules forced onto everyone by a massive corporation by the virtue of being part of the strongest duopoly on earth. Completely anti democratic
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Like one arab man once said, a government by run by the people for the people is not good because the people are retarted
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> Like one arab man once said, a government run by the people for the people is not good because the people are retarted
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there are no goverments run by the people actually
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just have the facade of choosing someone
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> He meant democracy by it
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’m in favour of it in a very strict sense. Not ever exposing the ids to the outside. I just want to know a random unique id that I can’t even map to a person
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would like to see how a liquid democracy fares
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> probs the true democracy
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (the direct form)
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> brb eat
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I’ll go watch Clannad
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Night o/
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good night 🙂
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont cry
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dango dango dango
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😢
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvzCmV3_12c> it feels different after finishing clannad
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 my server isnt in https master for the whole day right now, probably attacks?
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so the actual server wont respond or wont respond in time?
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there were attacks the whole day
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's a theory
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you give me a tcpdump of a time where it's not registered?
