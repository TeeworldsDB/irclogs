02:47 <@deen> Looks a bit nicer maybe and I get an automated message if I fucked up compilation again: https://github.com/def-/ddnet#-
07:48 <@EastByte> deen: how does the build status work?
07:53 <@deen> EastByte: Circle CI tries to compile the release versions of everything and if it fails an error is shown
07:53 <@deen> as defined in here: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/circle.yml
07:53 <@EastByte> oh wow
07:55 <@deen> and you can watch it build live, which is fun: https://circleci.com/gh/def-/ddnet/3
07:55 <@deen> it should also be possible to automatically do this for pull requests, but i haven't looked into it yet
07:56 <@EastByte> neat
07:58 <@deen> seen this cool pattern matching library in nim? https://github.com/andreaferretti/patty
07:58 <@deen> Pretty fun to use a macro for pattern matching instead of having it baked into the language
08:28 <@EastByte> looks like a simplified way of working with object variants
11:56 <@deen> That's funny, just yesterday I read the TeeDes article about DDNet: http://teedes.ru/viewtopic.php?id=40
11:57 <@deen> Today I see a new Russian article about Nim: http://habrahabr.ru/post/261801/

12:05 <@EastByte> deen: nice
13:24 <@EastByte> deen: "@minus | connection issues with our NA master server currentlyâ€¦ the upstream providers seem to be dropping packets like mad"
13:24 <@EastByte> didn't we have packet loss aswell?
13:25 <@deen> in USA and CAN? not that i know of
13:25 <@EastByte> okay
13:25 <@deen> i had packet loss on ddnet.tw (website + http downloads)
13:26 <@EastByte> ah right
15:35 < laxadedi> do I need sdl 1.2 to compile on OS X ?
15:35 <@deen> yes
15:36 < laxadedi> can't compile SDL 1.2 :(
15:36 <@deen> and i don't remember how i installed it
15:36 <@deen> you can download it from sdl  website
15:36 < laxadedi> hum, right
15:39 < laxadedi> Well, now I have this
15:39 < laxadedi> /Library/Frameworks/SDL.framework/Headers/SDL_syswm.h:58:10: fatal error: 'X11/Xlib.h' file not found
15:39 < laxadedi> I had the same problem when trying to compile SDL 1.2.5
15:39 < laxadedi> I installed the 'xcode CLI
15:39 < laxadedi> that is suppose to solve this problem :(
15:39 <@deen> you might have some library for x11, not quartz
15:40 <@deen> why are you building on mac btw?
15:40 <@deen> i did it once and was just happy that it works and I never have to build anything on mac again
15:40 < laxadedi> :D
15:40 < laxadedi> Cause I am using my mac for most of the developments I am doing
15:41 <@deen> i guess freetype or another library is trying to use the x11 version
15:41 <@deen> but you should be using quartz version
15:41 < laxadedi> well, that's what I am reading
15:41 < laxadedi> gonna try
15:43 <@deen> or install xquartz, but that's more of the hack solution i guess: http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/
15:44 < laxadedi> ok, downloading xquartz right now
15:45 <@deen> let me run my mac vm, maybe i can figure sth out
15:49 < o_be_one> hello
15:50 <@deen> hi
15:52 < laxadedi> deen: don't worry, I am downloading xquartz but it's slow, I'll ask you later if I still need help.
15:52 < laxadedi> thing is
15:52 < laxadedi> if I do that
15:53 < laxadedi> /System/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Versions/8.4/Headers/X11/Xlib.h
15:53 < laxadedi> /System/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Versions/8.5/Headers/X11/Xlib.h
15:53 < laxadedi> Well, find tell me I have those already, I'll try with xquartz anyway
15:54 < laxadedi> and I agree, it's not always simple to compile things on OS X :)
15:54 <@deen> hm, but they're in Tk
15:54 <@deen> they should be elsewhere I think
15:55 <@deen> /usr/X11/include/X11/Xlib.h for example
15:55 <@deen> that's where i have them
15:56 <@deen> but I'm wondering how that works
15:56 <@deen> most mac people don't have x11/xquartz, so ddnet client should not depend on it
23:30 <@deen> Now with a list of donors: http://ddnet.tw/funding/
23:32 <@deen> (just in order of donation time)
23:32 <@deen> (or half-way random^^)
23:38 < Learath2> laxadedi: where did you get your SDL ?
23:39 < Learath2> i couldnt get the brew version of sdl working at all
23:39 < o_be_one> nice about funding list :)
23:41 < o_be_one> oh sponsors are no mor in staff list
23:41 <@deen> o_be_one: sponsors are now listed at the funding for each server and also as donors
23:42 <@deen> o_be_one: also, do you want to be listed as o_be_one or o_tee_one?
23:43 <@deen> and I found out who every donor is except one, wrote him a mail^^
23:43 < o_be_one> people from TW knows me as o_tee_one, but i'm o_be_one, it's hard to chose :D
23:44 <@deen> so I'll call you o_be_one and link to you o_tee_one player profile^
23:44 < o_be_one> well deen let o_tee_one please
23:44 < o_be_one> cause o_tee_one is my tw name, it's ok :)
23:45 < o_be_one> and about moving sponsors to funding, i think it's better for understanding :)
23:46 <@deen> ha, got the last donor!
23:46 <@deen> was milk
23:48 < o_be_one> nice ^^
23:48 < o_be_one> theres not many donors atm, hope this will grow more with this update
23:49 <@deen> yep, just received a donation today =)
23:49 <@deen> there's now also a smal donation status widget on http://ddnet.tw directly
23:50 <@deen> so far I didn't really need many donations, since most servers were sponsored
23:50 < Learath2> deen: ddos on ger presumably :P
23:50 <@deen> yes
23:53 < o_be_one> yes sponsor is a good other way ^^
23:57 <@deen> yep, easier for me
23:57 <@deen> but sponsors can suddenly disappear^^
