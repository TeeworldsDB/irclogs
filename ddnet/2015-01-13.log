01:21 <@deen> Oh, i just noticed that I had an issue on my ddnet todo list: "Filter out bell on Windows"
01:36 < eeeee> http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/01/04/1411080.aspx
01:37 < eeeee> deen: ^
01:37 <@deen> haha
01:40 <@deen> I don't understand what's the proper fix though
01:41 <@deen> someone else should test it on Windows
01:41 < eeeee> me neither. but perhaps bullet is the only char which gets changed to bell
01:43 <@deen> apparently yes
01:43 <@deen> but other characters would become other control characters
01:43 <@deen> which is not desired either
01:46 < eeeee> guess we can use that WideCharToMultiByte function to check if it's gonna be a control character or not
04:02 < maple> anyday now
04:21 < eeeee> i think i found a cdn which lets you have 2tb of traffic for free :>
04:21 < eeeee> you can only have 500 files unfortunately
07:45 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
07:46 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
15:45 < o_be_one> hi all
15:45 < o_be_one> deen, is it normal on this page http://ddnet.tw/settingscommands/ that Server Settings is not shown in a table ?
16:13 < CookieMichal> Hello
17:17 <@deen> oops
17:17 <@deen> o_be_one: thanks, fixed
17:49 < o_be_one> ty deen , i was looking for something to allow mod to ban, you know how i can give this (for personnal server, not for the officiel can ddnet)
18:05 < CookieMichal> deen: I would like to suggest to remove time limit between votes, when there's only 1 person on the server.
18:57 <@deen> CookieMichal: why would you need multiple votes thouhg?
18:58 <@deen> o_be_one: mod_command ban 1
18:58 <@deen> o_be_one: mod_command unban 1
18:58 <@deen> o_be_one: mod_command bans 1
18:58 <@deen> CookieMichal: just use /map? It's always faster
18:58 < CookieMichal> deen: someone had poopy internet and I was waiting for him for like 2 minutes, then he pressed f4 and left ;-; I was alone ;-;
18:58 <@deen> ah
19:01 < o_be_one> deen, thank you :)
19:03 <@deen> ddos on chile
19:03 <@deen> looks like that's happening a lot recently
19:03 <@deen> our major unprotected server =/
19:04 <@deen> looks like I'll have to cancel the server
19:04 < o_be_one> :( but there is many players !!!
19:05 < o_be_one> where can you host with antiddos to allow chile to play ?
19:05 <@deen> yeah, but the datacenter said they will throw me out if another ddos attack happens =/
19:05 <@deen> I don't think you can find cheap ddos protection in chile
19:05 <@deen> which may be why we're the only TW server in chile
19:06 < o_be_one> maybe there is a country with antiddos with descent ping for chile ?
19:06 <@deen> no
19:06 <@deen> I'd really want to be located directly in Chile
19:06 <@deen> They all have ping 10-40
19:07 < o_be_one> ok we need to find something better
19:07 <@deen> good luck
19:07 <@deen> I spent weeks to even find this server
19:08 <@deen> I'm wondering where the attack comes from
19:08 <@deen> the usual european and USA ddosers or someone from chile?
19:09 < o_be_one> in ddnet.tw servers commands you have 2 times the ban command, deen 
19:09 < o_be_one> can we find the ddoser ?
19:09 <@deen> o_be_one: then it must be in the source code twice, i auto-generate that websitre
19:11 < o_be_one> ok so i need to warn you by github ?
19:11 <@deen> I'm busy now, so i don't know why it's in the source twice^^
19:11 <@deen> i bet there's a reason though
19:13 < laxa> deen: have you any idea how I could find the name/socket of a motherboard when it's broken ? :)
19:13 < laxa> anqel's PC is broken, I am trying to help her out
19:13 < laxa> but I have no clue how to find those informations, and apparently she doesn't have them
19:14 <@deen> laxa: ask her to take a photo?
19:14 <@deen> laxa: of the mainboard
19:14 < laxa> hum, and then ? :D
19:15 <@deen> look for the name on the board?
19:15 < laxa> for now, I just know that's an asus mb
19:15 <@deen> I haven't really seen motherboards for some time, not sure if they have names on them^^
19:15 < laxa> I don't think so :x
19:15 <@deen> mine has :P
19:15 <@deen> hm
19:16 <@deen> if the MB is defective, you have to replace it?
19:16 <@deen> then you could remove the cpu cooler and read what it says on thecpu
19:16 < laxa> I am not in germany
19:16 < laxa> anqel doesn't know shit about computer hardware
19:16 <@deen> or look for the bill?
19:16 < laxa> she doesn't have it
19:16 < laxa> she bought the computer to her parents
19:17 < laxa> and apparently her parents bought it on alternate she told me
19:17 <@deen> maybe it says on some sticker?
19:17 < laxa> https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t34.0-12/10928347_558846097586234_1000744422_n.jpg?oh=ca57cc7786db9af19277663727215825&oe=54B83132&__gda__=1421365410_32027054e0073c3d994ca46776ef739b
19:17 < laxa> that's what I got so far :D
19:18 <@EastByte> ah it's an ASUS
19:18 <@deen> with AMD socket
19:18 < laxa> yup
19:18 <@deen> so google for amd asus mainboards that look like that? :P
19:18 <@deen> oh, it's pretty old
19:18 < laxa> yes it is
19:18 <@deen> that's PCI, isn't it?
19:19 <@deen> but the cooler has heatpipes, so not that old
19:19 <@deen> should just buy a new one or what's the plan?
19:20 < laxa> hum
19:20 < laxa> she gave the computer to a friend of her parents
19:20 < laxa> and apparently he said that mb + power supply are dead
19:20 <@EastByte> huh
19:20 < laxa> computer would not start anymore one day
19:21 < laxa> nothing happening when pressing the power buton
19:21 < laxa> so I guess at least the power supply is dead
19:21 < laxa> not sure about the mainboard though
19:21 <@deen> replace electrolytic capacitors
19:21 <@EastByte> ^^
19:21 <@deen> inside the PSU and on mainboard, the broken ones
19:21 <@deen> works every time
19:21 < laxa> I don't even know how to do that lol
19:21 <@deen> solder them out
19:21 <@EastByte> she should try another power supply and see what happens
19:22 <@deen> find working ones in other hardware, solder them in
19:22 < laxa> EastByte: I think that's a pretty good idea
19:22 < laxa> solder ?
19:22 < laxa> !en-fr solder
19:22 < Nimda> Translation: soudure
19:22 < laxa> ok
19:22 <@deen> soldering is way more fun
19:22 < laxa> well, maybe for you deen, but she would need to find someone to do that for her :D
19:22 < laxa> cause I can't
19:23 <@EastByte> I can :P
19:23 < laxa> you wanna go to ahaus to do that EastByte ? :D
19:24 <@EastByte> well, I need some free time and some money for the travel
19:24 <@EastByte> and the promise that she'll date me
19:24 < laxa> lol
19:25 < laxa> she said : sounds good
19:25 <@EastByte> hm btw. can't she take of the cpu?
19:26 < laxa> I am trying to make her do that right now
19:26 <@EastByte> :D
19:27 <@deen> Do we make bets yet on what it is?
19:27 <@deen> I bet for Amd Phenom on socket AM2
19:27 <@EastByte> I never used amd hardware
19:28 < laxa> it's probably that indeed
19:29 < laxa> Amd athlon II
19:29 < laxa> [19:29:23] Anqel: ADX620WFK42GI
19:29 < laxa> that's what is written on the CPU
19:29 <@deen> ah, slightly off
19:29 <@deen> AMD Athlon II X4 620 
19:30 <@deen> AM2+ or AM3...
19:30 < laxa> ADX620WFGIBOXAMD Athlonâ„¢ II X46202600AM3 95 W
19:30 <@deen> ok, AM3
19:33 <@deen> EastByte: now that i think about it, this is my only amd system: http://www.pcengines.ch/alix2d3.htm
19:33 <@EastByte> 3 x ethernet, neat
19:34 <@deen> 100 mbit/s though, their new boards are the APU: http://www.pcengines.ch/apu.htm
19:36 < laxa> I am not that good with hardware
19:36 < laxa> http://www.ldlc.com/fiche/PB00153463.html
19:36 < laxa> do you think that would be good for a new mb ?
19:37 < Savander> why it's so cheap in germany :,
19:37 <@deen> looks good for me
19:37 < Savander> in poland it'll cost 300pln
19:37 < Savander> xD>
19:37 < Savander> no fair !
19:37 < Savander> xD
19:38 < laxa> deen: I am wondering about the RAM, should it work on any mb ?
19:38 < maple> laxaaa
19:38 < maple> sa fait une semaine que jai envoyer mes demos
19:38 < laxa> maple: hi, read my post on ddnet.tw
19:38 < maple> ok
19:39 < maple> ok i see
19:39 <@deen> laxa: AM3 is DDR3, should be fine
19:39 < maple> is there any good linux screen capturing software
19:39 <@deen> maple: ffmpeg
19:40 <@deen> https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Capture/Desktop
19:40 <@deen> at least that's what I used for my videos
19:40 <@EastByte> for teeworlds you should use glc
19:41 < laxa> anyone has old hardware to make a computer cheap ? :D
19:41 <@deen> laxa: my brother had a mainboard and cpu just like that, but sold it a few days ago =/
19:41 <@deen> EastByte: oh nice, opengl capture
19:42 <@EastByte> screen grabbing sucks
19:43 < laxa> best website to buy hardware in germany guys ? :D
19:43 <@deen> laxa: mindfactory.de or look for cheap prices on http://gh.de
19:45 < laxa> http://geizhals.de/biostar-a780l3c-a853859.html?hloc=at&hloc=de
19:46 <@deen> could be enough, but pretty bad :P
19:46 <@deen> the one you had before was much more modern
19:47 <@deen> oh yeah, AM3 is dead, AM3+ should work as well
19:47 < laxa> the new one is working for AM3 and AM3
19:47 < laxa> +
19:47 < laxa> I mean
19:48 <@deen> the biostar one? no
19:48 < laxa> the one I linked on frenchwebsite
19:48 <@deen> yes, that was good
19:48 < laxa> but I don't know if they deliver in germany
19:49 < laxa> that's the website I am using now to get anything computer related
19:49 <@deen> http://www.mindfactory.de/product_info.php/ASRock-980DE3-U3S3-AMD-760G-So-AM3--Dual-Channel-DDR3-ATX-Retail_912324.html
19:49 <@deen> cheaper in germany anyway
19:49 < laxa> lol
19:49 < laxa> but there search engine is dumb
19:49 < laxa> I click AM3
19:49 <@deen> yes, because it's AM3+
19:49 <@deen> not AM3
19:49 < laxa> they could give me mb that works with both socket
19:50 <@deen> ^^
19:50 < laxa> my french website gave me this mb
19:50 < laxa> when I was searching for mb3
19:50 <@deen> I'd say AMD is stupid to cause this socket confusion
19:50 < laxa> for AM3
19:52 < laxa> hum, anqel doesn't care, she would prefer to buy used hardware
19:52 < laxa> or buy an old used computer
19:53 < laxa> thing is, she doesn't have a lot of money to spend
19:57 <@EastByte> atleast teeworlds doesn't need much performance
19:59 < laxa> she is playing cs:go, teeworlds and doing photoshop mainly
19:59 < laxa> sony vegas
20:00 < laxa> crossifre / minecraft / sims
20:02 <@EastByte> we only support teeworlds players here
20:02 <@EastByte> btw. in the weekend we might play some cs:go :)
20:02 < laxa> if you go to her place you mean ?
20:03 <@EastByte> nah, just playing / teamspeak
20:05 < laxa> Nice
20:05 < laxa> I need to find another steam account to play cs:go with new players
20:05 < laxa> my smurf is too high ranked :(
20:05 <@EastByte> ooooh sad
20:05 < laxa> I need to ask a friend to lend me his account cause he isn't using steam atm
20:06 < laxa> and tonight I am suppose to play with a friend that never played cs
20:07 < eeeee> but how do you know mb is broken and not cpu or psu?
20:14 < laxa> no idea, a guy tested that for her
20:14 < laxa> but she'll probably buy something more recent but used for a good price
20:30 < Nimda> Skepsis by Juandissimo & DoNe & Soreu just released on Solo at 2015-01-13 20:25
20:42 < Learath2> cs:go seems so popular nowadays
20:43 <@EastByte> yea of course
20:43 <@EastByte> it's the follower of css and is even simpler
20:44 <@heinrich5991> and it got matchmaking
20:44 <@heinrich5991> that's a dealbreaker IMO
20:44 <@EastByte> hl2 really is a successful gameengine
20:44 <@heinrich5991> "source"
20:45 <@heinrich5991> (source engine)
20:45 < Learath2> we should all play together some day :P
20:45 <@EastByte> right
20:45 <@heinrich5991> sure. now?
20:45 <@heinrich5991> ^^
20:45 < Learath2> I haev time
20:45 <@EastByte> meet on the teamspeak at weekend
20:45 < Learath2> And I also now have a smurf so we don't have to play against GN1's :P
20:46 <@EastByte> smurf?
20:46 < Learath2> Got a new acc to play with a friend who was Silver 1 as you cant play with gold and silver together anymoar
20:47 <@EastByte> hmm
20:47 <@EastByte> what prevents from doing that?
20:47 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: rank?
20:47 <@EastByte> and if you are hosting your own server?
20:47 <@heinrich5991> if you're not five, you can't start a matchmaking search if you're too far apart in ranks
20:47 <@EastByte> does steam prevent it everywhere?
20:47 <@heinrich5991> no
20:47 < Learath2> Some kind of boosting protection you cant play matchmaking together if you are too far
20:47 <@EastByte> ah matchmaking
20:48 < Learath2> I tried hosting a server apparently my vps isnt quite enuff
20:53 < Learath2> soo we playing or not ?
21:07 < laxa> I'll play now
21:08 < laxa> with a total nooby friend, that has never played cs:go
21:08 < laxa> and I got an unranked account from a friend
21:08 < laxa> my main account is MGE
21:08 < laxa> and my smurf MG1 ^^
21:09 < Learath2> Im pretty much stuck in GN1 
21:10 < laxa> :D
21:10 < Learath2> 3 wins in a row then russians
21:10 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: laxa: so, can I join?
21:10 < laxa> yes I guess
21:11 < laxa> but I need to explain the game in french to my friend
21:11 < laxa> and maybe tell him how it's working before we hop into matchmaking I guess
21:11 <@heinrich5991> can I join your TS (or something else?) nevertheless
21:11 < laxa> ts.ddnet.tw
21:11 < laxa> but we are using skype T_T
21:12 <@heinrich5991> tell him to join TS :D
21:12 < Learath2> well you can join me on ts heinrich5991 if they are on skype
21:12 < laxa> Yeah, I don't know if he has TS
21:12 < laxa> Learath2: use ddnet official TS :p
21:13 < Learath2> but then i'd feel away from my home laxa
21:13 < D3skj3t> need admin please
21:15 <@deen> D3skj3t: yes?
21:15 < D3skj3t> i get vote kick everytime from server
21:15 < D3skj3t> gos they want 1v1
21:15 < D3skj3t> abusing votekick
21:15 <@deen> 1v1 where?
21:16 < D3skj3t> open fng
21:18 < D3skj3t> blacknina
21:18 < D3skj3t> started the vote
21:18 <@deen> i talked to them, they kicked you again?
21:18 < D3skj3t> not now
21:19 <@deen> ok
21:19 < D3skj3t> but earlier i got votekick 
21:19 < D3skj3t> then when i joint again they did kick again
21:20 <@deen> i talked to them, should be fine now
