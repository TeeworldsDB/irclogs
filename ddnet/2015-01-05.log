15:17 < laxadedi_> deen
15:17 <@deen> laxadedi: yes?
15:17 < laxadedi> can I ask you something in private ? it's not about ddnet or teeworlds
15:17 <@deen> sure

22:33 < Learath2> deen: would you be interested in merging in a httpdownload for maps 
22:33 <@deen> yes!
22:35 < Learath2> one question i check if the map exists on the server by trying to download and checking for 404 but can prolly also check if it exists by querying a script 
22:35 < Learath2> and deen moved the autoupdate stuff to dd_autoupdate
22:35 <@deen> what script? why a script?
22:35 <@deen> i think 404 is fine
22:36 < Learath2> if the page has a fancy 404 page it downloads it all before i can check for 404
22:37 < Learath2> so it first downloads the 404 then removes it and fallsback to teeworlds download
22:37 <@deen> huh, you don't need to download the full page for 404
22:37 <@deen> you can just check the header and stop then?
22:38 < Learath2> could prolly do some libcurl magic to only get the header
22:38 <@deen> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10775205/c-libcurl-check-header-before-downloading-body
22:39 <@deen> anyway, if it's complicated, doesn't matter
22:39 <@deen> I'll make 404 page small
22:39 <@deen> (ok, that SO solution is bad)
22:39 < Learath2> i found it deen http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION.html
22:40 <@deen> yep, that sounds better
22:40 < Learath2> ill make the fetcher just not do anything if the header is 404
22:50 < Learath2> found even better one if http response is =>400 it just fails
22:57 <@deen> nice
