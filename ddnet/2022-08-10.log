01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> can't i connect dummy using dummy_connect and make it join a team on the same bind ?
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> bind x "dummy_connect; cl_dummy 1; say /team 1" ?
04:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <zhaozilong> https://i.imgflip.com/6pggbb.jpg
04:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> ???
04:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <zhaozilong> admins admins!
04:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is there syntax for multiple exclusions in the browser search function
04:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> commas dont appear to work
04:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if there's no such functionality ill bet there is already an issue for it :P
04:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I would allow like a feature for "friends or empty" as a filter
05:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no you can't because dummy connect takes time and there's no way to wait for the next bind to activate
06:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> You still need these?

06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <m!ki> U have to whitelist yourself, read server name
06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> guys how do i config my server to use a different map?
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> `sv_map mapname`
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> where do i run this?
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you can set it in the autoexec_server.cfg
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> or f2
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> in game?
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> or running DDNet server app
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1006784423536119930/unknown.png
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> lol what is this
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> mac
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> ddnet server
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> downloaded from their site
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> it runs a server with sunnyside
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> i can connect to it
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> from the client
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well just download the map you want to play on, put it where it has to be on your mac (idk the path)
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Would you say something like this would work for new freeze? (This isn't coded yet, just a simple skin swap)
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1006784629484814486/new_freeze_concept.demo.mp4
06:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> then you login in rcon (admin, f2)
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I donâ€™t think so but would also very much appreciate it
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@lynn)
06:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> where do i download maps from
06:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> i want to download either multimap, or multieasymap
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Would you say something like this would work for new freeze? (This isn't coded yet, just a simple skin swap)
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> (Also the reason it looks weird is because there's no back asset for the skin; I don't know how to incorporate it while still keeping the transparency
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1006784629484814486/new_freeze_concept.demo.mp4

06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea I use it mostly when I find abandoned repos. To figure out which fork is the most relevant.
06:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@k2d222)
06:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> when i press f2, a console opens
06:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> asking for password
06:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sad
06:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes
06:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you have to use the password that you set using `sv_rcon_password`
06:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> or the generated password you can see in the console
06:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> i never set a password
06:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the idea looks nice, i think the ice should be a bit mroe transparent tho
06:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> there's a file you should take a look at how it works
06:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> idk how you set that on mac with that tool you're using
06:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> im running steam version of the game
06:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but write a file called autoexec_server.cfg in your game folder
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1006785992516194314/unknown.png
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> and put some lines like
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sv_rcon_password yourpassword
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sv_name Server Name
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sv_port 8303
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sv_map MapName
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ...
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> and put some lines like
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sv_rcon_password yourpassword
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sv_name Server Name
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sv_port 8303
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sv_map MapName
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> # ...
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```
06:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I'll send over the fixes once codedev validates it, so that i dont waste time
06:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> what is default password
06:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> if you didn't set a password it is auto generated & should be visible on console
06:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> wdym visible in console
06:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i wish freeze was additive
06:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so a layer above the regular skin
06:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i think that's the plan
06:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> also it'd be really funny if there was an icy sounding tee hook for when you hook a frozen tee
07:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ~~also can we like, remove the unused sounds? on god no one uses them for their mods~~
07:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> Guys, why isn't multimap around anymore
07:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> i used to play this game a few years ago and i always played on Multimap
07:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> per-player gameskins pls
07:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> at least an option for it
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> copy the same protocol for skins and matching os filename from server
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> /map Multimap
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> on any server
07:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> there used to be like 10 servers at all times running Multimap
07:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DESTROYER> with loads of players
07:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> There still are variations of multimap
07:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> would be cool
07:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i had a fun idea of double skins too, where you have two images and you overlay the assets from one onto the other. not much practical use, but you can get some cool skin designs out of it
07:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's really nice, you can add freeze skin over normal skin quite easily i think
07:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yeah, I'll just wait until codedev sees this, since this was his idea
07:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> would be nice to have team of ppl trying to manage UX so stuff looks consistent or something
07:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i suppose the idea of "tee-ish" is already present in the game
07:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <le1039dxl12> https://i.imgflip.com/6pggbb.jpg
08:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1006804376502939719/unknown.png
08:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice
08:48 <+ChillerDragon> blaze it
08:49 <+ChillerDragon> WHITE THEME GITHUB MASTERRACE https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1660114138.png
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> Ah the thing is asynchronous
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> Ill try to make endless bind to see if it catches it after XD
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it will prevent you from playing normally i guess
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> after 10 years of people asking features
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> they do something finally lmao
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Mermaid diagrams was asked since years, gitlab was way faster to release it
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> they might have taken things a lil bit too far no :D?
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> they might have taken things a lil bit too far no ðŸ˜„ ?
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> like simple graphs were probably wanted, but is it really necessary to render 3D stl :justatest:
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> we can finally make a 3d tee in github!
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Looks like bors will become obsolete by this quarter: https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/370
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Ez
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> sure, @Ravie  what do you think about using something like that as overlay?
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> definitely won't fit all skins and it already looks quite fat, I think keeping the hitbox tight on frozen skin is important
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Procedural frozen skin generation when?
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can prolly cover the tee in hexagons
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> ??
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> we could just use a shader, as jupy suggested
