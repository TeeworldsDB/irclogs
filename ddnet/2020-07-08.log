00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @louis are you sure? I thought the way hook velocity is propagated hasn't changed since ever
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no, i started a lan server on teeworlds and connected two clients and my hook was super different from early versions of teeworlds
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the hook in teewars was very  buggy, there weren't any collisions so you could basically create a sideways pendulum if you just held hook on a tee
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> https://youtu.be/IKDFyMljPak?t=43
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :Bandicam:
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> lol that hook
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm, missing in tee-to-tee hook physics seems to be 
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> - friction while tee is on the ground
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> - minimum radius of impact
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> - gravity on hooked tee (?)
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> 
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> am i missing smth?
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and holy fuck he already knows how to double rocket :heartw:
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the hammer animation is so nice
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well it looks like shit but it smooth
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I have an odd issue, servers with people on them show an empty scoreboard, which also means I can't find friends. My internet has been acting up today so perhaps it's somehow connected
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Ravie thats what servers do when theyre being flooded with inforequests
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its anti ddos thing
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the master servers? I can only see people on fokkonaut's playground
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i guess his server isnt getting attacked or doesnt have that type of protection on it
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no, almost all servers are under attack
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> hm that's sad
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chumtoad> agreed
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chumtoad> big ddos nobos
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> pls stop ddos me
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chumtoad> ddos zombietroll
01:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> hello pls dont promote illegal activities
01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> they should put all their effort into ddosing kog instead of me
02:08 <+fstd> i'm only having about 10 Mbit/sec incoming
02:08 <+fstd> what kind of sorry ass DDoS is that
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its spread thin across every server on tw i guess
02:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Darren Henk> get that cloudlfare boyssss 💪
02:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Darren Henk> get that cloudlfare waf boyssss 💪
02:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Darren Henk> probably wont help in this situation anyways, idk whats being ddos and what the interfacing application is
02:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Darren Henk> also cloudflare can be bypassed anyways so not like it would matter... rip
02:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> cloudflare is for tcp right
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Darren Henk> ive seen udp and tcp floods before but I am not too sure what is being ddos'ed, how, where it is located, what is the interfacing application, etc etc.
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what: every popular teeworlds server+the master server itself
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how: spoofed udp flood
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> where: everywhere
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Darren Henk> cloudflare offers 1 website free waf protection, they do offer more indepth comprehensive packages that allow you to pass all your traffic through their network and tunnel back to your site but ingress and egress is costly. Also, if your links get saturated then whats the point as your links would be your bottleneck.
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thats for tcp isnt it
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> its for http
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> then yes; also the problem isnt that the links get saturated (generally), its that it consumes all the cpu of the server when it tries to either filter or reply
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Darren Henk> you usually want to block flood as high upstream as possible, closest to the gateways before it would ideally reach your network. these providers want you to pay a fortune for ddos protection, the only good ones ive heard is OVH for gaming, other provided usually switch off your VPS when ddos happens/
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ovh is good
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/730224334005600316/unknown.png
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Darren Henk> you usually want to block flood as high upstream as possible, closest to the gateways before it would ideally reach your network. these providers want you to pay a fortune for ddos protection, the only good ones ive heard is OVH for gaming, other providers usually switch off your VPS when ddos happens/
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Darren Henk> where did you get this information?
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and nullroute generally isnt an issue with these types of attacks
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/730224723702841364/Screen_Shot_2020-07-07_at_7.52.14_PM.png
02:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Darren Henk> at work we had both a tcp and udp flood coming to our network.. funny enough the source address was 0.0.0.0/0 and destination address was 0.0.0.0/0. our perimeter firewall was dropping these packets however our links were saturated so not point trying to add extra mitigation on the perimeter. so we contact our provider to start blocking incoming traffic to our network upstream to lessen the saturation and then our perimeter fw can handl
02:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> these attacks are generally spoofing real tw player ips so blocking it this way isnt possible
02:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and they arent high volume enough to worry about saturating the link
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love how everyone has a great experience with ovh, but when we try them they null route us 5 minutes into attacks
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or put a firewall on our ssh port so we cant even connect, best ddos protection
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> OVH blocked my private IP address every time I refreshed the ddnet.tw website too quickly 😄
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now that I think about it, it does actually stop the ddos. If there is no traffic there can't be any ddos 🤔
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/lawful-access-encrypted-data-act-backdoor/
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> wow
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> but i think that always was a backdoor for government
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apple has for fbi
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz fbi cried
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Didn't FBI cry to force Apple creating backdoor for them, because they couldn't break into one of apple's phone?
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Imagine being an old dinasaur thinking you can regulate math
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you got nothing to hide you got nothing to worry about guise
12:49 <+ChillerDragon> yo @Learath2 how do you respond to people that say "i have nothing to hide"?
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> by pointing out that this argument only works when ur values 100% align with those of the government in the country u live in?
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> chiller
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> someone was faking u on fng earlier
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> they told me u allowed it is that true
13:01 <+Learath2> ChillerDragon: Just because you have nothing to hide from the current people in power, doesn't mean you won't have something to hide from the next govenrment in power
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes thats what i meant
13:02 <+Learath2> Also, it's a slippery slope, you got nothign to hide, so how about microphones in your house? It's only the government, there is no reason to worry
13:02 <+Learath2> Or some cameras maybe?
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the more backdoors like this that exist, the more likely it is theyll be exploited by a malicious 3rd party too
13:03 <+Learath2> How about we give a skeleton key to the government so they can unlock every lock ever made?
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration#Checked_baggage
13:05 <+Learath2> Exactly ^^, everyone and their mothers can get a copy of the TSA skeleton keys now
13:06 <+Learath2> And the TSA has the worst track record ever, the backdoor didn't even help
13:07 <+Learath2> Besides, I don't even know of a secure way to give them a backdoor
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> asymmetric crypto
13:07 <+Learath2> You can't revoke keys
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> assuming they can keep the key secure
13:09 <+Learath2> Also, how do you prove that two ciphertexts belong to the same plaintext?
13:09 <+Learath2> If you only have a key for one?
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you require the software authors to do it that way
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> didn't work great for ban of cryptography exports
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that did delay secure crypto for the world for a bit
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> even creeping into standards
13:10 <+Learath2> I guess if you punish everyone releasing proper crypto software, but if you write the software yourself, there is no way for them to figure it out
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess they'd be fine with that
13:11 <+Learath2> You don't even need to do the crypto yourself, not like they can make openssl disappear. You can just encrypt what you want with the governments key and the actual message with the recepients key
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not quite as easy, usually when doing asymmetric crypto, you don't encrypt the message, but the random symmetric key used for encrypting the message
13:12 <+Learath2> I actually wondered whether you could have two keys decrypting the same ciphertext, but neither the discrete logarithm nor the elliptic curve multiplication feel like they could be modified as such
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://earth.2020.cscg.de/tasks/RSA%20Service
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ctf task: here's a plain text and a cipher text, find a key
13:14 <+Learath2> bad prime choice?
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
13:15 <+Learath2> @heinrich5991, that's a good idea actually, provide two encrypted symmetric keys and one ciphertext
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's how asymmetric crypto is usually implemented
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's really slow, so you only use it for encrypting a random symmetric key
13:16 <+Learath2> I guess in the dystopian future we'll have to regress back to the dark ages and use steganography
13:17 <+Learath2> I'll send you mail with microdots
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or exercise your rights in a democracy to not let that happen
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I think saying "that can't happen" is dangerous
13:17 <+Learath2> germany is lucky to have proportional representation guaranteed by not using an insane voting system
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it's lucky to have its democracy reestablished after one failure
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> could already learn from that
13:18 <+Learath2> The rest of the world is stuck with the two party system, forever stuck in a loop between the shit party and the shit-lite party
13:19 <+Learath2> the best part is, it's not in the interest of either party to actually change the voting system :D
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 the TSA and locks u talked about reminded me about this awesome talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YYvBLAF4T8
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a must watch tbh
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can bypass lot of doors with a sheet of plastic, its hilarious
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://youtu.be/4YYvBLAF4T8?t=719>
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 thanks for the ping, the spanish translation from that guy already looks bad xd
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like it was made by a non native i guess
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> he admitted to using google translate
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> at some point I wondered why the same guy is providing translations for 3-4 languages 😄
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why would he do that tho
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because they probably don't realize that this leads to bad translations
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you also can't translate literally, some expresions from english dont work in spanish
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or look redundant
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Some expressions really don't translate to some languages
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deen already feeling pain from my update to include the data files in CMakeLists.txt
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 😄
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > I think having two different config directories is wise at all.
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thats missing a dont I guess :D
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://sqlite.org/amalgamation.html#the_split_amalgamation
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> quite accomodating (the split amalgamation)
15:38 <+ChillerDragon> @noby @Learath2 yea thats about the arguments I use. But the people I talk to are usually not worried about having microphones and cameras in their house or car because they already have that
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> also they want the goverment to here their critique
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> i sometimes have a hard time explaining it
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> there are appropriate channels to give feedback and being spied on isnt one of them
15:40 <+ChillerDragon> What worked best for me so far is pointing out that not everyone might need private communications but some doctors/politicians and journalists need it and we depend on them having privacy
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> true
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and military
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> and they have better privacy if everybody uses private communication
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> if you have 10 unencrypted taffics and 1 encrypted guess who the journalist is
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> and without journalists the democracy dies
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol yeah
15:41 <+ChillerDragon> and yes i allow faking
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> i am also faking
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> unfair ppl boost ur stats :p
15:42 <+ChillerDragon> yea
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> my mom also boosts my netflix stats
15:43 <+ChillerDragon> cuz we share acc
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do u go for multis there too
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "We don't have an option to only compile the server."
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 is that so?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw is it bad practice to put the sql queries,etc in a sql file and #include as a constant somewhere?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> specially big ones
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/410980/include-a-text-file-in-a-c-program-as-a-char
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> is it possible to get my total in-game time on ddnet servers
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no, only total finished rank time
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> is it possible to get time for every finish on every map or only best time is saved
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> every finish iirc
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> And where could i get that
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u do /times Ryozuki on a map u can see al ur finishes
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not their time tho
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make ur sql query
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> so the only way is to go in game and do `/times` on every map i finished multiple times
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Alexandar what's your ingame name?
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Aca^
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 782619 seconds
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> isn't there a bot command for that exact thing
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> is that total play time or only start to finish
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sum of all finished maps
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we don't track when you're online
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> and it also takes in count for maps that i've finished multiple times
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Total time for Aca^: 8 days 17 hours 58 minutes 52 seconds
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #bot-cmds
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> cant believe i wrote a js script to calculate all the best time for all finished maps when i couldve just asked the bot
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> okay, thanks guys
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> would've been easier to download our sql database and run the query yourself
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/#importing-the-official-ddnet-database
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Not really experienced with sql and didnt know where to download it
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Though the time that you gave me in seconds and the time bot spat out is different
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It's a good thing to learn SQL, in this case the query would've been: `select sum(Time) from record_race where Name = "Aca^";`
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ah, the bot is probably smarter
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we have some maps with "weird" times
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so it probably excludes those
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> like Flappy Bird
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> oh yeah i saw that
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> my time on flappy bird says its 121:13
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i guess thats how the map actually works
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, it's a bit weird to use the times for a score
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the bot does not exclude those maps https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/500032072455290880/699705146505953351
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexandar> > @Alexandar what's your ingame name?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexandar> @deen time to change the name 😄
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> anyone know the exact size of kill hitboxes and block hitboxes?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> are they the same size
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah well
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unidirectional block and other block has different hitboxes btw
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @heinrich5991 the last two translations on #2462 are done in a wrong context
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2462
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <afterfx> Question, how long or when it will be fixed the lagging issues ?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unclear, never. when the attack stops
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ravie it was reverted already
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> polish wasn't reverted yet, only french
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh
17:06 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki
17:06 <+ChillerDragon> > "We don't have an option to only compile the server."
17:06 <+ChillerDragon> there is -DCLIENT=OFF
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and `ninja DDNet-Server` to only build one target
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye thats why what heinrich said was confusing to me
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2465#discussion_r451498036 should read "to only compile the client"
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> Is it possible to see the ips from where are ddosing?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> they are all spoofed ips so no
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> this is something that must be fixed at the provider level
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> (of the senders) once it reaches the destination its too late to trace
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think not all of the DoS is from spoofed sources
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i saw a counterstrike reflection attack earlier otday
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I have a question about DDoS: My vps hoster blocks traffic to my vps and support says it's because there is an ongoing DDoS attack. I wonder how blocking all traffic benefits them. Their isp should still route the traffic to their internet connection and potentially impact the other customers virtual servers, right?
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> 
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Just thinking somebody here might know, you can't google "DDoS", too buzzwordy
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's the option for the VPS provider to nullroute your IP address
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then the packets won't reach their premises anymore
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wtf unique is down too now?
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it might also be (if you're hosting a 0.6 server) that your server is used for an amplification attack
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> is this within the vps providers network or will they tell their isp to nullroute the ip
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> benefits them because the attack could interfere with other customers on the same machine who arent being actively ddosed
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know how nullrouting works. it roughly tells other networks that they don't need to route traffic to your IP via their network
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> hmm  right, it's a virtual server so that makes sense
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk how specifically either but ik the general purpose of it
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> actually this happened in the past and i was always under the impression it is a reflection attack. they provide me with a basic traffic in/out per month graph and it's about the same huge amount in and out this month
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think the only way to tell if ur being used for reflection is to see if the source ips are spoofed randomly/as tw players or in a targeted way towards a few single targets
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> most attacks ive seen seem to be of the first type
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i think they might be really blocking me because of the out traffic, some kind of system to prevent their customers doing DoS attacks from their servers and support is just giving me the default response
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you host 0.6 servers?
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could try ratelimiting info packets
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> there are ways to prevent ur server from replying to all of the attack packets
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ye that^
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> his servers are 06 but support 07 afaik
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 0.7 is less problematic in that respect
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yeah i was ratelimiting info packets, this worked for the last attack https://github.com/unique-clan/unique-scripts/blob/091efbbc89f67d8eb03dbada004b4e58f62fdbd9/setup-iptables.sh#L25-L32
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> maybe i missed some
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> your VPS is nullrouted rn so you can't get a traffic sample, right?
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> connect packets as well, maybe
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yep
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the attacks today seem to be mostly inforequest floods, with occasional floods of <5byte pks, and occasional floods of >300-1000 byte pkts
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> anybody else has some iptables rules i could check against by any chance?
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> mabye
20:45 <+ChillerDragon> yo shellhackers does someone know how to do "live pipes" if id had a better way to describe it i would probably find it online haha
20:46 <+ChillerDragon> some guy mentioned it once that he was able to use the pipe | without buffering until the command on the left side finished
20:46 <+ChillerDragon> so one can edit stdout of a long running command and get live results
20:48 <+fstd> edit stdout?
20:48 <+fstd> like, manually?
20:48 <+ChillerDragon> nah like with something else
20:48 <+ChillerDragon> maybe my usecase makes sense
20:48 <+ChillerDragon> i have a process that takes time and prints a lot of lines i want to see live output of that
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> turn on line buffering for the stdout of that process
20:49 <+ChillerDragon> but i want to pipe it through a censor utility first
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> many command line tools have a command line switch that does that
20:49 <+ChillerDragon> long_proc | sed 's/secret/***/g'
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is long proc?
20:49 <+fstd> oh
20:49 <+ChillerDragon> scp
20:49 <+fstd> yeah for that it's -l, but there's also stdbuf
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh yea
20:50 <+fstd> which sometimes works depending on what the program does
20:50 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea looking into scp stdout option is a idea as well
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> scp is not the optimal program for transferring large amounts of data btw, rsync is likely faster
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (also works over ssh)
20:50 <+ChillerDragon> i was confused by rsync :D
20:50 <+ChillerDragon> but ye ik
20:54 <+ChillerDragon> rsync -r --info=progress2 -e ssh src dst
20:54 <+ChillerDragon> did the job :)
20:54 <+ChillerDragon> thanks guis i was totally on the wrong path lol
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no need for -e ssh
20:55 <+ChillerDragon> oh?
20:56 <+ChillerDragon> ah nice
20:59 <+ChillerDragon> oh boi and how much faster it is!
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Plantii!> i have cloned the ddnet-maps repository and want to start a ddnet server on windows with it, but i cant get it to load the autoexec_server.cfg file. i start it via a .lnk in the command line in the directory of the cfg file, might that be a problem?
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen || @heinrich5991 I was thinking, should we maybe run ddnet servers as needed up to a cap?
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like run more until there is one server with 0 players or we hit the cap
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We'd have less servers on the master server list
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sounds fine to me. You need a limit of how many servers max
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and people can't use favorites anymore, but I'm not sure if they use that much
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> also the server startups might cause slight lags since they can cause swapping
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> Do always opening and closing servers will not make lags?
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> I think better stay with that servers we have
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> Always opening and closing servers will be more expensive too cuz opening new tasks deals a lots of energy so energy cost will be bigger
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen maybe we should also send the cl_showdistance for the dummy
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/1782d95d999df0aa0f5cdac3f6f5289f843ab7d5#diff-8a24b0d0ea486146c2a6f0c8db63e153R1566
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i guess?
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> also, you know that 2000 and 1500 is very far? its not the same as before
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its about twice as high now
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay no, not twice
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but a bit
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> also, zoom steps are different now
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <racer290> i always used the hookline always on feature to play but updated yesterday, now its not showing anymore and i cant find the name of the switch to enter in the console, is there someone here who could help me with that?
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sorry, deen, it isnt, i was wrong
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but 2000 and 1500 is very big area
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why isnt it 1000/800?
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like before?
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> with the old area I had the experience that a tee flying in quickly can still be invisible
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> especially when playing with pings > 100
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> also, my default area is 1441x797
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, you mean the default when nothing is sent by the client
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Just want to confirm old memory: TW 0.7 changed the way mapres are rendered, and no longer borderadd & others border-smthg are needed, right?
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sounds right
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut thanks for testing stuff
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> np
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TortiLeq yeah, but on the other hand Learath2 is right that during non-peak hours we have dozens of empty servers around
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> which makes the server list load slower and wastes a bit of bandwidth
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> Hmm... so idk
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> Ok
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> Deen you remember that some days ago i said to you that we need 2-4 ger2 servers?
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> So i think its good idea to make something like about 5 reserve servers that will be use when all servers would be full
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we can dot hat quickly on demand
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> But cant make it automatically?
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not at the moment
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's what Learath2 is suggesting
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that we do it dynamically automatically, with fixed minimum and maximum amount of servers
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> Yeah its trouble that dynamically can make more lags than its now... i didnt think about that fact
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> Maybe 4 was too many... maybe close 2
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> 2 questions that kinda drowned:

23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Plantii! the `autoexec_server.cfg` should be automatically used by default by the `DDNet-Server.exe`. Alternatively, you can use shortcut with `-f "configname.cfg"` i.e.```D:\Gry\DDNet\DDNet.exe -f "force_entities.cfg"```
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @racer290 one of those:
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ```cl_show_hook_coll_other 2
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> cl_show_hook_coll_own 2```
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Patiga 👍
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <racer290> nice, thank you :)
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> nice :)
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Haha, pay once, use server forever. Not sure I can take the hoster seriously after seeing that offered. I'd be afraid they'll go out of business a month later
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/730542565606031550/screenshot-20200708235426.png
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TortiLeq we can always debounce it a little, like only kill servers if they are empty for a while
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen lol, what is that offer even
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What currency is that btw?
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rubles?
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> looks like russian's rouble
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
