11:21 <+Learath2> deen: where do you get the vanilla on the servers?
11:48 <@deen> ?
11:48 <@deen> github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
11:49 <@deen> you can fork it over to ddnet/teeworlds if you want to port the fixes
11:53 <+Learath2> deen: it was github.com/eeeee/ddnet @vanilla_ws
11:53 <+Learath2> chl and usa still had their .git intact
11:59 <@deen> oh
12:01 <+Learath2> patched them with eeeee's fix for now, we can work in the websockets again later
12:06 <+Learath2> deen: do we have a source for infectionz I can patch?
12:14 <@deen> yeah, it's lying around on the servers
12:14 <@deen> We were instructed by the coffee guy not to publish the source code though
12:16 <@deen> but might as well stop hosting it if it's too much work
12:16 <@deen> dunno if anyone even plays the mod anymore
12:32 <+Learath2> tw-plus seems to have it's own token stuff that doesn't seem to be working
12:32 <+Learath2> Teetime should patch it himself :/
12:34 <@deen> thanks for taking care of this Learath2 
12:34 <+Learath2> well eeeee wrote the patch, I'm just applying it :P

16:45 <+Learath2> deen: well I patched the blockz source but apparently the blockz source doesn't even compile :P
16:47 <+Learath2> nvm I should have RTFM :P
17:17 <+Learath2> !playercount

22:15 <+Teetime> Learath2 what token stuff?
22:17 <+Learath2> oh wait, wtf was I merging the patch to then
22:17 <+Learath2> yeah there is no token stuff in tw-plis
22:17 <+Learath2> plus*
22:20 <+Learath2> Teetime: well while you are here could you give the patch a merge? :P
22:21 <+Teetime> I don't really play teeworlds actively anymore and I'm quite busy atm :/ If you want to make a pull request I'll glady merge it though
