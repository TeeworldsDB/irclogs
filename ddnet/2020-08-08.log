00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> well all physics layers (game, front, tele...) always have the same size iirc
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> can someone help me find my save info
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i looked in ddnet_saves.txt but not there, i just dont know my dummy name
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> @louis ddnet-saves.txt is a new thing
01:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> from 14.0
02:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> omg
04:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @jao but then you can refer them to that place instead of looking where you should refer them to
10:22 <+ChillerDragon> @Lady Saavik i have a experimental client that has fully keyboard support in editor there is barley mouse interaction needed i can confirm using arrow keys is a lot of fun to switch layers :)
10:23 <+ChillerDragon> its 0.7 based tho xd
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <stnwtr> Is there an official teeworlds protocol documentation?
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> some comments in the source code, but i don't know anything else
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> @stnwtr https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/tree/master/src/engine/docs
11:40 <+ChillerDragon> there is also https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation but thats not technical its more for the enduser
11:42 <+ChillerDragon> i mean thats no docs but it can help https://github.com/fstd/wireshark/commit/0e9b93a067a8c71ff81230d39b1e97d674f59bfc
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <stnwtr> thanks a lot
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Welf your suggestions are a bit harder to implement i think
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/741622200955830282/Screenshot_2020-08-08-13-41-31-030_com.discord.jpg
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Shit, this would be a showstopper for tournament 1
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ^
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not sure what it's related to
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the issue?
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe its sql related?
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's about team state
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> some stale tee is still in team
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe you can rollback to a version that works?
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont recall any change to team state rn
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> restarting doesnt help right? xd
19:59 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> just checked, finish on regular server are still working
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in team?
19:59 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> yes
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> was the server empty?
19:59 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> yes (only we two)
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, thanks, but was too late, i had the restart prepared
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> rolled back to 14.2 release version
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> didn't see anything weird in logs, weird
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen did you not put a sixup version of the map?
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought it was auto generated in our map_release script
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> though I guess we don't do a map release for tournament maps
20:37 <@deen> oh, i also thought it would get auto-created
20:39 <@deen> i have added it manually now
20:40 <@deen> ok, my script was broken, will fix
20:42 <@deen> should be auto-created now
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 We had quite a few maps missing because of this: Aries, Cerulean, Comeback, GetSpeed 3, Loader, LS10, Onyx, Redefined 2, Smash, Snow Problem, Sunny Side Up, Time Calculator, Volt, Yun Gu 3
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well because of safety measures you can't turn on sixup support while the game is running so the first map will be 0.6 only
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> Can anyone give some advice about mysql select?
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> 
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> I'd like to get top5 last maps info (Points, Stars, number of finishes, top1 time). 
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> My current select works, but it doesn't include maps that doesn't have any finish (without any record in `race` table).
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> 
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> ||`SELECT maps.Map, maps.Stars, COUNT(race.Map), FLOOR(MIN(IFNULL(race.Time,0))) FROM maps JOIN race ON race.Map = maps.Map AND maps.Server='HRD' AND maps.Timestamp <= NOW() GROUP BY race.Map  ORDER BY maps.Timestamp DESC LIMIT 5`||
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tezcan> Hello can someone here tell me how to activate tele numbers? http://prntscr.com/twb84r
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tezcan> so i know which teletile is where
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> wheres your checkpoint tile

21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tezcan> @qshar i want it like it was before, having numbers on the teletiles, adding new teletiles wont help me fixing maps
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cl_text_entities 1
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tezcan> @fokkonaut thank you!!
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> xd

21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Lady Saavik> @qshar @deen is pro at it
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @qshar use a full outer join instead of an inner join
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well actually you want a left join here
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> outch, indeed. Ye, you are right. Thanks!
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> qdash
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> I also have 2 suggestions, i want to further suggest adding switching with arrow keys and/or tab between width and heigth of the layer sizes (when editing through right click).
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> Also i would love to have a function to make all layers (or all layers in a specific group) the same size.
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> edit: you can use shift left click (on a group or on different tile layers) and then shift right click to edit multiple layers at once
