02:22 < Learath2> prs are there for review
02:23 < Learath2> i guess the preferred workflow would be start working on feature create pr for it, get review along the way
02:24 < Learath2> start working on a feature == create a feature branch on your own fork
02:39 < Learath2> maybe only develop and master on the main repo where we merge from develop to master occasionally and tag it

20:13 < Ryozuki> i get some errors when compiling using cmake (mingw)
20:13 < Ryozuki> i get spammed with lots of these:
20:13 < Ryozuki> undefined reference to `__stack_chk_guard'
20:13 < Ryozuki> undefined reference to `__stack_chk_fail'
20:14 < Ryozuki> (when the compiler is linking)
20:58 <@deen> Ryozuki: try experimenting with the linking command, probably something too much or sth missing
20:58 <@deen> and compare to bam linking
20:59 <@deen> same as they instructed me on github issue today
