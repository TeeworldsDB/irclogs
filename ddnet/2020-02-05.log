00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikr
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://zillyhuhn.com:8080/jh
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i got a core file of gdb ðŸ˜„
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> did anyone of you guys ever tried to handle exit codes in gdb?
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i want to automate debugging and pass the $_exitcode out of gdb but some crashes seem to create non integer exit codes so ``quit $_exitcode`` fails on integer conversion
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and using the python events api to quit gdb seems to crash gdb which always results in the same exit code
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i wish their shell api was better im sure that wouldnt cause a crash :p
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> oh nyo he retarded :feelspepoman:

00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> censorship
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> now i have to look up irc logs :/
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> but you have gdb you cant :FeelsBadMan:
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im lost
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how can it be that the internet is not full of solutions for this average problem?
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> Where is my new ddnet android version ? :tee_thinking:
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon when that's the case, it sometimes signifies that there is a better way to handle the problem you are trying to solve
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ikr @Learath2 thatâ€™s why I wonder I did not find that solution online yet
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> @n000b i just have another question to demos/replays:
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> why i cant watch my saved replays? it say that the file is invalid (like when i cut demos and save them).
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> It worked with the first view demos xd
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> ah ok. I added a custom path in the storage.cfg. i changed it from last entry to second entry and now it works xd...
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> But i changeed cl_replay_length to 60 but its still only records 30 seconds?
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <moon> yo can someone tell me how I can contact a developer? having issues with client
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <moon> do i just ask here?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, you just ask here
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <moon> alright so... I can't find any GER servers since a couple of weeks, can only connect via IP... and it laggs like crazy
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <moon> is this just me?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <moon> GER 2 works perfectly
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @archimede67 someone ahs Troubles with the replay lenght. You know what is what?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @moon you sure you don't filter them?
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <moon> I am
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <moon> I even have packetloss on GER
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Deathman | Gotty make sure you are on the very latest version, there were a couple issues a couple versions back
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <moon> maybe you guys block me or smth idk
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @moon I can check connectivity later when I get home
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <moon> oh sure thanks
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> @Learath2 i always am
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @n000b huh?
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> you can specify the length: save_replay 60 for 60s
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> but keep in mind that if you save_replay 60 then like 5 seconds later you redo save_replay 60, that second replay will only be 5s long
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> ok and what is cl_replay_length then
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `save_replay 60` saves a replay that is at most 60 seconds long
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `save_replay` saves a replay that is at most `cl_replay_length` seconds long
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> ye but i did length 60 but it only save 30 seconds
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and you played for more than 60s since the last `save_replay`?
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> ofc i am not stupid pls
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Well that's weird then
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> :C
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> how fix ?
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I don't know)
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> thx
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> wow very helpful
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> xd
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Cha I thought it was more useful than remaining silent
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Cha no trolls allowed here
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> nah i thought the tone was just kinda sarcastic lol
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> i am not a troll
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> @heinrich5991 yes i thought the replay was better than waiting for no answer.
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> But i hope cutting demos and the replay function will work in the future again
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> @heinrich5991 yes i thought the replay was better than waiting for no answer.
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deathman | Gotty> But i hope cutting demos and the replay function will work in the future again without problems
