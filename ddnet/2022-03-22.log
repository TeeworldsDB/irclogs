00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Yes, this only works if you have the new client and the server also uses the new code. With old servers you will still be hidden and displayed in the Spectators team.
00:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Is it correct that you can't use a ddnet client on a 0.7 vanilla server but a 0.7 client on a ddnet server?
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes

07:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> actually i think it will be great if we add a shortcut here to let player join tutorial server incase they want to join again / accidently skipped, or new player that didnt familiar with the server browser UI able to join it easily. either add a new button or replace this both i think is good to have

10:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <T tee> Tu proposes quoi?
10:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @T tee parlez english ici, ya uniquement dans #off-topic
10:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NRK> ok ok sorry
10:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NRK> come off topic
10:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <T tee> I'll be back in ~1h but ok
10:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NRK> okay
11:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Dragere> Yes, also when you first start without internet, it just skips the tutorial without an error message. This might be very confusing.
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ryozuki yo have you touched platform-dependent dependencies before?
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> I'm making twmap wasm-compatible rn, so I switched from `zlib-sys` to flate 2 with the zlib backend, and for wasm flate 2 with the rust-native backend
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> ^ this leads me to believe my dependencies should look smth like this:
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> [target.'cfg(target_family = "wasm")'.dependencies]
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> flate2 = { version = "1.0.17", features = ["rust_backend"] }
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> 
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> [target.'cfg(not(target_family = "wasm"))'.dependencies]
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> flate2 = { version = "1.0.17", features = ["zlib"] }
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> However, this apparently isn't it yet. However my observations while fiddling around a bit seem so damn contradictive that I wanted to see if you might have an idea:
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> with the configuration above, both the wasm and non-wasm build use the zlib backend
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> if I remove the first two lines, the wasm build fails due to flate2 being an undeclared crate or module and the non-wasm build succeeds
11:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> If I change the zlib to rust_backend in the bottom two lines both wasm and non-wasm builds use the rust_backend
11:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap/-/tree/wasm-dependency you can check out this branch
11:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1197#issuecomment-268203727
11:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe try this
11:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk
11:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not use rust_backend always
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> so that the native build produces the same map files as the client
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <T tee> @deen fixed version (don't take in account the previous version I sent)

11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <T tee> @NRK check it too, just to see if i didn't miss anything
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> that seems to be the features of the own crate, no?
12:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NRK> @T tee  `Show quads

12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NRK> je vien de look
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <T tee> It's a mapping thing
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NRK> il a pas été changer !!!
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <T tee> If you know a bit about mapping
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NRK> oups
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NRK> ho ok ok so quad we do nothing
12:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NRK> and look off topic
12:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NRK> we have 2 "plein ecran" (fullscreen) but idk what to put for the first one ?  cuz its look like fullscreen but with no res option . so im kinda lost for the translation ... @T tee

12:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <T tee> Ok i'll look into it this afternoon
12:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NRK> yep okay !
13:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @NRK if it helps
13:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> - It doesnt minimize
13:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> - it always uses the video mode(resolution, color depth etc.) from your current desktop setting
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Help devs. 
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Cmake is complaining about vulkan, what i'm missing?

13:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> git submodule update
13:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> Is there any real reason why teeworlds hsl color sliders values are max 255, 255, 255 instead of 360°, 100%, 100%
13:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> Wouldn't 360 instead of 255 provide a bigger color range rather than rounding it
13:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> if its even being rounded
14:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> `git submodule update` returns nothing.

14:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> can you look manually if
14:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ddnet-libs/vulkan/windows/lib64/glslangValidator.exe
14:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> exists?

14:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> inside the root ddnet dir
14:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> on going...
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> you can build without ddnet-libs, but then you need to install all dependencies manually, like vulkan sdk
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> especially on windows easier to use ddnet-libs
14:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> So I'm trying to setting up with ddnet-libs
14:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> now it's cloning
14:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> :wtf: windows cmd needs double enter to start command
14:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> i was staring at screen :monkalaugh:
14:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> That problem was solved, thank you.
14:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Still missing python, but I'm one step further
15:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <NRK> @T tee  for the first  "plein écran " just put " bureau plein écran " feel like its the best word we can use . spanish translation have this one too so yep prob the best translation . and then i think french translation is go to go !
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> has anyone noticed that maximum nameplate size is kinda ridiculous?

16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd it grows
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> you gotta think about the visually impaired people
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i dont think anyone uses that setup and if they do then they deserve to melt in acid
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> yeah, but I'm trying to figure out the maximum size to optimize the nameplate drawing a bit. also W is a lot wider
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/955851621861048320/unknown.png
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u'd need to look in the fonts what glyph is the widest
16:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> I tried that but most of other fonts are limited to 6 charecters
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> idk
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> btw i'd not change the nameplate text rendering
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> vanilla/fng ppl will hate u
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the ddrace stuff can be changed xd
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> I'm just making them not render offscreen, it's a big performance boost
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its not game relevant
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> oh ok
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> if you use /showall every nameplate renders
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they save how big they are
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> oh they do?
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the width, and the height can be added to, or use the font size
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> idk it's a lot simpler to just assume all the nameplates are massive, the difference in performance of checking the size based on the font will be nearly zero
17:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pog
17:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks more fps
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> who uses showall xD
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> everyone I know
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> you can see all the tees in your demos
17:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mhh
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> how did you come to this assumption?
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> there are pre calculated
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it will probably even outspeed your version
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> the only difference will be in the tees/nameplates which are very close to the edge of your screen which will probably never be more than a few
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> also 80-90% of the speed up came from not rendering the tees
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> random values are always bad
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> something will break
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> ok fair
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> idk if you think it can be better go ahead, I'm not sure what the best way to get a constant for the maximum size of a tee or nameplate is
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> best on this image i'd take the maximum of
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> name, clan, heart, ID, this weird health hud thing, hook strength quad, hook strength ID
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and the height should be knows
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and the height should be known
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> idk I guess
17:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> jup but its not default ... xD you probably would not use all the features at once
17:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> yeah, it's not any issue just funny
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> @Not Keks why does it break when you zoom in? for me it still works
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/955875291790733352/unknown.png
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> does it depend on screen resolution?
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> possible
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> my nameplates might have higher resolution
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and thus more outline
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and maybe freetype also renders the glyphs different
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i bet it evn breaks for you
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 400 sounds too less for the whole range on your image
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> idk I can't get it to break no matter what I do, but it could be increased I suppose. I'm not sure what the best solution is
18:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Paralix> is it possible to move the folder of teeworlds in %appdata% where u want to?
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> You can edit the storage.cfg and set a path instead of $USERDIR
18:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> What hack client shows health above tees?

18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> I think it's only supposed to render on your own tee but it's kinda buggy
18:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Wait is that actually a ddnet feature?! Lmao why

19:32 <+ChillerDragon> ye ye i did a yay ddnet-git again yesterday i was missing the new icons :)
19:32 <+ChillerDragon> but ddnet launches fine today
19:32 <+ChillerDragon> its my custom client trying to load my hentai images

19:32 <+ChillerDragon> malloc(): corrupted top size
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if you thing its one of your images, and not your code replace one image in ddnet and see if it crashes then
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> its the same image that worked yesterday
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> only chabnge i did since yesterday was another merge with ddnet
19:36 <+ChillerDragon> it indeed seems to be the image i reduced my images to 2 and it launched just fine. Maybe its some broken png or a bug in libpng
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> does not seem like its worth debugging that. Ill just ffmpeg the shit out of those images if i need em and remove my data folder for now
19:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just send the image
19:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'll debug it
19:42 <+ChillerDragon> eeeee
19:43 <+ChillerDragon> when i said hentai i was not really serious its something less sharable actually xd
19:43 <+ChillerDragon> if ur really motivated to debug and want to make sure ddnet never could potentially run into any image loading related crash bugs feel free to slide into my matrix or irc dms
19:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> idc about image, i just dont want stupid bugs xdd
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> come matrix dms
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Lol
19:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Not Keks How many open source games use vulkan btw? I found https://github.com/vinjn/awesome-vulkan#apps and the list is pretty small
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno, but emulators use it
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dolphin
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yuzu
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
20:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> is dota2 open source?
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> no, most of the links are not
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok i think vkquake2 also has raytracing
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Seems like the new ddnet client or new libpng or whoever is responsible stopped supporting png images without alpha layer
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> nvm scratch that theory
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it should be just converted not unsupported
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 4 byte alignment
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> adding a alpha channel in gimp and exporting seemed to have changed something else
20:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> sometimes gimp will export it as indexed png
20:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> which we don't support
20:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I think it can be explicitly changed in gimp
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> gimp export fixed the image tho
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> chillerdragon I guess #4756 is the change
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4756
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> sounds like
20:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nono its since vulkan renderer that images are generally converted
20:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> vulkan doesnt like RGB, bcs 3 bytes alignment is weird
20:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> but it accepts RGBA, not RGB
20:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but i doubt anyone ever used a RGB skin xD
20:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats just some blocks xD
20:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> ofc it's useless
20:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ```
20:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wget -O data/countryflags/AD.png https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1647976588.png
20:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ```
20:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> this boi is crashing
20:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> true
20:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> but tbh I also see no reason to not allow RGB if it's converted
20:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> its not a RGB issue
20:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i removed the alpha channel from an existing flag turned it back into RGB and it loaded fine
20:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> something else is off with this image
20:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> can I see the funky image? maybe it has some weird properties
20:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1647976588.png
20:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> 24 bit depth might be the issue
20:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mh yeah
20:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its bcs country flags have no name
20:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> is there some cli command that shows me how much depth an image has?
20:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> you can see it in gimp
20:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> soo much effort
20:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i give up xd
20:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i didnt rly find this xd
20:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> idc you need the likes and followers
20:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> can't argue with that
20:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> maybe its the ratio of the image?
20:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> nah doesnt make sense either
20:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> how do I use fix_style, I get
20:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> ``Found no clang-format 10``
20:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why is my profile pic on matrix so low quality xDD looks horrible
20:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> install clang-format 10
20:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Tater\: what distro are you on?
20:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think we use clang 11 already
20:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or 13? xd
20:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <JustArtur> i have a question abt the copyright of maps and if you can use them if certain factors are fulfilled
20:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> good for u
20:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> u should be more specific because it depends which maps youre talking about
20:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> my maps are strictly lgpl licensed
20:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <JustArtur> am i allowed to host a map that is redesigned, while the guy who redesigned it doesent want me to host the map even tho his credits are still on the map
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> clb?
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> well if the guy doesnt want you hosting, wouldnt it be unfair to them if you just did it?
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> \
21:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <JustArtur> i mean its not his map but he just redesigned it
22:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> emphasis on **doesn't want you to host the map**
22:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> also this is the channel for game development
22:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not like you care about the law. Just go for it
22:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nor will anyone be able to enforce it realistically. Who is wasting money to sue someone for hosting a tw map?
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> based learath :monkalaugh:
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> do you get masterserver ban if you violate copyright?
22:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you think Dune that doesn't care about a crime with actual jail time will care about copyright violations? 😄
22:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> whats up with dune btw
22:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why doesnt he react to it
22:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and unbanned vali
22:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> cant heinrich masterban
22:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> vacation
22:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> from what i can see it seems like all og teeworlds devs just dont care about the game
22:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> or at least dont care about the community
22:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ik
22:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> he can, but sooner or later he won't be able to if his decisions keep going against dunes as oy is more aligned with dune than heinrich
22:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> we should plan a coup
22:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> just need to get the http master server done then we can enforce whatever masterserver policy we want with our 2000 or so players on our client
22:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should ban from http master
22:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we got control over that
22:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> +1
22:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually now that I think about it that is viable
23:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> who controls the master server?
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> look https://status.tw
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> then you have ddnet having https masters
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> woah that's a fancy site
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> `file`
23:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> where is https master code located btw?
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> there i guess https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/src/mastersrv
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @Chairn this doesn't look like https masters
