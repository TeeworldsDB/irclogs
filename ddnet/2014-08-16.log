12:03 <@deen> laxa: oh?
12:04 <@deen> laxa: you're supposed to have a timeout, after 100 seconds you can come back and get your tee back automatically
12:11 < EastBite> "but don't worry we'll find a way to circumvent your fix, so your life won't get boring"
12:11 < EastBite> that guy

13:14 < EastBite> xd
13:14 < EastBite> well done
13:15 <@deen> the javascript backend is really buggy
13:15 <@deen> welcome evil_saeid 
13:15 < evil_saeid> hello
13:15 < evil_saeid> deen you here ?
13:15 <@deen> no, i'm just the welcome-bot
13:15 < evil_saeid> really ? :D
13:15 <@deen> of course not^^
13:15 < evil_saeid> LOL
13:15 < evil_saeid> deen there is problem in client !
13:16 <@deen> which version?
13:16 < GoJEGrEEN> server
13:16 < evil_saeid> i already set spoof for zero in cfg and restart them too
13:16 < evil_saeid> but sometime i can not enter server !
13:16 <@deen> evil_saeid: server version 4.7.5?
13:16 < evil_saeid> sometime people get timeout 
13:16 < evil_saeid> or sometime they are ghost :D
13:16 <@deen> evil_saeid: you still have 4.7.4 on your servers, it's buggy
13:16 < evil_saeid> GOJE 4.7.5 ?
13:17 <@deen> i see in server browser :P
13:17 < GoJEGrEEN> yes sometimes all of tee get timeout and disconnect from server but they are still in server as ghost :/ so after dc they cant rejoin to server
13:17 < evil_saeid> SPOOF SOLVED in 4.7.5 ?
13:17 <@deen> i don't know if spoof is solved
13:17 < evil_saeid> can you remove spoof ?
13:17 <@deen> but with spoof off i had no problems on official servers so far
13:17 <@deen> yes you can
13:17 <@deen> just write sv_spoof_protection 0 in yourconfig
13:17 < evil_saeid> plz remobe spoof one :D
13:18 <@deen> i made 0 default
13:18 < evil_saeid> I WRITE IT , BUT ALREADY GOT PROBLEM
13:18 < GoJEGrEEN> 4.7.5 yes
13:18 <@deen> Also, I think official ddnet server in iran would be cool
13:18 <@deen> GoJEGrEEN: no, 4.7.4
13:19 < evil_saeid> :D official ddnet server must be linux also be ddnet name on it 
13:19 < GoJEGrEEN> i get last version updats from github deen
13:19 <@deen> evil_saeid: yes!
13:19 <@deen> GoJEGrEEN: in serverbrowser it says 4.7.4
13:19 <@deen> GoJEGrEEN: you made /r for ddnet?
13:19 < GoJEGrEEN> deen sometimes consol spam kick invalid client id to kick
13:20 < GoJEGrEEN> deen yes
13:20 <@deen> GoJEGrEEN: you can send me the /r patch. I would add it
13:20 <@deen> on github
13:20 <@deen> maybe in iran we could host servers with /r and official ones without /r?
13:21 < Savander>  /r = rescue?
13:21 <@deen> yes
13:21 < Savander> ahm
13:21 <@deen> we will add it to server, but not use on official ones
13:21 < GoJEGrEEN> yes i can but you must patch rescue from xxlddrace i can give you my code about /r time
13:22 <@deen> GoJEGrEEN, evil_saeid now you restarted version 4.6.3 :P
13:22 < GoJEGrEEN> hmm
13:22 < GoJEGrEEN> why consol spam kick invalid ....
13:22 < evil_saeid> yes i remove them 
13:22 < evil_saeid> its buggy and i lost players :|
13:22 <@deen> you remove what?
13:23 < GoJEGrEEN> before spoof protection i had no problems with servers
13:23 < evil_saeid> new version one
13:23 < evil_saeid> before spoof version
13:24 < evil_saeid> now servers are in version before spoof release !
13:24 <@deen> yeah, i added spoof protection for you though^^
13:24 < evil_saeid> i know deen 
13:24 < evil_saeid> but it killed my servrs :D
13:24 < evil_saeid> plz remove spoof completly from version :P
13:24 <@deen> just set sv_spoof_protection 0
13:25 <@deen> then it's the same as removed
13:25 < GoJEGrEEN> deen see this topic https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11065
13:25 < evil_saeid> i set it deen in cfg too
13:25 < evil_saeid> but already servers got problem !

13:41 <@deen> 13:38 <@deen> evil_saeid: i just need rcon
13:42 < evil_saeid> i run servers with no spoof protection server ! old version , so there is no any problem right now ! so if you wanna look rcon , look it but there is no problem right now with this version ( old version )
13:42 < evil_saeid> come server 
13:42 < evil_saeid> persion block 
13:43 <@deen> i wanted to see the spam in console
13:43 < evil_saeid> many players pm me that can not enter server or they get timeout from server so i removed new version and paste old version
13:44 <@deen> haven't heard any such complaint from official servers
13:44 <@deen> so, what do i do on server now?
13:45 < evil_saeid> i need to run server again with new version so you can look it and see spams :D
13:46 < GoJEGrEEN> brb
13:46 <@deen> so that's a no?
13:46 < Savander> :3

13:47 < Savander> my ford radio*
13:47 <@deen> what's laq?
13:47 < evil_saeid> DEEN i say there is no problem now as i remove new version and run servers with verion before spoof protection 
13:47 < Savander> so stop spamming
13:47 < Savander> lol
13:47 < evil_saeid> but with new version with spoof protection in zero value in cfg , already get problem !
13:48 < Savander> if you have problem, i have really goood website. pastebin.com
13:48 < evil_saeid> :D
13:48 <@deen> evil_saeid: well, it's running like that on official servers without problems, so I'd like to know what's going wrong
13:49 < Savander> Upload logs to this website.
13:49 < Savander> and then send them here..
13:50 <@deen> ok, i also get the same problem, shit
13:50 <@deen> on one server
13:51 < EastBite> I'm trying to reproduce the bug on a local server
13:51 < EastBite> but doesn't seem that easy
13:51 <@deen> EastBite: thanks, yeah, i can't either
13:51 < evil_saeid> REALLY ?
13:51 < Savander> EastBite: 
13:51 < evil_saeid> YOU GOT THAT PROBLEM TOO ? :D
13:51 < Savander> i can help you
13:52 < Savander> i can make 20 clients in 1 minute for you 
13:52 < EastBite> ^ already have a full server
13:52 < Savander> but these bots will reconnecting 
13:52 < Savander> all the time, debug mode you know
13:52 < Savander> ;p
13:53 < evil_saeid> DEEN you got this problem in one your servers too ? or its another problem ?
13:53 <@deen> evil_saeid: problem that you can't connect
13:53 <@deen> connection screen just hangs
13:53 < evil_saeid> yes finally :D
13:54 < EastBite> also the log in f1 was strange
13:54 < evil_saeid> IF you can enter server , you will see spam in rcon :D
13:55 <@deen> maybe it's because of timeout protection
13:55 < Savander> deen: 
13:55 < Savander> want see something?
13:55 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/eyMbb3fp7752
13:55 < Savander> log
13:55 < Savander> yesterday, when i wanted to join persian block
13:56 < Savander> it was spam
13:56 < Savander> of same logs
13:56 <@deen> yes, i saw
13:56 <@deen> but we don't  have inactivity kick on official servers
13:56 <@deen> so i think it's more a consequence than the source of the problem
13:57 < EastBite> shit my bouncer cannot handle the mapchange from spoof protection
13:57 <@deen> EastBite: disable spoof protection
13:57 < EastBite> but I want to test it
13:57 <@deen> EastBite: it's not the (only) source of the problem anyway
13:57 < EastBite> hm okay
13:57 <@deen> you can test it too^^
13:57 < EastBite> later^^
13:57 <@deen> but this right now happens  even without spoof protection
13:58 < evil_saeid> i say you that , i set cfg for 0 and restarted it and already got problem
13:58 < evil_saeid> PEOPLE SAY , CAN NOT ENTER server or they get timeout suddenly
13:58 < evil_saeid> or rcon get spam 
13:58 < EastBite> the timeout protection is also much more responsible for such a problem
14:00 < EastBite> deen: I'll add a random /timeout to my dummies
14:01 <@deen> on ddnet.tw:8331 only player with id 11 is buggy now
14:01 <@deen> when you connect with id 11 you can't join, otherwise it's fine
14:04 <@deen> my guess right now is that the network connection isn't properly closed after a timeout protection expired
14:05 <@deen> evil_saeid: after you restart do they have these problems immediately?
14:05 < evil_saeid> restart server with new version ?
14:06 < evil_saeid> spoof one sure ?
14:06 <@deen> evil_saeid: no
14:06 <@deen> evil_saeid: i'm just asking how it was last time
14:06 <@deen> evil_saeid: does it take 10 minutes until problems appear or immediately?
14:06 < evil_saeid> i run server , dont know when i get problems !
14:07 < evil_saeid> 5-6 hour ago i run server again and go out of home 
14:07 < evil_saeid> and got billion masage from players that can not enter server
14:07 < evil_saeid> or they get timeout
14:07 <@deen> ok
14:08 < evil_saeid> goje pm me that rcon got spam masage again and asked me i set spoof protection for zero in cfg or not 
14:08 < evil_saeid> and i say him that i set it then go out of home
14:12 <@deen> I hate fixing bugs that i can't reproduce
14:12 < EastBite> <3
14:12 <@deen> reading through all changes since 4.6.3 now
14:26 <@deen> Well, even better, that buggy server just crashed
14:29 < evil_saeid> :D
14:30 <@deen> ok, i think i know why this happens
14:30 <@deen> I have two ways of timeout protection
14:30 <@deen> i think one of them, the one not requiring a timeout code, is too buggy
14:30 <@deen> i should remove it
14:32 < EastBite> using the timeout protection the dummies don't even get kicked after conn_timeout_protection
14:32 < EastBite> something wrong?
14:32 <@deen> really?
14:32 <@deen> for me they do
14:32 < EastBite> it's set to 30
14:32 < EastBite> and they timed out minutes before
14:33 <@deen> for me the dummies get kicked
14:33 <@deen> try to set the normal timeout lower
14:33 < EastBite> did they use /timeout ?
14:33 <@deen> no
14:33 <@deen> did yours?
14:33 < EastBite> yes
14:33 < EastBite> I'm testing that
14:34 < EastBite> or is conn_timeout_protection initialized once per start?
14:34 <@deen> i don't know
14:34 < EastBite> meh
14:34 <@deen> but for me it works, even if dummies have a timeout code
14:35 <@deen> no, conn_timeout_protection should work, even if you set it later
14:35 < EastBite> that's strange
14:35 <@deen> and for it works with ddnet dummies
14:35 <@deen> do you have client 4.7.6?
14:36 <@deen> because the old client kept the dummy connection to old servers alive^^
14:36 < EastBite> my bouncer is adding the dummies
14:36 <@deen> ah, ok
14:36 <@deen> so why don't they get kicked? =/
14:36 < EastBite> do you have some testing server running?
14:36 <@deen> r0q.no-ip.org:8902
14:36 <@deen> pw is testtest
14:37 <@deen> or without pw?
14:42 < EastBite> deen: are you working with coredumps of your servers?
14:42 < EastBite> would be a great benefit
14:42 <@deen> unfortunately not
14:42 < EastBite> :/
14:43 <@deen> evil_saeid: still there?
14:43 <@deen> evil_saeid: can goje rebuild server from github and restart?
14:43 < evil_saeid> wait i say he come here
14:44 < EastBite> https://eastbit.net/priv/16_Aug-14-14_42.png
14:44 <@deen> ^^
14:44 < EastBite> maybe they get kicked at 1000 seconds
14:44 <@deen> nice army
14:44 < EastBite> <3
14:44 <@deen> you need 64 of them
14:44 <@deen> and they have to do what you do, but delayed
14:44 <@deen> so they run after you like ducks
14:45 < EastBite> whatever...
14:45 <@deen> GoJEGrEEN: hi, can you rebuild from github?
14:45 < GoJEGrEEN> hi
14:45 < evil_saeid> i had 63 of them in my server :|
14:45 <@deen> GoJEGrEEN: i changed something and i hope it works now
14:45 < GoJEGrEEN> yes
14:45 < GoJEGrEEN> i can
14:45 < evil_saeid> 1 me and 63 of them :D

15:05 < GoJEGrEEN_> deen: brb until evil saeed come back :/
15:05 <@deen> well, he said he will be gone for 2 hours^^
15:05 <@deen> and i will be gone rest of the day until tomorrow
15:07 < GoJEGrEEN_> :D
15:07 < laxa> deen: humpalumpa hasn't been fixed yet ?
15:07 <@deen> laxa: fixed how?
15:07 < laxa> lots of problems on the map
15:08 <@deen> didn't hear
15:08 <@deen> but there's a new version on testserver
15:08 <@deen> I'll just release that^^
15:09 < laxa> That should be good.
15:09 < laxa> Tell me when you release.
15:09 <@deen> i did
15:09 <@deen> but didn't reload the map
15:09 <@deen> which is already runnign
15:13 <@deen> well, i restarted server on ddnet servers instead
15:13 < laxa> What ?
15:13 <@deen> laxa: not talking to you
15:13 <@deen> about the timeout protection bugs
15:13 < laxa> ok :p
15:13 < laxa> So, tell me exactly how the timeout is suppose to work.
15:14 < laxa> Do I have to reconnect after the timeout or before the tee is being timeouted.
15:14 <@deen> normal timeout is 100 seconds
15:14 <@deen> protected timeout is 1000 seconds
15:14 <@deen> after you had a timeout
15:14 <@deen> you have to reconnect AFTER the 100 seconds
15:14 <@deen> then you get your tee back
15:14 < laxa> Hum ok
15:15 < laxa> using /timeout with ddnet client is useless or usefull ?
15:15 <@deen> useless, it happens automatically
15:15 <@deen> (but not for your dummy, has to be done by hand right now)
15:16 < EastBite> deen: http://eastbit.net/priv/16_Aug-14-15_14.png
15:16 <@deen> EastBite: looks good
15:16 <@deen> right?
15:16 < EastBite> I think so
15:17 <@deen> too bad i had to remove this feature
15:17 <@deen> it was pretty cool
15:17 < EastBite> what was it for again?
15:17 <@deen> when you had a timeout, but kept your ip and port, you could just go back on the server, without a code or anything
15:17 <@deen> and immediately keep playing
15:17 < EastBite> ah
15:17 <@deen> i made that before the real /timeout thing
15:17 <@deen> and thought it wouldn't hurt to keep it in
15:17 < EastBite> okay better keep such a thing away xd
15:23 < Savander> VIm is awesome
15:23 < Savander> lol
15:24 < EastBite> we all know that right?
15:24 < Savander> but first time
15:24 < Savander> i use it
15:24 < Savander> and it's awesome xD
15:27 < EastBite> deen: I'm really dumb
15:27 <@deen> EastBite: why?
15:28 < EastBite> the timeout tokens of my bouncer weren't actually randomly
15:28 < EastBite> that's the reason, why the protection got over when a new dummy joined send used /timeout
15:28 < EastBite> because I restartet the bouncer
15:28 <@deen> ^^
15:28 < EastBite> well now I'm clear in my head :3
15:36 < savi> :]
15:37 < laxa> deen: ddos ?
15:37 <@deen> laxa: no
15:37 < laxa> suddenly my ping went to 100+ for 30 seconds.
15:37 < laxa> and I wasn't alone
15:45 < EastBite> deen: I think I found something
15:46 <@deen> EastBite: what?
15:47 < EastBite> in ./src/engine/shared/network_conn.cpp ::Update()
15:47 < EastBite> if a timeout happens:
15:47 < EastBite>  m_State = NET_CONNSTATE_ERROR;
15:47 < EastBite>  SetError("Timeout");
15:47 < EastBite>  m_TimeoutSituation = true;
15:47 < EastBite> TimeoutSituation is being enabled
15:47 <@deen> yes
15:47 < EastBite> if(m_Buffer.First())
15:47 < EastBite> and this condition can still be true
15:48 < EastBite> where m_TimeoutSituation = false; can happen again
15:48 <@deen> oh
15:48 <@deen> ooooh
15:48 < EastBite> :)
15:48 <@deen> thanks!
15:48 < EastBite> np
15:50 <@deen> i actually just encountered this bug while testing
