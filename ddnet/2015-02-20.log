12:12 < N666> deen: Hi
12:13 < N666> deen: I have an idea for ddnet skin database.
12:16 <@heinrich5991> N666: moderated?
12:22 < N666> I don't know what is "moderated" 
12:23 < N666> I have written a userScript file, https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+userscript
12:23 <@heinrich5991> I mean, will only verified skins get in, or will everyone be able to put their skins in without control
12:23 <@heinrich5991> (the latter is probably problematic)
12:23 < N666> and I have made a video https://mega.co.nz/#!4tYShD4b!SB6i80gXPlljxA3B4Uo-j8A00lBCLBvRwmkpZphSXMI
12:27 < N666> heinrich5991: I'm don't want put or upload skin file , this is about rendering tee(s) in browser with feets and eyes
12:27 <@heinrich5991> oh :)
12:27 <@heinrich5991> nice idea
12:27 < N666> sorrry for bad english :)
12:28 <@heinrich5991> no, it was my fault, I thought ddnet didn't have a skin DB already
12:30 < N666> http://ddnet.tw/skins/ 
12:30 < N666> heinrich5991: do you watched that video ?
12:30 <@deen> N666: Hi! that's cool. wouldn't it be even more useful to add these rendered skin into the table or is that too expensive?
12:31 <@deen> afk
12:31 < N666> deen: I don't test it for all images , maybe some performance issues at low-power computer!
12:42 < N666> expensive ? if you mean money ? never, it's totally free 
12:46 <@heinrich5991> N666: yea, I had watched that video
12:46 <@heinrich5991> N666: by expensive he means that it costs too much performance
12:46 <@heinrich5991> deen: can't you just prerender the tee server-side? that way you don't need to care about perf at all
12:47 <@heinrich5991> "just"
12:48 < N666> I am testing for all images , and measuring memory use ... , I will tell you results 
12:50 <@heinrich5991> N666: can you show me your userscript?
12:51 < N666> is it okay paste it here ?
12:52 < N666> with I'm uploadin :)
12:53 < N666> https://mega.co.nz/#!dpoEFb4I!P2EvYeNYHGaxOOumgpiQo4eaNIpmPuwXqO_--Uy1iUs
12:53 <@heinrich5991> meh
12:54 <@heinrich5991> could you put it in http://pastie.org/
12:54 <@heinrich5991> ?
12:54 <@heinrich5991> (when you upload a video, it'd be best to put it on youtube or similar, so you can instantly watch it, for code snippets it's best to put them on a paste site like pastie.org
12:54 <@heinrich5991> )
12:55 < N666> okay wait a moment
12:57 < N666> http://pastie.org/private/j7ahhauxyxfqgdmf4jxa
12:57 <@heinrich5991> N666: that's all? pretty nifty :)
12:57 < N666> :D
13:27 < N666> fixed , tested , no problem , same resource usage :|  :-? 
13:27 < N666> http://pastie.org/private/2za6vdrgorstxxzgniefgg
14:28 <@deen> that's cool
14:29 <@deen> so, how would I go about adding this to the page by default?
14:29 <@deen> (I'm a JS noob)
15:03 < N666> (reduced canvas height to fit better) https://vimeo.com/120151234
15:09 <@deen> cool
15:20 < Learath2> deen skins arent going to change we should just prerender the skins and display them
15:23 <@deen> Learath2: maybe, but i didn't write the skin database and don't want to edit it. also, it may be nice to see the full PNG too?
15:23 < o_be_one> hi
15:23 <@deen> hi
15:24 < o_be_one> how are you ?
15:24 <@deen> fine, busy with the gsoc application
15:25 <@deen> (not for ddnet obviously)
15:27 < DoNe> hi
15:27 <@deen> hi DoNe
15:27 <@deen> N666 did the tee viewer
15:27 < DoNe> N666: you used javascript right?
15:27 <@deen> http://pastie.org/private/j7ahhauxyxfqgdmf4jxa
15:27 <@deen> http://pastie.org/private/2za6vdrgorstxxzgniefgg
15:30 < DoNe> N666: ?
15:34 < N666> DoNe: yes , I think this is javaScript :-?
15:35 < DoNe> N666: the easiest would be if you could make a programm that takes a pathof a picture and a path to a folder to place the skin image
15:36 < DoNe> N666: or we could implement it as you have it, that the client calculates the skin
15:36 < DoNe> but i dont know how to do it
15:37 < N666> DoNe: this is last version , http://paste.ubuntu.com/10325217/
15:38 < DoNe> how to implement it to the website?
15:38 < DoNe> deen: do you think its okay if the calculation is done clientside?
15:39 < DoNe> N666: do you scale the feed down? i think they are too big
15:39 < N666> this is user.js , if you want put it to site template , you must modifi it a little :)
15:40 < N666> DoNe: feed ?
15:40 < DoNe> feet*
15:40 < DoNe> could you modificate it?
15:40 < DoNe> i have just a little knowledge of js
15:41 < N666> ok , I will
15:41 < DoNe> do you scale something?
15:42 < N666> about feet , I made the sizes from tee worlds screenshots
15:42 < DoNe> okay
15:43 < N666> I reduced size of eyes and body , the sizes are 99% like original teeworld :D
15:44 < DoNe> nice work
15:45 < DoNe> did you use the default eyes?
15:45 < N666> yes
15:46 <@deen> Welcome, Anne__ 
15:54 < DoNe> bye
16:28 < Anne__> ty
16:28 < Anne__> xD
16:50 < N666> deen: do you know html ? 
17:03 <@deen> N666: i've heard of it before
17:08 < N666> I have made a .js file (not .user.js) , so you can use it just by importing it to site
17:08 < N666> something like : <script src="teeskin.js"></script>
17:11 <@deen> nice
17:11 < N666> if you don't know where paste it or .... , give it a expert ! , (the guy who built the site)
17:11 <@deen> (i built the website)
17:12 < N666> :O :D
17:12 < N666> nice
17:17 < N666> http://pastie.org/private/jcaekqwphj6qzxm7wkofw
17:19 < N666> here it is! , if you have any question about how its work or why its work , ask me , I'll answer gladly
17:27 < N666> after saving the file rename it to an easy name eg. "tee.js" copy it to site , then put <script src="tee.js"></script> under <body> element (like your map viewer), i'm sure you are pro. but. please get a backup of your files :)
17:39 < N666> btw my inGame nick is "Prime" , if needed ...
17:39 < N666> bye
19:41 <@deen> Wooohoo, it works
19:41 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/skins/
20:12 < eeeee> pretty cool, looks a bid edgy though (because it's scaled to 2/3)
20:14 < eeeee> also some skins just look awful but i guess that's not tee.js fault :)
20:14 <@deen> looks perfect for me in firefox
20:15 <@deen> except for 1 skin, 00Follec
20:15 <@deen> ah, that's too big
20:15 <@deen> 839x419 pixels
20:17 < eeeee> well not everyone is blessed with a good canvas context scaler
20:19 <@EastByte> looks like the rpi2 handles the teerenderer without problems
20:20 <@EastByte> well, rather fast
20:20 < eeeee> prolly even rpi1, since they actually have gfx acceleration
20:20 <@EastByte> doesn't work with X afaik
20:21 <@EastByte> so it's all software rendering right now
20:21 < eeeee> lol, srsly?
20:21 < eeeee> whats the point then :D
20:21 < eeeee> no that cannot be right
20:21 <@EastByte> well, sdl+opengl es works, using a workaround
20:23 <@EastByte> creating an empty window and using opengl es to render directly to the window position on screen
20:24 < eeeee> sounds like something a browser could do
20:25 <@EastByte> yep, iirc people wanted to work on a chromium modification to support webgl and stuff
20:26 <@EastByte> I have no idea what's the current state
20:26 <@EastByte> but xorg seem to suck
20:27 < eeeee> what about wayland?
20:28 <@EastByte> ^ reading about it right now
20:35 <@deen> 2 long weeks to wait until i know whether we made it as a gsoc mentoring organization
20:35 <@EastByte> good luck
20:36 < eeeee> yay ddnet in gsoc!
20:36 < eeeee> (j/k)
20:36 <@EastByte> :D
20:37 <@deen> haha
20:39 <@deen> eeeee: your js client would've been the perfect gsoc project :P
20:42 < eeeee> yeah there's so much stuff to be done before it's perfect and i just have no time
20:42 <@deen> and GER is down, huge ddos
20:42 < eeeee> :'(
20:43 <@deen> I'm expecting the tournament to fail
20:46 < eeeee> we can try hosting the tournaments on a separate ec2 instance with 10 gbit uplink. not sure if that would help much though.
20:57 <@deen> and chile down

21:56 <@deen> If anyone wants to see something special, the newly released "Justice 2" map has some of the best graphics, sounds, a working analog clock showing the server time, and 2 of the mappers are playing it right now
22:00 <@EastByte> wow, dat clock
22:04 <@deen> and really crazy parts
22:04 <@deen> stuff that no one mapped before
22:05 <@EastByte> nice to see such creativity
22:05 <@EastByte> too busy right now to play, though
22:05 <@deen> the map is impossible to play for anyone except the mappers^^
22:05 <@EastByte> haha
22:06 <@deen> it's more like brutal 6 stars and over-complicated
22:06 <@EastByte> or simply a map for "heroes"
22:07 <@deen> it's what happens when you have 3 creative mappers and they put all their ideas for 1.5 years into a single map
22:07 < Nimda> Justice 2 by 645654 & Pipou & Phacrum just released on Brutal at 2015-02-20 14:33
22:25 < Edible> i hope someone is recording this
22:26 <@deen> sure, we'll turn it into a video, like Justice 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XEdT2Tftug
22:26 < Nimda> [YouTube] Title: Teeworlds DDRace: DDraceNetwork - Justice | Rating: 4.75/5.00 | Views: 2,360
22:33 < Edible> I'm screaming like if this was a sports game
22:55 < Edible> did they cheat on that last part?
22:56 <@deen> dunno
22:56 < Edible> could it activate when you use the ! smilie?
22:57 < Edible> mmm not really
