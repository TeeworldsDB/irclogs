10:16 < Learath2> Text on buttons is somehow off centered especially obv in small buttons and one side of the button looks more rounded somehow
10:17 <@deen> huh
10:17 <@deen> there is no button to disable autoupdate anymore
10:17 < Learath2> not apparent for you ?
10:18 < Learath2> like a checkbox ?
10:18 <@deen> ah, because it just checks and doesn't do it
10:18 <@deen> i think it's fine
10:20 < Learath2> Everything looks fine 
10:20 < Learath2> no indication of progress if you start an update in settings tho 
10:21 <@deen> there is no way to check for updates now?
10:22 < Learath2> well if there is a way to update m
10:22 < Learath2> and starting an update in settings then switching to serverbrowser seems buggy letme fix that aswell
10:24 < Learath2> oh its not buggy deen the version on the server is just older and i was using the updated one :D
10:24 <@deen> ^^
10:32 <@deen> how could we best have a way to manually check for updates?
10:42 <@deen> i think i kno how
10:44 < Learath2> i tried smth but it didnt work
10:45 <@deen> done already
10:45 <@deen> releasable?

10:45 < Learath2> depends on how you did it :D
10:46 < Learath2> i tried the same thing but it didnt work for me :/ 
10:46 <@deen> Works fine for me
10:46 < Learath2> oh i uses STATE_INIT
10:46 < Learath2> i used *
10:46 <@deen> that does an additional DNS lookup
10:47 < Learath2> let me make sure it works
10:47 <@deen> ok
10:49 < Learath2> yep works 
10:49 < Learath2> looks releasable to me 
10:49 <@deen> great, releasing
10:53 < Learath2> btw what was all the whitespace problems with my commits deen ?
10:53 < Learath2> just so i can fix it :P
10:53 <@deen> Learath2: position of { and tabs instead of spaces
10:55 <@deen> ah shit
10:55 <@deen> forgot something
10:55 <@deen> not with autoupdater though

12:57 < Learath2> deen: whats wrong with the tester system 
12:57 < Learath2> everyone seems to be complaining about it
13:06 <@deen> tester system?
13:06 <@deen> ah, you mean map testing?
13:06 < Learath2> like the map testing stuff
13:06 <@deen> Ehm, we don't have many testers
13:06 <@deen> and the testers we have, they don't want to test, because people always complain anyway
13:07 < Learath2> what do people complain about ?
13:07 <@deen> Releasing the wrong maps
13:07 <@deen> not releasing the wrong maps
13:07 <@deen> fixing bugs
13:07 <@deen> not fixing bugs
13:07 <@deen> changing stuff
13:07 <@deen> not changing stuff
13:07 <@deen> no matter what you do, some people always come and complain
13:07 < Learath2> and by people you mean mappers ?
13:07 <@deen> and players and other testers
13:08 < Learath2> eeh sounds like quite an unhappy circle 
13:10 < Learath2> how qualified does some one have to be to become a tester ?
13:10 <@deen> there are trial testers
13:10 <@deen> you can just talk to some testers and become a trial tester
13:10 <@deen> if that works well, you become a proper tester
13:10 <@deen> but no one wants to do the work of testing
13:11 < Learath2> not enough volunteers want to test i guess :/
13:19 < saman> hi
13:20  * saman slaps laxa around a bit with a large fishbot
13:20 < laxa> hi
13:20 < saman> can u help me in editing mod?
13:20 < laxa> No sorry
13:20 < laxa> my life as a gamer is finished atm, I have no time, and I am not interested in teeworlds anymore
13:21 < saman> i know but it is just editing c++ codes
13:22 < laxa> I don't know c++ actually, maybe I could do it, but as I said, I have no time
13:22 < saman> ok my bro
13:42 <@deen> Hm, problems with libssl missing
13:42 <@deen> how would I solve this best?
13:42 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1200&p=11815#p11815
13:44 < laxa> why ddnet needs ssl ?!
13:46 <@deen> for https updates
13:46 <@deen> i assumed everyone has openssl on linux, but i guess i'm wrong
13:46 < laxa> is there any sensible information ?
13:47 < laxa> Well, to update a game, I don't see the need for a secure connection
13:47 <@deen> the executables themselves should not be compromised
13:50 < laxa> even with ssl, if the player has a compromised computer, he'll be fucked
13:50 < laxa> I am not sure adding ssl is that important
13:51 < laxa> it's only my personal opinion ^^
13:53 <@deen> Yeah, but if there is a mitm attack or someone gets the ddnet.tw hostname
13:54 < laxa> well
13:54 < laxa> I have an idea
13:54 < laxa> maybe you could put the checksum on some place on the internet
13:55 < laxa> and update it on every version
13:55 < laxa> and client checks all of them, maybe this is a good solution ?
13:55 <@deen> ...
13:55 < laxa> :D
13:55 <@deen> client checks the checksums through http? that's 0 additional security
13:55 < laxa> hum
13:56 <@deen> i should just figure out which ssl lib to statically link against
13:56 <@deen> and problem solved
13:56 < laxa> well, needing ssl should not be a problem anyway
14:07 <@deen> any thought on just statically linking openssl in? =/
14:17 < laxa> my server went down
14:17 < laxa> no idea why yet
14:17 < laxa> it's not ddos

14:24 <@deen> this is bad, libssl and libcrypto are huge
14:40 < WolfAlex> deen: on archlinux with openssl 1.0.2-1 installed -> also the openssl error
14:41 <@deen> WolfAlex: i know, i'm trying something
14:41 <@deen> does any distribution still use openssl 0.9 exclusively?
14:42 < WolfAlex> maybe debian old stable? 
14:42 <@deen> =/
14:43 <@deen> yeah, that's what I'm on on my building machine
14:43 <@deen> but i don't want to statically link openssl either
14:43 <@deen> or maybe i should
14:45 < WolfAlex> you could supply it with the binary (the .so)
14:45 < laxa> deen: my syslog is empty between 14:11 and 14:18, what could it be ?
14:45 < WolfAlex> and start with ld_preload?
14:45 <@deen> WolfAlex: that's bad on linux because current dir is not in LD_LIBRARY_PATH
14:46 <@deen> laxa: no idea
15:05 <@deen> Learath2: people say the update isn't working on windows
15:23 < Learath2> deen: works for me :/
15:23 < Learath2> what exactly isnt working with it ?
15:23 <@deen> they say after updating to 7.3.1 it still says "7.3.1 is available"
15:24 < Learath2> well that isnt checked by anything i added new 
15:24 <@deen> it could indicate that the update didn'T succeed
15:24 <@deen> and they're still on 7.3
15:26 < Learath2> deen: will test again 
15:26 <@deen> maybe it's a permission problem or becuase they use a desktop link?
15:29 < Learath2> does work fine when launched from the executable will try with a shortcut
15:31 < Learath2> also works with a shortcut deen
15:31 <@deen> weird
15:31 < Learath2> does this apply to everyone ? 
15:31 < Learath2> the problem i mean

15:37 < Mahdi> Hello
15:37 <@deen> hi
15:37 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/pNZw
15:37 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 b4336e4 def: Version 7.3.2
15:37 < Mahdi> I tried to run ddnet 7.3 on debian jessie
15:37 < Mahdi> but I get this " /home/mahdi/Games/Tee-mod/DDNet/DDNet-7.3-linux_x86_64/DDNet: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.0.9.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
15:37 < Mahdi> "
15:37 <@deen> I know, it doesn't work because of missing openssl 0.9.8
15:38 <@deen> give me 5 min and i give you a binary to try again
15:39 < Learath2> deen: wasnt ssl included like a major ago how did we not notice that :P
15:39 <@deen> Learath2: i built the linux libcurl without ssl because we decided to use http for map download
15:39 < Mahdi> I have libssl1.0.0 installed
15:41 <@deen> Mahdi: yeah, that's the problem 0.9 and 1.0 are not compatibly
15:41 <@deen> compatible*
15:42 < Mahdi> deen, I see...
15:42 <@deen> Mahdi: http://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-7.3.2-linux_x86_64.tar.gz
15:43 <@deen> does it start now?
15:43 <@deen> WolfAlex: can you test too?
15:44 < WolfAlex> sure
15:44 < Mahdi> I hope I don't have fps problems in this one
15:44 < Mahdi> downloading...
15:44 <@deen> Mahdi: fps problems?
15:46 <@deen> Learath2: there she is
15:46 < Mahdi> deen,  in the latest versions, after playing for a while my fps became low
15:46 <@deen> Mahdi: that's really weird.
15:47 <@deen> Learath2: from what I understand it just stays at 7.3 even after the update runs through successfully
15:47 < WolfAlex> deen: works
15:47 < Mahdi> deen,  not sure if it's because of my old hardware or something else but it doesn't happen in the default teeworlds client and didn't in the older versions
15:47 <@deen> WolfAlex: great, thanks
15:47 <@deen> Mahdi: hm, i don't know what could cause this
15:47 <@deen> Mahdi: are you playing on a laptop?
15:47 < Mahdi> deen,  it's working :-) thanks
15:47 < Mahdi> deen,  yes
15:47 <@deen> great
15:47 <@deen> then maybe your laptop overheats
15:48 <@deen> you can try enabling vsync, cl_cpu_throttle 1 (or 2)
15:48 <@deen> and for old hardware sometimes gfx_threaded_old 0 and gfx_asyncrender_old 0 also help
15:48 < Mahdi> deen,  Can I know what they actually do?
15:48 <@deen> vsync is vsync of your screen
15:49 <@deen> cl_cpu_throttle makes the cpu sleep for 1 ms after each frame
15:49 < Learath2> deen: well i can not possibly speculate whats causing a problem that i can not reproduce nor observe
15:49 <@deen> gfx_threaded_old 0 uses only 1 thread for everything in teeworlds, which causes delays
15:49 <@deen> Learath2: then ask Lady
15:50 <@deen> gfx_asyncrender_old 0 was something related to gfx_threaded 0^^
15:51 < Learath2> Lady: can you check the console while the update is happening and confirm that it says [fetcher] Task Done DDNet.tmp 
15:52 < Lady> ye
15:52 < Mahdi> thanks :-) 
15:53 < Learath2> which version of windows are you on ?
15:54 < Lady> what so you mean
15:55 < Learath2> Windows 7/Windows Vista/Windows XP/Windows 8/Windows 8.1
15:55 < Lady> xp
15:58 < Learath2> hmm let me get a windows xp machine to try as if the task is done it means the rename file is failing somehow
15:58 < Lady> I have to go soon
15:59 < Learath2> one last thing then are you using a shortcut ?
16:00 < Lady> what?
16:02 < Lady> bye...
16:02 < Learath2> swell that went nicely
16:03 < Learath2> mental note  trying to reproduce is more productive then trying to ask
16:07 < Learath2> while im installing winxp do you have any other idea as to what might be happening deen ?
16:07 <@deen> hmm
16:08 <@deen> maybe there was a reason the old autoupdater used a batch file to replace the executable?

16:11 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 8ae27f8 def: Improve autoupdater a bit...
16:11 <@deen> or the permissions are just missing
16:11 <@deen> to move the file
16:13 < Learath2> testing on a couple more windows 7 machines and a win xp 
16:13 <@deen> i didn't know anyone is still using winxp
16:13 <@deen> ^^
16:16 < Learath2> yeah didnt expect that one
16:19 <@deen> the linux binary is pretty big now
16:19 <@deen> from 1.8 MB to 3.0
16:19 <@deen> =/
16:19 <@deen> didn't see a better solution quickly
16:19 <@deen> don't want to depend on openssl 0.9 or 1.0
16:19 <@deen> on mac at least i know we have 0.9
16:20 <@deen> so it works fine
16:21 < Learath2> the binary is getting bigger and bigger :/
16:21 <@deen> indeed
16:22 <@deen> i think that's it though
16:22 <@deen> can't imagine anything else we'll need in the binary
16:22 < Learath2> could use a lighter ssl library as libcurl can use others too
16:23 <@deen> http://curl.haxx.se/docs/ssl-compared.html
16:23 <@deen> which is good?
16:23 < Learath2> tbh i have no idea which one does what and if it will even work 
16:24 < Learath2> was just a proposition :D
16:24 <@deen> strike trhough all the gpl ones immediately, can't statically link against them
16:24 <@deen> yeah, i know^^
16:24 <@deen> i was thinking about it too
16:24 <@deen> but my final result was that 1 MB more is better than even more problems by using some weird unsupported ssl library
16:24 < Learath2> maybe could statically link a lighter openssl
16:25 <@deen> oh right
16:25 <@deen> i looked into this but didn't understand their config script
16:25 <@deen> let's make it work first, smaller later :P
16:25 <@deen> could also make libcurl smaller
16:26 < Learath2> tested on 3 more win7 computers all seem to update just fine with and without shortcut
16:26 <@deen> it has support for so many protocols in
16:26 < Learath2> testing a win 8 and installing winxp now
16:26 <@deen> Learath2: if you make the directory admin-only, do you get Lady's error?
16:27 < Learath2> not sure how i'd do that on windows never touched directory permissions on windows
16:27 <@deen> right click and do something
16:27 <@deen> ^^
16:27 < Learath2> well if she somehow unzipped it to that location she prolly has the right to rename files
16:28 < Learath2> i really smell some winxp weirdness here
16:38 <@deen> released 7.3.2
16:39 < Learath2> deen: check for update works :D

17:24 <@deen> good/bad
17:24 < Learath2> will see if i can do anything

17:54 <@deen> hehe
17:54 <@deen> yeah
17:54 < Learath2> or close the client and manually rename ddnet.tmp to ddnet.exe

18:00 <@deen> i know the problem of moving the mouse in TW when in a VM
18:00 <@deen> it's terrible
18:16 < Learath2> heinrich5991: why didnt you use cryptgenrandom from winapi for the token stuff ?
18:18 < Mahdi> Why does it download files to my home directory when I update from the client?
18:19 < Learath2> deen: well linux thats your department :P
18:21 < Learath2> Mahdi: does the update succeed ?
18:21 < Mahdi> Learath2,  the last time I tried to update it just closed the client... Never seen a dialog like "successfully done"
18:23 < Mahdi> Learath2,  but in the past, it updated it successfully and I found the downloaded files in my home directory 
18:24 < Learath2> and are you on the latest version now or does it still ask you to update ?
18:25 < Mahdi> Learath2,  I downloaded 7.2 and haven't updated yet
18:25 < Mahdi> Learath2,  let me try and I'll let you know what happens
18:26 < Mahdi> 7.3.2 *
18:26 < Learath2> you might want to delete the files in your home dir
18:27 < Mahdi> "failed to download a file, close the client to retry"
18:27 < Mahdi> I like the new update system, the previous one was really a pain in the neck
18:28 < Mahdi> failed again: "failed to download a file, restart client to retry"
18:29 < Mahdi> it didn't even take a second, it just failed
18:30 < Learath2> can you check the console and check for lines that start with [fetcher]
18:30 < Learath2> lets see why it fails
18:31 < Mahdi> so I should run it in terminal...
18:31 < Learath2> oh doesnt launch a terminal with it on linux ? :D
18:33 < Mahdi> didn't set to do so :D
18:33 < Mahdi> anyway
18:33 < Mahdi> it updated successfully
18:33 < Mahdi> interesting 
18:33 < Learath2> huh were you launching from a desktop shortcut maybe ?
18:34 < Learath2> Mahdi: ^^
18:34 < Mahdi> :)
18:34 < Mahdi> does it differ?
18:34 < Learath2> doesnt on windows but as i dont have linux never actually checked if it makes a differance there
18:34 < Mahdi> well I created a launcher
18:35 < Mahdi> and told it to run the command I just ran on terminal to open the file
18:35 < Mahdi> must not differ
18:36 < Learath2> not sure how that would affect the arg0 and the currentdir perception of tw
18:37 < Mahdi> it downloaded the files in ddnet folder
18:37 < Mahdi> nice!
18:37 < Learath2> Mahdi: while launching the client tells you what it thinks the current dir is in the terminal 
18:37 < Learath2> can you check if its different somehow when you launch from the launcher
18:38 < Mahdi> sooo... I should run the launcher and..?
18:38 < Mahdi> check what exactly?
18:38 < Learath2> could change the line in your launcher to end with &> "ddnet.log"
18:39 < Mahdi> ok
18:39 < Mahdi> I'm adding &> "ddnet.log" to my launcher
18:40 < Learath2> quotes shouldnt be necessary 
18:40 < Mahdi> ok
18:41 < Mahdi> I did it
18:41 < Learath2> run the client and close it
18:42 < Learath2> should create a log and if you could upload that it would be great :)
18:42 < Mahdi> and ran the client but there's no ddnet.log in the folder
18:42 < Learath2> ddnet.log on desktop or launcher directory ?
18:42 < Mahdi> I'm confused
18:42 < Mahdi> I have the default launcher
18:42 < Mahdi> a launcher in my desktop
18:43 < Mahdi> I added it to my desktop launcher
18:43 < Learath2> then the log should be on your desktop or in the folder
18:44 < Mahdi> the desktop launcher just runs a terminal command
18:44 < Mahdi> which is --> /home/mahdi/Games/Tee-mod/DDNet/DDNet/DDNet &> "ddnet.log"
18:45 < Learath2> and ddnet.log isnt created ?
18:45 < Mahdi> no
18:46 <@deen> /home/mahdi/DDNet/DDNet/DDNet/DDNet/DDNet/DDNet/DDNet/DDNet
18:46  * Learath2 is also confused now
18:46 < Learath2> deen: halp hao2linux
18:46 < Mahdi> Learath2, those are my folders :D
18:46 <@deen> i don't know what's wrong
18:46 < Learath2> how could ddnet.log not be created 
18:46 <@deen> output into file with > ddnet.log
18:46 < Mahdi> Learath2,  let me take it this way
18:47 < Mahdi> Learath2,  I ran the DDNet &> "ddnet.log"
18:47  * Learath2 is formatting his laptop for the 5th time today now installing debian o/
18:47 <@deen> Learath2: haha
18:47 < Mahdi> Learath2,  try a virtual machine
18:47 <@deen> Learath2: you're pretty dedicated to the autoupdater =)
18:49 < Learath2> after that winxp virtual machine ? no thanks
18:49 < Learath2> Mahdi: could you do find / | grep "ddnet.log"
18:49 < Learath2> it should have went somewhere 
18:50 <@deen> or just run it in a shell and scroll up
18:51 < Learath2> deen: then we cant know what $CURRENTDIR is when he launches from the desktop shortcut
18:51 <@deen> ah
18:51 <@deen> let me check
18:52 <@deen> yeah, that fails, when running from another directory
18:52 <@deen> can't even find the cafile
18:53 < Learath2> dunno how to fix that and im quite tired ...
18:54 < Mahdi> ok
18:54 < Mahdi> I have a log file now
18:55 < Mahdi> I tried running ./DDNet > log.txt in terminal
18:55 < Mahdi> now let me do this to the launcher
18:57 < Mahdi> when it's ddnet.log it doesn't work
18:57 < Mahdi> but when it's something.txt
18:57 < Mahdi> it works
18:58 < Learath2> weirdddd
18:58 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] timgame opened pull request #170: added ninjajetpack prediction (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/pAlQ
19:01 < Learath2> Mahdi: could you paste the log somewhere ?
19:02 < Mahdi> in the chat?
19:02 < NoOOOoOB> @Mahdi www.pastebin.com
19:02 < Learath2> preferably in pastie.org or smth
19:05 < Mahdi> http://pastie.org/10026053
19:06  * Learath2 is even more confused as your current dir is correct
19:08 < Mahdi> I pushed the log in log.txt and pasted it
19:12 <@deen> Learath2: i guess i can fix it
19:13 < Learath2> deen: go ahead if you cant ill check when the install finishes on my laptop
19:14 <@deen> but i really thoguht you did this already
19:14 <@deen> have to find out where the binary is on *nix
19:33 < Learath2> deen: idk how it could be out of the current directory
19:33 <@deen> Learath2: it can be anywhere
19:33 <@deen> just run the binary from somewhere else
19:34 <@deen> i thought it was clear that that's one of the main limitations of the old autoupdater^^
19:36 < Learath2> yeah but the log Mahdi sends shows that the current directory is correct
19:36 <@deen> oh, i don't know what his problem is

20:01 <@deen> works for me
20:01 <@deen> if the client can start, it will be able to update now
20:02 <@deen> the whole logic with just using 2 as StorageType doesn't work anyway if someone changes their storage.cfg

20:43 < fstd> speaking of storage, is there a reason why the ddnet client uses ~/.teeworlds instead of ~/.ddnet?
20:43 < fstd> that can cause great pain for people who don't exclusively run ddnet
20:44 <@deen> we have a settings_ddnet.cfg at least
20:44 <@deen> what other problems does it cause?
20:46 < fstd> hm, has this been fixed recently?
20:48 <@deen> last year
20:51 < fstd> then i'm probably mixing this up with a different client
20:51 < fstd> (anyway i patched ddnet to use ~/.ddnet, still curious about whether there's a reason not to do this by default)
20:52 <@deen> yes, you lose all the maps and skins from .teeworlds
20:53 < fstd> mhm fair enough
20:54 <@deen> even having a separate settings_ddnet.cfg causes more than enough confusion
20:54 <@deen> people edit the settings.cfg and wonder why nothing happens
