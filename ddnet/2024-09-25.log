00:05 < bridge> <lukron55> a word of warning. if your usb goes through a washing machine. it may still work and mount however it might not be detected as a bootable device
00:05 < bridge> <lukron55> don’t ask how i figured that one out
00:11 < bridge> <01000111g> u did it for science
00:14 < bridge> <spyres.> a word of warning. if you put your pc through a washing machine. it may still work but ultimately come out cleaner than it was before.
00:14 < bridge> <spyres.> don't ask how i figured that one out
00:15 < bridge> <lukron55> lmfao
00:17 < bridge> <furo> What do you mean? They're always allowed. 0.7 connections are enabled by default, but requires the map to also be converted with `map_convert_07` and placed inside of `maps7`.
00:26 < bridge> <lukron55> i found a post somewhere saying that. just wondering how i can convert them in the cli
00:32 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds like the MBR/GPT is corrupted then
00:32 < bridge> <Ewan> so in fact not working
00:33 < bridge> <lukron55> when i tried to write on it with rufus it said there was an error
00:33 < bridge> <lukron55> so probably
00:33 < bridge> <lukron55> weird though as every other generic image writer didn’t output an error
00:34 < bridge> <Ewan> the nand is probably not functional
00:34 < bridge> <Ewan> at least i wouldn't rely on it
00:35 < bridge> <Ewan> if it does work to an extent
00:35 < bridge> <lukron55> it’s fine i managed to find a working usb anyway
00:35 < bridge> <lukron55> i’m surprised it works at all though 😭
00:41 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
00:58 < bridge> <papotav> I have 4....
00:59 < bridge> <Ewan> did I ask

01:00 < bridge> <papotav> i feel offended.
01:01 < bridge> <papotav> :pepeW:
01:01 < bridge> <Ewan> then remember every single time you slighted someone in a DDRace lobby
01:01 < bridge> <Ewan> and evaluate if you should even be here
01:02 < bridge> <Ewan> cuz i can recall the slurs
01:02 < bridge> <papotav> alr true, we both should leave...
01:07 < bridge> <jxsl13> the one with the mugshot profile picture is probably the offender

01:09 < bridge> <katsumast> actual nerd
01:11 < bridge> <Ewan> i should note both of these ppl are known bad actors in north american ddnet

01:14 < bridge> <Ewan> they are just not good ppl
01:15 < bridge> <Ewan> papota seems to think that cuz he plays with a high point player every once in a while he can throw his weight around and insult noobs (or really anybody, for any reason, at any time. that is sort of his personality)
01:15 < bridge> <Ewan> idk much about kazuma tbn
01:15 < bridge> <Ewan> idk much about kazuma tbh

Who else? I know one player that was affected by this and I would like to do some more investigation/polling -- seems to affect very few people. For a fix, I suggested to delete `settings.cfg` and `settings_ddnet.cfg`, but deleting them would not reset anything and w

11:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> chillerdragon: i just mean the leak ip thing is totally broken. i can get serverinfo regardless whether leak ip is on and off.
11:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :pepeW:
11:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> was the server registered before? maybe its info is still lingering on one of the masterservers?
11:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i checked. it wasn't in the list. but i can check the json. one sec
11:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: I also saw this issue the other day when doing the old version ban
11:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> please open an issue ^^
11:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I decided to tackle it another day because the house was on fire

11:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and now check in the client again
11:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> still there
11:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i can literally see my client ping it
11:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it starts with 999
11:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> and it shows
11:19 < bridge> <tsfreddie> with Leak IP off
11:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe you're on an another version?
11:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> steam version

11:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @tsfreddie you are probably using sp someones ddnet.tw backdoor master xd

11:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> are we gonna warning everyone about using favorite at all below this version too now?
11:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that sounds like nightmare
11:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :greenthing:
11:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: fixed now? (requiem)
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you cant reproduce? its just starting a client
11:37 < bridge> <robyt3> yes
11:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:InsaneCat:1135575687172980866> should i do something else. i don't think i was doing anything weird with my serverbrowser
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea now it seems fixed
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @tsfreddie unplug your main power unit your operation has been compromised
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> your ip is leaking!
11:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927> it's behind ISP's filter. i'll be fine
11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> CHINA firewall will protect you
11:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i can't even use the entire port range. it just does not go through
11:40 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 80 and 443 are the obvious ones. it just doesn't connect to my home via those. i guess it's for selling enterprise links.
11:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kekw: you can probably just port scan and find some weak point tho. just tell me if you did tho so i can update my firewall.
11:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm more curious why changing ping each refreshing isn't indicative.
11:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm more curious why changing ping each refresh isn't indicative.
11:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ye, imma just build a client myself and try to breakpoint why it is pinging i guess
11:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> @heinrich5991 if one of the server is Leak IP ticked. all favorite servers pings
11:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oof
12:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Someone email html pro?
12:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats arcane html

12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
12:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i guess more specifically if the first server of the queue is ticked then all server is pinged
12:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you could add "Fixes #9035" to your PR description
12:10 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9035
12:11 < bridge> <oxyzo.> what does "leak ip" even do:owo:
12:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it leaks your ip
12:11 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :think_bot:
12:11 < bridge> <oxyzo.> :poggers2:
12:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it sends a packet to the server, requesting the server info and leaking your IP address
12:12 < bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe you are right, it never worked if you have more than one server in your favorite.
12:12 < bridge> <oxyzo.> thats awesome then!
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i thought it doesnt work as soon as a server list exists at all
12:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but anyway, i didnt use that since years
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and honestly i also don't miss it xd
12:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> neither did anyone, it would be obviously bugged.
12:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @tsfreddie now that you are motivated for ddnet content, are you an artist?
12:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> define artist...
12:13 < bridge> <meloƞ> i saw the cards you made - you can call yourself artist @tsfreddie
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Could you draw a email banner for ddnet accounts
12:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089> what card
12:14 < bridge> <meloƞ> joker card
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> something so the email doesnt look like trash xd

12:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> any specification other than it is just a banner
12:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> or do you want a entire html thing
12:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> account related
12:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> template i guess

12:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> make it in ddnet ui style :santatrollet:
12:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> sure why not
12:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm assuming it should be smaller in size or just svg?
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if email html supports svg
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but else, svg would be good ig
12:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> email clients doesn't usually show remote images
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am ok with embedding it
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as base64
12:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so it should be really small i'm assuming
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess game traffic is more of a problem than one email per account
12:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but if not, we can still remove that image again
12:16 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you probably don't want a verification email to be massive traffically (which is why almost all verification email looks ugly)
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> honestly i think most ppl will only use steam login anyway
12:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that is true tho
12:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'll try making it smaller then
12:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> why am i accepting the fact that i'm just making it now?
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs you want to be called an artist?
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you basically define the word artist with that
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
12:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> not really. gamedev is a pretty big umbrella term that i'm happy with
12:18 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :kek:

12:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> My 2 seconds of google showed that most email clients support embeeded images
12:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, you can embed images

12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i had a save server, i can give u access on github
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then u can read the mysql column names xd

12:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: did you add jump in your assembly client?
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mhh hard to say
12:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not specifically but inputs work so jump should be ez lemme check
12:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> old fng always called it sacrifise, bcs openfng demanded that from the fng gods 😬
12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat should be suuuper straightforward ye https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds-asmr/blob/1cd4b2e18cbbef8c34287ff23e7ab7ebf2bd4ed4/src/send_system.asm#L36
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i removed all of this in fng2, so i guess you shouldn't call it steal
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but assist
12:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just add one more of those https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds-asmr/blob/1cd4b2e18cbbef8c34287ff23e7ab7ebf2bd4ed4/src/teeworlds_asmr.asm#L194-L197
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no i dunno chiller, i guess i'd just call it steals and stolen or smth
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and always snake case
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for column names
12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes i became lower snak case enjoyer like this year
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and always CAPS for SQL syntax
12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i still have legacy ass ddnet++ Camel_hybrid_CASE columns xd
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xdd
12:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet uses CamcelCase
12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i lowercase my sql these days too when doing manual queries
12:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but in code ye UP
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> use `sleek` for formatting
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sleek -n <path>
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://crates.io/crates/sleek
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is what i used for accounts
12:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ i only used the word sacrafice once in the readme. But i do enjoy the whole spiritual vibe. Its just not in the code yet. Not sure if i ever add it.
12:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i will keep it as steals. I called the columns stolen_by_others and stolen_from_others now. Its long ass but its obivous what it means which was important to me.
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
12:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat why u ask
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is the hardest thing in development anyway
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> short names vs long perfect names
12:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat if you struggle with jumping make sure you also send jump 0 at some point not only jump 1. Otherwise you get stuck holding jump.
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but stolen_from_others
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you steal
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you are active form
12:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: I was wondering if you did more stuff in da client
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah no. no more commits since 1 month
12:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if i rewrite a little of the compiler i will be pretty close to sending a packet to a ddnet server
12:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i briefly thought about making it CI ready and contribute it to ddnet but then i was too lazy. It could be a nice low maintenance independent lightweight protocol compatibility checker in the CI if it supports proper signals and exit codes. Ideally even fifo support xd
12:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> please write that in a maintainable language instead
12:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> xd
12:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 yea i knew there was some potential critism about that also one of the reasons why i didnt bother. The usual pr discussions. The idea would be that it does not require maintenance. Otherwise we can also just use a headless teeworlds client.
12:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but everything that dynamically links requires maintenance. the assembly client is fully self contained and will run on any linux for decades without changing anything or any dependency.
12:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's already maintainable ddnet servers/clients in libtw2, for example
12:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you want to add something to the CI
12:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> likely to run for decades as well
12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> libtw2 has no readme
12:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ???
12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the client i mean xd
12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rust breaks on a daily basis
12:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what?
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> compiling rust is quite unstable
12:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> libtw2 hasn't broken since the release of 1.0
12:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> libtw2 hasn't broken since the release of rust 1.0
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it broke my pipeline already
12:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> elaborate
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/issues/87
12:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's python, not rust you're complaining about
12:56 < bridge> <zhn> xd
12:57 < bridge> <zhn> ye libtw2 solid as rock
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its a rust compiler error
12:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in the python package
12:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> libtw2, the rust version has not broken since rust 1.0
12:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I stand by my point
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok maybe i dont know
12:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which is incidentally 9 years ago
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can just tell you it broke my CI
12:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, the python package
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what would you suggest serving binaries?
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> statically linked?
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and download them in the CI?
12:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> YES
12:58 < bridge> <zhn> not using nightly for example xd
12:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I wasn't going to argue about python packages
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am talking about the CI client
12:58 < bridge> <zhn> hey jupjop
12:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what flow do you suggest?
12:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I just wanted to say that libtw2 would be a solid base for some CI checks in a sane maintainable language
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hey gerdoe
12:59 < bridge> <zhn> hows it going
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> good & 4 u?
12:59 < bridge> <zhn> good as well
12:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i was suggesting 56K client that just runs i think thats pretty damn good
12:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, I don't think that's a good idea
12:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just download and run it no dependencies
12:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> for maintainability
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how so?
13:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because it's going to need some adjustments over time
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> like what?
13:00 < bridge> <zhn> i though im about to skip very important lecture but came here an hour before xd
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if it tests backwards compatibility it doesnt need adjustments
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if it doesnt break to launch it also doesnt need adjustments
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and here comes my hottest take: assembly is easier than rust
13:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon's got it all figured out, let's throw compilers out of the window
13:01 < bridge> <zhn> wait but it needs
13:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> you used bss as registers because it was hard to work with stack in assembly xd
13:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no but rly what adjustments @heinrich5991 
13:01 < bridge> <zhn> if you add changes ur current code becomes old code
13:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pst @milkeeycat xd
13:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you want to test more stuff, you want to test different stuff, you realize it has a bug
13:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see
13:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea valid
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in that case ez assembly edit or if you prefer libtw2 just delete the assembly client and replace it with libtw2 client then
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it for sure has a bug btw xd
13:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> leave a comment in main file like `if something doesn't work email this person: *chiller's email*` xd
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> chillerdragon@gmail.com
13:03 < bridge> <zhn> lets throw all the tests then kekw
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye sure as long as im around
13:03 < bridge> <zhn> whats wrong with ddnet headless
13:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet headless is ddnet
13:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so its fat
13:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> either its the version that was just built in the CI @zhn then its useless for a test that checks if old clients can still connect to the newly built server
13:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or its a fat download that depends on libc stuff so it will have to be updated and maintained
13:05 < bridge> <zhn> ig u can download previous tagged client to test things
13:05 < bridge> <zhn> but it just makes ci longer
13:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> depending on libc is no problem, it's backward compatible
13:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> from ddnet.org maybe
13:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well yea i have to admit ddnet 3.6 runs on debian 12 xd https://ddnet.org/downloads/#3.6
13:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> other libraries might be bigger problems
13:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea i struggled hard with ddnet persian client
13:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok sure then the only selling point left is download speed and size
13:17 < bridge> <tsfreddie> @jupeyy_keks is the token base64
13:20 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:vibe:1191801470945869927> i have a weird nitpick that you can't double click to select a base64 string
13:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> because the `-` `_` and `=` :justatest:
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it is yes
13:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> btw tees don't have mouth.
13:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah that sucks xd
13:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089> can we do a weird encoding that only uses alphanum
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They teleport the food into their stomache
13:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> since it is email so a copy to clipboard button is impossible i think
13:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sadly
13:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the `=` can be removed by using the no-pad variants
13:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> isnt there some html tag to say that it should copy the whole word as one
13:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> never heard of such thing hmm
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well tripple click works for me
13:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but dunno if normal users do that xd
13:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> wait there is wtf
13:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> `user-select: all;` css magic
13:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> bruh
13:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> thanks jupy
13:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I need to try if that works for emails 😄
13:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> true
13:31 < bridge> <robyt3> It should work in HTML emails, but do you want to include a plain text variant?
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not supported by gmail already
13:31 < bridge> <robyt3> :pepeW:
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Works with -webkit prefix
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
13:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mostly not supported tho
13:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://docs.rs/base58check-encode/latest/base58check_encode/
13:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> works in thunderbird :kekw:
13:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao no decode
13:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think you can send both plain text and html somehow right?
13:33 < bridge> <robyt3> Hex seems simpler though
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah i can also use hex
13:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> lol
13:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1288463696951246921/image.png?ex=66f546d3&is=66f3f553&hm=b023fb99e7489eb5c3535634627f063df05b9dce47c236d9fa40c61958d3cb82&
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hot
13:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
13:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i still need ddnet's steam publisher key to test steam integration 😬
13:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> like web api or?
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the session tickets seem like the easiest solution
13:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> is our steam implementation close sourced?
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just generate token, send to acc server. acc server gets steamid
13:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no
13:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> then you can get yourself a web api key and just build a client that uses the 480 appid
13:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i think
13:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:InsaneCat:1135575687172980866>  borrow a key somehow is probably easier tho
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont understand that
13:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but the publisher key is used on the server side
13:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ah nvm, i thought steam provided publisher keys for 480
14:01 < bridge> <learath2> Did I just miss chiller making an argument to add his assembly client into ci for testing?
14:02 < bridge> <learath2> `base56`
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> base16 it is now
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hex
14:03 < bridge> <learath2> Or `base58`
14:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the user doesnt care anyway.. it just has to look secure :lol:
14:04 < bridge> <learath2> Or honestly just an integer would also work, not like you need much length before it becomes impossible to guess anyway
14:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> generate code using `wordlist.txt` :kek:
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but i like that everything is [u8; 32]
14:05 < bridge> <learath2> Oh wow, you are at the steam stage?
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no, steam is the only thing left xd
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i wrote the integration for the server
14:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but to test it i need client integration + the publisher key to actually call the steam verify thing
14:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (I tried DMing you a key, can you look if it has the correct format?)
14:07 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, well if you use encrypted application tickets instead of session tickets, I think you can verify those offline on the backend
14:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah thanks, will test during the week
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno all other steam stuff looks so much harder to use
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the session + web api verify, doesn't need any additional libs
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for the server
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but if you feel summoned to do that
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u are ofc free to do so
14:09 < bridge> <learath2> But in exchange we can't verify tickets without connecting to steam backend servers, hm
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that works like a cert or what?
14:09 < bridge> <learath2> So we either have to link the account server to steam sdk or use the backend
14:10 < bridge> <learath2> Idk what sort of black magic they employ, but you get an encrypted ticket, you do steamapi::decrypt on it and it just works
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah nice
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if it actually does no call to any steam service
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is probs better
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs it doesn't need a rate limit
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but anyway
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'll start with the session stuff, since that is almost done
14:12 < bridge> <learath2> I have a question
14:12 < bridge> <learath2> Will we automatically connect steam accounts or will it be manual?
14:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> gmail does not seem to like embedded svg
14:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1288473364771373178/image.png?ex=66f54fd4&is=66f3fe54&hm=5bd2f4ee176add6265b6c66bafedfaa161f9a7a668aeb92a564f4558a037de4a&
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Good question, in dd-pg currently there is simply a "Login with steam" button.
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But tbh that is a thing that can be changed easily
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i dont want to think about such stuff now
14:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I vote for manual, but it can easily be changed, so whatever
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> arg
14:14 < bridge> <learath2> Mail html is such a PITA. It's so hard to get it to render correctly everywhere that serious professionals use paid tooling that just renders it on all clients
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that sucks ofc
14:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
14:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it seems like there are reimplementations of the steam encrypted app tickets
14:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-appticket/blob/3ff347347a8d5e1e9908225a671a8972b9e5bef4/src/components/parseEncryptedAppTicket.ts#L15
14:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so it's likely that it can be reimplemented somewhat easily
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (but focusing on something that works first makes a lot of sense)
14:15 < bridge> <learath2> Quick followup question: Do we allow just steam or just email or both on accounts?
14:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you can link additional credentials to a single account, if that is your question
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> both, but same answer
14:18 < bridge> <learath2> I'm wondering if steam users have to bother with linking their emails
14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They don't need to do that
14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but they can
14:18 < bridge> <learath2> It seems to just be normal aes
14:18 < bridge> <learath2> Cool
14:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh wow. gmail requires you to use remote images.
14:24 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
14:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tja
14:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I knew this is going to be an annoying topic xd
14:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> wat
14:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you use images from attachments?
14:25 < bridge> <learath2> https://www.emailonacid.com people use stuff like this to make sure
14:25 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i'm not sure how you would display attachment images in a html body
14:26 < bridge> <learath2> I guess that's fine, no?
14:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd guess most clients block third-party images in emails by default
14:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> not gmail apparently
14:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because it leaks your reading time and IP address
14:26 < bridge> <learath2> Also have you tried inline base64 images?
14:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's what i meant. inline base64 does not work on gmail
14:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (gmail proxies the images, so the IP address isn't leaked there)
14:27 < bridge> <learath2> https://www.caniemail.com/features/image-base64/ lol
14:27 < bridge> <learath2> The web is such a mess
14:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> let me try actual img tag tho, maybe gmail just doesn't like css inline images
14:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh i don't need to try it then
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> quick google confirmed that gmail doesnt support it tho
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but maybe that changed already
14:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> what if i include both inline and remote images with different styles :justatest:
14:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://stackoverflow.com/a/36870709/870079
14:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> apparently you can attach the image
14:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and then use `src="cid:<image cid here>"`
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "Also, many clients, including the Gmail web interface, will append a copy of all attached images at the end of the message, which is very, very ugly"
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lol
14:30 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that is pretty wild
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is that still the case
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why is this shit so hard
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe i should just do some ugly ass text based email
14:31 < bridge> <learath2> Actually why don't we look at a mail from a srsbsns enterprise to see how they do it
14:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> attachment already looks pretty ugly in most client really. and some people might wonder why some random images are attached
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dislike that i'd need to code that manually mostly 😬
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> base64 would be inline
14:31 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i already run everything in premailer.io just to check. my original html just results in black and white text in gmail
14:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> so what if we just use both remote url and inline. gmail sees the remote one. client sees the inline one. some weirdo can see both.
14:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 👀
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xcDDD
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> would be worth a try
14:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> two `src` tags?
14:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> two `src` attributes?
14:33 < bridge> <learath2> It's remote images in corpo emails
14:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> just two images side by side
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that would be an interesting try too
14:34 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, pretty much every email I found with images uses just remote images. What is our issue with that anyway?
14:35 < bridge> <learath2> That it won't get displayed properly on the 10 people old enough to still use a desktop mail client and play ddnet?
14:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> although blocked image on thunderbird is also ugly
14:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1288479003178700913/image.png?ex=66f55515&is=66f40395&hm=6ea4e82d5a02f5c2ae986297f80e0547d76b2c3eb2ab415049970ed8861f0ca5&
14:35 < bridge> <tsfreddie> that's fair
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if that are only a few ppl, i am totally ok with using external
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> makes our emails smaller
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in the end the email is there to copy a token
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> not to win a art contest
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> jk
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we win art contest
14:36 < bridge> <learath2> Atleast that's what my opinion is on that. The blocked image is also not too bad, it's just a logo
14:36 < bridge> <tsfreddie> jupy wants a whole banner tho, i just haven't drawn one
14:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:InsaneCat:1135575687172980866>
14:37 < bridge> <learath2> Oor, someone remake the logo in css and html tables
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but with a banner it's even better
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if the banner misses it still aligns normally
14:37 < bridge> <tsfreddie> genius
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> shouldn't be that hard xd
14:38 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean, tees are just circles. probably do able with a bunch of `border-radius`
14:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://developers.google.com/gmail/design/css
14:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> `float` `border-radius` `margin*` is probably enough to make a logo
14:39 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly as is it doesn't look too bad maybe we can get away with a purely css html banner, or no banner?
14:39 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it works as-is without any art really
14:41 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:amogus:876956004674338848> but i guess looking playful is kinda cool, not that i have anything better to do rn. if i didn't manage to get anything done before juppy ships it we can just use this.
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I thought it would maybe make it look more like game content
14:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with a banner
14:41 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder how many mail clients support @media(prefers-color-scheme)
14:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc u can embed svg in html
14:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> glad you asked: https://www.caniemail.com/features/css-at-media-prefers-color-scheme/
14:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> so use the svg logo
14:42 < bridge> <learath2> It would
14:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> gmail does not support svg
14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> f*ck gmail!
14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
14:42 < bridge> <learath2> We've been thru this 😛
14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> just be oldschool and send plaintext
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am surprised that gmail misses lot of support.
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> normally it's google that allows all the weird stuff nobody cares about xD
14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> but the corpos are so smart they "downscore" ur email spam score if u dont have a html version
14:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> just make the html a pre block kek
14:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> and use a png to ascii tool
14:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i assumed they wrote a parser specifically for gmail so it is just really small
14:43 < bridge> <learath2> Sadge. Would have been cool
14:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> and put ddnet logo as ascii art
14:43 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i assumed they wrote a parser specifically for gmail so it is just really small set of features
14:44 < bridge> <learath2> They probably went backwards to make sure vulnerabilities aren't possible. So a whitelist of allowed stuff rather than a blacklist

14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i made a meme
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> real cpp chads would know that you cannot use tsan and asan at the same time
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i never said same time kek
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> but thats bad
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> in rust u have all at same time :nameless_tee:
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if i am very honest that i'd have to say the special thing is not about having compile time checks in rust.
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's just that pattern matching + enum structs + RAII lead to much clearer code paths.
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If u use rust like c, then it will probably only partially be nicer than using cpp 😬

14:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> actually, I think ubsan/tsan/asan isn't really available for rust, which means you can't have them when writing `unsafe` code
14:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's miri, but it doesn't run your code in production AFAIK
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> RUSTFLAGS="-Z sanitizer=address" cargo run --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> TSAN_OPTIONS="ignore_noninstrumented_modules=1" RUSTFLAGS="-Z sanitizer=thread" cargo run --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ```
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my README never failed me
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess i once used asan on rust
14:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> epic fail
14:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1288484945941102633/image.png?ex=66f55a9e&is=66f4091e&hm=8e034a72ca392cf3d493e378327457efe01cd43e92e9a7d32e740e61e1d22002&
14:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> lmao
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> LMAO YOU ARE NOT
14:59 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:catbite:1080459483345584160> remote image it is i guess
14:59 < bridge> <teero777> ey i don't like this xD
15:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> imagine that worked
15:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> would be so epic
15:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> wrong, asan and tsan can run on rust, since they are passes that work over llvm ir, which rust emits, ubsan yes but its ub specific to c
15:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> miri would be the ubsan for rust, since all UB added to rust is tested first with miri to catch it
15:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, cool: https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/compiler-flags/sanitizer.html#addresssanitizer
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> but miri is quite limited on external calls
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw a good way to test unsafe stuff is -randomize layout option
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i should
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> RUSTFLAGS="-Zrandomize-layout"
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well actually pretty much all unsafe code i have are the vk calls xd
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77316
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> The randomize layout flag randomizes/shuffles/otherwise makes unpredictable the layout of repr(Rust) types, which do not have a specified layout. This is to aid in debugging programs, detecting undefined behavior and running crater experiments. This does not affect any types with specified layouts, such as #[repr(C)] or #[repr(transparent)] types. This is strictly an opt-in flag and will not affect current stable code unless the end user explicitly
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what i'd find interesting is if i could randomly trigger errors in tests to make sure that my error handling doesn't result in panics or dead locking or similar stuff
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> proptest crate, fuzzing, there is also another crate i forgor
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> are they easy to use? xd
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://lib.rs/crates/fail
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i need retard safe libs
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lib.rs is so ugly xd
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah is cool
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if that works easily
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well maybe
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> additional changes to the codebase also sucks xd
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://lib.rs/crates/cargo-careful
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks this is a cargo run replacement
15:26 < bridge> <tsfreddie> wtf it's 9pm
15:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> forgot to eat
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> forgot ten cat
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u want to send me the mail later i can test how it looks (even if unfinished) 😄
15:28 < bridge> <tsfreddie> maybe tomorrow
15:29 < bridge> <learath2> Would be even less likely to render the same on everything. There is a reason everyone and their mothers are still using tables 😄
15:29 < bridge> <tsfreddie> also just learned that you literally cannot use div to layout your email

15:32 < bridge> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks btw now that you are back, I have a question for you. Do you know if we intentionally don't support 1:1 resolutions without grey bars?
15:32 < bridge> <m1d1kslol> My RUS servers have disappeared, what should I do?
15:32 < bridge> <tsfreddie> my phone breaks with div
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes, the UI breaks
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I asked robyte if we should just not care
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he said he doesnt like it
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> best is you discuss it with him
15:33 < bridge> <learath2> Ok. There was a player actually using 1080x1080 asking me 😄
15:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 1:1 has a certain pvp advantage
15:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
15:33 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i've been using 5:4 when i was still playing fng
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> back then we all had 5:4
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but now we all rich and have 16:9
15:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> wasn't it 4:3
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> uff
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> true
15:34 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 5:4 is square-er
16:00 < bridge> <tsfreddie> sketched. also changed back to light theme. cuz most emails are white probably for good reasons

16:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> the sketch on the top right
16:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> peak artist performance
16:43 < bridge> <onekdo> anyone can tell how install ddnet server on ubuntu?
16:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 if 0 and 1 are certain then they cant be considered probabilities right? probabilities lie within the range from 0 to 1 excluded
16:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
16:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 hey, I have one more question regarding Sethi-Ullman algorithm, do I have handle division expression uniquely, because amd64 doesn't have `idiv` instruction with immediate as operand
16:46 < bridge> <learath2> 0 and 1 are most definitely allowed in the definition of a probability function I know. e.g. the event of a tossed coin hitting the ground has 1 probability within the event space since it's the only outcome in the sample space
16:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can self compile, or use the one from https://ddnet.org/downloads
16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u use the one from your ubuntu repo, that is probs pretty outdated
16:48 < bridge> <learath2> 0 I don't remember why we include though. A probability space is defined in terms of a sample space, an event space and a probability function. The sample space by definition only contains the outcomes, which are iirc defined as all the POSSIBLE results
16:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/badmathematics/comments/127vquu/eliezer_yudkowsky_0_and_1_are_not_probabilities/
16:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> xddd
16:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i saw this on twitter
16:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> X
16:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's useful since you don't need to change the sample space if some event becomes impossible
16:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> like you also don't have to hit everything in the image space of a function
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence
16:52 < bridge> <murpi> @jupeyy_keks What does <@&1129094178337460297> do if someone from the db crew approves a skin that shares a name with an existing one?
16:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it doesn't know about existing skins
16:53 < bridge> <murpi> Ok, I see
16:54 < bridge> <murpi> Do we have this in JSON format?
16:54 < bridge> <murpi> https://skins.ddnet.org/skin/community/
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://skins.ddnet.org/skin/skins.json
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but actually i have to improve that json before it's used, but i'd need to change php code
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah dunno, guess u can just use it xd
16:58 < bridge> <louis> the probability of a single valued event on a continuous function is usually 0
17:02 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, why? I don't think the algorithm relies on immediate operations being available. Imagine just 3 / 5. Algorithm suggests 1 register is enough, which it is, you store one result
17:12 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, I can see the confusion. Most definitely my fault, constant lhs leaves are not 0 because immediate operations exist. They are 0 because the constants are from memory (atleast back in those days, immediates are also technically from memory, just that they are embedded within the instruction)
17:12 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1288518600688144456/image.png?ex=66f579f5&is=66f42875&hm=f4e060cf4166295eac5f18bdc08f24e87d036e4800f23a7dbbe9791752eea9ef&
17:13 < bridge> <learath2> You really should have just implemented normal spilling and called it a day. I wanted to make it optimal but sent you into a rabbit-hole
17:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ill google stuff next time xd
17:14 < bridge> <learath2> To be fair to me, I told you spilling is the naive way to do this
17:14 < bridge> <learath2> Right about here
19:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if there was a variable on lhs, would it be 0 or 1?
19:09 < bridge> <learath2> 1, non-constant left childs get a 1
19:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> > since an operation such as `add R1, A` can handle the right component A directly without storing it into a register
19:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I thought that was about `add r/m64, imm32` in amd64 for example
20:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> after drinking some tea i think they are talking about `add r/m64, imm32` AND `add r64 r/m64` xd
