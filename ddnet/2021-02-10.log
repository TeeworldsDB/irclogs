00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> too bad
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd like to collect SVGs for the UHD option
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> pack them into a new repo in ddnet
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mind made greyfox and the x_ninja skin, and it really looks much better ingame ðŸ˜„ much less blurry
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Do you want to upscale graphics we don't have high quality versions for?
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes, and put them in a new directory with a UHD toggle
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You could use something like https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x for the missing images
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah but upscaling has too many artifaccts
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> im working on a default entities remake but its not rly the same, if u wanna see it i can send u the current version
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sure, sounds nice

04:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ShaneR> Initially I just had the question "how big is a tee actually" when drawing a skin which lead me to make this. It can be helpful to play with but also it could be used as a basis to make skins with more accurate dimensions.

08:51 <+ChillerDragon> Hue you can request access on gitlab repos? Is it common that you randomly get those requests? any gitlub mains here? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1612943431.png
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Jupstar âœª as far as I know Soreu didn't even make entities in vector
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok thanks for the info, lukely louis is at creating a new default as svg ^^
11:01 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar âœª do not forget mine :) https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/mapres/blob/master/svg/grass_doodads_chiller.svg
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i didnt chillerdragon ðŸ˜„
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> <3
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> i didnt know u actually plan on creating a UHD thing
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> will there be a github repo in the ddnet org?
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we already planned it like half a year ago, but i guess it wont really happen until you start ðŸ˜„
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes hopefully
11:04 <+ChillerDragon> id happily replace my svg dir with a submodule and pr to ddnet repo instead
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> do you have org access to create a repo? then we could start
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> my plan would be to create a repo with all SVGs in the correct data directory style, and write a script to automatically create a data directory with all the SVGs converted to the ratio you want
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so it could be created for any need ðŸ˜„
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> sounds very nice
11:05 <+ChillerDragon> go
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont think i have any access except the ddnet source ðŸ˜„
11:06 <+ChillerDragon> hm sad
11:06 <+ChillerDragon> @deen can we get a repo?
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i guess @deen would kindly help us ðŸ˜„
11:06 <+ChillerDragon> :GWPingSok:
11:06 <+ChillerDragon> i also have some ci for mapres but yea thats png not svg
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> i am hyped
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar âœª ima add a jungle doodads and you write a svg render engine :D
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we'll just use existing linux tools, since PNGs are faster to use anyway
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> than onfly rendering
11:14 <+ChillerDragon> but pngs are bad for zooz
11:14 <+ChillerDragon> what about multiple sizes?
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well as said, there will be a script, so its easy to created the stuff in the resolution you want
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> double skin res is already huge improvement ðŸ˜„
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/809005210470973480/unknown.png
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> none zoom in
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> need 2k screen tho
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/809006342525943808/screenshot_2021-02-10_11-22-15.png
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> on normal displays increasing skin resolution does nothing btw
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well on full hd it renders ~1429.84(assuming 64 pixels per tile) pixels in width
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and normal full HD is 1920 pixels in width
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so it should even improve it on full hd a bit
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I remember doubling the resolution did completely nothing on 1920x1080 cause the scaling factor on feet was the same (so still messed up) maybe it improved with the new rendering tho idunno
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> possible, since the texture coords were wrong with old skin system
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> anyway I have these if you need it
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/809016205406765068/unknown.png
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wtf
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah especially the vanillas are important
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> they're not the original, just really close
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> some little improvements like symmetry and outlines
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its ok
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> aslong the eyes dont look like 0.7 xD
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> what's wrong with 0.7 eyes?
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they look weird
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs they thin and far away from each other
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> they're fine
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/809017017780404254/unknown.png
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> maybe slightly bigger but it's cute
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/809017090164916224/unknown.png
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> looks creepy xD
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just as reference
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/809017497625821264/unknown.png
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> top is how they always should have been, the crossing is some side effect or whatever
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well im not about crossing
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they are too huge
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it looks creepy
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon, @Jupstar âœª Sure, what name do you want for the repo? What is the plan for normal players? Will we ship the svgs or just ship multiple resolution pngs?
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> data-svg i guess
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ddnet-data-svg?
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd say we ship a additional directory for releases that is named UHD and has normal data structure
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah works too @deen
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª r u adding svg support?
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont see any sense in it
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> will just increase load time even more
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> thanks deen <3
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if someone wants 8k support he'll just use the script to generate the PNGs
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Created and invited Jupstar: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-data-svg
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think svg can be smaller in file size
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> can one pr against an empty repo?
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that is true yes
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> jupstar go add the folder structure with gitkeep ima pr my doodads
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> try it out, then we know ^^
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> so u try :p
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so whats going on here?
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u adding upscaled textures?
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> svgs for highres client
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we add svgs in first place
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> highres optional dataset
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> yea no forking possible and prs seems dead too
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we can still plan on what exactly we want in the client, but for now it would already be nice to collect most of the vanilla PNGs as SVG to have them upscaled by 2x
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> @deen mind touching a README ?
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.khronos.org/openvg/
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: I gave you permissions, you should be able to just push
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki  i mean if u want to do some benchmarks ðŸ˜„
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> oh
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/809019156661403668/unknown.png
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe if i have time
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill try it
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> jupstar u want to do the folder structure right?
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> do u also have access?
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i assume so ðŸ˜„
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> i cant find a clone button and i do not see the usual init text
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you have to push an initial commit
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> yea but when its empty it usually shows the text
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> ok ima try to push something
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just create an empty readme or smth
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or i do it
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> idc
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> on it
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> yea no push rights as i assumed
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> the github ui should look different when having push access
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> ah nvm didnt accept :D
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> uhh
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> main branch
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> ah u were faster
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª change
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i did it after you said it didnt work, chiller ðŸ˜„
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> ye jupstar go add the folders or should i do it

12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can u even push empty folders in git? ^^
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> .gitkeep
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with .gitkeep
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> ye ima change to master
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> lets go full racist
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah so racist
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> change it on git too
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> im not sure if i have perms
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but tbh, its not so important to create all directories, just add your doodas in the right directory the PNG would be in chiller
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> git config --global init.defaultBranch master
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just in case
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for the future
12:18 <+ChillerDragon> ikr
12:18 <+ChillerDragon> i have that xd
12:18 <+ChillerDragon> yea my github access is too limited to switch default branch sad
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and pls also add the license, but i assume you want zlib like teeworlds? ^^
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/organizations/ddnet/settings/repository-defaults
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its nicer if we create prs anyway i'd say
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think only deen can doit
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so just fork it and do a normal pr
12:27 <+ChillerDragon> yea 
12:27 <+ChillerDragon> deen can we get a racist branch name please? :D
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cant u just do git checkout main or what?
12:28 <+ChillerDragon> oof license im not sure i like permissive stuff i think vanilla teeworlds is so restrictive
12:28 <+ChillerDragon> im used to master being the main branch it just adds extra confusion
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: whitepower or what?
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i like BSD / MIT and it fits teeworlds ðŸ˜„
12:28 <+ChillerDragon> yes!
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wat
12:29 <+ChillerDragon> rename main to master it would save me headache
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª but assets dont use mit usually
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they use cc or smth
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe I should also suggest the Chinese bad reviewers that we can use some Chinese flag from the middle ages instead
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
12:29 <+ChillerDragon> maybe we can delay the license a bit
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki yeah ðŸ˜„
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who made the assets
12:29 <+ChillerDragon> idk
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he gets to decide at the end no?
12:29 <+ChillerDragon> Landil?
12:30 <+ChillerDragon> sure
12:30 <+ChillerDragon> we inherit license anyways
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know if we can change the license
12:30 <+ChillerDragon> cuz its so restrictive its fucking infectious license
12:30 <+ChillerDragon> no we cant
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats license is it
12:30 <+ChillerDragon> we inherit the cc3bysa whatevery
12:30 <+ChillerDragon> sec
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but we have to be careful with debian packaging
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it doesnt allow all licenses
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cc by sa is fine

12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just cant do commerical stuff
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> we have to use it
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im fine with it
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> because the svg rework is  similar enough to be counted as based on
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is that so?
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> or we create new textures lul
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> im not a lawyer
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> i prefer to stay safe
12:31 <+ChillerDragon> or Landil might want to jail me
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there is a huge grey zone about such things
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> ikr
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> same with reverse engeneering
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> but keep in mind we racist
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> so stay in white zone
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ;D
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> CC-BY fucking SA 3.0 it is then
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is nothing wrong with it
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobo
12:33 <+ChillerDragon> its infectous
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> CC0 best ðŸ˜„
12:33 <+ChillerDragon> as bad as GPL
12:33 <+ChillerDragon> ye CC0 masterrace
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like viral licenses
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gpl best
12:33 <+ChillerDragon> go to mc modding then
12:33 <+ChillerDragon> its fully infected by GPL
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/edg-l/MC-HelperBot>
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i set it up
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and use AGPL
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> step it up*
12:34 <+ChillerDragon> its still called main
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even better license
12:34 <+ChillerDragon> @deen are you planning to change the branch or are u main supporter?

12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well tbh its vicious circle.
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> If the world would be open enough so nobody would exploit others work, we wouldnt need any kind of lincese, so CC0 is best.
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> So to protect us from that we make a free as in freedom license, which isnt a completly free license
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gpl just ensures that you can't take the rights of the users to have th source code available and modify it
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: None of the above. Just keep it at main for convenience, I don't care either way
12:36 <+ChillerDragon> i do :/
12:36 <+ChillerDragon> or we switch all branches to main

12:37 <+ChillerDragon> this inconsitance makes me nervous
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i know, but thats what i mean, its some kind of restrictive. i could build something for friends and i'd violate the license
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no u wouldnt if u share the source code
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but thats the point, its a restriction
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to ensure the 4 freedoms
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nobody cares about my modification probably, maybe its just some troll
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª i mean the license probably would enforce u to make the modification source code available to those that use i
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in this case ur friends
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> should get the source code
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u dont share the app with anyone else nobody will ever know about it anyway
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> anyway, for me its a vicious circle.
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there is no end of discussion in this imo
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:43 <+ChillerDragon> go audit my quality pr jupstar
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok^^
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah you also edited the readme
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> too bad
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> first 2 commits, directly merge conflict ^^
12:47 <+ChillerDragon> awesome
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but lets put licenses in a license.txt file

13:01 <+ChillerDragon> yea but the repo is called data already
13:01 <+ChillerDragon> so does that make sense?
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> it`s only displays on beta version
21:59 < u0_a97> test1
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> delete this warning
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/809166325405450270/Discord_23cCC9Iqqk.png
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> what map is this on
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> this on my 4k skin
22:02 <+u0_a97> tell him sizes
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> 3068x1534 resolution
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> this on my skin
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> it says you hsould make the width divisible by 8 and the height divisible by 4
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> 4096x2048 better i guess
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> i need to re paint my skin? ðŸ˜†
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> you should be able to resize it
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> I'm going to try now
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> vector format the best
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/809168860413689866/unknown.png
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is there any way to download the map from the website
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps
22:11 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps/blob/master/types/brutal/maps/Stronghold.map
22:11 <+ChillerDragon> @louis yea go to github as gerdoe mentioned and try pressing "t" to open fuzzy file search and enter the map name
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> @gerdoe ddnet support vector?
22:11 <+ChillerDragon> no
22:12 <+ChillerDragon> no live render
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> use vector to make hq images then convert it
22:12 <+ChillerDragon> but u can always export a vector as png in the resolution u need
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ofc
22:17 < u0_a971> cya later guys, with best wishes, u0_a971.
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is this idea even? Why should we remove a warning?
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's telling you exactly what's wrong with your skin file
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 but I don't like warnings ðŸ˜‰
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> ;D
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> everything ok with me skin
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> it displays good in game without any visuals bugs
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> it displays well in game without any visuals bugs
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> everything ok with my skin
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> use an image editing program to resize it to a size that is divisible by 8
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> gfx_show_warnings 0 maybe? :P
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> yees sir xDDDD
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Coke also gets warnings now and then iirc & is to lazy to change image size
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soyler> I changed to 4k now there are no warnings ðŸ™‚
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We never should have added that config option
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Knew it the second we added that it would be set by everyone so nothing would ever get fixed
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how did that config option slip past my gaze?
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was too busy with other things
