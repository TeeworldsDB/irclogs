14:09 < Muttley> hi guys
14:10 < Muttley> i found this source for a infection server: https://github.com/Teetime/teeworlds/tree/infection
14:10 < Muttley> i compiled it with bam and tried to run it
14:10 < Muttley> but i cant seem to connect
14:10 < Muttley> could it be that it is a old release not compatible with 0.6 ?
15:19 < Muttley> deen, did you need to make many modification to get the player limit to 64 ?
15:19 <@deen> yes
15:19 <@deen> good luck extracting them from ddnet :P
15:19 < Muttley> would it be cut and paste to get that into a other mod ;-)
15:19 <@deen> what are you trying to do?
15:19 <@deen> no
15:19 < Muttley> thats a no then
15:19 < Muttley> ;-)
15:19 < Muttley> infection

15:20 <@deen> by coffee
15:20 < Muttley> yea i have it
15:20 < Muttley> but is the gameplay the same ?
15:21 <@deen> not exactly
15:21 < Muttley> you miss the hammer laser bars correct ?
15:22 <@deen> i think so, but coffee is adding them already?
