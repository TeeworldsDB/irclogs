00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> This is planned
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We are already recording player inputs, but we are missing the tool to generate a demo from that
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2937
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Zwelf is working on something like that
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> if you install it using the package manage it updates the cache automatically, if you use make you can update it manually see https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Icons#Manually
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> and https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME_package_guidelines#GTK_icon_cache

14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Konsti can you explain why <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2166> is usefull?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Konsti can you explain why <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2166> is useful?
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think he's banned
18:37 <+ChillerDragon> classic konsti
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if we are revamping all the timecps for all the map, could we redo the tile itself?
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the current method is limited to 25 timecps and is a bit complicated with out of order / skipping whatnot
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ah yes also time cp is skippable
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> isnt it
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think a single timecp tile could work a bit better using smth like this
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/984140742891032596/unknown.png
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i mean if we were to revamp tile cp's wouldnt that also mean completely remaking the tilesheet
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah its probably too much work to fix whats not really broken much
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No, I think the current 25 are good enough
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Maybe it's a lil bit low for biggest map like "back in time 3"
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i guess for 99% of maps its fine and the 1% that its too sparse, speedrunning will have less emphasis on small optimizations anyways
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> true, but moving them to switch layers would allow 255 time cps
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but would also require to change all maps
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> (again)
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> another thing to do with twmap ;d
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ah yeah, could be easily automated task ðŸ™‚
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's what i mostly do in my work, i automate task ðŸ˜„
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's what i mostly did in my work, i automate task ðŸ˜„
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's what i mostly did in my work, i automated task ðŸ˜„
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> damn it, it's rather calm this week on github
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not nice to lose compatibility with old maps, having to convert them
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> moving them to another layer is a nono, what if someone mapped them on top of a switch?
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> @Not Keks yo, i still got some troubles with the fsaa stuff (i thought it was fixed), so if fsaa is enabled at 64 with opengl 3.0.0, it crashes (after a short time when the client reload)
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> maybe it's the same as last time, i just thought it was fixed ^^
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> gpu : 1060 6go
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> drivers : up to date
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we lowered it again
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> #5190
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> normally the window manager should handle this, and Desktop OpenGL has no way to know FSAA(except if you maybe call OS specific API)
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Kinda sucks, on linux it works as expected xd
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5190
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also it was you who reported it
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> :gigachad:
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> you got the credit xd
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> thx for remind
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ok yeah, what did u write last time? with my name
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no aa
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> yeahhh xDDD
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xddd
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ahah

21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Where to put the joystick settings in the menus?
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/984171753951596544/screenshot_2022-06-08_21-02-54.png

21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are the settings hidden when "enable joystick" is disabled?
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> yes
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm. it seems the movement box doesn't only contain movement stuff
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe move the non-movement stuff into "view" or something, and put it into the movement tab? or directly below it
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> vanilla puts mouse into a different box
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> so the order is mouse, joystick, movement
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds good to me as well
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beautemps> Hello pros! i've a question for u.
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beautemps> I can't see any animations in game for a while already and it prevents me from playing maps with moving tiles on kog (quads are visible but static) anyone knows how i can fix it ?
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <T tee> press pagedown on your keyboard
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beautemps> wut? pagedown makes the bg disappear
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beautemps> i see all the design, just not moving along with the envelopes
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <T tee> wait lemme see
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <T tee> are you on a map rn?
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beautemps> i'm not ig atm :/
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> On nightly?
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <T tee> then just press pageup whenever you're connected again, the reason is prob because you disabled quads which are used for the background, but also for the visual of the moving tiles
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beautemps> i think so, not sure ðŸ˜¦
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beautemps> i'll do so asap thx
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> If they are static it sounds like a different bug. Maybe try disable nightly or vice versa
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beautemps> how can i ?
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beautemps> nvm guys, steam fixed that on its own o/
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beautemps> thx for your answer!
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <T tee> nice ^^
