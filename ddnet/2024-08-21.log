03:15 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Going to give a shot at extracting data from maps and apply it to my editor
03:15 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Is this fine or do we have a better article?
03:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But he doesn’t. So many ugly skins in the db.

03:18 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Found this one as well 😄
03:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> When turn off vpn bans?
03:25 < bridge> <cellegenrih> When people stop using it for ban evading
03:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have a different proposal for fixing ban evading
03:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Stop banning people.
03:26 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :kek: no bans = no ban evasion
03:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ez
03:26 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :greenthing:
03:26 < bridge> <totar> stop using ips for bans :)
03:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s not okay that people get false positive vpn bans on a daily basis
03:28 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Well, I would use Cloudflare WARP to mask my IP, even if it only does little security for me, I don't think using VPNs for country restriction purposes will go a long way
03:28 < bridge> <cellegenrih> for the avarage gamer, vpn is useless, as in it only add ping delay

08:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> please Open a ban-appeal at #✉-create-a-ticket
08:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Which client are you using @dieses ?
08:31 < bridge> <dieses> steam
08:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Weird
08:33 < bridge> <dieses> what should I do?
08:33 < bridge> <dieses> I want to play
08:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What melon said
08:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Did you create a ticket?
08:34 < bridge> <dieses> yes
08:34 < bridge> <dieses> you were banned by antibot, pretty sure it is right 99.9% of times, just wait for the ban to expire and don’t use bot clients again, thank you!
08:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Then you have to wait for a response. In the meantime you can play on servers where you are not banned
08:35 < bridge> <dieses> I'm banned on all servers
08:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Only ddnet servers
08:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Add ddnet to the exclude filter
08:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I recently let my brother play this amazing game. But when I got home my account had been banned until February 21st. My brother said he didn't know why this happened. Until I found out he started  using cheat client. I'm sorry for what happened, but please release my account again. I really like this game, and I didn't want to be without playing it for so long. I promise this will never happen again
08:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So the admin said the ban is deserved and you say you did not bot?
08:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @milkeeycat: what’s that message? Xd
08:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: true story
08:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: ill try to connect dummy to ddnet server soon :DDDD
08:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Looks like a repost
08:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: ill try to connect a tee to ddnet server soon :DDDD
08:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wat dummy
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> A
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nice
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im also close
08:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i just need if statements xd
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Hit another Huffman error so maybe this year
08:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> That Response is very unlikely, i'm sadly not home - if you Use the Steam/Website Version its 100% a false positive by the antibot and needs to be checked. If you Just created a Ticket you might want to create an Admin Mail to get this doublechecked at #✉-create-a-ticket sorry for the inconvenience!
08:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> wait, do you need floats for huffman?
08:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Who said that?
08:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No don’t worry
08:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> hell yeah
08:39 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Fuxk floats
08:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Only used for tunes and physics as far as I remember
08:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @dieses: did you find a server to play on?
08:41 < bridge> <dieses> yes
08:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Nice
08:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Then you can game there until a admin looks at your ticket :)
08:41 < bridge> <fokkonaut> why
08:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Floats hard
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Can’t even ==
08:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> I recommend chillers Block Servers to beat up some greenswards!
08:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> true
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk how IEe155 float spec works
08:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> well u can ==
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Floats are causing many bugs
08:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> but i agree
08:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If I would built a game it would use no floats
08:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xD
08:59 < bridge> <learath2> That’s not how this works mr new mod 🙃
09:02 < bridge> <learath2> IEEE754
09:02 < bridge> <meloƞ> :angy:
09:53 < bridge> <teero777> Can ==(int)(f*x)
09:54 < bridge> <teero777> or abs(f0-f1)<1e-6
09:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Can we have `==` for floats?
09:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> We already have `==`  for floats at home
09:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> `==`  for floats at home: `abs(f0-f1)<1e-6`
09:58 < bridge> <teero777> *std::fabs
10:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Two ppl banned for botting?
10:13 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What’s going on here
10:13 < bridge> <tsfreddie> have you as well
10:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> My bot is undetectable
10:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> send
10:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It sends I-am-not-a-bot@ddnet.org net message
10:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> oh wait, don't send. i don't want german spy software
10:14 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Can’t be banned

10:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no need for bulgarian/romanian servers then. we can't do anything against DoS

11:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> huh, I met the author of the article before 😮
11:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's "memory training" or "A20"?
11:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> never seen financial ascii art before xd
11:51 < bridge> <murpi> Saw the article on the frontpage of hackernews today 👀
11:52 < bridge> <learath2> As in ram memory training? It's the process where the motherboard tests the ram to adjust timings
11:54 < bridge> <learath2> Especially noticable when you have a large amount of ram. My 64gigs took almost 2 minutes on a completely black screen. Very scary when you've just put together your computer 😄
11:56 < bridge> <learath2> A20 idk, a quick google suggests it might refer to address line 20 of a cpu
11:56 < bridge> <learath2> A20 idk, a quick google suggests it might refer to address line 20 of the system bus
11:59 < bridge> <learath2> Huh, TIL A20 is a very curious artifact of the past https://wiki.osdev.org/A20_Line

13:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> yep, in ddr5 it does it a lot
13:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> esp if u have oc ram
13:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> mine does it from time to time
13:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> to adjust timings xd
13:21 < bridge> <learath2> Funnily enough it used to be a huge thing early on in ddr1 because we weren't very good at producing high precision circuits yet, now it's a thing again because the timings have become insane
13:21 < bridge> <learath2> The speeds ddr5 memory run at require insane tolerances if there wasn't training
13:23 < bridge> <learath2> (fwiw I'm not saying ddr3/4 wasn't doing training)

13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i also have 64gb ram xd
13:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2 sticks tho
13:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2x32 6000mhz
13:26 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah but 64 gigs of ddr3/4 would train faster, the tolerances were tight but easier to meet, so it didn't train as long before finding good values

14:35 < bridge> <learath2> A raymarched planar wave, that I didn't colorize/light properly yet but it's interesting 😄
14:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> looks cool
14:46 < bridge> <learath2> WOOOO arrays
14:46 < bridge> <learath2> Now do array of structs
14:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> IN THEORY it should work
14:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but i can feel it will break in 50 places
14:47 < bridge> <learath2> Do you pad your structs to their alignment?
14:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> no idea wat padding you're taking about xdd
14:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i pad only fields in structs
14:49 < bridge> <learath2> You need to add trailing padding to structs so they are properly aligned in arrays
14:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> not again :pepeW:
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> E.g. first member of the struct requires 16 byte alignment, but you only have 24 bytes in your struct. Now you need to pad the end so the next struct in the array can have its first member aligned properly too
14:52 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> @milkeeycat could you explain a little bit about the language? (does it use llvm, lexer? pasrser? and stuff like that)
14:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i made an array of structs(they don't have padding) assigned value to first struct and it didn't even segfault
14:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> life is good
14:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> no llvm(bloated), i wrote everything myself, so it's buggy as hell
14:53 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :O
14:53 < bridge> <learath2> Not the assembler. When milkasm?
