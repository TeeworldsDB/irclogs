00:09 <@heinrich5991> Muttballs: I'm on it
00:11 <@heinrich5991> Muttballs: ?
00:17 < xRoThx> o_be_one:  Tu es la? 
00:18 < xRoThx> deen:  What do you think about that one? https://www.roxservers.com/dedicatedservers.php 
00:19 <@deen> what for?
00:20 < xRoThx> I am searching for a host that can not get downed 
00:20 < xRoThx> nfo went down 1 time. I think that is something pretty bad.. 
00:20 <@deen> when did it go down?
00:20 <@deen> you mean ddos?
00:21 <@deen> nfo is the best server we've ever had, please don't just change to another hoster^^
00:21 <@deen> if you want to know whether they will stay up, ask them if they can deal with 40 gbit/s ddos attacks
00:21 < xRoThx> Won't 'just' change
00:22 < xRoThx> ok
00:22 <@deen> and actually deal, not like OVH
00:22 < xRoThx> :P 
00:22 <@deen> at OVH the server stays "up" but you can't reach it anyway...
00:22 <@deen> roxservers is just an OVH reseller
00:22 <@deen> so they won't be better than OVH
00:22 < xRoThx> oh.. ok
00:23 <@deen> at least their own server runs at OVH
00:23 < xRoThx> How do you see that so fast? 
00:23 < xRoThx> lol
00:23 < xRoThx> oh ok
00:23 <@deen> i looked at their ip and made a whois request
00:23 <@deen> most "ddos safe" servers in france are ovh resellers
00:24 <@deen> i don't think you will find good ddos protection for < 400 € / month
00:24 < xRoThx> So most safe option for Europe would be a load balancing between a couple nfo servers? 
00:25 < xRoThx> If one goes down the other takes it over
00:25 <@deen> that would do no good
00:25 <@deen> also nfoservers is apparently bad now if you buy a new server
00:26 <@deen> QshaR bought one, and the players get very bad routing, while the routing to ddnet GER is great
00:26 <@deen> the ddosers would just need to send 40 gbit/s to each server for a few seconds, and they're all down
00:27 < xRoThx> Hm
00:27 < xRoThx> So no good 'n safe solution possible then?
00:28 <@deen> i had a few hosters that MAY have good protection
00:28 <@deen> they are behind link11, and it's supposed to be one of the best anti-ddos solutions
00:28 <@deen> but the admins were kids and the servers lagged
00:29 <@deen> also, you won't get out of the contracts. it's all in german and complicated. luckily i found a hole in the contract to get out :P
00:29 < xRoThx> Haha
00:30 < xRoThx> Ok
00:30 <@deen> there was one nice hoster i had in mind
00:30 < xRoThx> What one?
00:30 <@deen> but 200 € registration fee
00:30 <@deen> i'm trying to remember^^
00:30 < xRoThx> 200€ setup? :P ^^
00:30 < xRoThx> lol
00:31 <@deen> http://www.g-portal.de/rootserver/intel-x-mas/
00:31 <@deen> yes
00:31 <@deen> i think i showed you before
00:31 <@deen> nice dedicated server for 40 € / month
00:32 < xRoThx> indeed
00:32 < xRoThx> Seems too good to be true
00:33 <@deen> also, they have the lowest ping in germany
00:33 < xRoThx> setup 149 :P 
00:33 < xRoThx> lmao
00:33 <@deen> exactly
00:33 < xRoThx> Who does actualy pay that? 
00:34 <@deen> they give 0 ddos protection guarantees (well, who does?)
00:34 < xRoThx> Hm
00:34 < xRoThx> Rent to own package
00:34 < xRoThx> after 18months the server is yours :D
00:36 < xRoThx> Isn't it possible to negotiate about the setup fee with them? 
00:36 <@deen> i doubt they're better than nfoservers
00:36 <@deen> people in their forum complain about ddos attacks
00:36 < xRoThx> oh..
00:37 < xRoThx> @ nfo I only find people saying that they had ddos attacks & that they stoped with nfo servers
00:37 <@deen> yes
00:37 <@deen> nfo is great
00:37 <@deen> i guess no small hoster gets big attacks, so they're fine
00:38 < xRoThx> I found them by searching for the best GameServer Provider & to see if they have vps's
00:39 < xRoThx> maybe I should search for it again
00:39 < xRoThx> might find another good one
00:39 < xRoThx> Just need to be sure that 40gbps wont be a problem.. 
00:39 < xRoThx> because now its 40, in a couple months they ll have 60 or so
00:39 < xRoThx> it will keep on growing
00:41 <@deen> yeah
00:42 <@deen> these 2 would be fine for example, but way too expensive: http://www.link11.de/ https://www.voxility.com/
00:44 < eeeee> "fine" as in they can actually receive 40gbps or the bad packets will somehow get automagically filtered upstream?
00:47 < xRoThx> deen:  Will speak with a partner
00:48 < xRoThx> He does colocation for his servers
00:48 < xRoThx> He is firewall certified watchguard firewal expert or something like that
00:48 < xRoThx> At this moment he is offering me a month a server in Groningen (NL) and he will be configuring the Firewall for safety
00:49 < xRoThx> He also uses a couple other datacenters but he searhes something in Germany, I might be able to convince him to go here? ^^ http://www.link11.de/en/products/server_housing_colocation.html
00:52 < eeeee> firewall expert, wow
00:54 < xRoThx> Not that special I guess, but might be useful :)
01:00 < xRoThx> Good  Night All
01:04 <@deen> good night, xRoThx 
10:40 < Muttley> deen, what provider was xRoThx talking about
10:41 < Muttley> we are one of the 2 providers hosting in groningen
10:41 < Muttley> ;-)
11:28 <@deen> i don't know^^
12:09 < Nimda> ThereIsNoTruth by [SN] Snoop! & Chill [TD] just released on Moderate at 2015-02-05 12:07
15:29 < Nimda> Introduction by Themix just released on Novice at 2015-02-05 15:26
16:11 < o_be_one> deen, OVH has other ddos protections ... i use some of them
16:12 < o_be_one> voxibility is open to deal
16:16 < EastBite> o_be_one: something new?
16:31 <@deen> hm
16:31 <@deen> i was thinking about running KoG Gores in all ddnet locations
16:31 <@deen> but now I'm against it
16:31 < EastBite> kog gores = the map?
16:32 <@deen> no
16:32 <@deen> the servers
16:32 <@deen> http://www.qshar.com/
16:32 < o_be_one> EastBite, cloud hosting
16:33 < BeaR_> hall of shame ^^
16:33 < EastBite> deen: so what changed your mind?
16:34 < EastBite> didn't know kog is such an infrastructure
16:34 < o_be_one> what the difference with sqhar oO ?
16:34 <@deen> EastBite: it's so much work, i have to shut down a few ddnet servers for it, they don't have many players, their admin would have access to all ddnet servers, some of their philosophy
16:35 < EastBite> well the last point is invalid
16:35 <@deen> why?
16:35 < EastBite> access to ddnet srv administration?!
16:36 < EastBite> or do you mean just their servers
16:36 <@deen> i mean to the vps's we have
16:36 < EastBite> yea why would you do that
16:36 <@deen> so they can run their own servers
16:37 < EastBite> then they should use their own vps
16:37 <@deen> their server lags
16:37 < EastBite> tell them to use nfoservers^^
16:37 <@deen> they did, and nfoservers has worse routing now
16:37 < EastBite> huh?
16:39 <@deen> well, now I'm getting threats that if we ever run gores servers they "will be angry"
16:39 < EastBite> but ddnet works still fine right?
16:39 <@deen> yes
16:39 <@deen> only if you buy a new vps it lags
16:39 < EastBite> interesting
16:39 < EastBite> so why did I tell everyone to use nfoservers...
16:39 <@deen> haha
16:39 <@deen> maybe it's just KoG/qshar who have this problem, no idea
16:39 < EastBite> I bet xrothx uses some kind of vip version
16:39 <@deen> I'm not going to buy a new server to test
16:40 < EastBite> well if they don't want ddnet to host gores, I would rather accept it
16:40 <@deen> why?
16:40 <@deen> we have always hosted gores maps
16:41 < EastBite> because of the incoming attacks when other tw hosters get mad
16:41 < EastBite> not sure, afk
16:42 <@deen> well, i won't abandon 7 months old plans because suddenly someone decides to ddos us if we implement them
16:43 < BeaR_> ppl would really ddos because they host some maps? ..
16:43 <@deen> yes, we get ddos attacks all the time because we host blmapv3
16:44 < BeaR_> tbh never heard of ddosing vanilla servers in the last 5 years lol
16:45 <@deen> gores and block are very different from vanilla
16:45 <@deen> many people sit on gores/block servers all day, not doing anything
16:45 < Learath2> the communities are different
16:45 < BeaR_> yeah already had this feeling when I read the discussion on the ddnet forum .-.
16:46 < Learath2> oh no deen dont anger the russians please
16:50 < BeaR_> deen: there is already a release date for nim 1.0 ?
16:51 <@deen> BeaR_: no realistic one i might say
16:51 <@deen> release was planned for 31 December 2014
16:51 <@deen> then moved to "a few months later"
16:51 < BeaR_> is the feature set already complete ?
16:51 <@deen> yes
16:52 < BeaR_> ah ok
16:52 <@deen> it's just a lot of work for 1 guy
16:52 <@deen> araq is basically the only one working on the compiler right now =/
16:52 <@deen> Ah well
16:52 <@deen> 2 things still missing for 1.0: https://github.com/Araq/Nim/wiki/Roadmap
16:53 < BeaR_> was going to start learning a bit nim but was a bit unsure as I saw the amount of changes in Rust /:
16:53 <@deen> yeah, the changes in rust are crazy
16:53 <@deen> i can take 3 year old nim code and convert it to current one easily
16:53 < BeaR_> still not 100% happy with the syntax ):
16:53 <@deen> nim syntax?
16:53 < BeaR_> nah speaking of rust ^^
16:54 <@deen> yeah, the rust people do not care about syntax at all
16:54 <@deen> and they actually say so
16:54 <@deen> i think syntax is very important (other things too of course)
16:54 <@deen> BeaR_: become a nim gsoc student!
16:55 < o_be_one> what is nim ?
16:55 <@deen> https://github.com/Araq/Nim/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas
16:55 <@deen> http://nim-lang.org/
16:55 <@deen> BeaR_: says something about syntax here: http://www.steveklabnik.com/fosdem2015/
16:55 <@deen> "The semantics is the interesting part. The syntax is, really, about the last concern."
16:56 < o_be_one> Oo
16:56 < o_be_one> what this shit
16:56 < o_be_one> is it a bam equiv ?
16:56 <@deen> no, a programming language
16:57 < o_be_one> new one ?
16:57 <@deen> at least less than 10 years old
16:57 < o_be_one> lol and who use it ?
16:57 <@deen> me
16:57 < o_be_one> for ddnet oO ?
16:57 <@deen> a bit too, yes
16:59 <@deen> the code to update http map downloads in Nim: https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/nim-scripts/mapdl.nim
17:00 <@deen> BeaR_: actually one of my main concerns with rust is the compile time
17:00 <@deen> it's incredible. i tried to compile rust from source once and stopped after an hour or so
17:01 <@deen> while nim compiles in just a few minutes
17:01 <@deen> same for compiling programs, 0.3 seconds in Nim, 8 seconds in Rust (for something hello-world like)
17:02 <@deen> o_be_one: i'm also a contributor to Nim :P
17:07 < Learath2> deen: did you release the map download stuff yet ?
17:09 <@deen> Learath2: no, it needs to work without external libraries on linux and mac
17:09 <@deen> i guess i need to build static libcurl on them
17:10 < Learath2> werenyt we going to staticly link them
17:10 < Learath2> well i dont have access to those platforms so
17:10 <@deen> yes, exactly
17:10 <@deen> i have access, i'll do it the same way as with opus
17:10 < BeaR_> deen: yeah saw that post on reddit ^^
17:10 <@deen> actually, let me do that right now
17:10 < BeaR_> hah yeah compiling rust itself took ages ..
17:11 < BeaR_> not sure if you also have to compile llvm itself
17:11 <@deen> nim compiles so quickly i can use it instead of shell scripts :P : http://hookrace.net/blog/what-makes-nim-practical/#use-as-a-scripting-language
17:12 < BeaR_> hm interesting
17:15 <@deen> we still need a googler to vouch for Nim so we can get into GSoC =/
17:18 < BeaR_> debugging nim code requires gdb? Or can it ouput debug information also in other formats?
17:18 <@deen> what do you mean?
17:19 < BeaR_> mainly asking for debugging on windows
17:19 <@deen> if you want to use a debugger, any that works with C code should work with Nim
17:19 < BeaR_> msys is rather annoying /:
17:19 <@deen> also, nim has an included debugger of its own, but afaik it's currently broken
17:21 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went down!
17:22 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went back online!
17:24 < BeaR_> deen: can I switch the code generation backend from gcc to visual studio ?
17:24 <@deen> yes
17:26 < BeaR_> how ^^
17:26 <@deen> nim c --cc:vcc myFile
17:26 <@deen> or just edit the $NIMDIR/config/nim.cfg, it has a cc = gcc line at the top
17:26 < BeaR_> nice thanks
17:27 <@deen> i don't know how well vcc works, never tried nim on windows^^
17:27 < BeaR_> couldn't find this in the option list /:
17:27 <@deen> yeah, documentation really needs to be improved
17:28 < BeaR_> (windows editor still doesn't support linux line-endings)
17:29 < Learath2> BeaR_: i use mingw gdb on windows
17:29 <@deen> ouch. luckily nim doesn't care about line-endings
17:30 < BeaR_> Learath2: yeah but it's really annoying to use imho
17:30 < BeaR_> still waiting for clang and lldb /:
17:31 < Learath2> well cant comment much more on that as i only used msys and gdb 
17:33 <@deen> Learath2: we need all of these dlls on windows? =/
17:33 <@deen> curl.lib  libcurl.dll  libeay32.dll  libidn-11.dll  ssleay32.dll  zlib1.dll
17:33 < BeaR_> meh vcc throws me an unhandled exception and clang missing the include files (as usual) /:
17:34 < BeaR_> deen: yeah I think so
17:34 <@deen> BeaR_: doesn't sound like fun. it's easiest to just use the nim installer, which comes with mingw^^
17:35 < BeaR_> deen: yeah but I want to try debugging with visual studio ^^
17:35 <@deen> okok
17:39 <@deen> BeaR_: you can try askin on #nim too or in the forum, maybe they know how to get vcc running =/
17:41 < BeaR_> deen: found the solution, needed to setup the visual studio build environment ^^
17:44 < BeaR_> well ended up in an assertion /:
17:47 <@deen> anyone want to build 64bit opus libraries for windows?^^
17:48 < BeaR_> deen: I can try
17:49 <@deen> because that's the only reason ddnet doesn't build on win64 right now
17:50 < BeaR_> deen: where is the code located?
17:51 <@deen> opus sourcecode?
17:51 < BeaR_> y
17:52 <@deen> libogg from here: https://www.xiph.org/downloads/
17:52 <@deen> libopus and libopusfile from here: http://www.opus-codec.org/downloads/

17:56 <@deen> also, i don't have a 64bit windows vm to build^^
17:57 < BeaR_> xd
17:57 <@deen> but sometimes people try to compile ddnet client on 64bit windows and wonder why it's not working
17:59 <@deen> woohoo, looks like it built on first try!
18:07 < Learath2> could actually update the libcurl version
18:08 < Learath2> deen: i think we should update it the one i added is quite old
18:08 <@deen> Learath2: where to get it?
18:09 < Learath2> http://curl.haxx.se/download.html
18:09 <@deen> there are so many?!
18:09 <@deen> which?^^
18:10 < Learath2> let me gaze at it for a bit
18:15 < Learath2> deen: eh all these look so cluttered 
18:16 <@deen> Learath2: yeah, where's yours?^^
18:16 < Learath2> not like we need ssh and rmtp and sspi and stuff

18:16 < Learath2> yeah let me ask fisted where he got it :D 
18:20 <@deen> why does my mac vm need 2 GB RAM...
18:20 <@deen> debian ones are fine with 200 MB, so much nicer to compile
18:21 <@deen> maybe i should disable the GUI
18:23 < Learath2> deen: where did you get libcurl.a 
18:25 <@deen> i build them myself
18:25 <@deen> afk
18:32 < Learath2> so if i understood correctly you are statically linking for linux and dynamically for windows
19:20 < o_be_one> deen, oh good to know about nim contribution :p
19:20 < BeaR_> hm looks like they used mingw cross compilation toolchain to build the binarys
19:20 < BeaR_> ies*
19:21 < BeaR_> visual studio solution is only for statically linked libs ..
19:23 <@deen> Learath2: yeah, i don't remember why^^
19:24 <@deen> i think because it's easier to just add a dll on windows
19:24 <@deen> now i need to get the mac build working
19:27 < Learath2> deen: i can build a updated version of it for windows but you'd have to do it for other os's or we could use the cluttered mess and see if it works when we remove the useless dll files :D
19:27 <@deen> cluttered mess?
19:28 <@deen> what useless dll files?
19:28 <@deen> build a dll or static version?
19:29 < Learath2> there is a  build with RTMP SSH2 SSPI and al that stuff 
19:29 <@deen> no, please no

19:39 <@deen> so we want to try static linking on win too?
19:39 <@deen> would this compile with visual studio?
19:39 < Learath2> this one is fine just dont copy over libssh2 and librtmp
19:39 <@deen> (that's another concern)
19:39 < Learath2> i just dropped in the replacement dlls from that zip 
19:39 <@deen> ah, dlls
19:39 <@deen> ok
19:40 <@deen> i don't like this whole linking stuff
19:40 <@deen> everyone should do it like nim, just get all the source code together and build into a binary without any dependencies
19:41 < Learath2> and for release you might want to get rid of fetcher.cpp:L112 the verbose output is crazy
19:41 <@deen> Learath2: that's win32, also have win64?
19:42 < Learath2> there is mingw64 not sure if that would run fine tho

19:54 < BeaR_> works on windows(vs)
19:54 < Learath2> works fine too 
19:54 <@deen> nice
19:54 < Learath2> deen: zbSkyCraft is missing from the http archive btw
19:55 <@deen> Learath2: right, these maps are in a separate directory

20:10 <@deen> but download with udp on android is the most terrible thing in the world
20:10 <@deen> because these phones are always connected over bad lines
20:11 < Learath2> who uses the android build anyways D:
20:12 <@deen> people who watch others playing
20:12 <@deen> i should probably get it into the appstore though for more users
20:12 <@deen> but I'm not a fan of appstores
20:13 <@deen> i put a lot of work into ddnet android

20:35 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #142: Use the new callback. Make sure filesize < INT_MAX. (DDRace64...pr_DoubleNoMore) http://git.io/bg1M
20:36 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #142: Use the new callback. Make sure filesize < INT_MAX. (DDRace64...pr_DoubleNoMore) http://git.io/bg1M
20:39 <@deen> Learath2: any more changes?
20:42 < eeeee> android has native apis for file download, but not sure if easy to use from c++
20:43 <@deen> yeah, not going to add anything, works perfectly without any changes with libcurl
20:44 < Learath2> there is only one line which concerns me client.cpp:2150
20:46 < Learath2> not sure how it can happen but if somehow you arrive there with a m_pMapdownloadTask but havent actually tried the http download you will fallback to gameserver
20:46 < Learath2> and thats not a major problem as the download would work fine
20:48 <@deen> ok
20:48 <@deen> well, now i have to get the updated curl version into android
20:48 <@deen> before your PR everything worked :P
20:49 < Learath2> eww sry :/
20:49 < Learath2> you could ifdef it 
20:49 <@deen> why?
20:49 <@deen> i thought it's important
20:49 <@deen> if we ifdef it we could just keep the old one :P
20:50 < Learath2> Its a off chance that it could affect teeworlds 
20:51 < Learath2> Would fail with big files
21:00 <@deen> ok, updating curl on android is tricky =/
21:06 <@deen> not nice to make a PR just when i wanted to release =/
21:06 <@deen> takes me 1 hour just to compile everything again
21:08 < Learath2> just discard it deen
21:09 < Learath2> not like we will get >= INT_MAX files 
21:11 <@deen> 4 GB map files?^^
21:11 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- force-pushed DDRace64 from 97562eb to 48525e4: http://git.io/-BwJ2w
21:12 <@deen> you can make it an ifdef for non-android
21:12 <@deen> or get the current libcurl an android working, i can't
21:12 < Learath2> let me push the other half deen
21:12 < Learath2> part that doesnt break everything :D
21:12 <@deen> ?
21:12 <@deen> i have to recompile again?
21:13 < Learath2> It works you can just release it as is 
21:13 < Learath2> nothing mission critical :D
21:13 < Learath2> i just got rid of the stupid doubles libcurl enforces
21:17 < o_be_one> deen, when you decided to add maple as mod ?
21:17 <@deen> o_be_one: no idea, 3 months ago?
21:17 < o_be_one> just to know what has changed cause u told me he doest some weird stuff sometime
21:18 < o_be_one> (im very tired thats why i write like a kid)
21:23 <@deen> anyone with windows here?
21:23 <@deen> i need someone to try out the autoupdate, i'm scared it will break
21:25 < o_be_one> let me a sec
21:26 <@deen> i just released it, if you start your client it should update
21:26 < o_be_one> im downloading it, im a work ^^
21:26 < o_be_one> its 3;26 pm here
21:26 <@deen> don't download 7.0
21:26 <@deen> get 6.6.8 and update to 7.0
21:27 < o_be_one> ive taken it on ddnet.tw, its 6.6.8
21:27 <@deen> yeah
21:27 <@deen> good
21:27 < o_be_one> updating
21:28 < o_be_one> updated to 7.0 automaticly
21:28 < o_be_one> what to try now ?
21:28 <@deen> go on a ddnet server
21:28 <@deen> and download a map
21:28 <@deen> if that works, it's fine
21:28 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
21:28 < o_be_one> downloaded withotu problem
21:28 <@deen> nice , thanks
21:29 < o_be_one> you're welcome
21:30 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
21:34 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
21:37 < o_be_one> deen, you removed the paypal donate button ?
21:37 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
21:40 <@deen> ddos on GER
21:51 <@deen> ddos on south africa
21:52 < Nimda> DDNet South Africa went down!
22:01 < Nimda> DDNet South Africa went back online!
22:18 < o_be_one> deen, why you dont use flattr ?
22:18 <@deen> oh, i added a few donation methods!
22:18 <@deen> flattr is one too, right?
22:19 < o_be_one> yes its cause ive seen gratipay
22:19 < o_be_one> i think that flattr is more used
22:24 <@deen> o_be_one: done, thanks
22:27 <@deen> wtf
22:27 <@deen> flattr has some really scary default settings...
22:27 <@deen> they make you automatically give money to every repository you star on github...
22:28 <@heinrich5991> their concept is that you spend a fixed amount per time interval and you decide how you distribute it
22:28 < EastBite> really?
22:28 <@deen> yes
22:28 <@heinrich5991> so it's not really "dangerous"
22:28 <@deen> they never asked me
22:28 <@deen> ah
22:38 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
22:40 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
22:44 < Nimda> DDNet South Africa went down!
22:45 <@deen> all ddos attacks btw
22:50 < eeeee> why would you ddos south africa
22:50 < eeeee> anyone else has servers there?
22:51 <@deen> nono, the european ddosers ddos us everywhere
22:51 < eeeee> doesn't make any sense
22:51 <@deen> because there are quite a few SA players
22:51 <@deen> they just want to destroy something
22:51 <@deen> sometimes they ddos the servers in a pattern
22:51 <@deen> on ddnet.tw/status from top to bottom, or reverse
22:52 <@deen> maybe just having ddnet.tw/status encourages ddos attacks
22:52 < EastBite> ^
22:52 <@deen> so nice to see how they go down
22:52 <@deen> must feel like a game
22:53 <@deen> so, move the top part of it to a private url?
22:53 <@deen> would be a shame
22:53 < eeeee> just add some fake servers pointing to govt ips
22:53 <@deen> since it's pretty nice to look at
22:53 <@deen> haha
22:54 < EastBite> deen: beside the ddosers and you, nobody is looking at it :P
22:54 <@deen> people at least look at it when the server goes down
22:54 <@deen> to see if it's just them
22:54 < Nimda> DDNet South Africa went back online!
22:54 < EastBite> if it's important for them, yes
22:56 <@deen> and they even tell me why it lags sometimes
22:56 <@deen> like "RUS started lagging, i looked at ddnet.tw/status and RAM was 100%"
22:56 < EastBite> k
23:01 < o_be_one> ahahah eeeee i'm absolutely fan or your excellent idea about gvt status :p
23:15 <@deen> people do download a lot of maps with ddnet client it turns out
23:15 <@deen> 500 maps in less than 2 hours since release of 7.0
23:21 < o_be_one> woaw!
23:39 < eeeee> gj Learath2 ^
23:41 <@deen> no complaints so far about the map downloader not working!
23:41 <@deen> that's a major success i'd say
23:44 < Learath2> was thinking if there is anyway of breaking the map download 
23:44 < Learath2> with the mapname
23:44 < Learath2> nothing exploitable but might fail with some names
23:51 < lan> libidn missing when i tried to use ddnet client
23:51 <@deen> lan: on linux?
23:51 < lan> win7
23:51 <@deen> huh?
23:52 <@deen> how did you install it?
23:52 < lan> download zip
23:52 < lan> http://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-7.0-win32.zip from here
23:53 <@deen> oh wow
23:53 <@deen> that's definitely broken, damn
23:54 < lan> yay found a bug!
23:55 < lan> ill try older version
23:55 <@deen> yeah, get an older version and auto-update
23:55 <@deen> that works
23:55 <@deen> i'll fix it in 10 minutes
