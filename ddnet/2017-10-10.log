18:44 <+c0d3d3v> Can someone link me to the issue, that is about spam (cheat) vote kick. I saw a player today using a bot to vote kick players. In a way, that a mass of bots (dummys) join the game and instant vote (for an open vote).  And their votes were counted. Why is this posible, is there not a vote protection for 1 or 2 min.?
18:45 <+c0d3d3v> The player said "dnsbl" should be a keyword.
18:51 <+Learath2> c0d3d3v: No issue, the player is vali, dnsbl is not accurate enough to use on all servers
18:53 <+Learath2> already working on a fix
19:02 <+c0d3d3v> Yes, he is vali. Thank you. But why is it even possible? Can you give a short explanation. I thought you need to be a few seconds on the server to be able to vote. Why are his dummys instant able to vote?
19:05 <+Learath2> c0d3d3v: you don't need to be on the server any amount of time to vote, that's the issue :D
19:08 <+c0d3d3v> Ah ok, thank you!
21:12 <+Learath2> c0d3d3v: actually I wouldn't mind if you wanted to code that :P
21:15 <@heinrich5991> hm
21:17 <@heinrich5991> not sure if that fixes something
21:18 <@heinrich5991> one could disallow participating in votes that started before you joined
21:18 <+Henningstone> one could also join the dummies before starting the vote
21:18 <@heinrich5991> one could also join the dummies 2min before the vote
21:21 <+eeeee> what if you could only vote if the race timer has started for you (you've passed the noob filter)?
21:21 <@heinrich5991> heh
21:21 <@heinrich5991> I know the perfect blocking spot
21:22 <@heinrich5991> but yea, that might work as a captcha ^^
21:22 <+eeeee> hotfix it to add a solo?
21:23 <+eeeee> otoh captcha has to be dynamic to really be effective
21:23 <+eeeee> dynamic noob filters anyone?
21:23 <@heinrich5991> well, we could wait until they code such a replay feature :)
21:23 <@heinrich5991> would be nice to look at, a horde of zombies doign a noob filter
21:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> make google recaptcha
21:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> "im not a robot"
21:24 <@heinrich5991> more annoying for normal people than for bots
21:24 <+eeeee> that's been hacked: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsF7enQY8uI
21:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I see! Vali would have similar thing
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> for his bots, like 10 robots
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> on the table ðŸ˜„
21:49 <+Learath2> send a random math question to everyone who connects, cant vote until you answer it
21:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> calculate the integral
21:51 <+Learath2> prove that all non trivial zeroes of the riemann zeta function lay on the line Re(z) = 1/2
21:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> 1=0
21:54 <+eeeee> considering the teeworlds demographic, i'd say it's safe to ban anyone who answers a math question correctly since it's a bot more likely than not
21:55 <+Learath2> ouch
21:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> disbale vote at all!
21:55 <+eeeee> most people i see can't even figure out how voting works (at least on ctf5 servers i play)
22:02 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> does anyone know why the delay between a player being able to fire (equivalent of yellow hookcoll-line) and actually firing tends to cluster around increments of 20000 Âµs
22:02 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/367401411748691968/Untitled.png
22:02 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> and why it only shows this pattern for most players
22:02 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> not all
22:02 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> 20'000Âµs = 20ms = 1 tick in a 50hz environment
22:02 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I guess
22:02 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> ahh that makes sense
22:03 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> any idea why this doesnt show  for everyone? i had assumed ticks were hardcoded the same way into every client
22:04 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ticks are serverside, you can only shoot in 20ms increments
22:04 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> actually, the world only changes every 20ms ^^
22:05 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> cool thanks so that definitely explains why most peoples lines look like this
22:05 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/367402274139668480/Screen_Shot_2017-10-10_at_3.04.49_PM.png
22:05 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> but what could cause this?
22:05 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/367402314383753227/Screen_Shot_2017-10-10_at_3.04.55_PM.png
22:05 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> where do you measure this?
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> https://github.com/nobody-mb/teeworlds-fng2-mod/blob/master/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L610
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> serverside?
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> its written to a file on line 396 and yes
22:06 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> that code was running on my openfng server for a few days to collect the data
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> this code should only run in 20ms intervals
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ah wait
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> OnDirectInput runs when the client input is received
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> it just keeps track of the start and end times and then records the difference when the player shoots at an enemy
22:07 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> ye
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> meaning that maybe the difference is in peoples clients? i use ddnet client and so do most other fng players
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> currently investigating
22:08 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> thx
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ok, the normal client only sends a player input every 40ms
22:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜®
22:11 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> (or if something relevant changed)
22:11 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @nobody-mb this suggests a modded client
22:12 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> vanilla only sends input every 40ms, and ddnet every 20?  :O
22:12 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> this makes sense because redx uses hclient and his line looks different
22:12 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/367404146338299914/Screen_Shot_2017-10-10_at_3.12.36_PM.png
22:13 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> no, both vanilla and ddnet send every 40ms, unless something changed
22:14 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> (then they send it up to every 20ms **I guess**, don't really understand the code)
22:14 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> hm thats interesting
22:15 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> where would i find info about how other clients send input
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> in their source code, I guess
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> src/engine/client/client.cpp, `SendInput`
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> Savander - heute um 21:55 Uhr
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> disbale vote at all!
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> 
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> +1
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> src/game/client/components/controls.cpp, `SnapInput`
22:16 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> these are interesting files in ddnet/vanilla
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I am curious, what does Snap mean?
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> snapshot
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like a saved version ?
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> like take a photo of a situation
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> the server sends world snapshots to the client
22:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so, the snapshot is always outdated? ðŸ˜®
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> by tick or something ?
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> in a sense
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> yeah i saw that yesterday too when i  was trying to make draw distance lower, the code makes it seem like some clients allow snapping and some dont?
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> and the client sends snapshots of the player input to the server, hence `SnapInput`
22:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> lowering the draw distance?
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> trying to break zoomhack
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> well
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> can't really do anything about that
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> why not?
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> decreasing the draw distance seemed to work
22:19 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> i had someone test
22:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes, but then you're interfering with dyncam, or with players moving fast into your direction
22:20 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> even if u only decrease it by a small amt?
22:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> well, matricks definitely knew about the problem, so he optimized it accordingly
22:21 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> eh fair enough, was just a test i was doing
22:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you could ask him about that ðŸ˜ƒ
22:22 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you could ask him about that ðŸ™‚
22:22 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> #teeworlds on irc.quakenet.org (IRC server)
22:23 <+eeeee> decreasing that distance doesn't sound like a good idea
22:23 <+eeeee> why would you want that? to save traffic?
22:23 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> to reduce the impact of clients that allow you to see beyond the normal radius
22:24 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> because people have been modifying ddnet to allow it to zoom in fng and i have no way to detect this so ^ i can only try to make it less effective
22:24 <+eeeee> i see, that's fair. but would require more heuristics to e.g. accomodate fast moving players (snap them if they're predicted to be in view in the next few ticks)
22:25 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> fast moving players and people with higher ping maybe? ill probably have to do something like this lol
22:26 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> does anyone know of a more reliable way to detect triggerbots than the thing i was trying to make? (measuring how consistent someones fire delay is)
22:27 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I like your research ðŸ˜ƒ
22:27 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I like your research ðŸ™‚
22:27 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> thx:D
