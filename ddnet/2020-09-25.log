00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i find it funny, ##C guys citing the standard like someone cites the bible

00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah, i must be rly bored to be reading this chat at 1230
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can cite the standard like that too
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i see ur a man of culture too
00:59 <+ChillerDragon> lmao
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :thonk:
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> woah
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758843861732163594/unknown.png
02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> a 4 year old change of mine caused it.
08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> @deen of course `reload` doesn't log out me, but i reboot server manually after server manipulations
08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> 
08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> my words sound stupidly, just thought that auto-login by server would be great
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @deen interesting but does not seems to be related. When I start glx_gears I can minimize it any amount of times and it will not hang and also it quits in instant. Also that mesa bug is fixed for that guy, but his factorio still hangs.
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ok, as it seems it only affects me. I will make a shortcut that will send couple of SIGKILLs to a process. I hope that will help it.
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> P.S. teeworlds use the same technologies I think (SDL + GL) but it exits nicely.
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> P.S. teeworlds uses the same technologies I think (SDL + GL) but it exits nicely.
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Anyway if it only affects me, consider it the lowest priority for now please. Happily I can debug most things with a 0.7 client.
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > my words sound stupidly, just thought that auto-login by server would be great
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I was thinking about how to make auto-login a safe way for such circumstances (you reload a server).
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I think that a solution would be to mimic a web world's think: cookies.
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> A client could store a blob of encrypted data that server pushes to him after a successful authentication and give a server next time before the auth.
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> That cookie could contain an encrypted client id, some random value to increase cryptography strength and a time when client authenticated last time. This way server don't have to store client sessions or any state on it as it can take it from a client and be sure it gets a valid one and check if it has to be expired.

09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Prevent cookie-stealing will be easier in tw world than in web. A cookie should be given only to the server which created it (as in web world), a client will check if that's a right server by it's ip. I think it will be sufficiently safe.
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> binding rcon_login (nice that we have such command) to a key is not safe. One accidentally could press it being on a malicious server
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> a simpler solution would be a server-based autologin, a list of commands that will execute once a client connects to a server
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> off course rcon_login is simpler than cookies, but if we would have a central auth system one could make a non-encrypted, but signed cookie from auth center that every server could check
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> off course rcon_login autologin script is simpler than cookies, but if we would have a central auth system one could make a non-encrypted, but signed cookie from auth center that every server could check to authenticate a non-admin user too
09:50 <+MalwareTele> hi
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> hi
09:57 <+MalwareTheTele> hi 
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Pure_luck Or set password in you config with `password <pw>` like I have - but the current problem is that this password is autofilled in textfield when you join pw-protected server, but you're still seeing the enter-password-box and have to hit enter to join, instead of joining immediately if the password is correct
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck my guess is that it might be related to the graphics things we do. You could bisect it if you really want to find the cause
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> also client does remember last-used-password, so on actual rejoin you don't have to re-type it, but still have to confirm that you want to join
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen could that ↑ be changed to immediate join?
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We intentionally don't do that because it was used to steal ddnet nuclear server passwords and leak our tournament maps
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> lol
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the problem is that client remembers `password`, then you join to another server and client automatically sends it
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and doing it only for localhost servers?
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u password localhost
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> So what is your setting on gfx_resizable then @gerdoe
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> that way it's your server anyway
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ryozuki because I don't want everyone to join it when it's registered, only the ppl I invite
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> So what is your setting on gfx_resizable then @Pure_luck
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and it's easier to register it & tell them to look for a server name than sending them ip
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just don't sv_register it and give people the ip? That's what I do
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @deen you mean git bisect? I could if that will help
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I just not sure if that's my desktop env-related or DDNet code related
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck Not sure about how important it is. Could be a driver bug on your side, could be a potential DDNet problem that only you notice
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so your choice
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Anyway it feels an easy task that I can do. I will bisect
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> oh.... OH
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I don't know why but it's closing instantly now for the first time
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> > So what is your setting on gfx_resizable then @Pure_luck
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Jupstar ✪
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Lol
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've added  gfx_resizable 0 but it's deleted from a config after I start DDNet and exit it
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> maybe it's deleting options with 0 value?
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yes default values
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> It's fine then
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> No, it's not affecting atm. I can set it to 0 or 1 and it doesn't make it freeze on exit
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I don't know the reason of it
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But our SDL code seems to break quite a lot of setups
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Next time DDNet will start freezing on exit I will bisect
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Leave it to zero tho
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> done
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> What setting will maximise the probability of a problem?
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I want to investigate next time
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > But our SDL code seems to break quite a lot of setups
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Then it's not just me. I will try bisect next time to get more info.
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Well setting it to one will cause minimize and maximize to send resize events. Which caused trouble on some de
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> oh... it's here again. I've switched to fullscreen
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Well on windows it doesn't seem to grab the window.. Different problem
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Though the last time it was there in a windowed mode too
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I hate so much that it grabs an input. I cannot make partial screenshots
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> even in windowed mode
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> any option to prevent it from grabbing an input?
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> also I would like to move a window to have more than one instance visible
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Dunno,  just don't hit the in game screen
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> You mean aim for the header?
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yes xd
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ok, it will be tricky to make DDNet to lose focus. But I will try
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I have stable freezes on exit now. Will bisect
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> gfx_resizable doesn't affect anything
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> gfx_resizable doesn't affect it
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> well... it simpler, I've deleted settings_ddnet.cfg and problem gone
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it's some setting in it
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will diff & bisect a config then
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's a V-sync option
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It doesn't make teeworlds hang when set
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> The problem was there at least 6 months ago
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> For some reason building older versions is failing now
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Any tips on what I am doing wrong?
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ```git checkout 12.0
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> cd build
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> cmake ..
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> make clean
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> make -j 12
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ```
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> result:
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ```error: ‘offset_ptr’ does not name a type; did you mean ‘offset_ptr32’?```
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Maybe I should use an older gcc version?
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> DDNet 11.0 builds ok, problem was there 2 years ago
11:03 <@deen> oh, I assumed it'sa new bug, too bad then
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Cannot build older versions. I have bam 0.4.0 but it seems that it need older SDL
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> anyway I can just uncheck V-Sync
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> My problem is solved and you have slightly more info on it. Thanks
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck We used to have inp_grab 0, but I think we removed that. I usually press F1 to lose focus, but then you can't screenshot still
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck so maybe it's just caused by SDL2? You could try DDNet from https://ddnet.tw/downloads which was the last SDL1.2 version
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> DDNet 9*
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> DDNet 9.3.1 still have this problem
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> both teeworlds 0.7 and 0.6 doesn't have it
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 8.1.1 has it too
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 6.6.8 has it
11:50 <@deen> so apparently it's something we've been doing differently for a while :D
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 4.8.4 does not have it
11:51 <@deen> this is becoming software archeology :D
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 4.8.4 doesn't have it
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 4.9.3 has it
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> no builds in between though
11:55 <@deen> Do you have fifo console turned on? that was added in 4.9
11:55 <@deen> [Client+Server] Threaded logger output for fewer lags could also be related
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> too bad there were no docker in 2014
11:56 <@deen> Oh, 4.9 switched to settings_ddnet.cfg, maybe it's just your settings that are wrong
11:56 <@deen> so 4.8 used Teeworlds' settings.cfg
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've check/uncheced V-sync in 4.8
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> just to be sure
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it's not fifo console, turned it off
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've check/uncheced V-sync in 4.8 and 4.9
11:59 <@deen> could be something else in settings, try removing settings_ddnet.cfg and replacing it with settings.cfg
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ok, so next time I will be in a mood for archeology I will make a docker image to build that
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I can remove all setting I guess
12:00 <@deen> that's not the same
12:00 <@deen> removing all will put them to ddnet defaults, using Teeworlds' settings.cfg will use Teeworlds' settings
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I need teeworlds06 settings right?
12:01 <@deen> no, the existing ones probably work
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> weird, removed all settings, then started teeworlds06 first, then ddnet 4.9 and now it exits properly regardless of V-Sync settings
12:02 <@deen> ha, so it's some setting!
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've removed old config :C
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> so I cannot tell what was wrong now
12:03 <@deen> should've told you to make a backup .D
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've thought about it
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but haven't enough patience to that moment 😄
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> weird that I've removed config before and it didn't helped
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> for some reason newer DDNet makes it with something in it that make it buggy
12:04 <@deen> that means we have some new default that causes the problem for you I guess
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will try to reproduce it
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Yeah! it's newer default
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> *defaults
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 4.9.4 made bad default too
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 4.9.3
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> oh noes
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 4.8.3 default are affected too
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> can someone give me their settings_ddnet.cfg?
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I think that archaeology will not give me any more info.
12:20 <+SnowFox> Hello world. I was casually looking at an Intel die and noticed... it looks like a DDNet map. Thoughts? The bottom section. https://techgage.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Intel-Xeon-E7-v2-Die.jpg
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Make this into a map pls
12:22 <+SnowFox> Almost tempting..
12:22 <+SnowFox> Learath2: so you see it too?
12:23 <+Learath2> yep def
12:25 <+SnowFox> Unsurprisingly, they have more maps. https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ivy-bridge-xeon-e7-v2.jpg
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> $decline too repetitive
12:27 <+SnowFox> Heh
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> This is infc_infiltration map
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> oh... liquidators
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/758998529502609428/Screenshot_from_2020-09-07_19-56-27.png
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Intel obviously stolen our design
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> intels is obviously superior, what is this single core, with non-local cache?
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> someone skipped their microprocessor design class
12:30 <+SnowFox> Meanwhile I wasn't looking for Intel. Looking for RISC-V dies.
12:31 <+SnowFox> Much better designs there
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish risc v would become more popular
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> x86 is just such an awful ISA
12:32 <+SnowFox> Everyone with a modern nVidia GPU has many RISC-V cores. Also lots of Western Digital SSDs and high speed NICs with builtin compute.
12:33 <+SnowFox> But yes, it'd be much better if we users could use it as our main desktops, laptops, servers, and phones. Not just as raspberry pi replacements. Though this is certainly nice too.
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, it's not too uncommon in high performance embedded applications
12:34 <+SnowFox> https://riscv.org/exchange/cores-socs/
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even ARM is a better ISA imho. x86 is just unreadable
12:35 <+SnowFox> better than x86**
12:35 <+SnowFox> x86 is just a nightmare
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it's not a bar too high 😄
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've heard someone told a guy who was defending x86 instruction set as "not as bad" that he has a Stockholm Syndrome
12:38 <+SnowFox> Sounds fair
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Even ARM is a better ISA imho. x86 is just unreadable
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eSAF_qT_FY
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this guy has great talks
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Christopher Domas  is god
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> x86 god xd
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR0nh-TdpVg
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this one is good too
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, the memory sinkhole 😄
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And he has a great one about fuzzing the ISA too iirc
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 thats the first i sent
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he found undocumentet instructions
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hardware backdoor
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It doesn't even matter as intel have IMU which is exactly that bad
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and afaik AMD have something like that too
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> also every modern cellular phone in the world have a separate linux machine in the communication modules which in fact manage consumer CPU and have full access to it's registeres and memory
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but you probably already knew about that
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it's not a backdoor, it's a main entry
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I prefer to look at this as user is using a backdoor to access "his" computer or phone which is not his
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u see the video?
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> no
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you should
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Is that about IMU or something else?
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this has nothing to do with mobile phones
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I mean I know that my system has IMU and this is separate computer that have access to everything in my system and I don't have acess to it
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> IMU is not about phones too
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but it resembles me of comm_cpu -> cpu relationship in mobile phones which is like that too
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont remember him saying anything about IMU
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is a different idea
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yeah right
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you rly should watch the video
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this guy is another thing
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> my point is if you have IMU you don't have to bother about security or privacy, you don't own the system
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "you dont have to bother"
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> weak mentality
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> shut down curiosity just because x exists
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki iirc he has another talk on just the fuzzing aspect
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yeah, if your system is designed to overcome your privacy then flaws in protection of security doesn't matter much
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> one thing is when a criminal beat you on the street, that should be dealed with as it's a crime
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> IME is one big conspiracy theory. I don't think it's likely that not one person leaked this secret entrance
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> if police do the same nothing you can do, that's the way your country works
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 he also made that compiler using only mov instructions iirc
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> so if you have IMU in your system, it doesn't matter much what other accidental treats to your privacy manufaturer has added
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> as he intentionally added a front-door
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a genius
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > IME is one big conspiracy theory. I don't think it's likely that not one person leaked this secret entrance
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 agree
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've made evolutionary programming once based on 1 instruction agents. It was fun
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Though I wasn't been able to replicate whitepaper results
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also this kind of veeery low level backdoor is hardly ever useful. You need an active attack as you neither have much processing power in these small cores nor do you have much storage to store the data you gather
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> mov + xor is not the same as "made from movs"
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's extremely hard to extract anything meaningful from the millions of instructions going through the multiple cores
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> millions or billions
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 are you serious? IME have it's separate access to network and you cannot firewall it on OS level. Time doesn't matter if something malicious and remote controlled will get into IMU code which is rather possible. Some manufacturers don't even lock IMU fw
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > It's extremely hard to extract anything meaningful from the millions of instructions going through the multiple cores
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> That's not the way hacking works I think.
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> IMU just can load any code to memory and tell CPU to run it.
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> IMU have full unrestricted access to CPU and memory and peripheral. See wiki link above
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can give you a couple million instructions I ran on my computer and you tell me what my password is
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and CPU cannot control it or even tell if IMU intervened it
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> why anyone wants your password?
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> if he have full access to your PC memory and CPU already
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It takes a very smart person to do anything with the instruction stream, or the memory
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> wdym? C++ exploits are not that smart. They just injects a payload and then CPU runs it
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yes it requires a hacker to be smarter than average person, right
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You inject the payload into the relevant application, you know the context
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When you are on such a low level, there is no context
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but you don't have to inspect instruction stream with IMU, you can just tell CPU run a payload
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What would you get the CPU to run?
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is no `do_steal_data` instruction there, nor any way for you to even refer to the data
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ok, I see. not a treat to you
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> *threat
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No concept of ATA, no concept of kernel, no concept of processes, nor memory mappings
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> a kernel module will be enough I guess
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You don't know where the kernel is, nor what kernel it is
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but it's nice that you feel safe
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> that's why IMU is not banned I think
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The concern with the IME is that it can't be audited, which leads to security vulns often
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> most people think that's it's safe to have a separate PC they don't control in their system with full access (even greater than supervisor has) to everything
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> most people think that's it's safe to have a separate CPU they don't control in their system with full access (even greater than supervisor has) to everything
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I don't know why this idea does not scare people
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> mostly I think it's because they think "I am a smart person and I would not write a hack for it in a month"
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you watch that talk ryozuki linked, the guy managed to get access even more complete than the IME. Yet he didn't create a practical attack with it, except for a couple toy examples
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> which leads them to think nobody can or will be interested
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yeah, all those vulnerabilities even meltdown ones are not too practical
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but having IMU in your system is a different thing, it's more like having a robot arm that can press keys on your keyboard to download and run anything it need
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but I see you don't think it's dangerous or practical
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Look, I'd prefer it if it wasn't there, but it's far beyond the capabilities of anyone that would care to hack me
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ok
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If a government level entity wants something from me, they can just send cops and given I'm not a CIA operative I'd tell them everything they want to know before they snap my arm off
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> IMU firmware can be updated from OS if it's not locked by manufacturer
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and it mostly is not locked
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it's not a gov thing
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://xkcd.com/538/
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yeah, universal argument on everything
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If such a backdoor is used by manufacturers, it would have been leaked. So if such a backdoor exists, it has to be available to a very small select group of people
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> anyway, I've shared my concerns to raise awareness. If you don't imagine how bad it is, then nothing I can do there
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> IME also has integrity checks, so not like you can goof around with it, it doesn't run anything intel doesn't sign
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 and these select master genious prob have the skill to hack u on a higher level easily too
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Again the concern is that it's not very secure. Many people bypassed the integrity check
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > IME also has integrity checks, so not like you can goof around with it, it doesn't run anything intel doesn't sign
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> There are articles on how poorly access control is implemented. Don't rely on those integrity checks.
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki yeah, it's far easier to just freeze the server/computer as is and extract the bytes of memory
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And I've read articles which show how easy to overcome most of countermeasures in IMU to use your firmware if it's not fully locked with fuses.
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Pure_luck I'm fairly certain not a single case of remote replacement of the IME firmware happened
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> All the attacks I've read required physical access
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> What do you mean by physical access?
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Firmware of IME is updated from OS, not by attaching wires to a chip.
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean having either access to a physical terminal that is already logged in as root, or a remote terminal logged in as root
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So if one compromise a system with not locked IMU and will infect it and lock it one will never know that it is still there running.
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see what you gain by replacing my ME firmware when you already have root
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A kernel patch/module is far more powerful than a ME firmware replacement
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Because if you infect IMU it will work even if you will wipe your OS and install another one.
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess, but I'd never know they got in either way. Not like I wipe my OS every day
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So not knowing that you're infected feels safe?
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though, if I was doing something VERY shady, like selling thermonuclear devices to the chinese, I'd use a riscv board
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make ur own cpu
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can, the riscv architecture is open
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ok, I see. You don't have anything to hide.
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's common I guess.
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's a common misconception
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Beats any talk about privacy all the time.
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not that I don't have anything to hide. It's that the things I want to hide are already secure from the people that'd want to get access to them.
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly do not believe that a single person/group powerful enough to have access to an IME 0day would use it to see what kind of porn I watch or my credit card details
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its more probs against goverments
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what trump does
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As I said, if I had something to hide that was actually this critical, I'd indeed use something much more secure than an off the shelf intel processor
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd probably use something like a c64 I guess
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u know if stallman said something about propietary hardware
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I heard him talk/write about free hardware, don't remember anything about proprietary hardware and it's evils specifically
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-hardware-designs.html
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ohh
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I'd encrypt everything on some old ass computer, only ever let already encrypted stuff on my insecure computer
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Thus, the concept we really need is that of a free hardware design.
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess riscv is good then
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the raspberry pi?
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love risc v, if only it had enough performance for desktop computing
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Raspi uses an arm core, haven't read much on the security of arm but it's definitely very proprietary hardware
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://ryf.fsf.org/
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hardware that respects ur freedom
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Freedom comes at the cost of performance in this decade, sadly 😦
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hardware-wise probably
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> software-wise maybe not
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Security vs convenience as usual
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not even stallman went full stallman iirc
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. I have not seen any "freedom oriented" wifi adapter that supports high performance 802.11k roaming
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So your very secure laptop will roam wifi like it's 2008
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think ISA doesn't matter all that much nowadays. Nearly no one writes in assembly, existing compilers do all the heavy lifting from software side. And on the hardware side something similar happened with translation of ISA to micro operations, so most of Intel's CPU engineers probably don't have to deal with x86-64. And the translation doesn't take that much space on the die.
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> One stallman at 99% of stallman is ok. But 1kk of 1% stallmans are much better.
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I just want people to shift their awareness and habbits a little bit.
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen but wouldn't it be nice to actually be able to reason about the assembly that's written? I think even the compilers would get much better with a clean ISA
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So next time they choose something they will +1% to probability to make a better choice towards individual and thus collective privacy.
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (except for sane guarantees like memory consistency)
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2  sure, but is it worth the effort of rewriting things?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen The compilers can do the heavy lifting in this case too
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, but considering how many x86-64 compilers there are, quite some work porting them all
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> how much?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and people using intrinsics for vectoring will have to rewrite too
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I think it's 4 of them in 99% of cases.
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah vectoring is a large concern
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think there needs to be some other factor to switch to another ISA, other than being "more sane"
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 what is vectoring?
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've seen a video. It's about rowhammer, right?
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've seen a start of a video. It's about rowhammer, right?
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen yeah, which is why I doubt we'll ever get a sane ISA
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ah i see
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is even motivation to stay with these arcane closed architectures for the current major vendors
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They get to hide their secrets in the massive mess that is x86/arm, they get to keep their advantage of being one of the few people to know how to implement these architectures
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> An open ISA with a fixed instruction length makes it trivial for new players to start working on designs
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No one can implement another x86 CPU anyway, only Intel, AMD and Via have the license
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Who even sold the license?
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Must have been some internal deal between these 3 companies
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oligopoly gang rise up
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I mean AMD was always Intel clone CPUs in the start, and Intel was happy to adopt their amd64
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> IA64 had some cute features
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes cute
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But backwards compatibility always wins
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> not always, it's actual only for some period
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Besides if IA64 had taken hold, we'd be in much worse shape with intel being a monopoly instead of there being an oligopoly
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> do you build for x86 now or have you dropped support?
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> An illusion of choice is better than no choice 😄
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Pure_luck we do for windows, not for linux iirc
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> are there many games with cpus w/o x64 support?
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u think if a new architecture was made nowadays would be faster or is there some kind of limit rn
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yeah, linux marketink politicy on x64 is weird
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yeah, linux marketing politicy on x64 is weird
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki Not by much, as deen said, translation is rarely ever a bottleneck
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A fixed length ISA does make it absolutely trivial to fetch an instruction though
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck we build for x86 still
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Currently fetching an x86 instruction is actually quite tough. You can take a look at Domas' talk on fuzzing, it shows how many disassemblers actually sometimes disagree on how a set of bytes should be disassembled
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With a fixed length, you just fetch e.g. 4 bytes and that's it
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is Moore's law true btw
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can even read simpler sections of PowerPC bytecode with just a table
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki depends on who you ask
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what does that mean
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never quite understood why they called it a "Law"
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Isn't it more like a hypothesis? Not like there is any proof for it
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The ones who are deep in the matter will see that some method is slowing down and can't scale into the future, so they assume moore's law will stop
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but some new technology often comes along and gives better scaling
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIG9ztQw2Gc
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (even with infinite precision, we can only etch transistors so fine before they start not behaving like transistors)
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The physical limits to transistor scaling have been reached due to source-to-drain leakage, limited gate metals and limited options for channel material. Other approaches are being investigated, which do not rely on physical scaling. These include the spin state of electron spintronics, tunnel junctions, and advanced confinement of channel materials via nano-wire geometry.[108] Spin-based logic and memory options are being developed activ
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So I guess if you think of a processor in the conventional way of an etched silicon die, I think we are doomed 😄
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> spin based logic
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gotta search what that is
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah its this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spintronics
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a rather tough problem to put binary logic in terms of electron spin though, so I wouldn't expect much to come of it for many years
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Jim Keller is such a good presenter
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What I find more interesting is how much more efficient you can make computation, might also correlate a bit with scaling CPUs further down. The currently known theoretical limit (Landauer's principle) says that only deleting bits has to cost, reversible calculations can be done for free. And we're still quite far from that limit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Biological computing research shows that biological material has superior information density and energy efficiency compared to silicon-based computing
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen though it is one massive challange to get close to these fundamental limits
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I sometimes wonder, how much more computation power do we realistically need
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 about law: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it makes sense to call it law
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by reading the first paragraph
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> atleast to me
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I thought predictions wouldn't constitute laws
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im still waiting for github to add dark mode
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder whats preventing them to do so
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh the dark mode userscript works great for me
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I kinda gave up on github ever adding one 😄
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Userscripts are great but I'd prefer discord to actually hide blocked user's messages from me without need to install greasemonkey in my browser.
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Just another justification to install greasemonkey ^ 😄
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really pray'd hard for discord to die off, but it just never did 😦
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now discord is one huge privacy violation
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Why? Discord is the best in terms of privacy. I can get here with VPN on and with all privacy scripts and not get banned.
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Imagine a company providing free communication, video/audio/text with servers all around the world, with barely any advertising at all. I wonder who is the product
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> People who cannot defend themselves. At least discords allow me to do that.
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> For example telegram and sky don't allow me.
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> *skype
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can try. You get to hide who you are from discord sure, but it doesn't really care who exactly are you
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> That's good?
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even the statistics are valuable
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Nice. At least this is the last place like that where one can enter without giving a mobile phone number.
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not only that, I've read a very interesting paper on analysis of writing patterns. They managed to identify the owners of completely anonymized chats in a pool of 1000 people with very good accuracy
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 10 bits of identifying information is not much
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and it's not related to discord
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> statistical attack on your wording style can be executed anywhere
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and there is no evidence discord is doing it and other don't
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Interesting that this much more common form of privacy breach is of no concern to you but a fringe IME attack with only a handful capable parties on earth concerns you?
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are one interesting person, I'll give you that
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck did your vpn get banned connecting to official ddnet game servers btw?
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> no
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But I don't play DDRace or block
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I play CTF and infClass only
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> IME is evil but if you use mainboard with non-Intel network card, IME has no access to network and becomes harmless
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > Interesting that this much more common form of privacy breach is of no concern to you
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It concerns me too.
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But there is a difference on impact: full control on my system and just 10 bits of identifying information that I have voluntary given.
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Comrade IME has control over memory and host CPU isn't it?
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I don't think it's harmless then.
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Comrade even very extended tests on the IME with a firewall inbetween didn't detect any traffic from it for years. If it is smuggling information out, it's doing it bits/bytes at a time, extracting the data at the hops, with major collaboration from thousands of providers
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's like having a brain parasite without access to moving a finger on your left foot then.
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it is harmless, because even with full memory access it can't do anything useful without crashing your OS
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Tell it to exploit writers all over the globe.
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> There are userspace exploits and kernel ones. And they work well.
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but IME firmware is almost always older then your kernel
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> exploits usually don't work this way
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but IME firmware is almost always older than your kernel
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Comrade you can mount active attacks with it, I've only read of one where they used an external computer to analyze the instruction stream and inject instructions to execute a kernel exploit
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've seen another one with writing memory markers into the ram, to extract information. Again required an external computer to do the analysis
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> external computer
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Ok, give me access to all IME in the world and given my morals will be ok with it I will find a way to make a framework to detect what kernel version runs on the host machine and to inject the right kernel module to it.
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> You only need to be motivated and a business plan to use it.
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I will give you access to a computer I'll connect to the network if you want
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Nothing impossible here.
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can have as much time as you want to exploit it
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will not gain from your computer.
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but nobody has remote access to your IME
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it's just locked down in your computer
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll put 1000e of bitcoins on it?
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But if I will be IME exploit writer I could think how to monetise so many backdoors.
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> You will not put them.
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Comrade if anyone does it's intel
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> Intel can magically bypass all those NATs and firewalls? 😄
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Comrade they can sneak in bits/bytes of information to it if providers cooperate
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> you think IME adds some additional data to your network traffic?
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't, but it's the only feasible way to mount this global conspiracy without a soul actually being able to prove it
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> IME is definitely a bad thing, but its offline version (consumer-grade hardware) can't be exploited without full access to the target computer
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> so exploiting IME is quite pointless
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Except for a backdoor you can persist over system reinstallations
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but you don't need IME for that 😄
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You could indeed flash the bios too
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> UEFI is far enough and easier to do such thing
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> some manufactures even do that
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> "legally" 😄
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but they don't care about Linux, so we are in safe
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I was thinking of hacking an iranian nuclear plant, I would probably look into an IME exploit though
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > Intel can magically bypass all those NATs and firewalls
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> why one needs to traversal nat for outbound connection?
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Firewalls would be the concern there
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> The spacing between rank time & skin is kinda small in cases of more players on server
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/759034035065978890/unknown.png
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You probably would never get an entire packet out of a properly configured network with a firewall
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> @Learath2 just do port scan of iranian IP ranges and use some SSH with default login 😄
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> or the time is off completely, not sure
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Soreu time looks completely off, I wonder what went wrong there
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Will investigate
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/759034286329430066/unknown.png
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> it's off also with less players actually
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Lol, sorry guys, but 0.7 teeworlds is affected by this mortning archaeological bug too 😄
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've deleted it's settings too and with defaults it's as buggy
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The fact that we are missing proper text centering is very sad
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to rene
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to render the text 4 times to get it center 😄
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> o.0
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> proper text rendering is always big fun 😄
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie 🌈 made a really nice rework for 0.7 which finally introduces proper text rendering to teeworlds
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> 💖
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I see the issue, huh how did that go unnoticed so long
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/759038145512603689/screenshot_2020-09-25_16-06-08.png
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is how it's supposed to look like I think
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (except the red rect I used for debugging)
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> how will it look with longer times?
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> like 100 or 1000 min?
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We reserve enough for `00:00:0`
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Always
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> At least ddnet is not crashes on 4-lines multiline broadcast ad 0.7 did.
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> *as
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think 0 is the widest digit
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> it looks to be set on left instead of middle, so one more digit should fit
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> don't enable ids in scoreboard :justatest:
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> why?
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol we reserve enough for 00:00:0 but we don't even format the times that way
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> haha
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We only do `%02d:%02d`
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should I add the hours while at it?
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess, wouldn't hurt
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> While we're at weird time formats. The timer at top's deciseconds seem to be totally wrong 😄
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think we should just remove them
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> Where do I make the moderator complaint?
15:19 <+ChillerDragon> u dont
15:19 <+ChillerDragon> staff is untouchable
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't listen to the weirdo from irc
15:19 <+ChillerDragon> oof
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just DM any admin about staff complaints
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> It wouldn't be a problem to post a video recording link to the forum
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31>  ?
15:21 <+ChillerDragon> it would
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> for proof
15:21 <+ChillerDragon> because public staff complaint is actually not very welcome on ddnet
15:21 <+ChillerDragon> its silly ik
15:21 <+ChillerDragon> just switch to bbnet there is no staff
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There also seem to be a problem with our auto reconnect code, it crashes after a while :/
15:22 <+ChillerDragon> like clientcrash?
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep
15:22 <+ChillerDragon> :/
15:22 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i shouldnt have downgraded that fast 
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> hi @murpi
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @31 message an admin directly via dms
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, doesn't look as well as I thought it would
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/759043501203259483/screenshot_2020-09-25_16-27-29.png
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 that should be right-aligned, not left
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> nope
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dm snail
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> I'll handle it from the forum
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Public staff complaints are not appreciated on the forum either
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm the padding is also way off on the 64p version of the scoreboard, I wonder why
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> then where do i complain
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You DM an admin as I and 3 other people told you now
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Or u get banned
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Like me :monkalaugh:
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> kid :d
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Why kid
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> > You DM an admin as I and 3 other people told you now
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> @Learath2 understood thank you
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :d
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Pak 's game freezes even more often on Multeasymap, around spawn :f
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Guess the padding needs to scale down for the 64p one for some reason
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> literally 5 freezes and force restarts in less than 3 mins
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> Froze again now xD Im taking a break
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> Always at the same spot
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> you got screenshot again maybe?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> how is it always in same spots
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> like wtf
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> Is it forbidden to swear in the game
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> no, but i can get one... im sure it will freeze in same spot again.. 1 min xD
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pak with entities? Anything special you're doing?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @31 type `/rules` after joining any DDNet's server
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :tee_thinking:
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> multimap
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> @deen Yeah entities. Well it freezes when i try to jump over the first obstale in multieasymap
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> just a few places though
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> at the beginning
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> try without entitites overlay enabled
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> moderator takes sides
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31>  I blocked the kid who did block
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31>  she banned me ,did nothing to her
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> ım not speak english translate make
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @31 please write that in a DM to an admin and not publicly
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and especially not in #developer channel
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> https://youtu.be/nMCCP4igdYY
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> Its always this spot it freezes at... as you can see, i can climb through the other ones
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, you have a background map enabled in entities, that might be related
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How is this?
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/759047179926110218/screenshot_2020-09-25_16-42-09.png
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can try centering it aswell
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it looks kinda odd with the heading left aligned, maybe I should center/right align the heading instead?
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> @deen Oh can that be the reason? Ill try without it
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That was a quick fix 😄
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pak would be interesting to know, yes
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 i was searching for @Pak 's bug with valgrind and happened upon this randomly. Is that what you saw before?
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would guess so
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 looks fine to me
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll double check after I commit the scoreboard thing
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You think it's fine with the heading left aligned and the time right aligned?
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> I tried with %current% and still freezes... will try without anything
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> Seems to work if i dont have any BG at all 🙂
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 yeah
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pak thanks, will try to reproduce with background
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> never used that feature before
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> 🙂
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> @deen I take that back, froze again :/
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, too bad
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> I think it have something to do with the hardware though. This game has never frozen on my desktop, only laptop
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ah, might be needing too much power
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can try setting cl_refresh_rate 480 and gfx_refresh_rate 120
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> would be cool if the hook collision line would work with hook tele
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I like right aligned better
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/759049789257285652/screenshot_2020-09-25_16-51-24.png
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, but the problem is there can be multiple teles and the server randomly decides which out-tele is used
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> looks fine @Learath2
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ah right
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> tele isnt actually random tho.
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @Learath2 now check id's in scoreboard :darkAyaya:
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i mean not completely
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen want to get this very bg so it would be most accurate tests? xd
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nope
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> bg was irrelevant
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @murpi should work just fine, we just pretend the name has the id in that case
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @Learath2 It's not alligned with the name column if you enable id's, just looks weird
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @murpi Huh, I'll take a look, it looked fine though I think
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> clang-format nuked a bit of my change
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Should I go through and clang-format all of DDNet code base?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the main problem with that is cherry-picking stuff from TW and other mods cherry-picking from us
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (but same problem with the current slow reformatting)
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, IDs add some odd padding, I'll fix that too, thanks @murpi
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I think we should just go thru with it, though let's wait for heinrich
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think heinrich agreed with it
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We still have some large changes in drafts, they will get conflicts
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but not so hard to fix with formatting
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 some tune params are wrong in 0.7. Especially player_collision, player_hook and jetpack_speed
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/759053576302755891/Screenshot_from_2020-09-25_16-56-03.png
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> when I set player_collision it set's player_hook in 0.7
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and when I set player_hook it sets nothing
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> so player_collision is always 5.0
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've tried to remove all conditionals from code for faketunes but it didn't helped
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> when I set player_collision it set's player_hook in tw 0.7
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> everything is fine with a ddnet client
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> `laser_damage` was removed in 0.7
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, long names overlap so hard on the smaller scoreboards
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think I can fix it
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll just stop for now
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @redix so I should skip laser_damage tune for 0.7 client and it could fix that
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will try, thanks
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yeah, laser damage is set to 5.0 so this makes sense
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> @deen Tried it, and working so far. Will report if i get any more freeze 🙂
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @Learath2 maybe add a threshold how long names can be displayed, if it exceeds the treshhold it will just "..." e.g WWWWWW...
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pak glad to hear. this means your hardware is unstable unfortunately. probably a power supply or cpu/gpu issue
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> other games might also get bugs when they need lots of resources
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> Hmm alright, thanks 🙂
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> You said swearing was not forbidden
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> chat mute got it
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's working. Wait for a PR
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> How is this game?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> thanks @redix !
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Should I make a bugfix branch in ddnet repo for a PR or I don't have such permissions and should do a fork first?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> fork
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if this should get a more generic solution
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> How to invoke a clang beautifier? (bonus: on a block in vscode)
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> or is this not strict as other lines use the same style too?
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think there was an extension for vscode, I don't remember tho. I don't use it personally
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What you want is to run our fix_style python script, that only fixes the parts you touched
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> should I reset last commit to make them into a stage first?
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it seems I need that
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> --base HEAD~
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> isn't it makes the same thing as git reset HEAD~
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I mean python scripts/fix_style.py --base HEAD~
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> murpi is blocker moderator
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ah
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> @31 stop offtopic
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @murpi y u block?
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> no proof
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> lul
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol, that's almost an admission of guilt. I'll remove murpi from mod

16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Imagine being moderator just to be able to block with impunity.
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> pls no I did nuffing
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> no proof you did nothing
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> im just a sheep waiting in spec, eating grass and llistening to complaints 24/7 on multimap <a:ismesad:758061540657201364>
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> 😄
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> waiting to block?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ur not sheep. Am 🐑
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> girls do block
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> **murpi**:I did not see sorry 
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> men block
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> **murpi**:come here
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> cringe
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @Learath2 fake sheep
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> DeathSinger
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> ?
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> There is a video recording
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <31> speeches came out video
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, very off-topic
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #off-topic
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I'll redo the scoreboard
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nice
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does anyone have any requests they want to see done about the scoreboard while I rewrite it?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what do you want to change?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nothing
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want it to be clean 😄
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2 more info 😄
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i'm ok with how it looks atm
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> supplemental fields
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll have it resize more fluidly too, so things actually fit
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but it will be hard I think
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I'd liked to add some text fields to the score table. But it's highly optional
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I use clan table right now for that
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and add I to clan name for iZombie (initial one)
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ah nevermind
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it's fine as it is
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Is MySQL support stable?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> can i use it instead of SQLite?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It should be fairly stable, though it might take a while for you to understand the way it's set up
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> morning
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> what did i miss
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I am using SQLite in teeworlds already for my custom queries.
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @TsFreddie 🌈 intel is using IME but that's not a problem. We should make teeworlds on a risk machine. murpi is banned for blocking. I've had my first PR merged into ddnet 😉
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I am using SQLite in teeworlds already for my custom queries. And I know how to deploy MySQL.
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @TsFreddie 🌈 intel is using IME but that's not a problem. We should make teeworlds on a Risc-V machine. murpi is banned for blocking. I've had my first PR merged into ddnet 😉
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We didn't settle on the IME thing that discussion could have went either way still
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😋
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Time to delay all prs till octobe for hacktoberfest
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> October*
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> <a:wut:677059322550943744>
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> <a:ismejao:758062579888422952>
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> woah
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> diff city
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Diff so large it broke my phone
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Had to restart it
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> every time i open any file on github on my phone the browser hang
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> imagine reviewing 30k line changes tho
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Who adds skins to skindb?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Or: how do I add custom X-skin there?
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can't add skins. I don't know who adds them now though. There used to be a skindb crew adding/removing stuff
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not sure if any of them are still around 😄
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, I've again started coding too many things at a time
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll finish up the integrity check thing first
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Learath2 I'd guess right now it would be Ravie, Louis and me, since we're cleaning up the DB
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Clefairy'> > Not sure if any of them are still around 😄
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Clefairy'> @Learath2 I'm still here, just that skin section is pretty quiet these days 🙁
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I'd wanted to upload there some skins with X-flag for my server only
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> (they will not be suitable for other servers I guess)
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I reviewed it with `git diff` in command line, blazing fast compared to github
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> reviewed the clang-format?
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, but still got some problems, need to fix some includes in system.c
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you remove the formatting in `hash_libtomcrypt.c`?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's imported from elsewhere
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sure, I only excluded external directory for now
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Should I move it to external? I feel like everything outside of external should follow our formatting
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, but it's not really external, just adapted
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess you can also not exclude it
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's adapted, as you say
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> what is x_skins?
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> skins prefixed with x_
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> only for `MOD` type skins?
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> eh, got it
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they are by default ignored by the client
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and in the future mods can specify ALLOW_X_SKINS to tell the client that it should show skins with x_
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> mods can use that to send some skins to client that we would not consider tee-ish or appropriate for regular playing
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> can be x_skins downloaded from server?
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> from skin db
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> only
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so the mod author would have to submit their skins to our skin db
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> hm nice idea
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's for pure_luck's infection mod
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or was requested by him at least
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats nice, then i can create colored ninja without teamflag
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ for what mod?
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 4 teams fng
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, nice
