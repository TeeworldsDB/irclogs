12:00 <@deen> Learath2: hi. when the connection fails with the autoupdater, it just hangs?

15:21 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 564a692 def: Revert ZZZ emoticon when afk
15:32 <@deen> Huh, NETOBJTYPE_CLIENTINFO is sent A LOT
15:32 <@deen> is that really necesary?
15:32 <@deen> it neraly never changes
15:32 <@heinrich5991> what's in there?
15:32 <@heinrich5991> ping?
15:32 <@deen> and contains Name, Clan, Country, Skin, CustomColors
15:32 <@deen> nothing else...
15:32 <@heinrich5991> hum
15:33 <@heinrich5991> how often?
15:33 <@heinrich5991> just at the start?
15:33 <@deen> all the time
15:33 <@heinrich5991> oh
15:33 <@heinrich5991> you mean before compression
15:33 <@deen> aah, that's delta-compressed?
15:33 <@heinrich5991> after the first few snapshots only the difference to the last acked snapshot is sent
15:33 <@deen> good
15:33 <@heinrich5991> so if it doesn't change, nothing is transferred
15:33 <@heinrich5991> however, if you have 64-player server, it might change a bit more often
15:33 <@deen> nothing is transferred, but it's handled in the client anyway
15:34 <@heinrich5991> yes
15:34 <@deen> i think this thing netobj causes the lags for many people on 64 player servers
15:34 <@deen> now i'm just wondering if it's because of bandwidth or cpu load
15:35 <@heinrich5991> are you sure?
15:35 <@deen> nope, not sure
15:35 <@heinrich5991> maybe you could try to measure what actually is in the delta-snapshots
15:35 <@heinrich5991> (but I have not entered that terrain yet, I don't know how the delta-compression works specifically)
15:35 <@deen> me neither
15:36 <@deen> I'll just reduce the load of handling this client-side
15:37 <@heinrich5991> oh
15:37 <@heinrich5991> deen: do you mean vanilla clients on 64-player servers or ddnet clients?
15:37 <@deen> ddnet client
15:38 <@heinrich5991> then disregard the "however, if you have 64-player server, it might change a bit more often"
15:38 <@heinrich5991> I talked about this changing due to different players being shown
15:38 <@deen> I know that vanilla client will change a lot on ddnet server with 64 players
15:38 <@deen> but i've had reports from people with vanilla client as well

16:48 <@deen> I'd like to release soon. Would appreciate if someone tries out or looks into autoupdater
16:48 <@deen> it should work fine now, I hope
16:48 <@deen> If you compile from git, it should download the client, server, oldman.png and DDNet-7.2.1-win32.zip (just for testing)

17:53 < Spyker> mb post it on ddnet if you have time or you like it
17:58 < seymour_> lemme check this trailer out
18:00 < seymour_> oh yea, sick video editing 10/10
18:00 < seymour_> would watch again
19:39 < Learath2> deen: should try autoupdate with a manifest that has more then one version in
19:40 <@deen> Learath2: the code looked fine^^
19:40 <@deen> I'm mainly worried about it working fine on Windows
19:41 < Learath2> which part ? 
19:41 <@deen> everything^^
19:41 <@deen> but i guess i can release it
19:41 < Learath2> well im on windows and can confirm it works for one version manifest
19:41 <@deen> great
19:42 < Learath2> does it still hang if update fails ?
19:42 <@deen> oh right
19:42 <@deen> f1, cl_ddnet_update_server, set something bad and try
19:45 < Learath2> you nuked the restart timer whats the new behaviour ?
19:47 <@deen> to have a restart button
19:47 < Learath2> let me fix the hang 
19:47 <@deen> you know you can have the serverbrowser open when you're in a game
19:48 <@deen> so a sudden restart would be bad then
19:48 < Learath2> oh yep keep forgetting the ingame sv list
19:51 < Learath2> deen: what should happen if a fail cannot be fetched ?
19:51 <@heinrich5991> file?
19:51 < Learath2> yep
19:52 <@deen> Learath2: i don't know
19:52 <@deen> keep going and hope for the best?
19:52 < Learath2> eeh no way to undo all the already fetched files currently
19:52 <@deen> yeah, right
19:52 <@deen> let's just hope i don't forget to add files
19:53 <@deen> and if i did, i'll just add them the next time again
19:53 < Learath2> could entirely fail and ask for a manual update ?
19:53 <@deen> nah
19:53 < Learath2> should inform users of a possibly incomplete update when it happens tho
19:53 <@deen> if i forget an important file, i'll just make a new release quickly
19:54 < Learath2> say you didnt forget a file but a users internet suddenly rekt
19:55 <@deen> since we download the DDNet.exe last, is that still a problem?
19:56 < Learath2> well its quite unprobable but if a file in the middle fails and ddnet.exe succeeds there is no way of knowing
19:56 < Learath2> could add a quick "Some files failed to update. DDNet Client will restart now..." msg for that if you want
19:57 <@heinrich5991> do you keep going if a file failed to be loaded?
19:57 < Learath2> loaded ?
19:57 < Learath2> opened ?
19:58 <@heinrich5991> downloaded from the http update server
19:59 < Learath2> currently nothing 
19:59 < Learath2> gets stuck
20:09 <@heinrich5991> deen: do you know the syntax of lisp hashmaps?
20:11 <@deen> {"key" value}
20:11 <@deen> {"key1" value1 "key2" value2} i believe
20:15 <@heinrich5991> thanks

20:19 < Learath2> deen: does fix update on hang doesnt do nothing about if a file fails in between or at the end

20:20 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 f89f077 Dennis Felsing: Merge pull request #166 from Learath2/pr_UpdateHang...
20:21 <@deen> great, thanks
20:21 < Learath2> should add a message for the last file failing too as then after the restart it obv wont be updated

20:30 < Learath2> deen: anything else ?
20:30 <@deen> Learath2: i don't know
20:30 <@deen> i guess not
20:31 < Learath2> menus_browser.cpp:1286 could be prettier as a switch i guess but no idea how :D
