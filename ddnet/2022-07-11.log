02:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> okay so i got a problem
02:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> i got a conflict in my PR, how do apply a change to the PR to solve the conflict?
02:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> i got a conflict in my PR, how do I apply a change to the PR to solve the conflict?
03:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Garwex> Hey there, came to ask if by any chance someone had made a program or something to convert a 0.7 skin into a 0.6 skin.
03:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> If you can upload an example of both skins.  i can make an app
03:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> If you can upload an example of both skins i can make an app
03:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> @Garwex  If you can upload an example of both skins i can make an app
03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> I dont quiete get the versioning thing.
03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> Is 7 -> 0.7.5 and 6 -> 16.x or how does that work?
04:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aand for the 6th time the keyboard on my macbook is broken, I just love it, great product
04:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> one of the nicer feeling keyboards that also break very easily
06:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> Someone got a good video or sum that explains versioning? :feelsbadman:
08:54 <+ChillerDragon>  which versioning? you mean version numbers in tw? or general versoning concepts?
08:54 <+ChillerDragon> thats a classic https://simver.org/
08:55 <+ChillerDragon> ah no this is wat i meant https://semver.org/

11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2022/07/postgres-15-unique-improvement-with-null
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> postgres more and more better
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> bruh can't use amd pstate driver bcs cppc is disabled from bios and it is hidden :d
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> do u use that keyboard protection that avoid dust to get in ?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You mean the ugly silicone mat things people put on there? No I don't like the feeling
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Besides I shouldn't need to. I have had 4 laptops none of them needed 6 keyboard replacements. In fact none of them ever needed any keyboard replacements :D
15:09 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 still stuck on integration tests? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5205
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> experimenting with thin bar
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/996040672626880613/unknown.png
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if people like this it could even be default
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> imo better
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> looks good, but i would put it closer to the tee
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I would too but I think rn it's just outside the box of max tee size
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yup, looks better imo
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The tee is much bigger than the shape might suggest
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the tee skin? the tee-tee collision? the tee-wall collison?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tee skin
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> ou yea smaller looks nice
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 750€ to replace a keyboard. They are out of their minds. Shipping a broken product and only allowing free fixes for 4 years
17:00 <+ChillerDragon> :apple:
17:00 <+ChillerDragon> imagine not buying the newest mac every year
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like the wider bar, but maybe just due to it being there first
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> EU should have been harsher on them for this shit product. Force them to recall it if they are not giving free replacements for the lifetime of the device
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> EU passed some decent laws recently
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AFAIK, they force apple to let users run programs on their iphones, and force apple to let iphones be charged with usbc
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I'm really proud of them for rising to the occasion
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think apple has until next year to comply with the usbc one
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So the next iPhone will come with no ports at all 😄
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> pls god no
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hopefully the inconvenience in service will dissuade them
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A port is very useful in running diagnostics and stuff for repair
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm actually surprised how easily I can use iPhone hot spot with cable using Linux. Worked instantly. But I haven't managed to copy files to it except over SMB 😄
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and of course the SMB connection breaks whenever the screen goes black or I open a different application, aggressive power saving I guess
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm guessing they either use some generic protocol (doesn't sound like apple at all), or some kernel developer put in the time to write a driver
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd be so out of character if apple contributed the driver themselves 😄
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess it's this, so not apple-affiliated: https://libimobiledevice.org/
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's impressive how much opensource developer time goes to support such an opensource averse companies products. You'd think apple products wouldn't be this popular amongst the group of people that have this skillset
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> indeed impressive
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and huge respect to these ppl
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, insane amount of work reverse engineering piles upon piles of proprietary shit
18:23 <+ChillerDragon> and then apple will sue them axaxax
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you know there's no ethernet over USB standard?
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> everyone rolls their own
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's really bad
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I found out when I tried to share my internet with a teacher's mac, but it simply didn't work out-of-the-box like it worked with other OSs
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_over_USB I guess there are some protocols, but sounds like a lot indeed.
18:40 <+ChillerDragon> wot when running commands in docker they shop up in the hosts `htop` or am i confused. I somehow expected to see a docker process instead
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> how long have u been having that macbook?
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 5 years
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> well I guess 1 time per year
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> mine didn't break at least
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> been 1 year
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you got it after 2018 you got the new fixed keyboard on yours
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 2018 and 2017 models had the old shit butterfly design that kept breaking
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> ah ok it'll be alright then
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> just the speakers somehow kinda satures now :( idk why
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> maybe I put some water on it without noticing
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> just the speakers somehow kinda saturates now :( idk why
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can take it to apple and ask them while you are still covered by both their limited warranty and consumer protection
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> sadly I only had 6 months of that
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Where do you live that has only 6 months of consumer protection?
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> In France
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s 2 years in france and italy as far as I’m aware
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> Well at least thats what they say on the assistance tab
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should check the documentation. Though I know some french, I don’t know enough to read legalese 😄
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> U're talking about the apple warranty?
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> or some kind of general consumer warranty?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/996095903809159259/unknown.png
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> I'm talking about that thing personally
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> (google img up there)
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> General consumer warranty. We are in the EU where we have some semblance of proper consumer rights :P
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> owhh i'll definitely check on Apple's store then, bring it and assert my rights !
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> owhh i'll definitely check on Apple's store then, bring it and assert my EU rights !
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk the case in france. You'll have to check it out, but with my ipad I had no trouble getting it fixed 1.5 years after purchase
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Android file transfer via the poor usb2 speed is also very painfull. Just use a sync tool like syncthing, and you can use the speed of your fast wifi
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> do you all keep your pr branches?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I'm to lazy for cleanup.
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> yeah just checked seems like ure right
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> does the map editor not support browsing sym linked folders? :( 
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> sym linked maps work but not folders i guess the storage callback does not list sym links as folders or somthing like thart

20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> today si the day
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> poggers
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can do adb via IP
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> syncthing is nicer, because it does sync your folders every time you are in your wifi
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> and smarter...
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> and open source ;D you can get it from F-droid. But then take the fork version
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> depends on your use case, obviously
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> adb is already on the phone and can transfer files. syncthing is an app that needs to be installed and is more useful for syncing folders than transferring data
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in my experience, syncthing didn't immediately synchronize when new files appeared or when regaining connection to the wifi
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nextcloud has been more reliable for that
20:06 <+ChillerDragon> im highly confident that gitlabs broken shell escape that gets passed to eval has room for some juicy 0days
20:07 <+ChillerDragon> i mean cmn ...

20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> very exciting
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> missing semicolon before `then`?
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: ^
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen is this comment still up-to-date? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/abc9929d35537c67e06395aaf30eb1c1252fcb87/src/engine/client/discord.cpp#L3-L4

21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not rly
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> using the map name as keys is the sensible thing to do
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if that guy doesnt know how to use object.keys to iterate he is just dumbo
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh that guy is you
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> your rant is invalid
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thanks for coming to my ted talk
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and you should be used to json files having dynamic properties
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> XD
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you should use rust
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and with serde
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then use Option<T> on those parameters that might exist or not
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with typescript is as easy as putting a ? at the end of the name
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> nerd property experts :kek:
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cringe
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> that's what I have to learn
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> but yeah, ryo's method works fine
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ReiTW serde is the most powerfull serializer framework u will ever see
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its dark magic
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> have to learn too how to convert a struct data type into a byte slice
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> like to_be_bytes
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ReiTW dont do that like that
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use a proper serialization algorithm
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if uwant bytes use bincode
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust structs dont have a fixed order
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since rust can reorder the fields to optimize the size
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to avoid unecesary paddings
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> oh that's nice
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and bincode is better
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/bincode-org/bincode
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ah, well have to check, cuz for libbpf I have to pass a &[u8]
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> check it out
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then u probs need to use
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #repr(C)
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or something
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> what's that
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/other-reprs.html
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it makes the struct follow the C memory layout
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > This is the most important repr. It has fairly simple intent: do what C does. The order, size, and alignment of fields is exactly what you would expect from C or C++. Any type you expect to pass through an FFI boundary should have repr(C), as C is the lingua-franca of the programming world. This is also necessary to soundly do more elaborate tricks with data layout such as reinterpreting values as a different type.
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ah then yes
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but how do you pass it as a byte  slice then
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe with this
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/mem/fn.transmute.html
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i rly need to learn how it works
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its unsafe
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never had to do that so idk
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > transmute is semantically equivalent to a bitwise move of one type into another. It copies the bits from the source value into the destination value, then forgets the original. It’s equivalent to C’s memcpy under the hood, just like transmute_copy.
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yeah that's typically smth similar as from_ne_bytes that I need
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/996143086449213450/unknown.png
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, do you only need to pass stuff around as native-endian @ReiTW?
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kiwq> I'm a bit confused about what you mean. `if a rank has finishes > 0 then it's also got a rank, first_finish and time` Doesn't that kinda make sense? How would you want it to display the player's rank? I'm unsure what language you're using, but it's really easy to check if a property is null, and there make the assumption that the player doesn't have a finish.
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kiwq> 
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kiwq> What's wrong with using keys on the object, also as Ryozuki said it's really easy to loop over an object.
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kiwq> 
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kiwq> You're only fair criticism is that there is no documentation, which I assume is because deen throw this togheter in 30 minutes :) 
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kiwq> 
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kiwq> TL:DR You're incredibly lazy, and expect the API to be doing everything for you. <3

22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> :justatest:
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol, someone is only thinking about api beauty
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> no, im based
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> 
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> and also that was more of a joke than an actual complaint, i did in 2 minutes lol
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> 
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> also yes, docs are a must
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> feel free to do the docs yourself!
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> no, im based
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> 
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> and also that was more of a joke than an actual complaint, i did everything i needed in 2 minutes lol
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> 
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> also yes, docs are a must
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is a open source project :D
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> ok im crazy, but not insane
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> :KEKW:
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ??
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> it would take me too long man
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Sans then please do the docs
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and you expect others to do it for you?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What are you looking to use the API for anyway?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobody owes u anything
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> no, i expect the author/creator/dev (idk tbh) to gimmie an idea of how I should use the api
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean its pretty obvious?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the api is mostly used by the game
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so yeah
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually the API in question isn't used by anyone except @TsFreddie I think
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> explain this button then
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/996154076515553372/unknown.png
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk why u so aggresive
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> im not
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but if you feel there is a lack of documentation
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can give back
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and do it
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> why did u think i am :Thonk:
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ez, it is mostly used by internal projects BUT it's public
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean have u read ur image?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/996154272351793213/unknown.png
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> guys i have idea, a challenge server where u do a single move as far as possible and everyone has their own highscores and it can be seen on their profile
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> huh, alright
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> today everyone kinda loaded ngl
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> again, ya got no context my guy
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> 
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> me and futur were mostly joking while i was writing code
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well u shared ur joke without context here
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> and he was helping me turn it from js to ts
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on the dev channel
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> fair, f for me
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> literally mocking deen
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> FWIW it's a dictionary with keys because the API consumer needs O(1) lookup iirc
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and can't transform the data before storing it? ^^
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> good to know, see at least this little bit of info woulda been nice :p
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean an array would also work
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> eh screw it, after im done with this (and probably learn the api better) imma make some docs
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ❤️
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think they store it 😛
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and also fits cuz map names on ddnet are unique
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then it's O(n) either way
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (due to parsing)
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unless you do some crazy binary search if the map is sorted 😄
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess you could say that, yes, the consumer still has to insert it into a hashmap
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats the spirit! :ddnet:
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> all i need with that, is to convert it from object to array, and filter that array to then be able to tell the user what maps they have and havent completed
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> soo
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> ye
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> done that
22:45  * bridge [ddnet] <Sans> wouldnt mind some help tho
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> :/
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (you can *probably* do that without converting it to an array)
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Sans btw what are you looking to do? still want to replace the ddnet bot here?
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> I can, but in js/ts it's just so so much easier for me to work with arrays
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> well, yea, but now im focused on making an npm package
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> would be kinda lame if i used the api for 1 project and gave no one a way to use it easily in js
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddnet
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> so far from being done
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> but eh
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> it works (dont quote me on this)
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can iterate a dictionary too, if that's what you need
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> .
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> arrays are just easier to work with
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> maybe that's just me :p
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Sans noo
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the map is so easy
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```ts
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for(let key in Object.keys(data)) {
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>   let value = data[key];
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> }```
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ezzz
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> key is the map name
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> or
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/996156359118688256/unknown.png
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah that works too
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, it's `for (let [map, data] of Object.entries(dct))` vs ` for (let map_data in arr)` looks about similar to me if iteration is what you are looking for
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so whats wrong?
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> hacky thing, but i plan to minimize it
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah its just using js in a functional way
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> nothing, just converted the object to an array, filtered it, and mapped
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust iterators are better cuz they are lazy but yeah js likes that
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :3
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think js does lot of unnecesary copies
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz they are eager
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the point is if it was an array he got from the API, he wouldn't have to use the Object.keys() there
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> well, at least they're managed somewhat well
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> memory ain't that high
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> so
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is it actually copies? probably just more gc references
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> not true copies
22:51  * bridge [ddnet] <Sans> mostly
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what every js dev says
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hihi electron
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> hold up, when did i say i use electron :KEKW:
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when have you measured the memory of your app the last time, @Ryozuki?
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have never done that, I think
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for rust?
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> I've only worked with plain js and npm packages
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i do cuz its always small
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, for rust
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> last time was when i did this blog
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://edgarluque.com/blog/zstd-streaming-in-rust/
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> "Sometimes you need a bit of a stream."
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> cheeky
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hehe
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We don't need to because unless we are being like extremely wasteful there is no way we get even close to an electron app that is idling
22:54  * bridge [ddnet] <Sans> looking at you, discord
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we're still wasting a lot, I think
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you seen these justine.lol blog posts?
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they're quite nice
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> DDNet ingame uses 250~ mb for me. Discord uses 600M doing nothing
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nope, what are they about? I could take a look
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> sadness
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/996158128750067833/unknown.png
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> (discord hardware accel disabled, that's why's cpu is so high)
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah look at those, to compete with the silliness that is modern web browsers we'd need to be treating memory like it's 1cent per gb
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/ e.g. this I guess
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Discord will sometimes decide CPU cycles all belong to it, and hog all 8 of my cores for about half a minute
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> eh
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&query=justine.lol&sort=byPopularity&type=story
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> im surprised my discord uses so little ram actually
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think i saw that cosmpolitan thing a long time ago
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doing rly hacky stuff or smth
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly interesting
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://justine.lol/ape.html now this is a cute idea
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > so little ram
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> literally using nearly 1gb
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you've ever had chrome itself with a couple tabs you know why it's impressive they managed to stay within 1g 😄
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my firefox is at 1gb
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with twitch open
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> no i mean
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> i've got a couple of plugins and a theme installed
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im on windows cuz gaming
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/996159901569122415/unknown.png
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> so
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> using 10gb lmao
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> i wish i had 10gb 😭
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm at 800M with 7 tabs and twitch on firefox
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> switch to opera gx
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> :KEKW:
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> i got 13 tabs open
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah i had reddit open too
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with  the new design
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I absolutely detest chromium, I'd stay with firefox just to give them 1 more user so they can keep some market share
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> opera is just chromium
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> chromium is also on my detest list :D
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bluesky> who uses plain chromium
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is there another good alternative to firefox?
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> among others
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah, every other competitor was murdered by google inc
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can have chromium with microsoft skin, chromium with opera skin, chromium with google skin, chromium with some privacy extensions bolted on, chromium with opera skin but also for gamers
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Ryozuki I'm so proud of u for using windows
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> -.-
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant be bothered to play ff14 on linux
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do they let you run it on a VM?
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they literally do 0 clientside checks
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im actually modding the game
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its mostly server authoritive so
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i want full perf
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use shaders and stuff
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You could look into a VM setup, I remember it's actually possible to give the entire gpu to the VM and take it back later nowadays
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> chromium overwrites default browser, so every discord link fires up chromium for me, but i need it for things not working in firefox. its like skype, it created an autostart file every launch. the workaround was to create a folder with the filename / path of the autostart file to block it xd
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> no clue, have to check that out
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> > For the new 2017 version of skype that's impudent enough to add itself to autostart each time it's started (seriously? Never installing it on my own machine) it's enough to create a folder with the same name as a file it's trying to create:
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> from https://askubuntu.com/a/977036
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> you kill it.
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> never use it again
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> switch to discord
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> micros*ft moment
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you do, that might actually be quite easy 🙂
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> yeah sans im not using it, this was a few years ago, but chromium makes me think of.it
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> oh boi
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> im waiting for that day when chromium is gonna be replaced everywhere with something that's just as good but uses less ram
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably not happening, unfortunately
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> sadness
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> on windows i would use edge maybe 😅
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> i would say something
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> but
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> i fear i will get banned for it
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> edge is just a chromium skin
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> ^
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> really?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> like vivaldi
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> it's literally micros*ft's attempt at copying chrome
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> vivaldi is also closed source
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but its running chrome or not?
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it is
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> chromium* innit?
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> and edge is running chrome?
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, also
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> .
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> chrome is a browser
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chromium also is a browser
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i thought edge is completely microsoft
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you want to be precise, it's 'blink', the browser engine
23:22  * bridge [ddnet] <Sans> and also a base for literally every popular browser except firefox
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> i think
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> is firefox based on chromium?
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> no
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> ye
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> without knowing it
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> i dont use ff, i wouldnt know
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> safari is also not based on chrome
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> :KEKW:
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ie also not ? hahahhaa
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> ok that's apple territory, who tf knows what they be doing with their software
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> what's ie
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> https://tenor.com/view/internet-explorer-gif-24879124
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> oh this
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> wait people still use it
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ie is its own thing
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> i forgot about it lmfaoo
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> ||dont launch the client then, come play a round of chess with me instead||
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg :monkalaugh:
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> ^
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> so is all electron running chrome as well?
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> or webkit
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> whats that actually
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kiwq> Yep :(
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> cant it run firefox
