01:45 < bridge> <tela> since color is being talked about in #general , i've been meaning to ask about how colors work
01:45 < bridge> <tela> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1098031670684303490/Screen_Shot_2023-04-18_at_6.37.43_PM.png
01:46 < bridge> <tela> what is that color format up top?  I thought for a while it was just decimal but it isn't
01:46 < bridge> <tela> also for some reason I used to think you could enter in hex values by doing `player_color_body &E01F1F` but that actually doesn't give you the right color
01:46 < bridge> <Ewan> he said it worked for RGB idk
01:46 < bridge> <tela> what works for RGB
01:47 < bridge> <Ewan> The &e01f1f
01:47 < bridge> <tela> so &2043030 to get #E01F1F?
01:48 < bridge> <tela> that doesn't work
01:54 < bridge> <DefaultO> Isn't it just hex to int
01:55 < bridge> <DefaultO> Like you can represent hex color codes like this in micropython: 0xFFFFFF
01:55 < bridge> <DefaultO> And if you write it like that. You can convert it into a number easily.
02:02 < bridge> <tela> by int do you just mean decimal
02:02 < bridge> <tela> you can do 0xE01F1F to decimal but you get 14688031
02:02 < bridge> <tela> the number the game uses is 49408
02:05 < bridge> <DefaultO> Is it perhaps some x-bit?
02:05 < bridge> <DefaultO> 16-bit or something
02:06 < bridge> <tela> well it doesnt have a consistent # of characters
02:06 < bridge> <tela> so i dont really know how to go about figuring out what it is
02:11 < bridge> <DefaultO> Did you ask GPT to figure it out?
02:12 < bridge> <DefaultO> Also why ask a bot. Isn't it in the code? Shouldn't the math be either in the command player_..._color or when you pick the hex color in the settings?
02:14 < bridge> <DefaultO> Somewhere the value gets set
02:14 < bridge> <DefaultO> Or it gets converted when you get it
02:14 < bridge> <DefaultO> There are no other options
05:37 < bridge> <Ravie> @tela the number is just a decimal representation of the bits of hsl values put together, and to enter hex values I think you use $ instead of &
07:50 < bridge> <tela> ah thanks, you're right it's $, don't know where I got & from.  Using & does appear to take a value but it's just always gray, dunno what it's expecting there
07:50 < bridge> <tela> 
07:50 < bridge> <tela> > a decimal representation of the bits of hsl values put together
07:50 < bridge> <tela> 
07:50 < bridge> <tela> can you explain a bit more about that?  I'd like to find a way to have a hex value, and convert it to this format without using the game
08:25 < bridge> <Learath2> The first one is classic teeworldss colors. 3 byte packed hsl
08:29 < bridge> <Learath2> Going from hex rgb to tw colors you first need to go from rgb to hsl, let's talk about normalized hsl (components out of 1.0), then the value is (h * 256 << 16 + s * 256 << 8 + l * 256)
18:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> alignment, packing, ur mom
18:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i hate em all
18:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> <a:aPES_GaCrazy:667742302789304330>
18:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i love how llvm makes a c api but doesnt add all you can do there with the cpp api
18:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :okaymaam:
21:33 < bridge> <Mʎɹ シ> Rust, datafiles, stickers in discord
21:33 < bridge> <Mʎɹ シ> I hate em all
