08:34 < Lady> deen there is a bug
08:34 < Lady> First one is that you are sleeping
08:35 < Lady> I hope you will read it
08:36 < Lady> When I click on first 2 News (race maps & nightly builds)
08:36 < Lady> The link says nightly builds, but the news is about race maps
08:37 < Lady> Same for both news
08:37 < Lady> Bye
09:25 < tyurd> test
09:25 <@deen> welcome, tyurd 
09:25 < tyurd> hello deen :)
09:48 <@deen> someone tells me that the demo marker is WAY too early in a long demo
09:49 <@deen> no idea why
09:50 <@deen> source is in demo.cpp if anyone has an idea
10:52 < tyurd> uhm, what do you exactly mean?
11:03 <@deen> that the demo marker gets shifted to a too early position
11:04 < tyurd> maybe you get a wrong size when you use big files
11:05 <@EastByte> I always thought It was a problem about the progress bar itself, not being at the right position
11:05 <@deen> dunno, i've never used demo markers
11:05 < tyurd> same here
12:02 <@EastByte> o_be_one: are you available? looks like the ovh game filters (enabled) are blocking teeworlds :p
12:03 <@deen> EastByte: best way to prevent ddos attacks
12:03 <@EastByte> yes, sure^^
12:03 <@deen> "game filter"
12:03 < tyurd> wub wub

13:57 < sdgdfg> hi  heinrich5991 
13:57 <@heinrich5991> what are you up to? :)
13:57 < sdgdfg> just a spy
13:59 <@heinrich5991> kay
14:12 <@EastByte> sdgdfg: irc logs are online now, you can even spy without being in channel :p
14:14 < Sadale> EastByte, I'm going to take down that site. Just kidding :P
14:18 <@EastByte> everyone has the right to benefit from cool dev talk in this channel :p
14:19 < devnull> 'cool dev talk'
14:19 < devnull> :D
14:19 <@EastByte> absolutely
14:30 < sdgdfg> EastByte: but with logs i will get some delay to get information, so it's not tru spying then =)
14:30 < sdgdfg> s/tru/true/
14:32 <@EastByte> hm indeed
14:33 <@EastByte> devnull: some time spare for playing today?
14:33 <@heinrich5991> you know, true spying probably also includes not identifying as spy :)
14:33 < devnull> for about a hour
14:33 < devnull> invited a friend over
14:33 < devnull> ._.
14:33 <@EastByte> hmkay
14:33 < devnull> i asked you yesterday
14:33 < devnull> but you were busy
14:33 <@EastByte> you did that?
14:34 < devnull> yea
14:34 <@EastByte> ah nameless?
14:34 < devnull> yea
14:34 < devnull> oo
14:34 <@EastByte> ...
14:34 <@EastByte> you are a real spy
20:08 < Savander> heinrich5991, what with your map-catalog?
20:09 <@heinrich5991> what's up with that?
20:09 < Savander> you collected maps if i remember?D:
20:10 <@heinrich5991> yes!
20:10 <@heinrich5991> an old state of that can be found @ http://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps/
20:10 <@heinrich5991> Savander: do you have more maps to contribute? ^^
20:10 < Savander> hahah
20:10 < Savander> not really
20:10 < Savander> the same as before
20:10 < Savander> :P
20:11 < Savander> a lot of
20:11 < Savander> xyz_blocker
20:11 < Savander> lol
20:12 <@heinrich5991> why do you ask? â€“ even if you mostly play on xyz_blocker, I'm still interested in your downloadedmaps :)
20:12 < Savander> curiosity
20:12 < Nimda> TeeWorld by Zaiross just released on Novice at 2015-09-08 20:08
20:13 < Savander> i remembered that you doing something like map database
20:13 < Savander> i and i was curious if you did something, like website for it or so :PP
20:14 <@heinrich5991> no, not at all
20:14 <@heinrich5991> no work done in that direction
20:14 < Savander> ;)
22:14 <@deen> o_be_one: hey. any estimate when we can try moving GER2 (and later GER) to your OVH server?
22:15 < WolfAlex_> wtf ger on fr server?
22:15 <@deen> WolfAlex_: well, the current GER server has ping 100 for half the germans every day
22:15 <@deen> and GER2 is extremely expensive and has no DDoS protection
22:15 <@deen> I can't find any good server in Germany for a reasonable price
22:17 < WolfAlex_> hm okay, but you'll rename it to EU ?
22:21 <@deen> that would probably cause more confusion
22:21 <@deen> many simply search for "DDNet GER"
22:27 <@deen> And Strasbourg is right around the corner anyway :P
22:27 <@deen> closer to me than Frankfurt
