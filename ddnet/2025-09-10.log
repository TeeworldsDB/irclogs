00:42 < bridge> <totar> Issue for intended behavior lol
00:45 < bridge> <totar> "If I open an issue maybe I can trick them into making my dummy binds way stronger"
01:55 < bridge> <blazulite> @alw5 oomf roasted by tater ⚠️ sdiybt
04:32 < bridge> <always> well it doesnt make dummy binds stronger
04:33 < bridge> <always> i use mouse 1 for dummy hammer which is also my fire     key if i used another key for dummy hammer it would have the same effect
04:34 < bridge> <always> i just dont want to use another key for dummy hammer because its uncomfortable imo
04:35 < bridge> <always> when i press g on my keyboard it disables fire on mouse1,switches to hammer and enables copy moves
04:36 < bridge> <always> if im holding mouse1 while doing this(which im more likely to be doing than not) when im done flying faster or attempting to 3fly my fire would still be held down
04:37 < bridge> <always> the only way to fix this is adding +fire in the config file but that would make me hammer or use another key to make my dummy hammer like W
04:37 < bridge> <always> im not sure how fixing this bug would make dummy stronger
04:39 < bridge> <always> tldr: this doesn’t make dummy stronger it just makes deepfly bind users on the same playing field as people that dont
04:40 < bridge> <always> if im holding mouse1 while doing this(which im more likely to be doing than not) when im done flying faster or attempting to 3fly my fire would still be held down so if i need to hammer my dummy after disabling this or hammer at all it wont work
04:40 < bridge> <always> i hope my point came threw and wasnt hard to understand as im typing on mobile
04:41 < bridge> <always> i hope my point came through and wasnt hard to understand as im typing on mobile
04:43 < bridge> <always> if you can give me an example how fixing this bug  would change the game then im happy to understand that it wont be fixed
04:44 < bridge> <totar> I'm not naive, I know what you're tryin to do. It works this way on purpose
04:44 < bridge> <totar> I'm not niave, I know what you're tryin to do. It works this way on purpose
04:44 < bridge> <totar> I'm not naive, I know what you're tryin to do. It works this way on purpose
04:44 < bridge> <always> what am i trying to do ?
04:44 < bridge> <totar> you know
04:44 < bridge> <always> i do not
04:44 < bridge> <always> please tell me
04:45 < bridge> <always> i literally only want this fixed because using w for dummy hammer is uncomfortable
04:45 < bridge> <always> i literally only want this fixed because using w for dummy hammer is uncomfortable for me
04:47 < bridge> <totar> I know what you know about binds. Someone told me what you've been working on. I'm 99% sure you can connect the dots to why this massively helps you for more tha just what you've said.

04:49 < bridge> <always> i think i know what your talking about but i promise you i did not create this issue for that lol
04:49 < bridge> <totar> oh so you do know :)
04:49 < bridge> <always> what other ways could this issue be fixed
04:50 < bridge> <always> well i think your talking about tas in binds
04:50 < bridge> <always> but idk
04:50 < bridge> <always> i havent really touched that since i first discovered it
04:50 < bridge> <always> because i dont really care about it
04:51 < bridge> <always> maybe adding a -fire like in cs2 ?
04:51 < bridge> <always> idk how that could be abused
04:52 < bridge> <always> but i do want to emphasise i did not create that issue with abusing it in mind
04:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
04:53 < bridge> <always> just when i rarely play dummy i get this issue alot
04:53 < bridge> <always> where i cant hammer
04:53 < bridge> <always> which really is annoying
04:53 < bridge> <always> gm
04:58 < bridge> <always> now that you brought that up im gonna try figure out how making unbind release add unintended behaviour

05:51 < bridge> <always> @Discord Mod
05:55 < bridge> <always> how about making it so it holds the input till you release the key physically
05:56 < bridge> <always> so if mouse2 is +hook
05:56 < bridge> <always> and you unbind it while holding it it would still hold untill you physically release mouse2
05:56 < bridge> <always> any issues with that that ?
06:01 < bridge> <always> so if you
06:01 < bridge> <always> bind mouse2 +hook
06:01 < bridge> <always> >press mouse2
06:01 < bridge> <always> bind mouse2 +fire
06:01 < bridge> <always> its holding +hook
06:01 < bridge> <always> >release mouse2
06:01 < bridge> <always> it would unhook
06:01 < bridge> <always> >press mouse2
06:01 < bridge> <always> its holding fire
07:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Generally fair point, game core is already a big object so every copy is not completely free.
07:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
07:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If the caller side always uses temporary objects anyway an explicit rvalue still makes sense imo
07:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In rust the second copy is elided automatically thanks to ownership afaik.
07:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
07:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The best solution:deen_star:
07:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Generally fair point, tho game core is already a big object so every copy is not completely free.

08:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oh and in cpp you can have use after move. Dunno if compiler nowadays warns. But yeah, very unsafe

09:05 < bridge> <melon> A machinist co worker was dismissed without notice today
09:05 < bridge> <melon> :justatest:
09:05 < bridge> <melon> he changed something in Siemens Post-Professor and crashed the machine :KEKW:
09:05 < bridge> <Assa> did he put his arm into a running machine?
09:05 < bridge> <melon> he changed something in Siemens Post-Processor and crashed the machine :KEKW:
09:06 < bridge> <Assa> yeah ._.
09:06 < bridge> <melon> Not only is that illegal AFAIK, he put every machinist at risk
09:07 < bridge> <Assa> there was a point in my life where I could have dual studied machine building at siemens, but they were too slow to respond to my application
09:07 < bridge> <melon> Siemens is nice if you don't work for them directly
09:08 < bridge> <melon> Working for Siemens in maintenance for example is sick, all you do is drive around and repair broken machines
09:08 < bridge> <melon> Siemens is nice if you don't work for them directly imo
09:09 < bridge> <Assa> doesn't sound too bad of a job tbh
09:09 < bridge> <Assa> doesn't sound too bad of a job tbh if the payment is alright
09:10 < bridge> <melon> working in maintenance usually pays good
09:10 < bridge> <Assa> one of my friends is bricklayer, I would never want to have his job.
09:10 < bridge> <melon> oh yeah, my wife's father does that too and his knee is fucked entirely, he's 54 years old :justatest:
09:11 < bridge> <Assa> exactly.
09:27 < bridge> <learath2> Why was he messing around with it anyway? Sabotage?
09:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> can u explain this in words non machinist understand?
