00:42 < bridge> <totar> Issue for intended behavior lol
00:45 < bridge> <totar> "If I open an issue maybe I can trick them into making my dummy binds way stronger"
01:55 < bridge> <blazulite> @alw5 oomf roasted by tater ⚠️ sdiybt
04:32 < bridge> <always> well it doesnt make dummy binds stronger
04:33 < bridge> <always> i use mouse 1 for dummy hammer which is also my fire     key if i used another key for dummy hammer it would have the same effect
04:34 < bridge> <always> i just dont want to use another key for dummy hammer because its uncomfortable imo
04:35 < bridge> <always> when i press g on my keyboard it disables fire on mouse1,switches to hammer and enables copy moves
04:36 < bridge> <always> if im holding mouse1 while doing this(which im more likely to be doing than not) when im done flying faster or attempting to 3fly my fire would still be held down
04:37 < bridge> <always> the only way to fix this is adding +fire in the config file but that would make me hammer or use another key to make my dummy hammer like W
04:37 < bridge> <always> im not sure how fixing this bug would make dummy stronger
04:39 < bridge> <always> tldr: this doesn’t make dummy stronger it just makes deepfly bind users on the same playing field as people that dont
04:40 < bridge> <always> if im holding mouse1 while doing this(which im more likely to be doing than not) when im done flying faster or attempting to 3fly my fire would still be held down so if i need to hammer my dummy after disabling this or hammer at all it wont work
04:40 < bridge> <always> i hope my point came threw and wasnt hard to understand as im typing on mobile
04:41 < bridge> <always> i hope my point came through and wasnt hard to understand as im typing on mobile
04:43 < bridge> <always> if you can give me an example how fixing this bug  would change the game then im happy to understand that it wont be fixed
04:44 < bridge> <totar> I'm not naive, I know what you're tryin to do. It works this way on purpose
04:44 < bridge> <totar> I'm not niave, I know what you're tryin to do. It works this way on purpose
04:44 < bridge> <totar> I'm not naive, I know what you're tryin to do. It works this way on purpose
04:44 < bridge> <always> what am i trying to do ?
04:44 < bridge> <totar> you know
04:44 < bridge> <always> i do not
04:44 < bridge> <always> please tell me
04:45 < bridge> <always> i literally only want this fixed because using w for dummy hammer is uncomfortable
04:45 < bridge> <always> i literally only want this fixed because using w for dummy hammer is uncomfortable for me
04:47 < bridge> <totar> I know what you know about binds. Someone told me what you've been working on. I'm 99% sure you can connect the dots to why this massively helps you for more tha just what you've said.
04:48 < bridge> <totar> I know what you know about binds. Someone told me what you've been working on. I'm 99% sure you can connect the dots to why this massively helps you for more than just what you've said.
04:49 < bridge> <always> i think i know what your talking about but i promise you i did not create this issue for that lol
04:49 < bridge> <totar> oh so you do know :)
04:49 < bridge> <always> what other ways could this issue be fixed
04:50 < bridge> <always> well i think your talking about tas in binds
04:50 < bridge> <always> but idk
04:50 < bridge> <always> i havent really touched that since i first discovered it
04:50 < bridge> <always> because i dont really care about it
04:51 < bridge> <always> maybe adding a -fire like in cs2 ?
04:51 < bridge> <always> idk how that could be abused
04:52 < bridge> <always> but i do want to emphasise i did not create that issue with abusing it in mind
04:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
04:53 < bridge> <always> just when i rarely play dummy i get this issue alot
04:53 < bridge> <always> where i cant hammer
04:53 < bridge> <always> which really is annoying
04:53 < bridge> <always> gm
04:58 < bridge> <always> now that you brought that up im gonna try figure out how making unbind release add unintended behaviour

05:51 < bridge> <always> @Discord Mod
05:55 < bridge> <always> how about making it so it holds the input till you release the key physically
05:56 < bridge> <always> so if mouse2 is +hook
05:56 < bridge> <always> and you unbind it while holding it it would still hold untill you physically release mouse2
05:56 < bridge> <always> any issues with that that ?
06:01 < bridge> <always> so if you
06:01 < bridge> <always> bind mouse2 +hook
06:01 < bridge> <always> >press mouse2
06:01 < bridge> <always> bind mouse2 +fire
06:01 < bridge> <always> its holding +hook
06:01 < bridge> <always> >release mouse2
06:01 < bridge> <always> it would unhook
06:01 < bridge> <always> >press mouse2
06:01 < bridge> <always> its holding fire
07:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Generally fair point, game core is already a big object so every copy is not completely free.
07:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
07:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If the caller side always uses temporary objects anyway an explicit rvalue still makes sense imo
07:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In rust the second copy is elided automatically thanks to ownership afaik.
07:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
07:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The best solution:deen_star:
07:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Generally fair point, tho game core is already a big object so every copy is not completely free.

07:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If the caller side always uses temporary objects anyway an explicit rvalue still makes sense imo
08:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oh and in cpp you can have use after move. Dunno if compiler nowadays warns. But yeah, very unsafe

09:05 < bridge> <melon> A machinist co worker was dismissed without notice today
09:05 < bridge> <melon> :justatest:
09:05 < bridge> <melon> he changed something in Siemens Post-Professor and crashed the machine :KEKW:
09:05 < bridge> <Assa> did he put his arm into a running machine?
09:05 < bridge> <melon> he changed something in Siemens Post-Processor and crashed the machine :KEKW:
09:06 < bridge> <Assa> yeah ._.
09:06 < bridge> <melon> Not only is that illegal AFAIK, he put every machinist at risk
09:07 < bridge> <Assa> there was a point in my life where I could have dual studied machine building at siemens, but they were too slow to respond to my application
09:07 < bridge> <melon> Siemens is nice if you don't work for them directly
09:08 < bridge> <melon> Working for Siemens in maintenance for example is sick, all you do is drive around and repair broken machines
09:08 < bridge> <melon> Siemens is nice if you don't work for them directly imo
09:09 < bridge> <Assa> doesn't sound too bad of a job tbh
09:09 < bridge> <Assa> doesn't sound too bad of a job tbh if the payment is alright
09:10 < bridge> <melon> working in maintenance usually pays good
09:10 < bridge> <Assa> one of my friends is bricklayer, I would never want to have his job.
09:10 < bridge> <melon> oh yeah, my wife's father does that too and his knee is fucked entirely, he's 54 years old :justatest:
09:11 < bridge> <Assa> exactly.
09:27 < bridge> <learath2> Why was he messing around with it anyway? Sabotage?
09:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> can u explain this in words non machinist understand?
10:04 < bridge> <Ewan> he pushed to prod unsupervised and broke it
10:05 < bridge> <Ewan> except their tool was probably fucked by it and in need of replacement
10:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:

10:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What is the issue with rotation
10:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Furthest corner from center multiplied with sqrt(2)
10:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then you have good bounding box
10:15 < bridge> <Assa> yes, but this is currently just not implemented. I want to implement it after the quad clustering
10:15 < bridge> <Assa> proper hitboxes would scan the full env for every nanosecond
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What
10:16 < bridge> <Assa> but I believe an estimate (exactly as you suggests) would be perfect
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes
10:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No exact values please
10:17 < bridge> <Assa> the bounding box is already an estimate for bezier curves (as calculating this would be too expensive)
10:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Good
10:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What even is a good estimate for bezier
10:18 < bridge> <Ewan> assa what do u think the next slowest thing is
10:18 < bridge> <Assa> the point + the anchor height
10:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ah
10:19 < bridge> <Assa> not map rendering, but either player rendering or actually physics updating, which robyt suggests
10:20 < bridge> <Assa> you see almost all low design maps cap at around 5K fps which suggests another bottleneck
10:20 < bridge> <Ewan> that's about the highest I've seen
10:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But tater is right. Phy update only when snapshot
10:21 < bridge> <Assa> in my latest profiling test I tested on a full linear server, the result suggests that player rendering was the slowest part. Robyt profiled a different use case (e.g. flags on maps in physics)
10:22 < bridge> <Assa> I don't see a 2x regression in ctf1, even if I see a decline from 17.x to 19.0
10:22 < bridge> <Assa> I don't see a 2x regression in ctf1, even if I see a decline from 17.x to 19.0 (where I didn't touch anything in rendering)
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> hmmm
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> I wonder what it is
10:24 < bridge> <Ewan> the animations could be really slow if done naively
10:25 < bridge> <Assa> animations are yet another can of worms ...
10:25 < bridge> <Assa> but they're done performantly afaict
10:27 < bridge> <melon> the post processor sometimes does things you don't want it to do, However, it does things it HAS to do XD - idk his reasoning I'm afraid
10:27 < bridge> <melon> He made machine go BRRRJEBEBEJEJ instead of just BRRR
10:35 < bridge> <learath2> Rookie mistake, you need at least 3 BE after a JE
10:36 < bridge> <melon> exactly!
10:36 < bridge> <melon> but yeah, he basically removed the machine allowance, burned it, turned the machine on turned upside down and grabbed a coffee
10:36 < bridge> <Ewan> :poggers2:
10:36 < bridge> <melon> He got fired because the technician from Siemens saw it and went crashout in front of everyone :KEKW:
10:37 < bridge> <melon> He got fired on the spot because the technician from Siemens saw it and went crashout in front of everyone :KEKW:

10:38 < bridge> <Ewan> identical twins separated at birth
10:38 < bridge> <melon> it's a meme, enolem is a really good friend and a decently long time player. He started around the time I went AFK for a few years and when I came back I was told to stop faking them

10:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** where a maintainer
10:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** we need a maintainer
11:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the 88 open pr situtation is so frustrating .-.
11:04 < bridge> <Assa> Chiller you can give me one of the 88Prs to review

11:15 < bridge> <Assa> :brownbear:
11:16 < bridge> <Assa> how do I create debug dummies again?
11:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> have to build with debug
11:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** `-DCCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` `./DDNet-Server "dbg_dummies 10"`
11:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` `./DDNet-Server "dbg_dummies 10"`
11:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** irc edits be like
12:01 < bridge> <robyt3> Use a separate build directory for debug and release, then run the debug server if you want to benchmark with many players
12:04 < bridge> <robyt3> 64 PRs that are not draft and not waiting for author: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+-label%3A%22PR%3A+Waiting+on+author%22+-is%3Adraft
12:18 < bridge> <melon> but yeah, he basically removed the machine allowance, burned it, turned the machine on, turned it upside down while running and grabbed a coffee
12:18 < bridge> <robyt3> ChillerDragon: this won't compile on Windows without `windows_utf8_to_wide`, that probably needs to be moved to windows.cpp/h first
12:26 < bridge> <byfox> 24 of them are yours
12:31 < bridge> <melon> :kyaruXD:
12:31 < bridge> <Assa> I opted to benchmark a demo again with 64 real players, this was easier and more accurate (due to different skins, freezing happening and stuff)
12:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Freeze bars could also be benchmarked separately by having 64 players move in and out of freeze, to check whether #5699 is still an issue
12:45 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5699
12:45 < bridge> <robyt3> (Might also need benchmarking with Vulkan and OpenGL separately)
12:49 < bridge> <Assa> also draggers seems to be dropping fps a lot if you have a lot of them on screen (doesn't suprise me, but might be my fault 🙁
12:49 < bridge> <Assa> also draggers seems to be dropping fps a lot if you have a lot of them on screen (doesn't suprise me, but might be my fault 🙁 )
12:51 < bridge> <Assa> Is there a way to turn off freeze bars? Then I'll do a benchmark
12:56 < bridge> <learath2> Stop creating new ones :PomPom_Cry:
12:58 < bridge> <Assa> sometimes you just run into minor bugs when just doing things, I'll always open an issue, no matter your 666 issue goal
13:01 < bridge> <Assa> Is there a way to turn off freeze bars? Then I'll do a benchmark
13:01 < bridge> <Assa> E: yes with `cl_show_freeze_bars`
13:12 < bridge> <robyt3> TBF, the demo with that name already exists on case-insensitive file systems, but I guess there's a FileExists check that should be ignored if the name only changed in capitalization

14:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (/j)
14:17 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Oh btw, due to how it wanted alsa to be installed, ahhhm now I cannot hear anything lmao
14:17 < bridge> <cellegenrih> (inside the client ofc)
14:18 < bridge> <cellegenrih> also it feels laggy, like way laggier than expected
14:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> prediction is broken and you need to mess with the video settings
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U mean fps?
14:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> yeah, on clicking a server, on scrolling, on interacting in general
14:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> (not including but revelant to also loading assets. that one is obv)
14:49 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ingame feels fine? cannot tell cuz I didn't check the fps there
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ah you build a debug build?
14:55 < bridge> <Cellegen> ...ffs
14:56 < bridge> <Cellegen> Now cuz of what I installed for ddnet-rs, upon reboot it bricked fully
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Rip
14:57 < bridge> <Cellegen> Im super mad, fuck this dude
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Wtf u talking about xd

15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Try different kernel
15:01 < bridge> <Cellegen> I cannot go into my bios even
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You really think ddnet-rs broke your setup or what
15:01 < bridge> <Cellegen> YES
15:01 < bridge> <Cellegen> Very
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah it's virus
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Gotcha
15:02 < bridge> <byfox> xD
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmfao
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> what did u install
15:02 < bridge> <Cellegen> Like I only installed one linux package for what ddnet-rs needs for compilations
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u rm -rf /etc/fstab
15:02 < bridge> <Cellegen> And my entire pc is fucked
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> its nearly impossible its ddnet-rs fault
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur pc maybe was already unstable
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u have windows too?
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> it likes to mess with uefi
15:03 < bridge> <Cellegen> As if i know the reason
15:03 < bridge> <Cellegen> Yes, on another drive
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> u rly cant get to bios?
15:03 < bridge> <Cellegen> Nope
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> user land programs cant modify bios
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> not even kernel i would say lol
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok they can now that i think
15:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> but using programs to flash the bios xd
15:04 < bridge> <Cellegen> I installed a sound lib
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> (i think flashing bios from user is only possible on winshit)
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> alsa?
15:04 < bridge> <Cellegen> Alsa
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u try removing the power cord
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> and plugging it again
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> do ur fans work
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> is ur ram set correctly
15:04 < bridge> <Cellegen> Believe me or not, Im already doing it xd
15:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> ram prevents boot lot of times
15:05 < bridge> <robyt3> So how much output do you get? Do the fans turn on? Do LEDs turn on? Is there a 7 segment display indicating  the boot state on your Mainboard? Does it beep in any way when turning on?
15:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> try removing gpu and using igpu if u have
15:05 < bridge> <Cellegen> Oh-
15:05 < bridge> <Cellegen> "Bios has been reset"
15:05 < bridge> <Cellegen> Amazing, it fucked up the bios for a sec
15:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> i highly doubt ddnet-rs caused this

15:06 < bridge> <Cellegen> ...
15:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> what are ur specs
15:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> are u on ddr5?
15:06 < bridge> <Cellegen> Ye
15:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe your battery was empty. Remove power entirely and replace the CMOS battery.
15:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> how much ram
15:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u have ddr5 ram at 6000mhz, only use 2 sticks
15:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> otherwise its highly unstable
15:07 < bridge> <murpi> I wonder how often that actually happens
15:07 < bridge> <Cellegen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1415322735474770070/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_ce6985be-d170-443e-a7d4-2d0f6eeaf34a.jpg?ex=68c2c983&is=68c17803&hm=971f81edbfe95c75014fc3d0b8f2ec349689a6be0c8a5b697cb7747ed98cb32c&
15:07 < bridge> <robyt3> I had issues like that at least once
15:07 < bridge> <robyt3> If your BIOS detected changed RAM configuration it might start a lot slower to retrain
15:08 < bridge> <Cellegen> Should i try going into linux again?
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> ?
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> u dont have ddr5 xD
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats an old ass cpu
15:08 < bridge> <murpi> 2 different ram sticks is wild
15:08 < bridge> <robyt3> You are using two different RAM sticks which is usually a recipe for trouble
15:08 < bridge> <Cellegen> Oh i though gddr5
15:08 < bridge> <Cellegen> Eh
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> modern ryzens use ddr5
15:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> u have ddr4
15:09 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> That's what's on your graphics card
15:09 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Notice the G
15:09 < bridge> <robyt3> I have trouble even with the same RAM sticks that were not bought together
15:09 < bridge> <Cellegen> OG?
15:10 < bridge> <Cellegen> Also, yeah the linux os wont boot
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> @cellegenrih u should get same ram sticks bundled together
15:10 < bridge> <robyt3> Try a RAM memory diagnostic (on external drive or from Windows recovery menu)
15:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> they are even from different brands urs
15:10 < bridge> <Cellegen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1415323642539020320/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_24af9bfd-1436-470e-9b8b-f23eb4d7108d.jpg?ex=68c2ca5b&is=68c178db&hm=9344a84c27b491a79c2b1b1de50a8e277e5a1803929a584446a980a93266b330&
15:11 < bridge> <Cellegen> No shit, yet it worked for years till now, doubt its the cause
15:12 < bridge> <Cellegen> Well thank god i can boot into windows
15:13 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ugh, now in windows
15:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jupeyy_keks how could you break Cellegen's PC, didn't expect such a thing from you 🙁
15:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> cant even check the drive on windows cuz it won't support the type lmao
15:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @milkeeycat ngl the Rust compiler mentioned it that it wants to use "alsa" but I could only have "alsa-base"
15:15 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I guess due to this fucking reason the os decided to get alsa-base instead
15:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> idk dude, I guess I'll just never touch ddnet-rs 😂
15:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> it works on your computers bois
15:18 < bridge> <cellegenrih> But hey, at least I can compile 0.6 :owo:
15:20 < bridge> <cellegenrih> if anyone wanna tackle on wtf this did, go ahead
15:20 < bridge> <teero777> evil jupstar
15:20 < bridge> <melon> As mentioned, it installed pkg-config
15:21 < bridge> <melon> Didn't the error even say that
15:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Jia Tan of ddnet community has been exposed
15:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the compilation error did mention to ty PKG_CONFIG environment to be added to PATH
15:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> so I searched up on whatsup and found this
15:34 < bridge> <rehoboamrulit> Are there any Gores mods for ddnet server other than opengores
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes, ddnet
15:49 < bridge> <melon> idk pkg-config failed, so I assumed you have it already
15:49 < bridge> <melon> and it also mentions PKG_CONFIG_PATH isn't set
15:49 < bridge> <melon> 
15:49 < bridge> <melon> .pc files are pkg-config exclusive

16:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> yeah, and from there what would you do?

16:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> lowered by half by using MSI
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> the names are the thread names
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got quite some layers
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> improving the scheduler priority to put first woken threads by i/o improved time too
16:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> the k means its a kernel thread and number is the kid
16:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> on user threads its u and the pid
16:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> 17ms boot with i/o writes
16:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> or 170ms idk now
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:21 < bridge> <harmonylessons> how to make a quad on the whole map?
18:08 < bridge> <kebscs> @chillerdragon i agree with c++ constants in <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10876>
18:08 < bridge> <kebscs> but i like how enums have green color in visual studio 🥹
18:08 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1415368410832834640/image.png?ex=68c2f40d&is=68c1a28d&hm=3811af07bca6e8b2244f59ec909b1ecc3c60dca492a7add47dfc9ddb5918a5a8&
18:09 < bridge> <kebscs> white for constants looks so bad :/
18:10 < bridge> <Assa> I am pretty sure you can also make them green if you want
18:15 < bridge> <kebscs> idk how
18:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Omg kebs you use vs not vscode?
18:17 < bridge> <kebscs> ofc
18:17 < bridge> <kebscs> im on windows so vs better
18:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2: can we make kebs, assa and dobry maintainer please?
18:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @kebscs: also on windows it should be slower and less configurable
18:18 < bridge> <learath2> No thank you
18:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 🫑
18:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Can you even veto it like that? I would like to speak your manager!
18:20 < bridge> <kebscs> its good
18:21 < bridge> <melon> chiller you keep on forgetting learath is a green name
18:21 < bridge> <melon> the only one who could unveto is veto is another green name
18:21 < bridge> <melon> the only one who could unveto his veto is another green name
18:21 < bridge> <melon> or konsti if he tries hard enough
18:21 < bridge> <melon> 🐀
18:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> xd
18:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 🐀
18:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I turned off the emoji keyboard when I obtained my first touch device (a few years ago) and recently turned it back on
18:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Quite funny ngl
