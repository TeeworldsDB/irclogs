01:12 < Ryozuki> what is new in 9.2?
01:12 < Ryozuki> it's me or sound changed?
02:36 <@deen> dunno
10:24 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] awaysoft closed pull request #415: Add Localize() in client menus (master...i18n) https://git.io/vgcs5
14:47 < ACTom> Hello, is there any possible to merge pr#417?        Add font support for chinese, japanese, korean. 
14:52 <@heinrich5991> ACTom: is it this font? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WenQuanYi
14:52 < ACTom> yeah
14:53 < ACTom> but I merge it with DejaVuSans
14:55 <@heinrich5991> can you give me a few letters from a CJK language so I can see how they look in-game?
14:55 <@heinrich5991> or do you know a tool to view ttf files? :)
14:56 < ACTom> please wait
14:57 <@heinrich5991> the internet suggests gnome-font-viewer
15:00 < ACTom> http://smages.com/images/pic2016030ziz.png
15:00 < ACTom> yeah, gnome-font-viewer is a good tool, but I'm using Windows now.
15:01 <@heinrich5991> how come there are so many CJK letters if teeworlds doesn't support it? ^^
15:01 < ACTom> http://smages.com/images/pic2016030ndn.png
15:02 < ACTom> There is a client can input CJK letters, we called c-client https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10838
15:02 <@heinrich5991> ah
15:02 <@heinrich5991> nice
15:03 < ACTom> And, I have build a sdl2 verson ddnet, can input CJK letters
15:03 <@heinrich5991> cool :) â€“ unfortunately sdl2 for ddnet client isn't there yet AFAIK
15:03 <@heinrich5991> why do you disable the CJK font when a non-CJK language is selected?
15:04 < ACTom> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/192
15:05 <@heinrich5991> ah
15:05 < ACTom> Many novice need chinese or give up this game,so I think show CJK language is need.
15:06 < ACTom> but for pro users, they can use English :-D
15:07 <@heinrich5991> one last question
15:07 <@heinrich5991> "But the more serious problem is that every time FreeType pull out a font and let it render into a texture, it cost almost 0.1 seconds for each character,"
15:07 <@heinrich5991> is it that bad? can you view the server browser without too much lag?
15:08 < ACTom> This is why I disable the CJK font when a non-CJK language is selected.
15:08 < ACTom> novice cannot feel this lag.
15:15 <@heinrich5991> ACTom: I think this pull request looks good, I'd merge it. before I do so, could you fix the warnings around fontFile in gameclient.cpp and menus_settings.cpp?
15:16 <@heinrich5991> namely, make it const char *pFontFile
15:16 <@heinrich5991> const because you assign string literals to it, and pFontFile because that's how teeworlds names variables
15:22 < ACTom> ok~
15:22 < ACTom> I'll do it
15:22 <@heinrich5991> (and if you feel like it, enlighten me what the ~ after the ok means :) )
15:29 < ACTom> ~ kind of emotional mark, for "happy" or "glad" or any positive status.
15:32 <@heinrich5991> ah :)
15:39 <@heinrich5991> ACTom: ping me (preferably on github) when you're done with that
15:44 < ACTom> heinrich5991: you mean @you ?
15:44 <@heinrich5991> yes
15:45 < ACTom> ok
16:33 < ACTom> heinrich5991: Is that replace char *fontFile to const char *pFontFile ? I'm in Windows, now it doesn't have warning.
16:48 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 pushed 5 new commits to master: https://git.io/v2HG7
16:48 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 9651028 Tom: Add font support for chinese, japanese, korean....
16:48 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 7f95961 Tom: fix a compile problem in linux
16:48 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 26a1a9f Tom: replace strstr to str_find
16:48 <@heinrich5991> ACTom: ^
16:50 < ACTom> heinrich5991: I see, thanks~
16:52 < ACTom> heinrich5991: Is there any other message tools does ddnet team use?like Telegram or xmpp.
16:52 <@heinrich5991> it's mostly IRC
16:53 < ACTom> IRC is not stablely when using mobile in China.
16:54 < ACTom> I hate bad network!
16:56 < ACTom> heinrich5991: Is there any data that can let me know the format of map and demo?
16:57 <@heinrich5991> hardly
16:57 <@heinrich5991> the best thing you could do is probably read the source code :/
16:57 <@heinrich5991> and if you're at it, you could document it ^^
16:57 < ACTom> I'd like to build an online map or demo viewer.
16:57 < ACTom> sad, but I'm reading it
16:57 <@heinrich5991> I think some people already took a stab at that
16:59 < ACTom> yeah, a flash version, but cannot open.
17:01 <@heinrich5991> can't find it right now, but there was a javascript version for viewing maps
17:03 < ACTom> really? I'll find it, maybe online demo player is a good project.
17:04 <@heinrich5991> ACTom: here's my documentation for the datafile format: https://gist.github.com/heinrich5991/d7de53d6721070f44e77#file-datafile-md
17:05 <@heinrich5991> (the "outer" format of maps)
17:05 <@heinrich5991> I haven't described the inner one yet
17:05 < ACTom> wa, thanks~
17:05 <@heinrich5991> you can also look at tml "teeworlds map library" (written in python), if you want a secondary source of information for the map format
17:06 <@heinrich5991> if you think something (or everything? ^^) is unclear, tell me, I'd like to improve that document
17:07 < ACTom> ok~thanks~
17:07 < ACTom> And good night~(00:07 for me)
17:07 <@heinrich5991> good night. time zones ._.
