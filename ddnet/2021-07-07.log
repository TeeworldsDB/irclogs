02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> it's work nice
03:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you know that data races are UB in >C11 and >C++11? Very interesting

04:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ALED?> thanks
05:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @heinrich5991 thanks for the compose key recommendation, works great
05:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ññ
05:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> man i can't wrap my head around game engines networking solution
05:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what engine
05:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> work?
05:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> they keep telling you to stuff both server and client logic in the same script
05:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> :justatest:
05:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> ye. unity
05:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i see
05:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sounds like a small project lol

12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FreZZ7> yo guys, short question, jsut to understand it. Does ddnet have a ddos protection? and if not, whats the reason for? is it possble to help? with money coding/implementing or idk?
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 2-3k $ per month might help xd
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ur server?
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> looks like java xd
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> no
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FreZZ7> im playing on german- you just say that as a guess or you know it?
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i meant tsfreddie 😄
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but the 2-3k $ were for ur question xd
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FreZZ7> yeah, i know- so you guessing it or you know it?
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ddos protection is just insanly expensive
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nothing u'll be able to affort
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FreZZ7> yeah i know it isnt that cheap- but it might have been the problem to implement it- thanks bro
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> so many- dashes in the - sentence \:D
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon ever checked if the fps are actually lower? with a external tool
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dunno how to tag u
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> u did good
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i also responded
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> element has a ping based on name like irc and tw chat
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok, if u on linux and use mesa drivers u can just use GALLIUM_HUD=fps ./DDNet
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Jupstar ✪\: dont u belive me seeing that it performs bad with my eyes?
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> seems like i do not use mesa drivers
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is the client open source?
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://github.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-ux
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> pls no ban .-.

13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> do you see emojis tho
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yes

13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> this bridge is really good
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but no troll
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> u
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> reply sucks tho
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LCSG47> :Pepega:
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i mean i think u can see mine but i can not see the replys from discord
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@gerdoe)
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> U
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lol that reply xd
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <visitOP> "Based on DDNet which is based on DDrace which is based on Teeworlds." :kek:
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: seems to be same fps for me
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> which is based on teewars which is based on teepop
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Jupstar ✪\:  wat? did you run the client and test with dummy or what?
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> which is based
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Jupstar ✪\:  it sometimes happens after a few hours of runtime
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i toiggled between them
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> u wont catch that in 5mins
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah thought its always xd
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> nah
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> also u on windows right?
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> no?
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> since when
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since i replaced my nvidia card
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> which always crashed my linux system back then
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> dafok is teepop @gerdoe
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so dunno 3-4 years maybe
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 4 years!?
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> why was i so sure u use windows then?
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> cool game by matricks
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i have windows installed, if a game doesnt run, but lately i can run all games on linux, thanks to more improvements in wine and dxvk 😄
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Jupstar ✪\:  yea anyways i think my client is full of bugs the windows users report crashes .\_. i run some valgrind but didnt find shit
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then i'd say windows is full of bugs
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i also run my teeworlds in wine because the best bot clients are only compiled for windows
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> :kek:
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah yes its probably windows not my client sure \:D
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, just blame the others
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ofc
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> always blame microfost
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LCSG47> Holy what a :Pepega:
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> best tactic... intels fault
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd dejavu
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Jupstar ✪\: but i can recommend you switching to chillerbot-ux as main client anyway \:D then u might spot the fps issue at some point
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Jupstar ✪\:  has juicy features such as "goto\_switch" and "goto\_tele"
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i prefer to not use features, that are suspecious
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> axaxaxax
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> whats suspecious? \:D
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> sussy features
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> chat bots
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or afk bots
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> auto reply when afk such sus
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> oh souly is proud user of cbux then
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well im not saying that ddnet doesnt allow it, i dunno what the rules are
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just don't need such features, not worth it xd
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> u said u have 10k fps
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> sounds like u need a client that lowers it
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> under certain circumstances xd
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> isnt ur client ddnet based anyway?
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> it also has totally non sus features like cl\_remote\_control
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea it is
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then i guess it can perform around the same level ^^
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cl_activate_mining
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> axaxax
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> mining comes soon(tm)
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> *quickly uninstalls*
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is the new prevalent way to do it, both in unity and unreal
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> i mean i get it
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> but it is still pretty annoying
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont like it
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> nobody likes it
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but unreal still has c binds doesnt it?
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nothing better than not using any editor based game dev and take 1000 hours to do anything :greenthing:
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well i can probably still just code the network transport myself
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but i don't think they would let me 👀
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I doubt that. I'm sure most developers enjoy having networking out of the box without having to think much about it
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> >bevy
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually i love ecs based game engines
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its the future, ez paralelism
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> if you want to do p2p or host/clients yes
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> dedicated server stuff is a bit weird
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i heard unreal and unity kinda do it internally now too
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.17/manual/index.html
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ts懒散 unreal atleast has a way to build a dedicated server
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are planning it
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mostl a headless client
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> unity has it too
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its the future
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> still want to try it, but nothing comes up for game idea xd
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @gerdoe i wanted to do a zach-like game with teeworlds theme
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just have to start it
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> inb4 nobody knows zachtronics games :feelsbadman:
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> just the "network layer" we were supposed to use doesn't like separating server/client code very much
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.zachtronics.com/exapunks/
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tis but tees
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but i don't really want to ship server code in client as well.
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> if i don't care, putting both in the same script works just fine.
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> waiting for godot to release 4.0 with vulkan and new cool stuff
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe not caring is the best solution some time.
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> godot is goodot
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i miss it
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can actually use rust with godot
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~or typescript~~
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ts懒散 I have a solution for you, a genius one, so smart your mind will be blown
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> put ifdefs around the server code :thinkaboutit:
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> smart
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does c# hav ifdef
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> unity has it
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a headless client is way too much overhead btw imo
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ikr
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> these solutions were mostly born out of convenience rather than performance
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ye
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> besides, hosting is mostly offloaded to game service providers
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> so in china it is pretty common to do the most convenient solution and let the provider deal with scaling
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> unless you're tencent
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> everyone is tencent
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀 i mean tencent itself
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> not the ones taking/giving money from/to them
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ts懒散 u doing that ddnet clone in unity?
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> 👀
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> atleast in unreal you can hook fairly low to implement your own networking
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't know why i said maybe, they didn't make me sign any NDA or anything
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but boss is looking at me chatting with you guys sooooooo
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does it take lot of time to learn unreal? without the blueprint stuff
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or do u have to actually use that
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and does it feel good to create the maps in their editor, or is a custom one like teeworld's one better to use?
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> :troll:
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> he's literally on the left of me
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes, it's a huge project
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yo boss of tsfreddie
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wouldn't avoid the blueprints, they make it much more fun
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The idea is to make blueprint components out of C++
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> small editor better but less functionality i suppose
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i only tested the godot web editor, but felt like a pain
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but yeah its highly customizable ofc
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so not comparable to blocky teeworlds
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yo @Jupstar ✪  is int64\_t on mac something else than on linux?
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i get this on mac ` error: format specifies type 'long' but the argument has type 'long long' [-Werror,-Wformat]` but the other way around on linux
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in what file
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but its possible its different yes
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> in my haxclient
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://github.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-ux/runs/3008494607#step:6:443
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just replace all int64 with int64_t
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i did
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> that caused the issue
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> maybe i gotta cast it to long  then
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah in printf
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ye
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah thats a pain, but there are also std replacements for that
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> str_timeformat or smth has it
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> for what ?
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for %ld
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but if one is long and the other long long didnt we add possible bugs to the codebase?
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> PRId64
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> seems like previously int64 was long long on every system
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> #include <cinttypes>
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no it shouldnt bug, just always use standard
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> whats "PRId64"
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> int64_t
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the text replacement for printf
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so instead of %ld use %" PRId64 " rest of string"
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> that looks even more messy than my long cast ;D
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but you say thats the good style way?
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its the standard way, i wouldn't say its good xd
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> guess there is a reason c++ added streams, indepentent of, if they good either xD
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i bet boost has some nice better solutions^^
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ur a boost maximalist?
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> want it in ddnet? \:D
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> imo its just a better standard
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i rarely use it, used it in the past
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yo btw how far is your svg render engine for tw? \:p
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> haha, i doubt we'll do it with pure SVGs, but as soon as we have game.svg i'll add support client side to load higher res pngs
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> UHD option basically
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lame
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but still cool
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ what about https://abseil.io/
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i did some progress with jungle\_doodads latley https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/images/tree/master/realistic/transparent/doodads/jungle_doodads
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> never heard of it 😄
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its google own impl of c++ std
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon, 0.7 again?
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> still nice
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its probs way more perfomant too
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd really like to have all mapres too 😄
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Jupstar ✪\: i think jungle\_doodads did not diff in 0.7
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah yeah, i think i heard that exists, sounds good
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> performance best
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since in std u cant implement new found optimizations cuz MUH ABI STABLE!!!
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon nice 😄
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/abi/
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good read
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Making std::regex faster (it is currently faster to launch PHP to execute a regex than it is to use std::regex
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is the standard limiting the performance?
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or is gcc/clangs impl just so bad xD
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its maintaining ABI stability what limits perfomance
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah i see
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they cant implement new optimizations
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the post i sent is gud
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah will read
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as long its based on facts
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and not biased
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> faxx
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it shows the pros and cons
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> of both sides
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is a reason why google made abseil
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but google also has weird code style rules
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean i can imagine there is alot of shit in std, question is how good are compilers to remove that
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u cant remove the shit
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since some ppl rely on the quirks
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, but i mean like if gcc has a gcc c++ mode default
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> smth like that
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> > For example, std::string has a string_view conversion operator that I want to kill with fire, and that might be an ABI break which is not a source break - or an almost silent one-.
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> what? this operator is so useful 😄
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> if they want to remove something, they should get rid of that stream garbage finally
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> iostream and stuff
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the stream is the cout and cin stuff right
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> the worst part of C++ standard library
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> and also quite big one i think
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> overloading the << and >> operator makes u able to do weird stuff
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> exactly 😄
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> making standard library smaller is good for static linking
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just use lto
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then all trash is gone xd
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> hopefully
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use rust and then all c++ is gone xd
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ez af
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ez af
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> best solution 🙂
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but C++ is still nice
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i honestly dont want to do much with it rn
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and im gonna try embedded rust when my STM32F3DISCOVERY arrives
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> i heard even their C indian libs (no offense) are full of bugs
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats that
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> let's hope putting Rust on top of it won't make it even worse
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> development of base libs for modern microcontrollers is outsourced to India to keep the price low
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont need any C when using rust
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> so you know
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but Rust uses some C libs from ST, doesn't it?
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> oh
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> that's nice
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> i heard even their indian C libs (no offense) are full of bugs
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what would be the point of using rust on top of c
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the good thing is using rust directly
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it would be the fact that you can code your stuff in Rust instead of C, right? 😄
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/japaric/f3
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is a lib someone made
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/rubberduck203/stm32f3-discovery> ok this one is more up to date
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> looks like even its dependencies are 100% Rust
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> nice job
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is a nice tool to create these libs https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> so Rust features inline assembly probably
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is an asm! macro
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/library-features/asm.html
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/862311738161496084/unknown.png
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> security vs performance gonna be insteresting in future, especially bcs CPUs probably get closer to single threaded performance
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> guess a pure rust kernel vs linux would be really nice
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ i think we should create the oficial ddnet binaries with some modern CPU features enabled
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like stockfish does
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think we should use lto and ofast
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/862312184129519646/unknown.png
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> hopefully software will finally get less crappy than hardware 😄
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is how they present it
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> top to bottom for most perfomant
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah they can defs speedup alot of operations, especially string operations
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but u know
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we'll stuck with gl 1.x forever xd
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> guess for the new instructions a new processor architecture would solve it
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then we'd have something like a "new" standard
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean c'mon i just want to see if a better CISC processor could give more performance
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> x86 can't be it, and ARM is not really CISC(but also not really RISC either anymore :D)
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i guess ARM's single thread performance comes mostly from the fact amd and intel designs x86 with hyperthreading /SMT in mind
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe games should find a way to not depend so much on single thread perf
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ECS may do this
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> sure, but sync is always overhead
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> physically
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> y
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but maybe its worth it
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean 4-5 threads are common for games
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i bet even ddnet uses more, just bcs the drivers use them internally
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but cpus nowadays have 12
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or more
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder if they use all
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to own a threadripper
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even the name is cool
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 64 cores ez
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> AMD Ryzen™ Threadripper™ 3990X Processor
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Graphics Model
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Discrete Graphics Card Required
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> # of CPU Cores
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 64
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> # of Threads
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 128
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 128 threads poggers
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah insane
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> getting closer to GPU core counts from 15 years ago xD
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Up to 4.3GHz
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with boost
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but probs only on 2 cores xD
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how many cores does a modern gpu have
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean they dont really have cores in that sense
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> more like shading units
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but dunno 4-5k
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do modern games do physics simulation inside the gpu?
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dunno
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://vkguide.dev/docs/gpudriven/compute_shaders/
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think u can do it
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with this
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probs not bcs latency
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but we all know nvidia game physics dont we xd
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can actually implement a physics engine usinhg compute shaders
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rtx 3090 has 10496 cuda units
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is probs done in aaa games
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://forum.unity.com/threads/finished-my-compute-shader-based-game.508623/
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > So, I finally released a game that works completely on GPU
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean its really cool
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> GPUs master race xd
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Looking at $ddos in #bot-cmds looks like most attacks today had very high outgoing packets per second. Is DDNet used in an amplification attack?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe look here
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://ddnet.tw/stats/server/
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probs better for a specific time range
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> hmm just 10 Mbps peak isn't really anything usable for an amplification attack
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> so the attackers arent even doing that
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> wtf is wrong with them
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> on the other hand GER2 had 100Mbps peak
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> on the other hand GER2 had 100MBps peak
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> hmm just 10 MBps peak isn't really anything usable for an amplification attack
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> nvm those are also incoming traffic
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> why does the discord bot show outgoing?

19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh yeah strange xd
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Jupstar ✪\:  its not only client runtime. Reconnecting to the server fixed the fps too \:)
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe its a bug in ur system xd
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> must be a linux kernel bug
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah lets blame linux
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and intel
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 😚
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/862415907368468540/mapinfo.png
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ?
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> both 3 lines
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you won't convince him to rename without the capital P
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :what:
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> p(P)ulsar
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> the big p mapper huh
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> the capital p mapper huh
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> 🅱️ulsar
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :cammo:
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i generally like to have it a bit different, but probs would move Insane to the stars, minor stuff 😄
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> it's simple thing and ,so much better  😦
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> but ok
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> idk you agree with me or not :ww:
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i think a better order of the components moving them into new lines would be better
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so yes i generally agree 😄
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ok cool
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> @TsFreddie did you tried this one?
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> for your srv?
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> i got this errors with this way

23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> nya
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> what nya
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> what wrong 😄
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> nya for fun'
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> that doesn't help me 🙂
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> but nya if you want 😄
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> nya
