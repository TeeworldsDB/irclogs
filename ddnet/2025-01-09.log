07:25 < bridge> <learath2> I gave it a review, LGTM. Who needs this?
07:48 < bridge> <teero777> I do :owo:
07:49 < bridge> <learath2> What are you planning?
07:49 < bridge> <teero777> Can't tell
07:50 < bridge> <teero777> But that pr is very useful
07:50 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i do
07:51 < bridge> <learath2> I bet it's for making bots, wow I can't believe you'd do this to us
07:51 < bridge> <teero777> Actually not this time xd
07:51 < bridge> <learath2> So you do actually make bots, wow
07:51 < bridge> <learath2> Officer, this man here
07:54 < bridge> <teero777> nonono I wouldn't ever
07:54 < bridge> <teero777> @totar can confirm I have never made bot in my entire life and this pr is useful
07:54 < bridge> <teero777> @totar can confirm I have never made bots in my entire life and this pr is useful
07:55 < bridge> <totar> I promise it's useful
07:56 < bridge> <totar> if it was for bots he would tell you
07:56 < bridge> <louis> i do
07:56 < bridge> <louis> for tune lock

09:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> Hey smokky how about you don't post a screenshot of a desktop with a bot client .rar file? Thank you.
09:12 < bridge> <kiler94> I don‚Äôt have ddnet that won‚Äôt start, I log in and it immediately crashes, what should I do, please help me
09:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> @kiler94 update your client on https://ddnet.org/downloads or use steam
09:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
09:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> Also please delete the bot client everyone can see on your desktop - or you'll be banned :greenthing:
09:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Haha gottem
09:13 < bridge> <kiler94> how to remove bot client
09:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> why even ask to delete it, just ban him
09:13 < bridge> <kiler94> No pls
09:14 < bridge> <kiler94> I will delete my word of honor
09:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> Owning cigarettes is not as bad as smoking one. I won't ban him just because he has that file on his PC
09:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> Delete it and update DDNet and you'll be fine.
09:15 < bridge> <kiler94> Fine Thank you
09:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I love buying cigarettes when I don't smoke
09:16 < bridge> <kiler94> what should I do? I followed the link but I can‚Äôt find the site to update and where to click
09:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @milkeeycat: yea? Which ones?
09:19 < bridge> <louis> what if i love smoking cigarettes that i don't have to pay for
09:22 < bridge> <kiler94> I updated everything, but it still doesn‚Äôt work for me, you can upload a tutorial if you have an hour
09:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> illegal ones üò¨
09:24 < bridge> <kiler94> I updated everything, but it still doesn‚Äôt work for me, you can upload a tutorial if you have an hour
09:27 < bridge> <kiler94> fuck why did I lose my server log I need to fight again
09:32 < bridge> <kiler94> help me pls!
09:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
09:43 < bridge> <kiler94> please tell me how can I put everything back so that I can go to DDnet and I have the time I beg you
09:45 < bridge> <totar> it would be easiest to install the game with steam
09:45 < bridge> <totar> then you cannot break anything
09:47 < bridge> <louis> you can try to backup your AppData/DDNet folder, then delete it before reinstalling
09:48 < bridge> <louis> search %AppData% in windows search, then open that folder and the DDNet folder should be there
09:48 < bridge> <kiler94> bro I log in via Steam and it pops up and this is what is displayed for me

09:49 < bridge> <louis> try what i wrote above
09:49 < bridge> <louis> move that file outside of the folder (put it on ur desktop to make a backup), then relaunch game without that file
09:49 < bridge> <louis> move that file outside of the folder (put it on ur desktop to make a backup), then relaunch game
09:49 < bridge> <louis> alternatively, just rename your DDNet folder smth else, like DDNet_backup
09:50 < bridge> <louis> alternatively, just rename your DDNet folder smth else, like DDNet_backup, then relaunch the gamem
09:50 < bridge> <louis> alternatively, just rename your DDNet folder smth else, like DDNet_backup, then relaunch the game

10:06 < bridge> <learath2> I have a pack of cigarettes from 2021 that I only smoked like 2 out of üòÑ
11:27 < bridge> <louis> TsFreddie: are you still interested in taking the PR over, and if not, could you give the sauce on how to make it handle without special handling? :heartw:
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> How does it help if ddnet merges it if you end up using it in a own client and server anyway
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just merge it
11:37 < bridge> <teero777> huh? if this was for local i wouldn't care if it gets merged to ddnet
11:37 < bridge> <teero777> why do you even think i want to have this merged? xdd
12:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> Teero making his own server‚Ñ¢Ô∏è????

13:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> Good choice - smoking sucks ( i go through 1 pack of snus every day )

13:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> Aw hell na
13:36 < bridge> <learath2> @heinrich5991 what new thing do you see the 45 degree bind becoming a command enabling?
13:39 < bridge> <learath2> We are obviously on very very different pages here. There should be no unknowns to this at all. There is a bind that already makes this exact thing possible. It just behaves a little better
13:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah nice
13:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Cords as spec is something I for sure was missing sometimes thanks for working on it @pioooooo
13:44 < bridge> <kiler94> I don't have settings_ddnet.cfg in my ddnet folder
13:45 < bridge> <kiler94> What should I do? How do I log in to the ddnet I'm crashing
13:47 < bridge> <kiler94> Pls
13:50 < bridge> <louis> just delete the entire ddnet folder (after backing it up somewhere) and reinstall / re-launch ddnet
13:52 < bridge> <kiler94> How to delete the entire ddnet folder and back it up

13:54 < bridge> <kiler94> I have already deleted the bot client
13:55 < bridge> <oxyzo.> :greenthing:
13:58 < bridge> <zhn> bro
13:58 < bridge> <zhn> stop posting screenshots with bot clients archive on them
13:58 < bridge> <learath2> Just crop the damn screenshot, it's not rocket surgery
13:59 < bridge> <oxyzo.> thats just zip file with homework on it
13:59 < bridge> <syrinok> You just know he'll cheat the moment his problem gets fixed too
14:00 < bridge> <syrinok> and louis is helping him, gg
14:00 < bridge> <kiler94> No way, I just want my account back and play koga and that's it
14:00 < bridge> <louis> innocent until proven guilty ü´°‚úä
14:01 < bridge> <syrinok> Proven guilty by having it on his desktop
14:01 < bridge> <syrinok> The universe has filtered this guy out, let it continue
14:01 < bridge> <kiler94> I removed it immediately
14:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 do you still plan to make your programming language?
14:04 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe, idk, I don't feel like doing something that doesn't have anything novel. So I need to come up with a concrete plan
14:11 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> whats the point of echo in remote console
14:12 < bridge> <zhn> to talk with authed people :troll:
14:29 < bridge> <0xdeen> What could go wrong? I'm pretty skeptical of all these promises. It's a bit like disabling CI to speed up developer velocity, works in the short term, but you'll have an unmaintainable mess in a few months.
14:30 < bridge> <0xdeen> But then I'm also skeptical of IDEs for similar reasons, so maybe I should just accept being a luddite üòÑ
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Today's AIs are good for small scripts without a doubt, so I expect this code review to be good in that too.
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But yeah for any medium sized projects probably already useless^^
14:34 < bridge> <learath2> I feel #9465 is going a little off-track with a very (IMHO) meta debate
14:34 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9465
14:36 < bridge> <syrinok> Patching it out entirely (quoting hein) is impossible, unless we wipe the game
14:36 < bridge> <louis> the implementation needs some more work btw
14:36 < bridge> <syrinok> Plenty of r1s make a lot of use of the bind
14:37 < bridge> <syrinok> I guess you can argue you don't NEED the bind for these r1s, but they definitely helped
14:38 < bridge> <syrinok> Also how do you remove it from older clients?
14:38 < bridge> <learath2> It most certainly does. I just don't get the point of a large meta discussion of other dummy features in there
14:39 < bridge> <syrinok> Also how do you remove it from older clients?
14:39 < bridge> <syrinok> (Only way is to force the latest client)
14:39 < bridge> <learath2> You don't. Heinrich made a suggestion on how one could remove dummy aim e.g. but I don't see how it applies to this situation
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that 45¬∞ snap thing is really a annoying thing xD
14:40 < bridge> <louis> personally i think we should force updates so we can implement cool gameplay changes as well as phase out old jank üò¨ but my opinion might be too much for that conversation
14:40 < bridge> <syrinok> I think it should just be a feature, it definitely makes the game less annoying to play, some parts are bullshit without it
14:42 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> :justatest:
14:43 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i agree
14:43 < bridge> <syrinok> "We could remove such features by removing them the next time we add a quality of life feature so that people will have to decide whether they want the new QoL or the old "features"
14:43 < bridge> <syrinok> 
14:43 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya, nothing would make me swap out of being able to use angle bind
14:44 < bridge> <learath2> You can add whatever gameplay you want without forcing updates. If it's absolutely impossible to make it work with old clients we can have a minimum version on some maps
14:44 < bridge> <syrinok> It's too convenient
14:44 < bridge> <syrinok> Then people will just make their own client, and that'll become the main client
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> true
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if we remove it we also have to say using it is cheating
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and old ranks had an advantage
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> making the feature easier must always imply that this is a ddnet only cheat
14:47 < bridge> <syrinok> Seems like a crazy decision, then a new branch of servers shows up because of said crazy decision :greenthing:
14:48 < bridge> <louis> what if the update is something like updating the .map structure to decouple maps from images? i'm not sure if that's easy to implement for all versions without keeping two map file types on all servers
14:48 < bridge> <louis> at some point the extra trouble doesn't seem worth it
14:48 < bridge> <louis> maps from images -> images from maps*
14:49 < bridge> <learath2> I think it's just a meta discussion that is in the entirely wrong PR. There is no buff we could offer on the "other side" to make people take the nerf of never being able to line up a double/triple rocket ever again
14:49 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya
14:50 < bridge> <learath2> I don't even know what the "other side" would be in this case. Some other change that makes double/triple rockets easier? That would change the dynamics of the game waaay too much
14:50 < bridge> <louis> yeah, it doesn't make sense in the context of the 45 bind
14:50 < bridge> <louis> i guess it only makes sense for dummies
14:50 < bridge> <louis> which should be nerfed anyways IMO. copy/deepfly while both dummies are unfrozen is hax
14:50 < bridge> <louis> which should be nerfed anyways IMO. deepfly while both dummies are unfrozen is hax
14:50 < bridge> <syrinok> Make wall hammers easier, they're only the most precise common mechanic in the game. :greenthing:
14:51 < bridge> <syrinok> Though only noobs would care about this change
14:51 < bridge> <learath2> This is 100% doable, if we think a new format is worth it and if we develop a nice new format I'd personally do the backcompat for it
14:52 < bridge> <learath2> I'm very skeptical of changes to gamefeel. We have something very special at our hands, anything that makes it easier or harder might just alienate a lot of players
14:52 < bridge> <learath2> Even the autohammer change was veeery controversial
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> How _annoying_ is using the current 45¬∞ binds anyway?
14:53 < bridge> <louis> i guess you're a lot nicer than me, i wouldn't trade gigs of server space for the 50 players on older clients
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Like does it make aiming afterwards harder?
14:53 < bridge> <learath2> It's not that bad, but it'd be nicer if it was just a nice command that you can bind normally without digging into the wiki
14:53 < bridge> <learath2> I don't think gatekeeping players with a wiki is the way to create "difficulty"
14:53 < bridge> <louis> yes, but i was more concerned that it's not visible to noobies and requires you to substitute mouse sens in the console
14:53 < bridge> <murpi> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9460
14:53 < bridge> <murpi> Very annoying, because it doesn't work half the time for me
14:54 < bridge> <syrinok> Good players simply press it for a quick shot and release it, it's possible to get 100% used to using it, but it does feel janky for most players
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I generally agree, but e.g. in ddnet-rs 45¬∞ doesn't really work, since i increased the cursor accuracy client side. And some day I'd need to think to allow this _cheat_ purposely for ddnet servers
14:54 < bridge> <learath2> I would just rebundle it at startup
14:54 < bridge> <learath2> I would just rebundle it at startup/map change
14:54 < bridge> <learath2> cache the most common 50 or so bundles
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think that is a new bug isnt it?
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> since we for whatever reason decided that zoom changes the cursor
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> which imho is a very bad change anyway
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cursor to me is relative
14:55 < bridge> <murpi> It's really not, aiming straight upwards always works. it's the other directions which stop working
14:55 < bridge> <louis> eh good point, i guess that's an easy problem then
14:55 < bridge> <murpi> Also, I'd like to just throw this into the room, we have maps which utilize the 45 degree bind
14:55 < bridge> <screeeny> i first noticed it august for me https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/757720336274948198/1274320251542306897
14:55 < bridge> <learath2> I really should have been paying more attention to what was going on with all the spec/cursor/zoom changes. We are just making a mess here
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well august is "new" for me
14:56 < bridge> <syrinok> Which is the exact argument when talking about removing weak
14:56 < bridge> <louis> @murpi can you name the maps
14:56 < bridge> <louis> i thought they can all be done without the bind -- as in you can manually take the time to aim 45*
14:56 < bridge> <murpi> Nope, I just know stronghold, linear and multeasymap by name
14:57 < bridge> <learath2> I don't understand this, it's not a "cheat" if we say it's not a "cheat". Like all the dummy features
14:58 < bridge> <learath2> (We as in whoever makes the rules, if kog says it's a cheat it'd be a cheat on their servers)
14:58 < bridge> <syrinok> autumn, helps with bind
14:58 < bridge> <syrinok> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1326912982944579605/image.png?ex=67812783&is=677fd603&hm=4ff18a61027d19a30ef2057fe4df234d2f4b82223c0f8511eeeb2217f01465b6&
14:58 < bridge> <syrinok> Plenty of other maps with parts like this
14:58 < bridge> <syrinok> some in ddmax some in brutal
14:59 < bridge> <louis> hasn't the aim-depending-on-zoom been a thing for a while
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I was about the _even easier_ version
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I thought that is what the issue is about
14:59 < bridge> <louis> this is the same as saying the bind makes triple nading easier, you can still do it manually it just takes more time
14:59 < bridge> <louis> it's not really required
14:59 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya and
14:59 < bridge> <learath2> "even easier" is just making the bind into a command and making it justwork instead of being a weird consequence of rounding rules and something
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes yes, my point was that the current 45¬∞ snaps since they rely on max distance, _might_ be harder to use
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so if we allow it, simply make sure we have a consens that this is for ddnet mods only
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or ddrace
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Eg. I don't like that it relies on the accuracy of the local cursor
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that i 100% agree with
15:02 < bridge> <learath2> Oh, well the pvp servers don't have our weird cursor/zoom changes. They already have a similar amount of jank. I'm also unsure how useful a 45degree bind is on a pvp server
15:02 < bridge> <learath2> So maybe we can just disable it on every other server to be safe?
15:02 < bridge> <learath2> But I very much doubt it matters if this is easier
15:02 < bridge> <syrinok> When are we removing hookcol, it makes hooking through edges far too easy :greenthing:
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i dont want to lie
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think hookcol should be a practice only command
15:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly we introduced it 2000 years ago
15:03 < bridge> <syrinok> Playing without hookcol is a fucking nightmare. lol
15:03 < bridge> <learath2> I too was a 0.5 player, I also thought entities was cheating üòÑ
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It partially is xD
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean i also play with entities, since it always existed
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but if it wouldnt exist it would give a advantage
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but if it wouldnt exist it would give an advantage
15:04 < bridge> <syrinok> Time to go back to the past, bros
15:04 < bridge> <syrinok> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1326914376526991473/DDNet_jI7MBhxaxo.gif?ex=678128d0&is=677fd750&hm=835d3aafd3f033d3daa00ab55af155faf4f3ce388fb0e3793499df8a2eb830a6&
15:04 < bridge> <murpi> *starts firing pistol frantically until one bullet flies through the corner*
15:04 < bridge> <learath2> To be extra fair. I also thought/think the 45 degree binds are cheating
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think they are actually a massive cheat
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u cannot be rocket pro without them
15:04 < bridge> <learath2> But I understand that we allowed these and gameplay was built around these, so now it's a necessity. I don't think anyone lines up their rockets anymore
15:04 < bridge> <learath2> But I understand that we allowed these and gameplay was built around these, so now it's a necessity. I don't think anyone lines up their rockets by hand anymore
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no rocket pros at least üòÑ
15:05 < bridge> <learath2> I still double rocket by hand but I also fail like 2/5, and I can't triple rocket almost at all

15:05 < bridge> <murpi> @screeeny Didn‚Äôt you use a cool background to help with lining up your aim?
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @screeeny can we talk....
15:06 < bridge> <learath2> The entities change also made all the "secret" locations non-secret üòÑ
15:06 < bridge> <screeeny> yea i had a cutom background that highlighted important angles. for example jetpack on similar height, 1st 2nd 3rd ground sg
15:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah no math was way too easy on run guy
15:06 < bridge> <murpi> That's pretty smort, ngl
15:07 < bridge> <screeeny> still kinda unreliable to use
15:07 < bridge> <learath2> I actually do not know the exact angle for jetpack at same height, I just have to figure it out every time üòÑ
15:07 < bridge> <learath2> Is it 45?
15:08 < bridge> <screeeny> i dont remember exactly but it was lower ithink
15:11 < bridge> <screeeny> this is also kinda fun to do with abusing max distance https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/746534464984973323/1312952943896694790

15:26 < bridge> <bp_unmoggable> hello, from what commit should I build ddnet to get 18.9? I only see 18.9-rc4 tag
15:26 < bridge> <bp_unmoggable> Why did the original versioning even change, it makes it more confusing now
15:28 < bridge> <learath2> I think deen didn't tag 18.9 yet
15:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> @0xdeen can u tag it whenever u can, maintainers need this
15:33 < bridge> <learath2> We should re-look into making the entire release process more automated

15:54 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, it is just a very stupid delay I added that doesn't branch on anything, just an unconditional delay
16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> any easy issue to do?
16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i always want to do smth but i get lazy
16:25 < bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9492 this should be absolutely trivial, though idk if the discussion ended
16:27 < bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9481 some of these are pretty easy, though we might want to ship more UX along with this
16:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> you could do some rearrangement of ingame chat commands if you want :3
16:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was more looking at here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9405
16:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> since its a segfault, its the full c++ experience
16:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got the backtrace locally
16:30 < bridge> <learath2> Also looks pretty easy, @robyt3 seems to have already debugged it though, so maybe check with him that he doesn't already have a patch cooking?
16:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> doesnt loko like he made a fix
16:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway i dont mind duplicate work
16:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> doesnt look like he made a fix
16:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> accounts :santatrollet:
16:45 < bridge> <robyt3> I only checked if I can reproduce it, haven't worked on a fix
16:47 < bridge> <tutti_fruti3> q all
16:49 < bridge> <tutti_fruti3> Who can help to compleat KOG afternight?
16:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you better ask in #general or simply on the server directly
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok i thin i know the issue
16:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> the issue is trying to create a tele layer outside the game group
16:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> the game tiles button should be available on groups other than game

16:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> nvm
16:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not that xd
16:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> it simply doesnt create the tele layer

17:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> well my process for this bug was to spin up gdb and get the crash, which the issue had nice text on how to reproduce it, then i saw that it was an out of bounds access and then looking at the code and knowledge of how the  editor works i found it
17:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> describing "looking at the code and knowledge of how the  editor works i found it" might be a bit harder

17:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> > In Rust, pointers are not simply an "integer" or "address". For instance, a "use after free" is undefined behavior even if you "get lucky" and the freed memory gets reallocated before your read/write. As another example, writing through a pointer derived from an &i32 reference is undefined behavior, even if writing to the same address via a different pointer is legal. The underlying pattern here is that the way a pointer is computed matters, not

However, when casting pointers to integers and back, the provenance of the resulting pointer is underspecified. With this release, Rust is adding a set of APIs that can in many cases replace the use of integer-pointer-casts, and therefore avoid the ambiguities inherent to such casts. In particular, the pattern of using the low

17:51 < bridge> <eidderFsT> move the direx out, and let angle use that too.
17:52 < bridge> <eidderFsT> basically calculate what is being sent to server and just let angle show that instead of based on mousepos. so you convert mousepos to int and get a direction that way
17:53 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i would check how exactly mousepos is converted in `controls.cpp` i have a slight suspision that the current implementation doesn't match. or maybe it does, i cant really remember

19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sry bro, but the interest into these old versions equals 0
19:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u have to find out yourself
19:00 < bridge> <learath2> Eh, airline pricing is just a blackbox, it's really hard to figure out why. Maybe it's a date thing, maybe it's a government subsidy thing
19:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> going directly = 300‚Ç¨ going to a nearb yairport = 60‚Ç¨ + train
