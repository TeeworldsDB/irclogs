00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> fixing bugs = nono -> ddnet thing ðŸ˜€
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> happy that i got this one through
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1760
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> im almost sure the only hit 1 tee bug is used in some map
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You mean freeze or explosion?
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> explosion
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i guess no
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why?
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> [9:31 PM] Im 'corneum: but i found a cool thing to map with it:greenthing:
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if he has an idea to use it, so had probably someone else
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> there are 2-3k maps
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i wouldnt be surprised if someone used it
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> He has the idea now that he knows it
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> he found it during mapping as i understood
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> its a known thing since forever
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> tbh... When a map relies on obvious bugs... Just remove it
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but we dont know the map
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> +1 redix
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you cant remember every part of every map
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> I know... Won't happen
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if you could find all maps that abuse the bug, you could work around it maybe
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thats what we did when we fixed stoppers
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> I just don't get it... When you are mapping and notice a bug... Why do you use it as a feature and not report it instead ðŸ˜’
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but collecting all maps that have specifically rotated stoppers is easier than finding maps that rely on such a specific behaviour
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> they arent devs xd
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> to them it doesnt matter
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Yeah you're right ðŸ˜•
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> I'm pretty sure the speedup code isnt correct either... The max speed thing looks odd. But fixing this would definitely break maost
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> I'm pretty sure the speedup code isn't correct either... The max speed thing looks odd. But fixing this would definitely break maps
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> is anything correct? xd
01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> new hookthrough maybe
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> The original ddrace physics code isn't that great... But you can easily get this wrong and there is just no documentation... And at this time there was nothing like a code review for tw mods
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```// Explode at most once per team
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>             int PlayerTeam = ((CGameControllerDDRace*)m_pController)->m_Teams.m_Core.Team(apEnts[i]->GetPlayer()->GetCID());
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>             if (GetPlayerChar(Owner) ? GetPlayerChar(Owner)->m_Hit & CCharacter::DISABLE_HIT_GRENADE : !g_Config.m_SvHit || NoDamage)
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>             {
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                 if (!CmaskIsSet(TeamMask, PlayerTeam)) continue;
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>                 TeamMask = CmaskUnset(TeamMask, PlayerTeam);
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut>             }```
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this is the broken part, what would be the correct fix?
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> NoDamage is true when the projectile (in this case from the map) has no owner, so its -1. Setting NoDamage to false would fix it, but I want a "correct" fix xd
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (just for myself right now, not ddnet)
03:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes @deen  some official build with official version number. Something that replaces my handcrafted releases i sent over discord.
10:56 <@deen> @ChillerDragon any preferred version number to start with? 0.1, 1.0?
10:57 <@deen> and it would be great to have a properly working tool for converting maps to 0.7
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I think itâ€™s not perfect yet so 0.1 but probably a bit more useful to use 1.0 to not clash with vanilla versions.
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oh yea the map tool :/
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 1.0
