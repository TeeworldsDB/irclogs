12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> 
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> I don't get this vid
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> üòÇ
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can see me doing turkish translations in 2:44
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 does your wireshark dissector still work?
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well at the very least packet_decode is completely unaware of these new packets
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I see why timakro kinda hacked around the token cache
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wireshark dissector doesn't work for 0.7 packets, no
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't implement the 0.7 protocol
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if we can get the ddnet token protocol compatible with the token cache
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's the issue?
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Issue is that I don't even know where I'd start that as it's two completely different approaches
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. the ddnet one doesn't have the concept of peer tokens
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't even think we do tokens for our connless partners
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that's true, not a on the protocol level
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that's true, not on the protocol level
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 can you use a procedural macro on a binary program in rust?
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, sure
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a binary crate is not that different from a library one
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but to use proc-macro
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it requires [lib]
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> error: the `#[proc_macro_derive]` attribute is only usable with crates of the `proc-macro` crate type
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/722422829433487380/unknown.png
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's for declaring a proc macro
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to declare a proc macro
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and use it
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you have to declare it in a separate crate
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> meh
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that cannot be done in the same crate as the library/binary that uses it
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why?
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd guess because it'd cause a two-stage building process otherwise
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it were declared in the same crate as it's used, you'd first have to compile the proc macro code to be able to read the rest of the crate
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `[regsixup]: WARNING: No master servers. Retrying in 60 seconds` this is one part I didn't think would require any work given I didn't touch it
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> talked too soon
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> HAHAHA
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay cool
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so now i am not the only one anymore having problems with 0.7 master
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mine more than likely stems from some token mess
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> see
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> aaand idk what's wrong
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> great
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> @deen Could you please add a score limit voting option to zCatch SA servers üôÇ Lots of people are requesting it
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut do you know how I can disable all the masters but one so I can actually debug this?
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nope haha
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> amazing usability by matricks
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fine I'll patch it out
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> iptables
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what is the point of a masters.cfg if you'll just ignore it...
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk lol
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it choses a master, gets a token, sends a heartbeat, has a stroke and asks for another token
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, I saw a similar pattern in the pcap from the guy hosting @fokkonaut's servers
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but if you could also put gdb to work, we can probably find the root cause @Learath2
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe just patch MAX_MATSERVERSERS to 1 or so
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah already did that and used master4 so I can tcpdump on ddnet.tw if needed
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not really necessary, you could tcpdump locally as well
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but I doubt my issue is related to his, the fw?? never seems to make it to `CRegister` for me
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> could you log whether messages are dropped due to invalid tokesn?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I don't understand what timakro did here, but I don't think the masterservers messages token is ever verified
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro ^
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Hm?
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tbh I don't even know what token is going where anymore
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 connless packets contain two tokens
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Me neither, in the beginning I tried choosing two consistent names for the client and server tokens but I gave up after a while so if it's called ReponseToken or SecurityToken or Token, it means nothing
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> one token for "how can you answer me"
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and one token for "this authenticates that I do own the source address"
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm the fw?? never makes it out of Recv anyway
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I even left a note for this, yes it's dropped for an invalid token
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> The way I get the tokens (don't ask me which one I don't remember) from the NetworkServer::Recv function to the CServer::PumpNetwork function is ugly
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As I inherited it from you, mine is also ugly
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The UnpackPacket twice isn't too pretty either
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It was the only way without major changes
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but none of this mess is easy to clean up, I wasted like a month trying to clean it up
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> took a week to get things to here as soon as I gave up on the low level networking ever being clean
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> b
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, the random requests for token are still there though
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it registers
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ImJustANobody what numbers are reasonable? 10, 20, 600, 1000?
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 isn't this new connless protocol very noisy? Every time someone needs serverinfo they need a 520b token message
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> isnt that the point
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's the idea I think
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> to make it harder to ddos
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the request has to be >= the response
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> to avoid amplification attacks ye
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> To this day I don't understand why the master server register protocol works without this line in 0.6 https://github.com/unique-clan/unique-race/commit/160d35d1bd3e90fe0ae89a1fae64122ab7e2d17a#diff-2b61fb3875a3e845adc670e15aa20fb7R308
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> The state machine is just broken without it
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> probably some race condition that's more often taking the correct path than not
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I don't know if this fixed it but master server connections always time out and take like 3 tries to get going
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Every teeworlds server log that ever existed constantly get those warning lines, and that's not udp packet loss
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the masterserver is the worst coded part of teeworlds imho
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> here is to hoping we'll get http masters someday
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> someday
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even if someone did it
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would be a slow process i think
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and backwards comp
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/teeworlds-master-server
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never finished it
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz i dont think anyone would like it anyway
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> @deen 150, 300, 500, 800 Would Be fantastic üôÇ
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ImJustANobody too late, added different values already üòÑ
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> The masterserver code also had very little changes over the years. When I was working on the 0.7 masterserver stuff I compared to 0.7 and there are hardly any differences between ddnets outdated 0.6 and 0.7 there
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> What are those magic numbers? ^^
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If a couple of you have time can you join my server?
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> @deen Awesome ! Thank you so much üôÇ Appreciate it
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> @Learath2 What's the ip?
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> learath2.info
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice maintainance
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it has been under maintainance for 4 years
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I've got time, just finished a difficult exercise sheet for uni. Got to get me head free
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustANobody> @timakro Well done !
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Thanks xD
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 the 520b packet for serverinfo was added late and in a rush
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't see a better solution, except putting it somewhere else like http masters
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just found the weirdest bug
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which is? üôÇ
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> somehow when someone leaves and someone else joins they use the wrong info
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> another impossible to debug one, two in a day
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> "info"?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the guy who joined had the other guys name, skin, etc
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Doesn't sound familiar, sorry
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd like it to be easy every once in a while üòõ
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Make sure you have no "delta unpack failed" in the client logs. I tracked down a problem with spectator mode to the snapshot level, wasn't fun.
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Make sure you have no "delta unpack failed" in the client logs before you do testing. I tracked down a problem with spectator mode to the snapshot level, wasn't fun.
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a dbg_break on delta unpack failed just for that reason
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> üëç
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've had my fair share of fun with snapshots, especially combined with UB
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it worked perfectly on macOS half worked on linux üòÑ
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I wonder why matricks didn't generate the engine level protocol aswell
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2256/commits/29d0b1f52399ca218f7096da4dd29213d128cb15
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Turns out you can even cherry pick this, I don't know how to generate this part of the protocol easily
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Oh thats short
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Nice
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro do you remember how you handled joining after spectating?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The join button just says "locked" :
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> maybe the client thinks there are 0 players ingame allowed
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> in one version we sent spectator slots in the other version we send ingame slots
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i think in 0.6 it used to be sv_spectator_slots and now its sv_player_slots or smth similar
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aha, only 0 active players are allowed
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I need to send a `NETMSGTYPE_SV_SERVERSETTINGS`
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I keep forgetting the new messages
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, this is all the bugs I could track down. The rest will take some people to actually test this
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I couldn't reproduce the teeinfo thing so there is atleast one bug I couldn't find
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what teeinfo Bug?
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When a tee leaves and another joins, it sometimes takes another tees information
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm thinking I'm missing one of the new messages somewhere that should be sent to sixup when someone joins but I don't see it
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I have a cmake question
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Sv_ClientInfo and Sv_ClientDrop
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's been there since the beginning but I forgot about it. With this I now require Python3 and I'm using cmakes builtin FindPython3, but that bumps the cmake requirement all the way up to 3.12
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I'm not sending Sv_ClientDrop at all
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its on OnClientDrop
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in*
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I missed it, works surprisingly well without üòÑ
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Here I go digging into cmake documentation again üò¶
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> #2256
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, that fixes CI. I'm done with it for now, it just requires more testing by more people
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll work on more QoL changes like the chat commands
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 question resolved?
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 if `find_package(PythonInterp 3)`¬†does what I think it does
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 This seems useless https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2256/commits/29d0b1f52399ca218f7096da4dd29213d128cb15#diff-25bcc1bcfab43c7e0957ca2fa89fe34fR1260
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> 14 & 15 is NETMSG_RCON_CMD_ADD and NETMSG_RCON_CMD_REM which is only sent by 0.7 servers
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, yeah not really important at all, was just on autopilot :D
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 what is rcon login name?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On vanilla you can only connect to rcon if there is a default_admin/mod/helper
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can only use a username with a ddnet client
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ok didn't know ddnet had usernames
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah `CAuthManager` handles that
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> `// login name, now used` so the protocol always had it but ddnet used it and then they removed it in 0.7 i guess?
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> silly
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought so too
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 yes, that works
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Merged, send developer role for me :danAmazing:
22:00 <+ChillerDragon> meh why doesnt cmake find my python3 isnt that a common name for python 3.x?
22:01 <+ChillerDragon> or do i have to replace my /usr/bin/python w python3 ?
22:02 <+ChillerDragon> What merge konsti? Are u ddnet dev now? :D
22:07 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1592338010.png omg not even virtual env works
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> @ChillerDragon no but i suggested the turn off entities tile for front layer cuz it worked but wasnt shown in editor xd
