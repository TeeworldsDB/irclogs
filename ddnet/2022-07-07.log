00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but they're also separate because of resource usage in the client IIRC
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> valgrind is unhappy ðŸ˜¦

08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> Lmao dude in reddit comments wrote library that the malare uses ðŸ’€

12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> funny we talked about size yesterday
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32007695
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ML compiler has probably no guarentee on the correctness of the output
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> or its fake ai
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I think thats false
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/994555935081103470/unknown.png
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> interesting comment
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The ML is applied to "what optimizations to do" rather than producing code as is
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Idk if i expressed myself well xd
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ok, they use ai on things that are easily verifiable (i mean, the result is verifiable)
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> both problems can be quite hard to solve, especially register allocation which is NP problem i believe
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not really, they just use AI to decide which optimization to apply
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like they use AI to decide which chess move to play
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> I was worried on output correctness, but those problems solutions are easily verified. From the first google link, it's just graph traversing for inlining and register allocation, but i didn't read until bottom of page ðŸ˜„
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> I don't have time to rebase <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5545> right now, i'll do it tomorrow or on saturday
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> at least, i already saved the commit on another branch otherwise i'd have forgotten and lost them (but i think github would still have a copy from the PR?)
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> git reflog can show you old commits
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Paralix> Comand for see stars and not snow in freeze?
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does not exist
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Paralix> ðŸ˜®
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Paralix> is not possible have the old assent?
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> until your git gc deletes them locally too
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Systemd-Creator-Microsoft
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> :/ now he is funded for the entirety of his life to push his shitware
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmmm
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bad news i guess
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got the itch to code ddnet stuff but i got no time
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sad life
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> As soon as Heinrich adds rust u have to be active again. We need u then; P
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk i dont have much hope for that
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (to work out)
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Nothing is impossible
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why not? I'm kinda sorta okay with it unless it balloons the executable size or looks too ugly at the interface
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk, i love rust but you have to be reasonable, most devs here dont know it, it adds complications due to FFI, etc, so we gotta rly talk it out xD
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and if ddnet was more modular it would be easier
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> okay, ill rebase my naming pr while in the train and push tonight or tomorrow
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Train coding is very relaxing
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ðŸ‡¼ ðŸ‡¹ ðŸ‡«
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> wtf
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well not that much ðŸ˜„
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I like it if the ride is longer than an hour
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> touchpad is too sensitive and train giggles
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> mine is 3 hours
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wifi works great in there btw
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> haven't tried ddnet yet ðŸ˜„
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ez solution, don't use touchpad
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> kbm only
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `s/m//`
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> neovim ftw
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actuall
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://helix-editor.com/
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this might be better
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have to give it a better look
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> modern neovim reimagined in rust
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/994691614775717988/unknown.png
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> I use this, it is good but has a tendency to crash
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh rip
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its pretty much alpha
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its rly new
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kokoprali> idea: you can ping clans in chat
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> easier spam
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rejected
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASEDHALT:
