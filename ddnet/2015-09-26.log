00:12 < [pieLover]> what's up with the shutting down in october thing
00:21 < eeeee> heinrich5991: should we have an appropriate topic to answer that ^ ?
00:22 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: I guess so. if you can think of something appropiate, I will set it
00:23 < Donate4DDNet> eeeee: who is the new hoster?
00:23 < eeeee> heinrich5991: DDRaceNetwork ends on October 1: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2347
00:23 < Donate4DDNet> deen i miss you yet :( youre so cool :( 
00:24 < eeeee> wait or maybe http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2344
00:24 < Donate4DDNet> noone will do such for ddnet :(
00:24 < eeeee> k thx
00:25 <@heinrich5991> thanks for the good idea
00:25 < Donate4DDNet> theres anything in my eye, oh its water :(( 
00:26 < Donate4DDNet> whats now with ddnet?
00:28 <@heinrich5991> Donate4DDNet: as I understand it, the current plan is for it to shut down soon
00:28 <@heinrich5991> Donate4DDNet: but I just read the forum post, so I don't know any specifics or even if my understand is correct
00:34 < Donate4DDNet>  yeah shutdown at 1 october but do anyone host? pls i loooove ddnet so much
00:34 < ochristi> the problem is probably not hosting, but maintaining the whole thing, that takes up a crapton of time
00:36 < ochristi> those who are capable to do this, usually have to less of that time on their hand
00:36 < [pieLover]> I'm hosting some backups of the downloads of the client/server in case the website doesnt get a maintainer or whatever. http://pcde.tk/ddnet/
00:37 < ochristi> [pieLover]: you could always compile them from source
00:37 < [pieLover]> not all the versions, because as you see, it takes a lot of space for my mostly-full 20gb server
00:37 < [pieLover]> yes but not all players will do that, we know that damn straight
00:37 < ochristi> sure
00:37 < [pieLover]> i'm hosting backups of the source as well
00:38 < ochristi> [pieLover]: that is on github, I doubt this will be removed
00:38 < [pieLover]> not all players know what a github is.
00:38 < Donate4DDNet> but the mod ddnet is alive!?
00:38 < [pieLover]> people are stupid, remember that
00:39 < Donate4DDNet> whats github? i just know at website
00:39 < [pieLover]> also, if the site does go away for some reason, them finding the github is slightly less likely
00:40 < ochristi> those who are dealing with the source are aware of github, I am sure
00:41 < [pieLover]> you're being negative toward me hosting some backups?
00:41 < [pieLover]> there's no harm done, why negative?
00:41 < ochristi> [pieLover]: sorry, I surely do not mean it that way :)
00:42 < Donate4DDNet> deen if you read that, thank you for the gread time with u, i'll do my best and cyao i maybe host some server but i am 12 i dont understand anything with source ans so on, and maps or whatever,              deen, we all love you

01:52 < gr33nt3a> Hello!
01:53 < gr33nt3a> I want to offer my help for ddnet.
01:53 < gr33nt3a> Is this the right place? :D
02:05 < [pieLover]> yep, i believe so, but they sadly need people and time not money, which is harder to come by
02:20 < gr33nt3a> I am a software developer and want to give tiem
02:20 < gr33nt3a> *time
02:25 < gr33nt3a> My time to be more precise :D
09:45 < Vandincot> Greetings
09:51  * Vandincot slaps Vandincot around a bit with a large fishbot
11:54 < Sv47> Hi guys! I see some news, the servers is go dows on october 1-st? (sorry for my english). Are there admins? How many resource your need? I work at internet provider and have server, IP, and 100 Mb/s chanel. I can give for game it =)
11:58 <@heinrich5991> Sv47: the problems is mostly that we'd need someone who organizes the stuff. and ddnet is often hit with huge ddos attacks, e.g. "50gbit/s udp flood"
11:58 <@heinrich5991> I'm not an official resource on that though
12:07 < Sv47> ohh.. its so big traffic... its amazing ddos attack to small game) soon Ill be have 1Gb/s chanel, and I think the servers firewall can block it without big lags. But the problem if DDNet is shutdown forever =(
12:09 < Nimda> run_dragon by LordSkelethom just released on Race at 2015-09-26 12:00
12:09 < Nimda> run_dude by Ubu just released on Race at 2015-09-26 12:00
12:09 <@heinrich5991> you probably can't block such a ddos attack with a firewall, but I'm no expert here
12:09 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: ^
12:24 < Sv47> I can block the IP or ports, if it not help I have the "rights" to call the head-provider or the RIPE to ban the ddos IP forever, I was has problems with ddos-ers but not that big =)
12:44 < sdsdfsdf> >>ban the ddos IP forever
12:45 < sdsdfsdf> xD
12:45 < sdsdfsdf> it's botnet usually not one server
12:46 < Sv47> botnet yes... its many IPs but its to easy to blick
12:46 < Sv47> block*
12:47 < sdsdfsdf> okay)
12:49 < Sv47> ok. On monday I try to speek with my friend and think what we can to do for server to dont lost the powerfull tee project =)
16:21 < Ac1dBeef> > I can block the IP or ports, if it not help I have the "rights" to call the head-provider or the RIPE to ban the ddos IP forever, I was has problems with ddos-ers but not that big =)
16:24 < Ac1dBeef> if you have control over you bgp announces and can do flowspec, you'll probably handle attacks, but if you don't it will be no difference from regular collocation.
16:29 < EastByte> deen: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2347&start=70#p26052
16:29 < EastByte> so there is an offer to take over maintenance
16:31 < BeaR_> EastByte: there is?
16:32 <@EastByte> there is not?
16:32 < BeaR_> u mean fifi or gr33nt3a?
16:33 <@EastByte> gr33nt3a and fifi wants to help, if I understand correctly
16:34 < Ac1dBeef> If you need someone with unix admiinstration background, I can handle maintanance of servers.
16:55 < niora> Hello
16:55 < BeaR_> hi \o
16:56 < niora> i heard from a friend that the servers will stop
16:57 < BeaR_> niora: indeed, the full post can be found here http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2344
16:58 < niora> i and im a sys admin and hacker i mostly focus on linux and making high performance server systems for banks
16:58 < BeaR_> maybe some people will take over ddnet or start a new project (:
16:59 < niora> so who is responsible for the servers i can talk to
16:59 < BeaR_> currently deen is still in responsibilty
17:00 < niora> cool thx 
17:00 < BeaR_> you can also write a post on the forum, but well
17:01 < tyurd> hi, any idea to fix this error? compiling using linux. http://hastebin.com/odasowawep.vbs
17:01 < WolfAlex> niora: so you are to blame if my bank goes down ? like every weekend? :D
17:02 < niora> my i ask at which bank you are?
17:02 < WolfAlex> Postbank (frankfurt) ._. 
17:02 < niora> no im not responsyble for it 
17:02 < tyurd> xd
17:03 < WolfAlex> oh ok :(
17:03 < tyurd> where are you from niora?
17:03 < niora> Austria
18:59 <@deen> EastByte: never seen either on ddnet
18:59 <@deen> wouldn't want to give the project to some random people
19:00 <@deen> EastByte: there are many other offers by 11 year olds or people that have never played on DDNet
19:02 < Ac1dBeef> deen: will it be problem if i am playing ddnet for only 2 weeks?
19:02 <@deen> Ac1dBeef: sure, who guarantees me that you won't just stop working on ddnet in 2 months?
19:03 < Ac1dBeef> well ok, no questions then
19:07 < laxa> deen: how long do you think it would take to setup a server for ddnet only without any extern connection and no website (juste game servers with actual records and scripts)
19:07 <@deen> laxa: don't understand the question
19:07 < laxa> just the game servers as they run right now, with DB
19:08 <@deen> they are set up already, what's the problem?
19:08 < laxa> Well
19:09 <@deen> I'm currently setting one up, and did so yesterday as well
19:09 < laxa> They'll go down on the 1st octomber
19:09 < laxa> if I get a root server, how much time/work is needed to get just a set of ddnet servers running with current records and everything working as right now
19:10 <@deen> dunno, 30min?
19:10 < laxa> well ok
19:10 < laxa> This is just a script to run right ?
19:10 <@deen> no
19:10 <@deen> there is no script, i do it by hand
19:10 < laxa> Hm ok
19:10 < laxa> Well
19:10 < laxa> I can make you some offer then
19:10 < laxa> I have no intention of keeping the actual ddnet alive
19:11 < laxa> but I'd like to run "ddnet" in France for example
19:11 <@deen> yeah, i noticed that people REALLY love the idea of running their own ddnet servers now
19:11 < laxa> I just have not the time to deal with some huge servers network
19:11 < laxa> if you want
19:11 < laxa> just remove all servers and let just GER run
19:12 < laxa> or something
19:12 < laxa> but you want everything to keep running as I understood
19:12 <@deen> of course, just running GER would be ridiculous
19:12 < laxa> Well
19:12 <@deen> same amount of work, but no servers worldwide
19:13 < laxa> No one has the time / experience to make DDNet run as it is right now :(
19:13 < Ac1dBeef> i think the main problem are not servers, but continuation of client/server development.
19:13 < laxa> Ac1dBeef: that's actually not needed
19:13 < Ac1dBeef> why&
19:13 < Ac1dBeef> ?
19:13 < laxa> only if critical bug/exploit
19:13 < laxa> ddnet servers and clients are in production
19:13 <@deen> I just want a single person I can trust to give server rights to
19:14 <@deen> how that person keeps the servers running, with help of multiple people, that's their choice
19:14 < laxa> Well
19:14 <@deen> so all these people i've never heard of proposing to help don't really help here
19:14 < laxa> If no one in this channel is interested doing so, don't think no one would be suitable then :(
19:15 < Ac1dBeef> if game is not improved, it dies. everybody can run a server, but to make releases a core team or authoritative maintainer is needed.
19:15 <@deen> right, that was my conclusion and why i shut down the servers
19:15 <@deen> and now they want to make a public search for someone, which is ridiculous
19:16 <@deen> shutting down ddnet feels like more work than keeping it running...
19:16 < laxa> Dunno what is time consuming about running ddnet without doing anymore developments
19:17 <@deen> also, some admin is deleting messages in the forum of people saying they can help keep ddnet running, that's weird to say the least
19:17 < Ac1dBeef> deen: aren't there any people willing to take over project, whom you trust?
19:17 <@deen> Ac1dBeef: nope
19:17 <@deen> laxa: talking to 100 people every day, making sure the servers run perfectly, fixing server bugs, setting up new servers
19:18 < Ac1dBeef> at all? nobody showed any will?
19:18 < laxa> deen: most of it is not especially the root admin job
19:18 < laxa> I am talking really server side work to do
19:19 < laxa> My mind right now if I take care of ddnet/"my ddnet servers": it run autonosmouly, I have to take care of nothing except when real problems are there : ddos/server died/crashs/db problems etc
19:20 <@deen> laxa: well, that would be nice
19:20 <@deen> but people come nagging me about DDNet all day long
19:20 < laxa> that's why I am not interested in taking care of ddnet : to me it sounds like it needs too much work : especially cause you have 10 servers connected to each other
19:20 < laxa> deen: find a head that'll take of ddnet community
19:20 < laxa> *take care
19:20 <@deen> laxa: well, didn't find anyone
19:21 < laxa> taking care of ddnet project and doing root admin work are 2 things completely different
19:21 < laxa> I am sure someone like Onion might be interested in doing the Project management/community thing
19:21 < Ac1dBeef> laxa: if deen wants to pass ddnet to single person, his repsonsibility is not to continue doing everything alone, but to organize development of ddnet. If He is capable of doing all job alone, it's ok, if not - then he's duty is to assemble good team.
19:21 < laxa> and having someone like EastByte or anyone else keeping the servers running
19:21 <@deen> laxa: Onion has maybe 30-60 minutes of time per day
19:22 < Ac1dBeef> so this person does not really have to be a programmer of admin at all
19:22 < Ac1dBeef> he have to be 1. trusted; 2. good organizer
19:22 < laxa> It should already be enough
19:22 <@deen> anyway, this discussion is useless
19:22 <@deen> laxa: if we run ddnet like that with "30 minutes a day is enough" then I rather want it shut donw
19:22 < laxa> if it's not, you can make a FAQ or ticket solution
19:23 < laxa> That's why I am asking about the standalone 'ddnet' server
19:23 < Ac1dBeef> deen: "30 minuted per day" was told generally in context of server's maintanance (it's really almost enough for that).
19:23 < laxa> You complain about people wanting to run 'ddnet' on their own, but, no one is suitable to make things exactly like you'd like them to be
19:24 < laxa> I see that as our only choice to keep playing DDRace/Teeworlds actually
19:24 < Ac1dBeef> at first it'll be needed to spend some time, but then maintanance won't take much of it.
19:24 < laxa> Like you deen, I'd better see your project running like you did
19:27 < laxa> Otherwise, just tell me what choice we have
19:28 < Mahdi> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. I love DDNet. Don't leave
19:28 < Mahdi> :(
19:33 < Ac1dBeef> Is there anyone who plays on ddnet long enough, who is not 11yo :) and have some will to keep ddnet alive, to organize continuation of it's development, to deal with overcoming problems and make a team?
19:33 < laxa> Well
19:33 < laxa> It's going to be simple
19:33 < Ac1dBeef> not really
19:34 < WolfAlex> Ac1dBeef: no there is noone like that 
19:34 < laxa> If the 1st october, ddnet goes down, and no one has launched ddnet
19:34 < Ac1dBeef> laxa: see?
19:34 < laxa> I'll make a standalone server
19:34 < laxa> so people can play ddnet
19:35 < Ac1dBeef> laxa: a lot of people will, and that's one of the worst cases.
19:35 < Mahdi> I use DDNet client more than servers
19:35 < laxa> Ac1dBeef: I don't think so
19:35 < Mahdi> It should not go down. It's the best teeworlds client ( even better than the default ) 
19:35 < Ac1dBeef> the main problem is continuation of sw development and ratings.
19:35 < Mahdi> And I thought you were getting it on Steam. 
19:36 < Ac1dBeef> Mahdi: unlikely with current situation
19:36 < Ac1dBeef> valve won't accept game without responsible team
19:37 < Ac1dBeef> or responsible developer
19:37 < laxa> you don't need development as I said
19:37 < laxa> teeworlds and even ddrace ran for years without any patches/develoment
19:37 < Ac1dBeef> laxa: if nobody will maintain code, it will "rot" and less and less people will play game, so soon servers won't be needed.
19:38 < laxa> you barely know teeworlds
19:38 < laxa> this game has more or less the same amount of players as when I started
19:38 < Ac1dBeef> you barely knows software development :)
19:38 < laxa> 1000 players at peak time
19:38 < laxa> I am a software developper
19:38 < laxa> this is a game
19:38 < laxa> not an application or something
19:39 < laxa> we don't even talk about money or something
19:39 < laxa> we just talk about letting actual players to play
19:39 < Ac1dBeef> for how long could you stop touching your code until there will be no users of it?
19:39 < laxa> I am done with this conversation
19:39 < Ac1dBeef> ok
19:39 < laxa> you seem like a commercial
19:39 < laxa> not a developper
19:39 < Ac1dBeef> well, i am sysadmin
19:40 < Ac1dBeef> so "operational" part is significant to me :)
19:40 < laxa> servers running is enough
19:40 < laxa> deen: that would be enough for 500+ people http://www.online.net/en/dedicated-server/dedibox-classic ?
19:40 < Mahdi> Teeworlds is on steam now and hopefully it means new players and if the players are more the development should be too. And DDNet would have to try to be developed as well... Or maybe I'm just too optimist
19:41 < laxa> We are talking about running ddnet servers, and you are talking about development
19:41 < laxa> that's the least of my current issue with ddnet
19:41 < laxa> deen is not the only one developping for ddnet
19:41 < laxa> you'll hopefully still able to run your client even if ddnet goes down
19:42 < laxa> Lots of applications have little to no more development at some stages
19:42 < laxa> you don't necessarly needs to improve it or add new features
19:42 < Ac1dBeef> laxa: if you look there https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/graphs/contributors, you'll see that he actually is.
19:42 < laxa> last version of vanilla teeworlds was like 2 years ago or something
19:43 < Mahdi> That's why vanilla Teeworlds is awful and DDNet is NOT
19:43 < laxa> you compare potatoes and carrots
19:43 < Ac1dBeef> latest vanilla teeworlds version was less than year ago and there is upcoming release
19:43 < laxa> that was a minor patch to fix bug
19:43 < Ac1dBeef> and it's is actually developed
19:43 < laxa> no new feature
19:44 < Ac1dBeef> it has about 25+ commits for the last month.
19:45 < Ac1dBeef> and 7 for last week
19:45 < laxa> wow
19:45 < Ac1dBeef> it's enough for small project to think, that it's well maintained
19:45 < laxa> people don't give a fuck about it really
19:45 < laxa> they don't even know what programming or github is
19:46 < Ac1dBeef> but people don't play games, that are not developed at all
19:46 < laxa> This one is
19:46 < laxa> developped
19:46 < laxa> and running for more than 5 years
19:46 < laxa> don't get your point
19:46 < laxa> we are talking about running servers to play on
19:46 < Ac1dBeef> "this" is ddnet or teeworlds?
19:46 < laxa> you are talking about developping new features
19:46 < laxa> both
19:47 < laxa> you don't understand what is opensource apparently
19:47 < Mahdi> vanilla teeworlds is featureless in comparison with DDNet
19:47 < Ac1dBeef> yep, teeeworlds is developed, ddnet won't be if deen quits.
19:47 < laxa> you can't be sure of that, if no major bugs is found, I don't see that as a problem
19:47 < Ac1dBeef> laxa: i understand opensource enough to think that projects usually dies if noone maintains thir code.
19:48 < laxa> Whatever, I am bored of this, I'll open something if no one does
19:48 < Mahdi> It's right that in opensource everybody can develop an app/game but without a development team we're just gonna have different useless versions of the app
19:59 < laxa> deen: will you give forum database to someone ?
20:46 <@deen> laxa: no problem to keep it running
21:10 < eeeee> laxa: i think you should do yourself a favor and just create your own ddrace server. ddnet brand will only bring you more ddos attacks.
21:53 < laxa> eeeee: aaa told me that, I agree
21:53 < laxa> I guess I'll just integrate it as ddracepro.net ^^
21:54 < laxa> deen: what was your last message the answer to ?
22:54 < laxa> deen: are you here ? :x
23:04 < [pieLover]> any updates on the ending thing?
23:16 < [pieLover]> like the steam greenlighting, how's that going to be effected?
23:18 < Ac1dBeef> [pieLover]: if there wouldn't be any responsible developer or team, valve definitely won't approve game.
23:31 <@heinrich5991> <Ac1dBeef> for how long could you stop touching your code until there will be no users of it?
23:31 <@heinrich5991> for a pretty long time, actually
23:31 <@heinrich5991> ddrace wasn't under active development for several years, I think
23:32 < laxa> I told him that
23:32 < laxa> he doesn't understand it
