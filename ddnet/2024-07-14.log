00:03 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
00:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i literally only got it to function and then went to sleep lol
00:03 < bridge> <Ewan> me too
00:04 < bridge> <Ewan> expo 2
00:04 < bridge> <Ewan> 6000MHz
00:09 < bridge> <0xdeen> Thanks @milkeeycat !
00:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @mpft `anyhow` also seems unused. but it shouldn't be unused, all the `unwrap`s and `panic!`s should return errors instead ^^
00:18 < bridge> <Ewan> sure
00:19 < bridge> <Ewan> not that saying this exempts me from that but I Literally Only Got It To Function And Then Went To Sleep
00:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if that means "I don't want to hear anything about the program", then sorry
00:55 < bridge> <chairn> python programmers be like
01:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 `str_copy(aBuf, "‚òê", sizeof(aBuf))` does not seem to work
01:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1261824093314093067/image.png?ex=66945cc3&is=66930b43&hm=82c42f57020e3e08d185fd8ea0e8b9671a9257db9496f64a8096aa97341f3c85&
01:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> when hovering, the IDE shows it as questionmark already
01:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> and that's how it's displayed ingame
01:22 < bridge> <zhn> strange though, utf8 copying/formatting works pretty well (on linux)
01:22 < bridge> <zhn> are you sure you have utf8 encoding?
01:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
01:28 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe you have a locale issue?
01:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> They get saved correctly in the file
01:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> and i can use the same text everywhere else
01:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> including inside of teeworlds
01:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it's just that the unicode characters turn into shit
01:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i remember i had this issue once with the whisper arrows, dunno how i fixed it
01:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
01:30 < bridge> <learath2> Wym turn into shit? As in your editor has issues with them?
01:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ye, probably, as you can see when i hover this is being displayed
01:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ah, i fixed it
01:30 < bridge> <fokkonaut> encoding has to be utf8 without signature, instead of signature
01:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :)
01:42 < bridge> <Ewan> i do appreciate the feedback but it's also a little bold to assume i hadn't thought about these things. being unfamiliar with the language makes it hard to just quickly knock shit out like that, even if i had already thought about it
01:42 < bridge> <Ewan> a lot of it is in the tone/wording, i know you're probably doing your best but prefacing your criticisms with "by the way" or "if you didn't know" goes a long way lol
01:44 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe if i was like "yeah i spent a lot of time on this and i'd like to see what you think" then it'd be appropriate to nit like that but i'm obviously still in the process of fleshing it out
01:44 < bridge> <Ewan> if it wasn't clear when i said i got it working then slept
02:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> pyson gangster
09:50 < bridge> <Ewan> i think all of your concerns have been addressed now
10:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> tell me when I'm allowed to give feedback
10:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > it's also a little bold to assume i hadn't thought about these things
10:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I did not mean to imply this
10:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > a lot of it is in the tone/wording, i know you're probably doing your best but prefacing your criticisms with "by the way" or "if you didn't know" goes a long way lol
10:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> to me, prefacing these particular statements with "by the way" or "if you didn't know" makes them sound more like I'm implying that you don't know
10:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i see that
10:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i can see that
10:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: who's playing with ur name? :justatest:

11:11 < bridge> <Ewan> any time
11:11 < bridge> <Ewan> we are here
11:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sorry for my nitpicking your feedback. thanks for taking the time to tell me how you felt about this
11:14 < bridge> <Ewan> in hindsight i did kind of bite your head off lol
11:15 < bridge> <Ewan> it was just frustrating because you were saying exactly what i already knew but didnt get around to doing lol
11:15 < bridge> <Ewan> not super reasonable to expect you'd know anyway
11:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `.into_os_string().into_string().unwrap()`
11:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> on a path can be replaced by `.display()` if you just want to display it to the user
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> oh sweet
11:18 < bridge> <Ewan> why doesnt it implement the Display trait?
11:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because file paths can contain "characters" that aren't valid strings
11:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> both on windows and on linux. on windows, they can contain unpaired surrogates (something that relates to weird implementations of UTF-16) and on linux they're unchecked bytes (except for / and \0), so they don't have to contain valid UTF-8
11:21 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
11:21 < bridge> <Ewan> isn't there another one too
11:21 < bridge> <Ewan> into srting lossy or smth
11:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, that's the same as the `.display()`, but slightly less efficient
11:21 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
11:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you work on windows or on linux?
11:27 < bridge> <Ewan> linux rn
11:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the shell should be handle globbing for you
11:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> btw ^^
11:27 < bridge> <Ewan> fish doesnt like globbing properly for me
11:27 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
11:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what do you mean?
11:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> fish doesn't glob the way you want to?
11:28 < bridge> <Ewan> it does now >_>
11:28 < bridge> <Ewan> that i say something
11:30 < bridge> <Ewan> and even if so i don't think it would replace the strings in a compatible way
11:30 < bridge> <Ewan> cuz i use ; delim
11:30 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe i could just use multiple input args but this seems good for now
11:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, probably works. globs need to be quoted now
11:32 < bridge> <Ewan> good imo
11:33 < bridge> <Ewan> guaranteed consistent across shells
11:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> IMO not so good, because the user knows their shell and the program will interpret the globs differently from their shell. also, it has weird behavior if filenames contain glob characters
11:36 < bridge> <Ewan> how would the shell glob it? delimited by space?
11:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i usually never use the shell glob lol
11:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i use find in scripts
11:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the shell globs it by putting it into separate arguments
11:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hi
11:37 < bridge> <Ewan> so `-i=*.png` would do `-i=a.png -i=b.png`?
11:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. in a directory containing two files `a` and `b`, it'd turn `ls *` into the three parameters `ls`, `a` and `b`
11:38 < bridge> <Ewan> oh
11:38 < bridge> <Ewan> yea i could just make inputs unnamed
11:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, `-i=*.png` would not work, unless you have file called like `-i=foobar.png` (with the `-i=`) in your current directory (which would also be cursed, I guess) ^^
11:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea
11:39 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
11:39 < bridge> <Ewan> well
11:39 < bridge> <Ewan> food for thought
11:39 < bridge> <Ewan> not sure exactly how ''d handle an undefined amount of unnamed args as inputs
11:40 < bridge> <Ewan> makes any other unnamed param impossible
11:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yup
12:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> thats me doing legit gaming (trust me bro)
13:09 < bridge> <pathos3005> If possible, can anyone confirm with me on game state updating?
13:09 < bridge> <pathos3005> 
13:09 < bridge> <pathos3005> Is there any difference between Teeworlds and DDNet on how the game state is updated?
13:09 < bridge> <pathos3005> 
13:09 < bridge> <pathos3005> I see that DDNet updates 50 ticks per second. This means 20ms each tick. What if the player's ping/jitter/disconnect is 50ms or 500ms for a brief moment? What part of the game state is checked then updated, and how frequently? Any partial updates or is everything full updates?
13:36 < bridge> <learath2> @0xdeen where is the core?
13:38 < bridge> <learath2> found it
13:46 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah it has something to do with the address :/
13:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I don‚Äôt know for sure but the way the core game state is handled should be the same in ddnet and teeworlds.
13:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also the game state does not depend on the clients ping. If you have a 900 ping with 1 fps and 90% packet loss. The server will still let for example gravity apply the same speed in the same time to your tee.
13:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
13:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The server handles the state and it ticks 50 times a second. The client just sends inputs. And the server sends the game state as a snapshot which always a diff to the last snapshot the client acknowledged.
13:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So if your client drops all packets for 500ms the server will still have computed the full state 50 times a second using your latest input. And it will keep sending you that new information of the game state as a diff to the state you last acknowledged which was before the jitter.

17:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i'm going nuts haha
17:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> been working on a custom vote menu class since yesterday evening
17:10 < bridge> <fechewy> ok
17:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> It's pretty much done for now, but it's a pain in the ass to work with the strings from the description
17:25 < bridge> <zhn> :troll:
17:25 < bridge> <zhn> you'll not believe but i did the same previous night
17:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> really?
17:34 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
18:09 < bridge> <zhn> yup
18:10 < bridge> <zhn> not vote menu only though
18:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> What did you do specifically?
18:36 < bridge> <_vencha> hello i have a server and few people are playing right now. i want the ban some people without me being on the server
18:36 < bridge> <_vencha> i looked at the external console thing. but i want to manage it with a program with gui. is there like this on github or somewhere else?
18:45 < bridge> <0xdeen> I haven't tried it: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10827
18:46 < bridge> <_vencha> i cant download built version
18:46 < bridge> <_vencha> and i dont know how to build source
19:46 < bridge> <zhn> wait is it possible to bind `spectate_closest` on rmb?
19:55 < bridge> <hekkeyne> I'm here a week later
19:55 < bridge> <hekkeyne> is there anything new?
19:55 < bridge> <hekkeyne> Hello
20:44 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @gerdoe, what are you working on? A server mod?
20:50 < bridge> <zhn> ye, bw
20:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> nice leak

22:57 < bridge> <egyt> Well, time to boot in Windows
22:59 < bridge> <egyt> Well, time to boot in Windows... oh wait, I'll have to compile it...
