08:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> otherwise life would be too easy
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That's the nicest squatter mail I've received so far. Usually they just threaten to pay now or they'll increase the price later.

15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You never know if these will ever  come back up ðŸ˜›
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wanted to do a reinstall on that host anyways but I need to back up 731G     of teehistorian data
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> jeez
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is this irc on quakenet?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 when you are here can you make sure your collection is working? I like to make sure atleast someone else is collecting before I go reinstalling this host
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> haha rip heinrich
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> everybody needs heinrich 24/7
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats why i offline since days he needs a chillout xd
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon yes it is, #ddnet on quakenet and I think #ddnet in freenode
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> we have two ircs?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> which is this bridge linked to?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes like the #teeworlds one
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol i didnt know that
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does this mean i miss half the communication -.- =
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bridge makes sure everything gets everywhere
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 1TB of backup space is 8 euros a month :/
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> as long as it's just backup rsync it to an external drive, i do that for my vms
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not downloading 1TB on my shitty home network, I'll need to upload it back after reinstalling this system ðŸ˜›
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd much rather have it on hetzners network where I can easily do 120MB/s
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> 8â‚¬ still is a pain in the ass :p
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm, maybe I should get a server upgrade while at it, then I can just copy from the old one to the new one
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> I had an hubic account that was something like 50â‚¬/year for 10To, the offer stopped this summer, now i use an old pc at home
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now that sounds like a pretty cool deal
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well I need to restart this server if I don't want to back up at 10MB/s anyways
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so here goes nothing :/
15:44 <+Learath2> that is as soon as I find my encryption keys :P
15:44 <+Learath2> because yes, I was stupid enough to do full disk encryption, on a server....
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 send help on oodnet
16:19 <+ChillerDragon> Oh nice since when i got the sick +
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i think the hookline is broken
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/519535250414632985/screenshot_2018-12-04_16-27-01.png

16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm?
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> in the first pic the line clearly goes under the hook
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is this collsion down there
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> this is a weird colo
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> r
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Im 'corneum and can you hook?
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> no
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> doesnt looklike normal collision too me
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> did u mod your entities
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> no
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> guess the length of the hookcol is too long or it's rendered at the wrong place
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can you try on a horizontal wall aswell?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> sure
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> its the same
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> 
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/519536007968981002/screenshot_2018-12-04_16-29-44.png

16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is this new?? I can't believe something like this could have gone unnoticed for so long
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> maybe you can hook a tee as soo as he touches the line
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> maybe you can hook a tee as soon as he touches the line
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> which is what the line is mostly used for
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hopefully ðŸ˜„
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> well yes, but you can hook before the line touches.( defauls skin)
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> making a proper hookline would need prediction because sometimes you need to hook before the line turns yellow. when the other tee is fast
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That'd be more of a cheatline then a hookline ðŸ˜„
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yeah
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but then there would need to be 2 modes
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> or the tip of the line needs to be marked for hook and tees
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i found another bug,  when you go through a 'cant hit others tile' and shoot through a player with shotgun or laser, the beam will also have no effect on you while when you dont hit the tee, your laser will hit yourself.  grenade works fine tho
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> @deen meh i have mutt running now it is a rough user expireince for now
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> And i feel very insecure having my gmail pw in plaintext in some configfile
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 I bought a new 2.5" 5 TB disk for 100 â‚¬, seems more reasonable than "cloud backup"
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum it's the distance for the tee, can't make it perfect since distances for tiles and tees is different
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cloud sucks anyways
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon Personally I have a server that runs fetchmail, procmail, then I sync the mails using unison to all my computers and just read them with mutt. sending makes mutt connect to the server and msmtp them. So mutt is just the graphical interface for the mail directory, can also just read the mails using less and send with echo | ssh msmtp
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and you do that because you didnt find any setup that is more haxxor and complicated? xd
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Set it up 11 years ago, needed no changes since then and worked fine
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats a long time how old r u ?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 28
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> quick maffs
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's not that hacky, more like "each program does one thing"
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> unix style
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its funny to call a terminal app graphical interface xd but i get it
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I will do it in 11 years then
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> at work I use Outlook Web thingy so it evens out ðŸ˜„
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> who is ur mail provider?
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> home mail you mean?
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I used to run deen@ddnet.tw on my own, but got really annoyed by having to complain to Microsoft, Google etc about them blocking the ddnet.tw ip address as spam
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nobos
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> felsin9.de is just some free 1and1 stuff, but all I need is IMAP and SMTP anyway
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you have a .de domain for free? lol
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, more like "included in the dsl contract anyway"
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh cool
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well i have no idea how mails work but i dislike using gmail cuz google
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i wish to have something more selfmade one day
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It kept breaking for me, so I don't recommend running your own for practical reasons
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmm not very motivating :c
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ha, was looking for the old tutorial I followed and the top comments here sound familiar: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16238937
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> "I run my own mail infrastructure. To say the least I wouldn't recommend it even to my worst enemies. It's horrible."
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ouch
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rip another dream of yung chilldreguhn
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I mean you can do it for fun
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> doesnt sound fun tbh
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but maybe don't depend on it for your job applications
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i would enjoy the end result
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and show off in front of freinds that dont care at all
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just run cmatrix on a full screen terminal, impresses them more
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is cmatrix
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> spounds really trashy
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> most people would be impressed by any console with random stuff like i3 with ncmpcpp+htop+tty-clock is usually enough
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and then you open chrome to check your mails lol
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> ðŸ˜‹
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Just use browsh to be cool again: https://www.brow.sh/
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> lol i used uzbl back in the days
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> qutebrowser is the modern one I think, but I'd miss addons
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to get a proper fetchmail setup on my server aswell but couldn't really be assed so far
