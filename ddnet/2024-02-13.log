00:26 < bridge> <zhn> wut
00:26 < bridge> <zhn> didn't i explain
00:27 < bridge> <zhn> its shorcut of my old ass nickname Zohan606 that i used before 0.5 went full empty
00:27 < bridge> <zhn> also it refers to Don't Mess with Zohan film
00:34 < bridge> <learath2> Did you not update for months and compile with pen and paper?
00:35 < bridge> <learath2> My daily upgrades usually take 20-30 minutes on my old ass 4770k and they happen in the background while I do other stuff
00:35 < bridge> <Ewan> 4770k is an awesome cpu
00:36 < bridge> <Ewan> and idk i like to have packages
00:36 < bridge> <Ewan> not a problem on arch cuz im just downloading binaries
00:36 < bridge> <Ewan> what de are you on & stuff
00:36 < bridge> <Ewan> because i was using the reduced gnome image
00:36 < bridge> <learath2> It used to be great. Now it's 10 generations too old with far too small a core count
00:36 < bridge> <Ewan> would still be great as a home server or something
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> not a cpu i would want to run on my desktop
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i bought a 4770k on ebay a few years ago and it never arrived :feelsbadman:
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> so i refunded and bought another for $30 more
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> and now my cousin has it and it sits in his closet
00:48 < bridge> <zhn> :justatest:
00:48 < bridge> <Ewan> ebay's refund policy is good
00:49 < bridge> <Ewan> not really afraid of scams there as long as i pay through the website
01:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Woah I thought 0.5 is older than that movie
01:26 < bridge> <zhn> nah, otherwise adam sandler couldn't put his effort into tw0.5.3
01:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
01:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg my vscode boots so slow i tab out while its booting and then it hijacks my active tab again when it finished that is unaccetable harrasment! Is this a gnome issue? Vscode issue? Idk how to fix it. I just never want any application ever to tab it self into the active application
01:55 < bridge> <-StormAx> how the heck `g_Config.m_ClPredictionMargin` works?
01:55 < bridge> <-StormAx> like
01:55 < bridge> <-StormAx> if that less than its better?
01:56 < bridge> <-StormAx> like less = better?
01:57 < bridge> <zhn> its like buffer of prediction
01:57 < bridge> <zhn> and less doesn't equals to better especially if you have lag spikes (you will have em in any case)
01:58 < bridge> <zhn> or packet loss
01:58 < bridge> <zhn> thats about more^ though
01:59 < bridge> <zhn> if you'llset small margin you will just have stretchy prediction (afaik)
04:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki i want using the ``static`` keyword to throw compiler errors like -Wno-static-variables but that does not seem to be a thing. Pls add to edlang that you can opt out of any keyword.

09:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> everybody knows that "temporary" fixes are always left in codebase :santatrollet:
09:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Does someone by any chance know if there is a clean revert for this method call https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/76aeb8e781cc7e48a39a5c2bb4b962a674147eff/src/game/editor/editor.cpp#L3353
09:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``UI()->MapScreen();`` seems to set the view from like world view to absolute view or something like that. And I would like to get the state before.
09:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lol got it xd
09:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dude i starred at this for 30 mins omg 
09:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I need ``Editor()->GetSelectedGroup()->MapScreen();``
09:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> All going fine and according to plan so far :) 
09:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1707813263.png
09:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> After becoming protocol hacker. I now unlocked editor genius. If you have any questions regarding editor code or need editor2 im here for you. Its on my CV now.
09:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Soon I will use those two skills to unlock live mapping o.O
09:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Imagine it would render the tees playing on the server you are connected to in the map editor. And updates are reflected live in game.
09:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Imagine ..
09:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> But 0.7 first of course.
09:52 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hi
10:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> i decided ill be collecting links i share
10:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> here https://edgarluque.com/misc/
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> cool
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> it wouldn’t be that hard
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> just a lot of footguns i think
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> assert_eq!(
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki>     [Some(1234).as_slice(), None.as_slice()],
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki>     [&[1234][..], &[][..]],
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> );
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> TIL
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.as_slice
12:46 < bridge> <Ewan> yes i definitely understand this code :monkaS:
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's basically a shortcut to wrap a value into [value], while leaving none empty
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or to describe it in English
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> An option is basically like an array. None is empty array, while some is an array of size 1
15:18 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Idk either
15:19 < bridge> <Ewan> what is the purpose of the statement
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Normally using option you would need to use the map fn to achieve the same what as slice does here for u
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I've never used it like this
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno if it's ever useful
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But it exists xdd
15:24 < bridge> <kekomonter> Tried to update my client to new ddnet version :pepeW:
15:24 < bridge> <kekomonter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1206969269628436490/image.png?ex=65ddf0ba&is=65cb7bba&hm=22da9f7ab325267d948678ea2ef7d37f8272264f661b183b0db348c5ebc20395&
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Hot
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Some work for u xd
15:27 < bridge> <kekomonter> :pepeW:
15:27 < bridge> <kekomonter> I need a lot of tea
15:48 < bridge> <Ewan> is it a casual botting chat kind of day
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> it is
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a api that takes a slice
16:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i have a value or not
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> i turn that option into a slice to pass it to the api
16:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> api being a lib function
16:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> modified chat.cpp, just move your "hey, check out this new client:" function into a seperate file and call it to prevent MC >:3
16:29 < bridge> <teero777> modified controls.cpp for that custom thicc snapinput
16:29 < bridge> <kekomonter> :gigachad:
16:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> :brownbear:
16:30 < bridge> <kekomonter> Echo of old version
16:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> you changed the whisper msg again?!
16:30 < bridge> <kekomonter> Emojis in chat
16:30 < bridge> <kekomonter> Cuz arhimede rewrote all chat
16:30 < bridge> <meloƞ> https://tenor.com/view/oh-no-you-didnt-surprised-gif-18378687
16:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> is it like just basic emojis? or can you add custom's ?
16:31 < bridge> <kekomonter> This like emojis in discord
16:31 < bridge> <teero777> bro added nerdfont
16:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> if you're capable of displaying :kek: and :OMEGALUL: i will kiss your shoe's
16:32 < bridge> <kekomonter> You can start
16:32 < bridge> <kekomonter> :troll:
16:32 < bridge> <kekomonter> Maybe I'll found old demo
16:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> nah, if i  do these kinds of feature's i would like to have them on latest, since i am using that instead of custom clients most of the time
16:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> but it would add way to much bloat
16:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> and custom chat entitys are always a bad idea, thinking about the horrible emojis i've seen in my years on discord :justatest:
16:40 < bridge> <kekomonter> I found this
16:40 < bridge> <kekomonter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1206988180637622422/2023-04-10_13-47-56.mp4?ex=65de0257&is=65cb8d57&hm=c87bbd416a8c91d59a9b959b30adfeeaee4dea659d6ce9de934211c90a5c129a&
16:40 < bridge> <kekomonter> I have 7,16 gb of obs demos, all my history in one folder :justatest:
16:44 < bridge> <diariesvexar> is your fps normal with emoji ?!
16:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> @diariesvexar i want to thank you again for your help on my windows issue - i got it running finally
16:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> the issue was me
16:45 < bridge> <kekomonter> I had lock on 80 fps
16:45 < bridge> <kekomonter> Now 300 xd
16:45 < bridge> <kekomonter> I don't like 99% CPU usage
16:46 < bridge> <zhn> yeah ddnet had emojis back in the days too
16:46 < bridge> <zhn> was abandoned fast though
16:46 < bridge> <kekomonter> Maybe, I'm not old gamer xd
16:47 < bridge> <zhn> z-team client had emojis too
16:47 < bridge> <zhn> eh
16:47 < bridge> <zhn> good ol days
16:47 < bridge> <kekomonter> huh
16:47 < bridge> <diariesvexar> I didn't done anything but glad to hear it's work now for you ❤️
16:47 < bridge> <diariesvexar> oh then make sense
16:49 < bridge> <meloƞ> <3
17:57 < bridge> <teero777> woah whaaaaatttt really?
17:57 < bridge> <teero777> just blame it on the compiler
18:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> roby sounds so formal ending every sentence with a dot, i highly respect that ngl
18:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> im not used to people caring about the formality of doing so, i like it
20:14 < bridge> <matodor> why does a clean install of ddnet only install the DDraceNetwork community in filters by default?
20:14 < bridge> <matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1207042039221452800/image.png?ex=65de347f&is=65cbbf7f&hm=68ebf71a902b14bdd38915e93a5d49194d1346c5d826bb3b52068e5f6ff89b85&
20:15 < bridge> <teero777> what?
20:15 < bridge> <teero777> it filters to DDNet by default since the client is from DDNet? xd
20:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah nice
20:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> whoever changed that, legend
20:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's all i ever asked for
21:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> unique epic
22:51 < bridge> <zhn> it was always like that though
23:58 < bridge> <teero777> i am so confused what is wrong with github ppl
23:58 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1207098610601164822/image.png?ex=65de692f&is=65cbf42f&hm=c4738b3aecde68701144cb0f5c04ab3433c870922c80b1d11c1a6f893a8fc56a&
