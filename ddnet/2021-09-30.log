06:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Real> i dont think so
06:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Real> but i think its different between hooking and touching the tee to another tee, im not sure but i think they both have different collisions.
06:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Real> ill test it out later
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> I don't think that adding some velocity is real collision tho
08:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How would you do it then?
08:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean
08:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> tees are no complicated model or something
08:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think its fine xd
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> set position without changing any velocity kekw
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that can lead you to being in the wall
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and being stuck
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i don't really remember how does tw MoveBox
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/560d2ad1a3249709e6594b8c365f65cbd83a7351/src/game/collision.cpp#L497-L563
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> finally google
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> added dark theme
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to google
13:08  * www slaps Q around a bit with a large fishbot
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> google sok
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lmao the ddnet++ code base is so cursed it now requires bam AND cmake to compile \:D but yay i managed to yoink in ddnet's git history into my fork that started half an decade ago with a fresh history
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> what even is the sense of bam?
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> isnt that just shooting in your own leg for absolutly no gain
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> whats the history of teeworlds, did matricks invent everything from scretch for educational purposes, or just for no reason?
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> education is my guess. it‚Äòs much more fun to reinvent the wheel
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok^^
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> hence system.c lol
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh yeah but c++98 also sucks
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and teeworlds was written in c first wasnt it?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> still waiting for matrix to build a c compiler
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> still waiting for matricks to build a c compiler
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> trolldragon
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> its not for education matricks is just smarter and writes better code than everything out there
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> bam \> cmake
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> str\_copy \> strncpy
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> rip chn
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> üëÄ can we just connect to steamwork's network and let people just host servers via steamwork and let them connect to each other in a time like this
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you mean sdr? it means no more open source client and server
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and by time like this you mean always?
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> lol
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> idk
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we could try it, but i‚Äòm still waiting for cloudflare first
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> giving up open source is a huge step imo
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> are we getting support from cloudflare?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i contacted someone, on HN they said they could help cheaper
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> what about china
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> china is super hard, we‚Äòd need a chinese company to help us
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> probably not gonna happen
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the c functions really arent the best, would be nice if c++ would support static sized strings like boost does \:/
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> best about teeworlds base is how it supports all platforms
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> troll¬≥
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :troll:
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> fokko when add a mobile mode for ddnet, i bet many of your players just chilling on your servers anyway xD
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Lul
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Android support is back in no?
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it is
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> see
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then i dont need to do so
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but ddnet on android without mobile support sucks xd
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> doesnt it have mobile support?
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean it runs, and if i connect a keyboard to my phone it works xD
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> soo?
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it doesnt have like buttons to toggle scoreboard and stuff üòÑ
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u mean on screen controls
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, it was in ddnet 9.3.1
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cant u just move it back in
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> code exists
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its SDL stuff
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i believe
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i never looked into that source, but it also was SDL 1.x
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe take a look at it again or so
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but someone also needs to fix the whole IME stuff
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i know that each on screen Button was mapped to a real key, which could be bound ingame xd
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs it overlapps with android onscreen keyboard
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> in the sdl settings while booting the game u could set those buttons
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and u could move them customly
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah yeah, maybe smone should add it back xddd
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye probably xD
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> pelya had android port of 0.6 client afair
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye, it was even on google play
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> back then
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1614/files
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ye would love onscreen buttons also for non android phones
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i wonder if walking with the phone tilt sensor would be any good
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet fitness program
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> how much did you move today, before you played ddnet
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> also we need aim assist on mobile because its so hard to play w touch
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> trollerdragon
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hrhrhr
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Its a thing in mobile tho
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> "Brawl Stars" is a pvp game where you shoot each other and you can literally turn on aimbot
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> you cant compare such a bad game to a brilliant game like teeworlds xd
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsÊáíÊï£> brilliant
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can I offer some free work to some companies? I want to fix some bugs, I don‚Äôt want anything in return
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what companies
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mihoyo to start with. Then I can offer some to facebook. Then my next target would be microsoft
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can help reddit too, but I doubt they‚Äôd want my help given I‚Äôd remove the fucking ‚Äúuse the app‚Äù nag
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Mihoyo?
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u play genshin
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt it just some mindless gacha
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ofc I play genshin, the premier weeb game
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i prefer to waste mony on dota
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It actually has a great story and I personally think the money grubbing company is ruining it
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the only company i would help free is valve, make steam have proper window hints for the chat so that twm can make it floating properly
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But even free2play and the mechanics to force you to play every day it still has a pretty great gameplay loop imo. If only their priority was to make a great game instead of making a shit ton of money
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, my, god valve yes, hire me please. I‚Äôll make you a new client
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also the steam client is super aggresive at stealing ur cursor
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Seriously fuck all this web browser ui ba
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Bs*
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Steam client works like horseshit, feels like I‚Äôm running on a core2duo
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its better to browse the shop on the browser
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> seriously
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 100% agree. If I have to use a browser I‚Äôd use a proper desktop browser not embedded garbage
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can help discord too
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can give my bank a hand with their shitty website
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i bet you can crash clients with million votes in votelist :D
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea crashing clients with malicious servers is still a thing
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, don‚Äôt remember but he vote heap probably refuses to grow past a certain point
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @gerdoe\: go fuzz and fix
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> server-side or client-side
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Both sides iirc
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u can
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Someone should add a limit there üòõ
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you can always modify server to do any bad thing kekw
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The client should resist it though
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> let's check then
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Noby says it doesn‚Äôt so we should fix it imo
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> there are plenty of ways to crash client from server
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which we should try to fix üòõ
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think its all things taht would never happen with normal servers
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/560d2ad1a3249709e6594b8c365f65cbd83a7351/src/game/client/components/voting.cpp#L222
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/560d2ad1a3249709e6594b8c365f65cbd83a7351/src/game/client/components/voting.cpp#L135
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> that's it
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> They only make money with the app, you want to destroy them? üòÑ
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can't track people and get their info well with a website, need an app for that
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They have a fair bit of ads everywhere, though I hear their clickthru rate is awful so they don‚Äôt get paid well iirc
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @Learath2 afair you did something about replacing basic containers by `std::*`, how's it going?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don‚Äôt like that the goal with everything is money and that people still support these things. I would gladly host something like reddit with the same model we run ddnet if it had any chance of being used
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> federative social medeia :p
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> media*
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I was almost done with that actually. Just a few tricky ones remained
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe I should push it so someone else can finish it up
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it will be hardest pr to review :D
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Wikipedia is a good counter-example, really successful, donations only
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know there are things like mastodon, but they are just doomed for mainstream failure. It‚Äôs just a nerdfest
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> they keep their ads too agressive
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yep
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably the only one of it‚Äôs kind. I don‚Äôt really think I know any others with mainstream success
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> the only thing i don't like in wikipedia
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> hm, ye, you are right at that point
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> dummy's netmsg are going after main tees yep?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-14-released-2318/ :poggers:
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 how is secured.gg doing with USA and GER?
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ueh
