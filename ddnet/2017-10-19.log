00:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Great!
00:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Is databasr for zcatch fixed?
11:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> How come it knows my ip? Is this only displayed on the client side or will the person that is controlling these servers actually gain my ip? (fyi, ip displayed here is from a vpn client, now my own personal ip)
11:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/370501371235139584/ip-ddnet.png
11:41 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> Well, you send the server your ip to get the response
11:42 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> Solution: Don't use the Internet browser, use DDNet or Favorites instead
11:42 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> Then only your trusted servers get your IP
11:42 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> does it send any other information
11:42 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> no
11:42 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> just a list of ips that have accessed the browser is pretty useless without names etc
11:42 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> without ip you can't get an answer
11:42 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> well, you can correlate ips with names
11:43 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> look at when people refresh server browser and who joins a server close after
11:43 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> then the probability of that name and ip belonging together is high
11:43 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> i guess
11:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> I thought there was a decentralized server that collected the active servers and displayed it to the clients... and that your ip was hidden until you actually connected to the server :S A bit like this. But this is not how it works?
11:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/370508448456114176/ddnet-server.png
11:48 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> that would be possible, except for the pings
11:48 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you wouldn't be able to tell what ping you'd have to the servers
11:49 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> currently, you fetch a list of server IPs from the servers
11:49 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> and then ask each server for its info
11:49 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> *list of server IPs from the master servers
11:49 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> the "decentralized server" in your system would actually be very much centralized ðŸ˜‰
11:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> Haha sorry, meant centralized x). Is it hard to change this behavior? Maybe a feature that would turn of the ping and just display where the servers is located? Like, "GER" instead of "Ping: 22"?
11:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> Had no idea my ip was shared to everyone as soon as I bring up the internet browser ðŸ˜® Maybe that's very usual for onlinegames...
11:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> well. your IP is also "shared" with every web site you visit
11:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> the IP address is what allows you to receive answers to something
11:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> think of it as an address
11:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> if you send mail somewhere, the only way to receive an answer is if you add a "reply-to" address
11:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> Yes, I know that. Just... not so comfortable with sharing my ip to someone calling my cocksucker when I don't want to share it with this person :S
11:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> Yes, I know that. Just... not so comfortable with sharing my ip to someone calling me cocksucker when I don't want to share it with this person :S
11:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> Yes, I know that. Just... not so comfortable with sharing my ip to someone calling me cocksucker when I don't want to share it with that person :S
11:54 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you don't trust every web site you visit either, I guess ðŸ™‚
11:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> For some reason I just think that this person can be evil enough to somehow abuse my ip-address
11:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yea, we'll see what we can do about this
11:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> That's true, but in ddnet we have such a small community that I feel more personally targeted than if I just visit some random website.
11:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> if you join a server, you'll always send your IP address, together with your nick name
11:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> the person hosting these servers doesn't have to call them like they do now
11:55 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> so then you'd have no idea ^^
11:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> I know, but I would never join a server that says "cocksucker", I join the servers that I trust :v
11:56 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> but what obligation does the current hoster have to call their server like they do now?
11:56 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> they could just name it like a server you trust
11:56 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I mean, the person hosting the server doesn't suddenly become more trustworthy because it has a different name
11:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> Yes, as it is now. But what if this "master server" file with the ip's also had information on "country, ip, trusted"? Who is controlling the masterserver?
11:59 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i am
11:59 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> where would you get that trust flag from?
11:59 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> heueueueu
12:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> from ddnet ðŸ˜ƒ
12:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> "official servers"
12:01 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you can already open the ddnet tab if you don't want to connect to something else other than the official ddnet servers
12:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> and that is exactly what I was looking for .____.
12:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> I feel stupid now :c
12:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> Thank you for clearing it up for me, and sorry for requesting a feature that already exists.
12:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> I thought there was a decentralized (meant centralized) server that collected the active servers and displayed it to the clients... and that your ip was hidden until you actually connected to the server :S A bit like this. But this is not how it works?
12:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/370508448456114176/ddnet-server.png
12:07 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> np. I mean it's still a useful feature request (for the rest of the servers)
12:11 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but ddnet tab has no DDNet++ servers -.-
12:11 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #909: Update DDNet libs for GLEW on Windows (master...pr_ddnet_update_libs) https://git.io/vd7o1
12:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> Yeah, true, but DDNet tab will be enough for me as it stands now, and just like Deen said, if I want to add other servers not listed in DDNet (like blocking servers), I can just add them to favorites.
12:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> 
12:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> One thing though, it "already" to late to not feel that my ip got in the hands of the wrong people because I clicked the "Internet" tab. Maybe a warning would be a step forward?
12:11 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you'll get a new IP assigned at midnight, no?
12:12 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon yes, the ddnet tab specifically only has the official ddnet servers
12:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> what is DDNet++?
12:12 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> best tw mod
12:12 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I don't htink ddnet hosts any ddnet++ servers
12:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> thank you @ChillerDragon x)
12:12 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> no ._.
12:12 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> they dont
12:12 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> only ChillerDragon does
12:12 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> atleast he is great guy
12:12 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> xd
12:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Jambi> pls
12:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> no, I will not get a new ip at midnight heinrich
12:13 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> why not?
12:13 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> u can vist me in munich and use my ip
12:14 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> u can visit me in munich and use my ip
12:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> why would I ðŸ˜’ heinrich?
12:14 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> quallity vpn
12:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> why would I :v heinrich?
12:14 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> dunno where you're from, but in germany most providers don't give you a static IP address
12:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> sweden, we get static IP addresses
12:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> so... kinda why I feel like "fuck, my ip is in the wrong hands" :V
12:15 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> duuude
12:15 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ur ip is public everywhere
12:15 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> if some tw players wants ur ip
12:15 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> he gets ur ip
12:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> like, how?
12:16 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> were you ever on a non-official server?
12:16 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> all tw servers get the ips
12:16 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> all admins have the ips
12:16 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i guess via skype and discord its also possible but im not sure
12:16 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> all tw web pages
12:17 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> http://www.teeworlds-ip-database.org/
12:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> see, I said "wrong hands" for a reason. DDNet and its staff is not the wrong hands
12:17 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> much leaked data
12:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Justafish have you ever been on a non-official server in teeworlds?
12:17 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> what r non official servers
12:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> blocking server, yes`?
12:17 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> there are official tw servers?
12:17 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> official ddnet servers
12:17 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i guess the master is hehe
12:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> well then, the hosters of the blocking servers have your IP address
12:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> I know. But so does the "cocksucker" guy
12:18 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> hehe
12:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> all servers in the "internet" tab have my ip.
12:18 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> how do you know it's not the same person?
12:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> if they saved it that is
12:18 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> how do u know its not deen?
12:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> I don't. But atleast I would like to have the option to choose who I trust
12:18 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> #nohate xd
12:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> I don't. But at least I would like to have the option to choose who I trust
12:18 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> maybe its me
12:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> yeah, maybe it's me
12:19 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> maybe im swatting u tonight
12:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> and I am just fucking around
12:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> x)
12:19 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> haha
12:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Justafish> (am not..)
15:14 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> So, can we expect people to have glew on Linux? Should we ship it?
15:14 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> Can we even ship it
15:14 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> or would that break because of different mesa versions?
15:14 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> questions, questions, questions. Obviously I don't have much time, but I'm trying to get builds working again
15:55 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> yooo guiiis c:
15:56 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> does any1 has tipps to let the ddnet client run in lower resultion but still in fullscreen lol
15:56 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i just unboxed ma new laptop and it has too high screen resultion and too bad hardware so i only get 100 fps -.- thats why i tried to play ddnet client in full HD
15:57 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but it only fills 1/8 of my screen now xd
15:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @deen think glew will be a dependency they need to download
15:57 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> how much fps can your screen display, @ChillerDragon ? 60?
15:57 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> uhm where do i see i?
15:58 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> why should it be limited to 60 lol
15:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> if you don't know it, it's 60
15:58 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i had 100 fps in tw
15:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> because screens only have an update rate of 60
15:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> that's not what appears on the screen
15:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it's just how much the program calculated
15:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> do a dxdiag
15:59 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ya anyways it is not smooth in normal resolution
15:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> then look at display tab
15:59 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> fullHD is okay on this small screen anyways
15:59 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> is there any cfg to fix the fullscreen?
15:59 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> dxdiag?
15:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> if we render internally at a lower resolution wouldn't the gpu upscale it?
15:59 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> win-r; `dxdiag`
15:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> on windows 10 just type dxdiag into the cortana box
15:59 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ty
16:00 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> dxdiag said no problemo
16:00 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yea, but what screen refresh rate?
16:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> you can see what refresh hz youare using
16:00 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> ah
16:00 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> kk xd
16:00 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> sec
16:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> scrolldown a bit on the device panel
16:02 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> 60Hz
16:02 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> is taht the value?
16:02 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yes
16:02 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> k
16:02 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> see, your screen can do 60fps max. so the problem is not the fps directly
16:02 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> sure
16:02 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> it was much smoother in the ower resolution with 300 fps
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> but i cant control the mouse too good and its too small -.-
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> yea, but the problem is not the fps, but something else ^^
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> wasnt there a high dpi command?
16:04 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> cl_high_dpi 1 or something
16:04 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> i can't find it anymore?
16:04 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> is it removed?
16:08 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> well i fixed it. by scaling my whole operating system to fullHD
16:08 <+ddnet-discord> <ChillerDragon> it works c:
16:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> :S
16:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 depends on the HZ your screen supports, most displays only support up to 60hz
19:01 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #910: Run the server on CI (master...dd_pr_sanity) https://git.io/vd54D
20:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> just encountered the weirdest bug ever, suggenly you go "spec" and fly around the map without your tee, trying to reconnect to the server reveals you never disconnected at all
