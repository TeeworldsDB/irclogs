01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are updating github design

02:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> discovered a bug, not a major one cuz it only works kick command
02:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> send rcon so i can exploit bug
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> if i connect to a empty server i get ID 0 and when i connect my dummy it gets ID 1, when I kick him with command "kick 1" it disconnects the tee but my client still thinks my dummy is in the game, then when somebody connects and gets my dummy original ID which was 1 and that person gets tagged in msg, the msg will highlight for me
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/720438641146724392/unknown_1.png
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> it can be easily recreated
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> thats not bug with kick
02:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!     ZombieToad> thats bug with client
03:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @jao's hairy kebab
07:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Thoughts on making weak / strong hook map specific? (If possible) I believe weak hook degrades the quality of Teeworlds, newer players don't even know it exists, hell, even some people that have been playing for quite some time don't. Some maps require it, but why should it be forced to be a mechanic on all maps that don't?
07:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's almost an invisible mechanic, and it makes general gameplay feel tedious. The simple act of trying to toss a tee is affected by it. Newer players are greatly impacted by it, and they don't even know it.
07:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it is definitely possible from a code perspective at least
07:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Making every tee have strong hook 100% of the time, besides on maps that absolutely require it, would just all around be a quality improvement IMO.
07:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> The game would feel better to play, there's absolutely no reason to keep a bug that degrades the quality of the game on all of the maps that don't even require it.
07:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Well, there's one reason I could think of, it would become even more unknown, because it wouldn't exist on a majority of the maps... But, there could be some kind of notification that the mechanic exists via a server message when the map is loaded? Making this change would completely remove the need for /spec .. And I guess would make a lot of the ranks slightly easier to beat... But, is that so bad? For the overall improvement of the game
07:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Well, there are two reasons I could think of, it would become even more unknown, because it wouldn't exist on a majority of the maps... But, there could be some kind of notification that the mechanic exists via a server message when the map is loaded? Making this change would completely remove the need for /spec .. And I guess would make a lot of the ranks slightly easier to beat... But, is that so bad? For the overall improvement of the gam
07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Some maps have ranks that haven't been beaten in a long time anyways, I feel like the boost of competition would be a welcome change. Maybe it'd make some people want to try a little harder, knowing they wont have awkward RNG on their hooks.
07:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yes, weak / strong hook is something you can learn and master. You can study maps and figure out which part the person with strong should get, but it's absolutely not a fun mechanic to have in the game in general.
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i sometimes see people switching tees / using /spec to try to remove weakhook and that feels like something that people shouldnt have to do
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yea, it feels like a very barbaric system, and it's something I think ddnet could improve upon greatly, it's a very massive quality of life change, super important IMO.
07:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> There are so many toss parts that I see noobs struggling with, and a majority of it is the fact that weak hook exists. It makes it so much harder to learn. A lot of the older players don't realize how obnoxious it is.
07:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> keep /spec tho
07:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think ur kinda overexaggerating the severity of having a weak hook but i do agree it should be changed / altered for newer maps
07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I'm really not, you think that because you're so used to it, but it really does affect newer players, quite a bit.
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> And the general gameplay feel, it's very obnoxious to have the feel of your hook vary because of the order of which you joined / killed
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Also, /spec wouldn't exist on any map that doesn't absolutely require weak hook, everyone having strong hook makes it a worthless command. The sole reason for /spec is to give someone strong hook.
07:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Instead of it being used to give strong hook to people to make parts easier / possible, it'd be used to give people weak hook to make certain parts possible.
07:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It'd be a cleaner implementation of the system, while also greatly improving the quality of gameplay on all other maps.
07:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no /spec is good in t0 to not be blocky too
07:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's a very cheatable mechanic on maps, we can't allow it to be possible on every single one. I guess the current possible /spec maps could still keep it.. But I feel like most people would opt to just have strong hook at all times, instead of /spec to make space for other people.
07:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> DDrace isn't gores, /spec to make room for people isn't very important.
07:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol uve obviously never played blocky-ish maps
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ppl will get pissed if u remove /spec anyways so imo better to keep
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> [3:08 AM] qshar: The best explanation was something like this: When you race and you feel that you didn't warm up - you just have the weak hook. When you save players like a pro, that means you have strong hook
07:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its pretty subtle^
07:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but it makes a diference
07:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Questioning my experience is cute, but yea, I don't think having /spec as a mechanic to cater to large groups in ddrace shouldn't really be encouraged.
07:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Again, I don't think it really matters if maps like Aim kept /spec
07:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol what? t0 on ger is always one of the top servers
07:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> But the core reason for it being there is for strong hook, and that wouldn't be a thing anymore, with this change
07:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> And a vast majority of maps don't even have /spec
07:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i also really notice weak hook when playing on the ddnet fng servers, but only because im used to everyone having strong hook
07:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i never noticed it at all before making the fix
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> Weak is cool
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I'm sure it feels frustrating to a majority of players, it's a bug after all.
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's not even a fun bug either, not something that has potential to improve the game, like bunnyhopping in half life
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> Remove fatigue from sprinting in cod, it would change negatively
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> You're defending a mechanic that isn't part of the core gameplay, it's just a nuisance on the feel of the game.
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> fatigue is there on purpose to make sprinting less op right
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Correct
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> weak isnt there to make strong feel less op
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its just physics bug
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> I like it
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> That's fine
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> It adds spice to the game
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> Like
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> You are the alpha tee if you have strong on all
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> :kek:
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont know enough about ddrace to say here but i can say removing it from fng was a positive change
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> Maybe call it alpha and beta tee instead of strong and weak :kek:
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Nice meme lol, but yea, I don't think it's good for a lot of reasons, I've already mentioned most of them
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> People that have been playing for a long time got used to it, so they don't really mind it anymore, but newer players will feel it, and the game will feel worse to play to them, and they won't even know it's because of this stupid bug that has been plaguing the game since it started, and the justification for keeping it is because SOME maps requires it.. Well, why not let those maps keep the ability to switch to it, instead of having it on a
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> People that have been playing for a long time got used to it, so they don't really mind it anymore, but newer players will feel it, and the game will feel worse to play to them, and they won't even know it's because of this stupid bug that has been plaguing the game since it started, and the justification for keeping it is because SOME maps require it.. Well, why not let those maps keep the ability to switch to it, instead of having it on al
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The problem is more that we dont know how to find maps that need it so all old maps would have to keep the old mechanic
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what would make a map require weak hook?
08:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> To my knowledge, there's a very small amount of maps that actually require it
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> And, I think that risk is fine? People will report the map as being broken, and it'll be flagged for this new system.
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are some drag parts I was shown
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> We've already had issues with maps being broke in the past, it'd be the same thing
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well those were unpresicted, this would break some maps and we'd most likely not lnow for months
08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> If we reach out and figure out which maps require it before pushing the update, that'd be even better
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> are the broken maps literaly impossible without weak hook
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I'm sure some people have some memory of which maps need it
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For the stopper changes we just ran a script to find all the maps that neeed updating
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> or possibly it could be added as an opt-in rather than opt-out, so that only new maps / maps that are fixed manually will have strong for all
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's such a stupidly low amount of maps that require it, I don't think keeping this mechanic JUST for those maps is a good thing
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is it easy to figure out if a map needs weak
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think opt in would make the confusion worse, no?
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well i didnt know
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> > It's such a stupidly low amount of maps that require it,
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well i didnt know
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> > It's such a stupidly low amount of maps that require it,
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> when i typed it
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I can't even count the amount of maps that require weak hook on 1 hand
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also btw its not exactly trivial to get rid of weak hook, but I have  a solid ish idea
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> From what I've played
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ud have to have played thru every single map to know right?
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yeah the fix for weak hook involves changing a good amount of stuff across several files
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Each tick youll have to compensate for the weaker tees
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Correct, but ddnet doesn't have every map that I've played that requires it lol I don't remember their names, which is the main issue lol
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I hope a second pass is not necwssary because that would be quite horrible for performance
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont remember exactly what the fix was
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> something with changing saturatedadd
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think there is a fix pr'd on vanilla actually and heinrich commented on it the actual proper way to fix it
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Questioning my experience is cute, but yea,"
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cute 😳
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> :kek:
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you cant remove spec, its simply a great tool when you race a map with 20 ppl, or semi gores maps that ddnet has
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you play always on team so u dont know
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> louis triggered me a bit with his usual reminder of his existence :kek:
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah spec I think we'll keep
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also iwouldnt change weak strong hook, deen already did it and reversed it in the future cuz lot of ppl complained
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Most maps don't have /spec but yea
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is sometimes no way to get out of the way in maps and it just angers everyone
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Why did they complain, ryo?
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think the fixes were mostly in tick() and stuff and didnt change the netcode at all
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know, i wasnt there, but deen always says it
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> That sounds insane lol, why would people argue for a bug that makes the gameplay feel shitty
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u fail a map today due to weak hook?
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the fix deen applied wasnt actually remoivng it completely but making weak and strong more similar
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> No, it's just something that's been on my mind for years
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it also involved adding a PostTick function
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but not an extra loop afaik
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> just ask qshar how to fix it
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ye
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen why didnt people like removing the weak?
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> on servers with the fix by qshar weak hook is entirely removed
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Also I see noobs not understanding what makes their hook not pull as good as it should, and it really fucks them over
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It'd be way easier to just fix the problem, and not try and teach them a stupid bug that shouldn't exist
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> Ye its game mechanic, just ask lol
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A lot of things fuck noobs over in ddrace :(
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> honestly, if i would care about noobs, strong weak hook is t he last of the things i would care, they dont even have a tutorial xddd
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> mostly the ddrace part
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's just a very harsh experience learning ddrace
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> the servers are the worst
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @abcqwerty u
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> In general though, do we all actually like weak hook? Really?
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> u should have a server that only has easy maps
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> A lot of things fuck ppl in dark souls
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like it tho
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> Deal with it
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the hard way to learn ddnet
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> makes u proud
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> true
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> but took me a month
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> There is big learning curve
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> to realize that u could change maps
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is a lot of time from when you start to the first time you finish a map
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I dong actually mind weak hook that much but it's been 10 years. I won't pretend it was essy to get used to
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Sure, it has some slight charm,  we all had to learn it, sure... But is it really good to keep it, is that added randomness for noobs a good thing? I don't think so
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It changes how you fly it changes how you throw it changes how you drag
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its not randomness as is cuz its deterministic who has it and who doesnt, wrong term
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tried to get a couple friends to play the game and they had trouble getting one throw consistent
08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Changes so much, and learning that is so fucking stupid for newer players, they just think they messed up, when in reality, it's a bug making it way harder than it should be
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if we do this we should know about maps with weak hook, or konsti will raid the discord
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe an indicator to show who has strong could help, but I dont think we should make this bug a feature
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> add a server that only has mud and just2easy on it
08:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its not even a bug for vanilla its just not needed in ddr
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> what
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2148
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's a very negative bug, I don't like the effect it has on gameplay, I'd rather it be gone, than embraced. I feel like newer players would very much prefer it not existing
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> nah it was originally added to vanilla to give positive feedback loops towards top players
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wrong
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> Negative for you
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> huh
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> lol
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> whats the reason then
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sad tw fix
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/720533023560433664/unknown.png
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the reason is that its a physics bug
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> im p sure it was on purpose
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> like heinrich says in this link
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wat
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> okay, louis is 100% trolling lol
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how tf is strong/weak a bug in original tw
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how do you even make that a bug
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> read the image
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> he explains why
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it seems like something that would purposefully be in
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and yet it isnt
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @louis it wasnt on purpose, your murican brain can do more than this, its a bug that turned into a feature in ddrace, ddrace is basically made out of a bug that alllows you to hook in corners, it was never intended either
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> stop racism pls
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> louis its not on purpose wtf
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @onby u
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i always thought it was
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> guess i learned smth today
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> ```Depending on the order of character spawn, players have stronger or weaker hook on each others.
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> The reason is that velocity calculation of characters is order dependent:
09:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> Example: player a has spawned before player b and b is hooking a:
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> a.vel *= friction
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> ...
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> b.vel *= friction
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> b.vel += hookforce
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> a.vel += hookforce
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> 
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> b has spawned before a:
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> b.vel *= friction
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> b.vel += hookforce
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> a.vel += hookforce
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> ...
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> a.vel *= friction```
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is a bug that is very expected btw, it's actually very hard to balance these things when you are working with a finite timestep
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> Do we actually need to make the game even dumber?
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yea, actually.. What? Teeworlds isn't a dumb game
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean if the game is 1000iq now it'd be 990iq
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> Like spikes wont kill you if you politely say no?
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's actually one of the hardest games I've ever seen to get into
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> tw is good
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cant u just calculate it from whoever is hooking to the hookee
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes a subtle game mechanic vs remove spikes
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what if both tees hook eachother
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Talk about hyperbole
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just calculate it twice
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @louis man... idk if u want to show of stupidness on purpose, the calculation is explained by heinrich in the image i just sent
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ye continue with ur 5 grade math
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby exactly the problem fhats why this might require a second physics pass
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> 2+2 is 4 thats quick math
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Ryozuki stfu dont call me a 5th grader when ur maturity level is even lower than that
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no its 5
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Stop trolling in this channel lol
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> First you go over all the tees and distribute the forces. Then you go over and cap them
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers: i :poggers: am :poggers: louis
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ur funny bro
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thats what the posttick thing is for i think
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah might have a bit more of a performance impact then intended
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> whys that
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> An entire second pass through?
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no its just
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast the second pass is quite cheap
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> after core.tick() doing core.posttick() which is only 2line function
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it doesnt look like much overhead to me atall compared to some of the other stuff that runs every tick for every character
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean the tick is already O(n^2) so it probably wont be noticable
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ive tried profiling my server in a couple ways and it seems negligible
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> maybe its different with 64pl server compared to 32 idk
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but probably not since they do it on kog too
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway implementation is not thr main issue here
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, maybe we should just make it, deploy it and test it
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if it creates r1s that wont be beatable though and I wonder how it affects hookfly
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it probably would on maps like just triple fly
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> or just rocketfly, etc
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I feel like it wouldn't be an issue
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> would only be if for some reason it didnt work out and a revert would happen
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> test hookfly on a server that already has the fix maybe
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah but a revert then would nuke all ranks that were done on the new patch
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do the patch on half the servers and show a message that says it may be reverted/ranks deleted
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I highly doubt hookfly would feel much different with both strong hook, maybe you'd have to press a direction a little more or less, but it's a very adjustable mechanic
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Or adjust your hook duration
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> have u tried
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Nope, but I'll try it now, if anyone wants to test it on noby's fng server with me lol
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no weak would make a shit ton of r1s pop up btw
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> can u do it with dummy
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Perfectly fine IMO, brings new competition, people do this type of things in other games all the time.
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Perfectly fine IMO, brings new competition, people do these type of things in other games all the time.
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Perfectly fine IMO, brings new competition, people do these types of things in other games all the time.
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its hard to test hookfly correctly w dummy
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> tbh i kinda don't want this to happen cause reverse speedfly is cool but itd make everything easier
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yea, I tested it on fng just now, feels the same
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> nice
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> We should probably ask deen what complaints people were making about it
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> To see if it wasn't just a bunch of nonsense
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> are there parts that literally cant be done with strong
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes bruh
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> like in 3 random oldschool maps
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Reverse speedfly is for glitching through things lol
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> exactly
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> huh
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uVMx-Sk3bs
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lool wut
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> hax
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is it related to weak hook tho?
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yes, but the time was removed for this, and the map was fixed
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why is it related to weak hook
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I've never done this before, but I assume the tee on the bottom hooks with weak hook
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's a fairly pointless mechanic, people just use it to cheat specific maps
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i see ppl do it sometimes but the othe r way
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> going upwards lol
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yea, speedfly
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is it another one thats hard to test with dummy
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I don't use dummy often, ask murpi / nexus
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> @murpi
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I can probably do it on your server, but the hammer needs to not be powerful lol
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> go fng small server i can remove the hammer tuning there
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> 9:21 AM] louis: no weak would make a shit ton of r1s pop up btw
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> [9:21 AM] onby: can u do it with dummy
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> [9:21 AM] Skeith: Perfectly fine IMO, brings new competition, people do these types of things in other games all the time.
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> that kinda goes against the whole policy of the last 8 (?) years
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> deen always tried to avoid any change that would make previous runs outdated as much as possible
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and that one change literally makes most of the previous run biased
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It'd be slightly better times, times that people would've gotten regardless, in reality, no?
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Or damn close
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> also people didnt rly complain because of the mechanic being gone but because the fix was bad, u just had strong for movements but for hammerfly and such u still had weak
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I see
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> which made it impossible to know which one should be driving
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is it the same fix i have
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> dunno
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> iirc it was a fix by fisted
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Well, deen added the change once already, no? It just wasn't well implemented
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> So he was willing to slightly mess up the times before, the times really wont improve THAT much due to the change anyways, I genuinely think if people beat the times with 2 strong hooks, then they could've done it without as well.
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> But the quality of gameplay will go up by quite a bit, it's very much worth changing it imo
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> well it was 50 years ago
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> lol
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> it fucks up thousands more ranks rn
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> the more time goes on the worse it is to make mechanic changes
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yea..
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont see noobs complaining about hook
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but i prsonally dont mind anyway the hammer change fucked everything
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> already
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i would even be for a full reset with all these changes
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's a fundamental flaw with the game though, I think it'd still be worth doing now
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and accounts
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but thats in a parallel world
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :greenthing:
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there are 4,157,174 ranks :greenthing:
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Fuck em :greenthing:
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> well to be fair not even 1% of them are meant to be competitive
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but ye
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> still unfair to ppl who spent hours runnign a map
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hooking through corners is a fundamental flaw of the game, lets change it too
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> woke
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> in 0.7 that almost got fixed i thikn
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> or it even did
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> in vanilla
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> But it's a core part of ddrace, unlike this bug, that really just makes the game feel like trash.
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is discussion
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Ryozuki thats usually coz they are just not aware of the difference, its a huge pain when they try to learn driving and similar stuff with hammerfly, since its a lot harder with weak hook even tho they aren't doing anything wrong
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> noobs also dont know they can hook through acorner :greenthing:
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> well thats subjective @Skeith
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> strong weak hook can be seen as a core part of ddrace always as its been there literally forever
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> weak hook strong hook are part of core ddrace
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I suppose, but that's subjective to old players, mostly. Newer players wont like the mechanic if they KNEW it existed, but they don't.. xd
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> it is annoying at times but why could it not been seen as a mechanic?
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not even a random thing
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can control it with team
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yeah its just something that u have to take into account
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> when playing
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yes, we know that.
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> New players don't, and it's silly we have to explain the bug to people so they can play normally
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> because its a bug thats been fixed on other servers
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> hows that an argument
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you consider it a bug
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but in ddrace its a feature
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> if other servers remove speedfly we should remove it too?
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can do what you want in your mod
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i mean kog
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is a race type server
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for gores
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they do their thing
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we do our
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I don't like the idea of clinging to a bug that negatively impacts pretty much everyone, it's just something we've learned to play with, it's not fun.. Lets not pretend like it is, nor is it good game design.. It doesn't really add meaningful depth to the game, we're dumbass old farts that should probably think about newer players
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yeah its kind of a bad game design thing
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but that doesnt mean its not core part of ddrace lol
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> (and being core part of ddrace doesnt mean it should never be changed either)
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> can someone show me a map that cant be done without weak
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> At the end of the day, a better server would have this fix.
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @ᶰ°Konͧsti knows some
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> at the end of the day its not as easy as u make it sound
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and it has collateral
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Mild
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I've gone through the negatives in my big rant
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> that uve minimized big time
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Have I?
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yes
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> 10:06 AM] Skeith: So he was willing to slightly mess up the times before, the times really wont improve THAT much due to the change anyways, I genuinely think if people beat the times with 2 strong hooks, then they could've done it without as well.
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> for instance that
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> is just plain wrong
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> if u get 10:00 race time and they get 10:01 with both strong
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I've been talking about it for awhile now, scroll up lol
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> they would not have beaten the 10:00
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> with that run
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> which is unfair
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and that 10:00 run would have be faster
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and if theres a slight different mechanic with the fix
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> the community backlash will be rly bad
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's exhausting to argue about times like that, it's kind of greedy to not want this change because you had some times that you're scared some people will come through and beat you by a few seconds.
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> as for u fucking up ranks doesnt matter but for all the ppl that spent time making them its kinda lame
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> You lose the times eventually, it happens. Just do it again, your times wont remain forever.
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ive literally said im not against the change at that point
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> im jsut being realisitc
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and not trying to have fake blinkers
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> pretending everything is fine
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> whats wrong with the idea of putting strong hook on only some of the servers with a label that its just an experiment and the ranks may not stay
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ur arguing like a politican
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> politician
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yea, I'm just trying to voice some reason for a mechanic that is really detrimental to the game, I get your point
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I want what's best for the game is all, I'd argue for the change even if I had 50 rank 1s
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yeah yeah
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but when u wanna push a change u have to think outside of ur own perspective
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> This really just affects the gameplay that much, it makes it unfun for us old farts, having to deal with managing weak / strong.. And newer players are actually just suffering because of it, it feels bad all around.
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and think how negatively it could actually impact everyone else
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> with a subjective mindset
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i.e coz u dont mind losing ur r1s doesnt mean other ppl who spent time doing them will not mind eithe
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> r
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wouldnt the change roughly help everyone equally
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @onby in the future yes but retroactively not
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh nvm
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yeah
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It would, it's just mess up people with good times, they could 100% retake them, but yea
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It would, it'd just mess up people with good times, they could 100% retake them, but yea
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> You gotta put in the effort again, which is annoying, for sure.
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> note that ranks on maps aren't generally as close a 1 second
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> couldnt u make a similar type of argument about changes like the auto hammer
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> no rank will ever (?) be perfect
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> doesnt make it more fair
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> to change a make mechanic that makes beating that rank easier
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the ranks aren't as close, if it'd really be 1 second as you suggested, then it doesn't matter
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> if a player spent 3 hours for a ranking because he was constrained by that mechanic, it's not really fair to allow other people to beat him within 1 hour with a newer mechanic
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> for most cases yeah but that will obviously happen
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean at that point you'd have to do some statistics
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> someone else wil lcome along and say that this doesn't happen
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> well
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> anyway that affects lke 1% of the playerbase
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> so if u go by stats it dosnt matter at all xd
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not how stats work
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :pepeH:
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could e.g. check how far apart rank 1 and 2 are for many maps
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> on novice its often very close
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do some stats
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> show me the distribution of the time difference between rank 1 and 2
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on all/all novice/all non-solo maps
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i was jk @Skeith was right lets implement it
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :justatest:
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :justatest:
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> lol
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Nah but lets be real, this change is worth some pain from everyone
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i cant think of other examples besides the auto hammer freeze thing but werent there
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> other times where changes were made to the servers that make getting ranks easier than they used to be
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> there were a few minor ones
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> jetpack mechanic has been changed once or twice
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but it was in the early days
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but ye the hammer one was big enough at that point it doesnt matter
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> That auto hammer in freeze 100% made some massive skips
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yeah ive mentionned it
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> earlier
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yea, I'd argue it's way bigger than fixing weak
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ye
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> it is
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> That was very recent too
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Skeith @snail note that many people forget that you could do the hammer reliably before
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i wonder how much of an impact it would have on peoples ranks if weak was removed
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> simply spin your unlocked mouse wheel
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if its in the scale of a few seconds or more
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @onby it hugely depends on the maps
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> makes it harder lol
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> in some maps if weak has the wrong spot its rly annoying
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yea. not everyone has a mousewheel like that though
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> loses dozen of seconds and makes it harder yeah
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> as a dummy player, please dont remove auto hammer :justatest:
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> REMOVE IT!!!! IT RUINED EVERYTHING!! AAAAH!!
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Skeith it leveled the playing field for people with/without that mousewheel
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> REEEEEEE
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> remove hook, hooking is hard for noobs cuz they have to aim
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it was possible before @Skeith
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> :troll:
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yea lol
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I actually did a massive skip on a hookthrough map
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> using multiple tees and syncing katana with the hammer in freeze lol
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Got rank 1 on the map, I think some people wanted my time removed lol
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> look tw
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> The map was Just Hookthrough
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> katana :lol:
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> dont know what your point is what you are describing was just as possible before the fix
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Oh, I was just saying lol, not arguing anything lol
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Was basically saying I knew it was possible before the change lol
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah, understood that differently ^^
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> remove jump, its hard for nobos
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> :troll:
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Hard for you, maybe.. Not for us big boy gamers.. -pounds chest-
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Deleting weak is an old discussion and were already made on DDNet and reverted again. Im absolutely against implementing it. Also The problem about "pirofly" still exists with both having strong because the weak physic is very deep in the code
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Apparently reverted because it was implemented poorly
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Stop changes to the game mechanics :peperage:
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's a very healthy change to the game, and it'd only slightly affect the times
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ᶰ°Konͧsti there is an easy fix, which will also fix pirofly.
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Weak is a feature and shouldnt be changed
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Btw, Where is there no Turn off entities sign in Front layer?
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> If it's a feature, it's the worst feature in the game, and it brings everything down.
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> weak is a bug, a bug that exists since forever
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ᶰ°Konͧsti you can just use the index from the front layer, entities will show i
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> t
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like a bug
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yea, I hate the idea of making it an actual feature, when it negatively impacts most things. It's just selfish to consider it such, think of everyone else, don't only think of yourself and your own times.
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I meant the "turn off entities invisiblei nthe editor"
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I know, heinrich
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like it should be removed ingame or from the editor
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> wat
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i guess added to the front.png
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> It should just be added to front.png xx
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I see no negative impact from weak. Its easy to deal with it and it doesnt even make a difference on most parts.
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Only all these aoe players that yelling for strong for every simple drag part think its needed
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we are removing weak someone else commit it, at this rate Konsti is going to put a hit out on me
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> :justatest:
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> were not going to remove it
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Why, it was my idea, kill me instead!
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> it was an idea through all years and there were reasons it didnt had been done
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Dont start this shit again
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yea I know, but I brought it up now lol
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think there is a QoL improvement needed here if we want new players tbh, maybe a way to indicate you have strong/weak at the very least?
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I feel like it'd be way better if people just took the hit, it's really just an annoying mechanic, having to learn it and deal with it is just... Bad
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Its skill
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Seems like u dont have
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ᶰ°Konͧsti stop
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> stop personal attacks
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> new players dont even know that there are 2 hook strengths
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> No skill involved, you just have to play differently each time, and it's tedious, it's almost like you're learning 2 games in 1
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is an exclusive club of people that get off on being able to outperform others in slight ways, all the physics changes offend them deeply
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ᶰ°Konͧsti just as you expect others to acknowledge that it can make a difference on maps, it would be good if you could also realize that people brought up arguments that it does negatively affect e.g. the new player experience
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> re the "I see no negative impact from weak."
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Awful for newer players, you have to understand that it's difficult for newer players to get into this game, a bug that makes the game feel inconsistent is FRUSTRATING.
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's kinda understandable, they spent hundreds of hours polishing their gameplay, but does that mean we have to be stuck forever for the 10 people that think like this?
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Its just bad to change game mechanics
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I hate it
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ooh, I have a quote for this one "Stagnation is akin to regression"
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It's kind of a similar issue with older people and technology, they're so used to how things were, they don't want it to change. Even though the change is overall just better for everyone's quality of life
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No idea who said it but our business teacher loved saying that 😛
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If this is going to be a feature, we should fully dish it out, currently it feels random for new people
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> there will be unbeatable ranks due fixing pirofly :thonkery:
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> do we have many new players?
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I will personally go through and deal with those times, I will sweat for this change, gladly.
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It'd benefit everyone
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen well not really, but if we want them it'd be good to either indicate strong/weak hook or remove weak hook
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do you know we don't have new players @Learath2 ?
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> well we definitely have new players, who should be taken care of. also becoming more beginner friendly should always be a priority imo
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is this just an assumption?
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> For sure, we have a ton of new players
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I frequent novice servers
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the player numbers haven't been going up, so atleast it's as many new people as old people that leave
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i'm ok with removing it (again) and fixing the few maps that require it. what about the fast fly getting slower?
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you need weak for the quick hammer fly?
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> konsti claims so. i'm not pro enough to know
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i guess it depends on how u patch it
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Or players that aren't really skilled yet,  weak hook just negatively impacts those players. It impacts literally everyone, we're just used to it
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> an indicator on the tee seems good, deleting it big bad
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> personally i only speed raced with weak, so no experience with strong
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @Skeith anything that is seen as a "mechanic" will obviously impact everyone, i dont see how that is an argument
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't actually know why speedfly happens on the physics level so not sure if it'd change anything
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Speedfly works with strong only
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> did u try speedflying on kog @ᶰ°Konͧsti ?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> if u fix pirofly i doubt speedfly will work
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the top tee is the one that has strong so the bottom tee also being "strong" doesn't matter much w.r.t. to that
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> .s/to//
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> no its releated to the weak/strong bounce
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> There is another thing
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u care so much about new players, but there arent, and they couldnt care less about a weak hook, they would care more about a tutorial
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 yes, necessarily
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Maps wont work anymore or get verx harder because it fixes the shotgun run with weak/strong
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> My argument is, people are just overly stubborn about things, this change is just amazing for the game, and it's frustrating that people would try and defend weak hook simply because they're so used to it being there. It's not like it actually makes the game better
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki why do you believe we have no new players?
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u miss out a lot of things
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> didn't we change it before and had to revert?
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz ddnet used to have wya
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> way more players
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Yes deen
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2016 the golden age
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ppl leave, dont come
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that just says that more players leave than join
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not that we don't have new players
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> The shotgun physics are The most important argument against it
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> It requires weak and was used on lots of maps
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @deen we reverted it because it wasnt a proper fix basically, u didnt have strong while hammerflying and u had no way to figure out who had the real strong
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> so u had no idea who was supposed to drive hammerflies
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> If both have real strong i doubt speedfly will work so
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> changing this will virtually bring no new players
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lmao
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> well it has to be tested
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when a player needs to know about strong hook, they are already into the game
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the entry barrier is way earlier
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't think it'd affect shotgun physics either as tees don't interact with eachother
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> than the weak strong hook
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur focusing on the wrong thing
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ᶰ°Konͧsti shotgunning other players?
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It helps, you're fooling yourself if you think it isn't just a massive QoL change for literally everyone
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> massive qol
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @heinrich5991 shotgunrun
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this isnt a massive qol imho
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Its a gamemechanic with weak
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki not improving something because there might be other stuff, is nonsensical
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how is this improving
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imho its part of the fun
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is not an improvement in my eyes
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki well I spent a couple hours trying to get friends into ddrace it is indeed an issue when they try to learn throws
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> It gives u a lot of sidespeed and is used as parts and as tricks
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> It is a massive QoL, having to figure out who has weak or strong, and having to play around weak every single time you have it is very annoying
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ᶰ°Konͧsti but if not more than one tee is involved, how can weak/strong have an effect?
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> konsti isnt that mostly on exploity maps like brainduck?
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or am I misunderstanding what shotgunrun is?
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> However, this change will only help noobs and @Ryozuki is right that without a tutorial we won't get many anyway
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @Patiga
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> the shotgun speed boost is and can be used in lots of maps
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @heinrich5991 2 tees walk left next to each other, the left one shotguns the right one repeatedly, the one on the right gains massive speed
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> esp oldschool ones
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I'm a noob then, I'd enjoy this change lol. Even though I've been playing for 11 years lmao
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, that kind of shotgun run
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @heinrich5991 shotgunrun is like hammerrun but with shotgun
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://youtu.be/aYCpB0v4Mcg?t=97
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> And it definitely requires real weak
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh there are patched servers, like qshars
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> does it not work on there?
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here shotgunrun
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Gores and fng are good with all strong
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Because they dont have weak mechanics
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm wondering whether the things you assume will break, actually break
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so we need a change to try it out, could we get the code from qshar?
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and then we need a list of physics we expect to break and have to test them
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and maybe adjust the physics a bit if possible
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the question becomes "Is the work and pissing of Konsti actually worth it?"
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> 100%
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> .s/of/off/
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ur pissing of the game
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @ᶰ°Konͧsti did u try on kog or not
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> can u speedfly there
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sure, there are more important things like tw7 compatibility. but if someone really cares about this, they can work on it
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i dont know if KoG did just give strong hook or real strong for both
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Skeith can code it 💯 👍
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can basically hear Wombat calling us lowlifes for changing this
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And many more
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I would love to, but I can't code. FeelsBadMan
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> This discord will be swarmed
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> nah
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U represent 1% here
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> U
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 the loudest voice isn't always the most important
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i actually think most ppl would be happy about it
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, even the auto hammer change only brought like 3-4 mad men out of their caves
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> IF its done properly
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I highly doubt that, I feel like a majority of people would greatly appreciate the change, including newer players
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but im sure most current patches break speedfly and stuff
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Because people don't say something if ur doing trash
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> They want to play
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> what
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> the other wxay arounds
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> if its trazsh they cry a lot and if its good they stfu
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah I have a feeling it'll break speedfly and shotgunrun, we'd be capping the speed post tick and I think these happen because of the way collision effects are propagated
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Anyway it will break the physics if ur giving both real strong
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Add an indicator for real strong and then give both strong hook
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> how do u do that on a 64p servr
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Me and murpi tested speedfly on noby's server, he has forced strong hook
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Worked fine
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> The indicator would be like the feet for Dj i guess
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> But yea, idk how he does it
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> noby fng hast also super hammer
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Skeith feels this and that, he feels a lot of things
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I'd feel you
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm actually don't know how you'd indicate with 64p, maybe a slight "glow" around the tees you have strong on?
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ?
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> The strong hook on fng was with Help from qshar btw
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> u have to rank
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> dozens of players
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> next to each other
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> its kinda impossible imo
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rank?
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> player 1 has strong on 2 3 4 5
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> 2 has strong on 3 4 5
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> oh right cuz everyone has another strong
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> how do u exactly tell that on 10 players next to each other
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> it will become a clusterfuck
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> lol
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, but what's important is for you to know who you have strong on, no?
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yeah
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> u could do that differently for each player?
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, sure
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> o
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> thats nice then
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> (tbh thats the exact same problem as we currently have tho)
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> "a counter intuitive mechanic that makes it worse for beginners"
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The order of the entities in the gameworld is what determines this and it's not hard to keep track of that (I think we already do even to force strong)
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Could maybe even find the person that has strong on the most people and mark them differently
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Maybe the hook gets a color Which shows weak/strong for the player ur hooking?
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Sounds really messy to me, I hope it's possible to just get rid of weak hook somehow and keep these other mechanics. Are they even actually used? I know speedfly is
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> shotgunrun Definitely used
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to make everything order-independent you have to audit a lot of code
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think there is no question whether these are used
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah not as easy as one might think to make it all order independent and I think it does always necessitate a second pass
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you could just print a number next to each tee
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds ugly
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, then hook color?
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> huh, sounds less ugly
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 🙂
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hook color, a glow around the tee that you can toggle
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like with the indicator
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hold b down to see who you have strong on
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 isn't it only external velocity changes that need "balancing"
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm yes. but that includes collision
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm maybe we can use a function for changing velocity that everything has to go through?
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not confident enough in that solution to claim that it will definitely work ^^
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> How to split a quad in editor
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> #2257 is caused because we are missing an offline check in PumpNetwork for the dummy
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ᶰ°Konͧsti you sure it's possible? I don't see any reference to it in code
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> [5:02 AM] ᶰ°Konͧsti: noby fng hast also super hammer
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i turned it off on the test server so they could try
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @Learath2 ive seen someone creating a skin with the skin.png everyone have
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Like puzzling it in the editor
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Patiga do you know something about @ᶰ°Konͧsti's request?

12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i think hold ctrl or shift while dragging something
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> although ive never done anything with that, also not sure if its exactly that
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> okay that sorta works, but im unable to cut it down to something sensible, not smth super stretched
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> its shift + drag the corners of a quad
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ᶰ°Konͧsti ^
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> xd thx, i made an extra png for everything now xD
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Isnt this basically uv mapping?
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should be able to map any part of the texture toany quad
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought you actually wanted to cut a quad
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like a knife tool
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i think its supposed to be doable by holding space and selecting the part of the image you want
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> doesnt seem to work tho
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> btw fun bug
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hold space in a quad layer
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> select stuff, click
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> repeat
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> you'll duplicate the image, shift it a bit
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> and the visual bug persists over seperate quad layers
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> when i was a new player i didnt even know weak existed until some aoe video explained it and i didnt notice
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it was definitely surprising to learna bout it so at least indicate that it exists to new players
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i also think the long term benefits of removing weak would outweigh the few strats it would break
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> no u
16:16 <+fstd> snail: what was a fix by me?
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> removing weak hook
17:16 <+fstd> i remember debugging that and finding the cause
17:16 <+fstd> but i don't think i've ever actually fixed that
17:17 <+fstd> because it would require rewriting a good deal of the game core
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i guess im confusing with another patch of urs that we implemented then
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the patch was bears
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> Y
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 whats the differences between default 0.7 protocol and your imported ones?
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I mean, what did you add to get them to work for your project
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I want to do it the same way for my 0.7 server for 0.6 support
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So I need to import the 0.6 protocol and do the changes there
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didnt change much of anything, I emit a namespace block to keep it from colliding with the actual protocol
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is crosscompile.py that generates the message maps
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You also need message repacking if you want to avoid ugly bittwiddling to get the larger messages in there
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes, of course
