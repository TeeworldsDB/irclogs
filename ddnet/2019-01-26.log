00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well how about u ask the rest of the community if they want higher player limits?
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye why not
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what settings have to be changed
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> they won't as the only ppl playing zcatch are those that play it for a very long time, new players have a hard time getting started on zcatch
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> lower limits
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> isn't it currently, that the round just doesnt end, before enough players are on the server?
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> yeah
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> last_standing_players I guess was the setting
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe implement it , that rounds with too few players, like 6-10 only end the round without reward
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the limit is mostly that u can't farm points, isnt it?
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> but on the other hand savander's ranking system will be kind of bypassed because it would not change, how many player syou need to end a round, easy peasy 5 or hard 15
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> you cna farm point, but those have no real purpose, as it's mostly indicating, how long you played the game
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> 1 win would be between 5 killed enemies and 15 killed enemies, what's a big flaw
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> sv_last_standing_players is on 10 atm
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what should I change it to
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> 5 maybe
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> was the default all along
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> but ranging will become flawed
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> but ranking will become flawed
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 10 is the default
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> in savander's modified version
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> now in default zcatch
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> imo you should really poll such things with other zcatch players before changing it
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> as it was supposed to be all along
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe some like it
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> maybe test and see how the player count changes?
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well an idea too yes
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> it would be a win for the community if at leats two servers would get filled at the same time
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> I think that would be a proper tendency to work with
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ok changed to 5
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> on all of them :D?
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i stopped playing zcatch cause the grenade is just gay
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> someone throws a grenade 4 tiles away from me and I die
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> zcatch laser was best ðŸ˜„
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i throw a grenade 2 tiles away from someone and they continue
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i throw a grenade 2 tiles away from someone and they continue running
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> well, I cannot really change that tendency, if ppl don't start playing laser, nobody will play it and if nobody makes the first step, nobody else will do that step and maybe revive laser again
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> on the ger ones
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> are there other countries with zcatch servers
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> would be best if all of them had that setting set, as ddnet servers are the ones mostly frequented
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> some consensus should be created and that maybe foreign players don't have a false image of the mod.. dunno
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <boy man> i mean probably
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <durrtypurrp> @jao pls change it back to 10, its waaaaay to easy to get a win like this
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <durrtypurrp> doesnt work out if you dont got a point system
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @durrtypurrp the problem seems to be that you get no round of zcatch if the limit is too high
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if the ranking system destroys things, maybe it is the problem, not the limit
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <durrtypurrp> well idk if there rly is a problem
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <durrtypurrp> theres everyday a full server
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <durrtypurrp> i know there were like 2 or 3 full servers back then but i dont think dddnet is the problem
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <durrtypurrp> the comeback of your rankings brought ppl back to play zcatch
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <durrtypurrp> and i think this could ruin it again
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as I understand it, zcatch rounds are only played above a limit
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ranks are given at the same limit
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that correct?
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <durrtypurrp> yea you can usually get a win if 10 ppl are playin
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <durrtypurrp> and to get a win with only 5 ppl is no challenge
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so what about playing zcatch from 5ppl onwards and giving out ranks from 10ppl onwards?
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <durrtypurrp> hm you mean the round ends but no rank given?
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <durrtypurrp> that could be ok
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <durrtypurrp> at least change it back to 10 and make a survey or something cause i think many ppl will have a problem with this
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <durrtypurrp> i heard you were able to get a win with 5 ppl when zc started
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <durrtypurrp> and ppl complained about farming wins
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <durrtypurrp> *when ddnet ranking started
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ok will change back
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <durrtypurrp> ty
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chad> Anyone who use Debian/other distro with XFCE?
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> the ranking system is the problem
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> as I said, increasing it to 10 is the same as an easy fix to the problem that a win against 5 people is handled the same way as a win against 15 enemies.
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> thus leading to more problems
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> change the mod to either teelevision's where ranking is handled differently or disable ranks, that would fix it for everyone
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Do you guys know why my deepfly isn't working correctly ?
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> And if yes is there a way to fix it ?
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @Gwendal  you can search for different servers. it works better on some than on others and its different for everyone.
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Uf alright
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> I'll try this thanks
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Gwendal unfortunately deepfly depends on dummy and main having exact same latency, which some ISPs don't provide since we have different ports for them
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <boy man> when would deepflying with a dummy be useful
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Well Relief
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> a whole map based on deepfly
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Just deep fly also
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> and "deepflying with a dummy" is weird since u can deepfly only with a dummy
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> relief is not based on deepfly xd
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> its just cheating parts with it
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Gwendal you can deepfly with others
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> you just need same timing ðŸ˜„
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> well ye but for a nobo like me it is based on df xd
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> And many cheats on dummy maps
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> and ye i never saw this archimede xd
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that's only possible in theory
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> but ye it is possible theory
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> but ye it is possible in theory
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Hello boys my boi @Kei is having issues with ddnet
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Hello guys my boi @Kei is having issues with ddnet
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ben> no u

20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ben> I fixed it lmao
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ben> rip
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> this
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> isn't fixed actually
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> he is stupid
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ben> fu
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ben> I did
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ben> but it worked for 10mins
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ben> okay fixed
