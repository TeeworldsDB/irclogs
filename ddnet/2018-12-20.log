07:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @NeXus doesnt it work if you specify `bind z "rcon tune explosion_strength" 6 24`
07:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> ehm with the toggle before*
07:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> that's sad if noone can't do that :c
07:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @NeXus doesnt it work if you specify `bind z +toggle "rcon tune explosion_strength" 6 24`
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> toggle only works with settings not commands
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> from the point of the client "rcon tune ..." is a command
08:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and from the point of the server "tune ..." is also a command
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Now it works with `bind z rcon toggle_tune explosion_strength 6 24`
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Had a crash on Chile, hope that ^ fixes it. Otherwise it's caused by the connector itself
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> toggle_tune is not merched yet right?
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> toggle_tune is not merged yet right?
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @aqu it's merged. why?
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (not released though)
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but should be on the official servers, but they have an unrelated problem with shutting down üòÑ
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aqu> im not nexus
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aqu> :pingsock:
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the @ in discord is super annoying. @NeXus
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i type @ nexus and press tab and instead I get aqu

22:52 <+Ryozuki> not biased at all uh
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u
22:54 <+Ryozuki> lost all motivation
22:54 <+Ryozuki> to help ddnet code-wise
22:54 <+Ryozuki> even if it wasnt much
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> :c
22:54 <+Ryozuki> well a whole feature like telegun
22:55 <+Ryozuki> its amazing how being banned from ddnet dc makes u feel lot outside of a community
22:55 <+Ryozuki> forum is really dead
22:55 <+Ryozuki> i miss those times where deen made tourns nearly every month
22:56 <+Ryozuki> with sickcunt maps
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ryo... what did you do
22:58 <+Ryozuki> what do you mean
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> also do it with dm
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> pls
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> for getting yourself "banned"?
22:58 <+Ryozuki> please... im on irc
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ikr
22:58 <+Ryozuki> i posted a forum picture where konsti complained about jao
22:58 <+Ryozuki> and jao himself banned me
22:59 <+Ryozuki> on a normal community another admin handles a situation where you are involved
22:59 <+Ryozuki> but its a image
22:59 <+Ryozuki> nothing nsfw
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> you know that you had no permission for uploading rule abusive pictures / posts
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and you didnt warn anybody about posting it
23:01 <+Ryozuki> there is no rule preventing me from uploading a image containing a forum post, even more when it doesnt contain anything offensive
23:02 <+Ryozuki> i dont have to warn anybody when sending a image, lol
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> "oh okay, so we should ignore the fact that the topic was rule breaking, and compare to others who dont want to discuss it more, you ignore their actions about it, which it makes it more abusive."
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> while you had nothing personal on that topic, you ignore everybody who does against it
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> mostly the staff community
23:03 <+Ryozuki> are u copy pasting someone?
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> no, that was my thought. and i dont understand that if you knew about what will happen, then why did you do it in the first place without taking some serious steps
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> konsti banning was a serious issue and i wont actually take this topic
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> just mentioned it
23:05 <+Ryozuki> i actually dont know which are you words
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> and again, i wasnt against konsti but he ignored the rules
23:05 <+Ryozuki> anyway jao is rly biased towards konsti
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> your fenimist opinion. ye we can hate jao for their serious actions but its nothing compare to konsti
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> how long till ryozuki gets kicked off irc for bringing drama back into the dev channel
23:06 <+Ryozuki> the forum post being rulebreaking, i doubt it, he didnt mention jao at all, and its normal to complain in a community, but ddnet admins can't accept it
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> that was clear and we had several proofs that it was jao that konsti was talking about
23:07 <+Ryozuki> show me them
23:07 <+Ryozuki> the proofs
23:07 <+Ryozuki> "we"
23:07 <+Ryozuki> who
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> "only releases maps if you are friends with them"
23:08 <+Ryozuki> if he gets identified by that
23:08 <+Ryozuki> its his fault
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> we heard this sequence from jao
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> its his fault?
23:08 <+Ryozuki> yes, you don't understand?
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> not konstis' who literally ignored the forum rules?
23:08 <+Ryozuki> which rules he ignores
23:08 <+Ryozuki> ignored*
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> that dont post any abusive about admin stuffs
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> konsti could take the topic LEGIT
23:09 <+Ryozuki> "abusive" what is abusive in the post?
23:09 <+Ryozuki> it was a legit post
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but he did with most of insults on it
23:09 <+Ryozuki> did u even see the post
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> that was a fenimist post didnt you see?
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> which was bad,
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> against the rules
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> what else do you need for proof
23:10 <+Ryozuki> fenimist???
23:10 <+Ryozuki> what are you talking about
23:10 <+Ryozuki> dafuq
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ye konsti is literally against jao and his admin situation
23:10 <+Ryozuki> and he can't have that opinion?
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> konsti should say that he is mostly fenimist for people that konsti does not like their opinions / actions about it
23:11 <+Ryozuki> men
23:11 <+Ryozuki> what fenimist means?
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> not if he is insulting
23:11 <+Ryozuki> you made up that word
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> okay, well if konsti could actually write that whole topic without cyberbullying the target (lets say jao for example but for this case it doesnt matter), than why he was actually ignoring all the defensive side of that topic? (like having thought that arent making other people having influence.
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> okay, well if konsti could actually write that whole topic without cyberbullying the target (lets say jao for example but for this case it doesnt matter), than why he was actually ignoring all the defensive side of that topic?

23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> okay, well if konsti could actually write that whole topic without cyberbullying the target (lets say jao for example but for this case it doesnt matter), than why he was actually ignoring all the defensive side of that topic? (like having thought that arent making other people having influence.)
23:14 <+Ryozuki> you don't know what cyberbullying is
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> same as insulting but in front of the computer, on the internet
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> without even knowing each other
23:15 <+Ryozuki> "Cyberbullying includes sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content about someone else. It can include sharing personal or private information about someone else causing embarrassment or humiliation. Some cyberbullying crosses the line into unlawful or criminal behavior." he for sure didnt do any of that
23:16 <+Ryozuki> he made a complain
23:16 <+Ryozuki> on a public forum
23:16 <+Ryozuki> where people can discuss
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> that complain was actually an attack against a player he didnt mentioned his name
23:16 <+Ryozuki> i would send u the image but i dont want to get banned from this channel yet
23:17 <+Ryozuki> a complain is not a attack
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> konsti wanted to take down that person (admin) by complaining about it
23:17 <+Ryozuki> "take down"
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> but konsti didnt said that it was his personal opinion,
23:17 <+Ryozuki> i think you know half of what you are saying lol
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> he said it as a fact
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> he wrote* it as a fact
23:17 <+Ryozuki> lot of people do it when they think its right, but that doesnt make it cyberbullying
23:17 <+Ryozuki> this is hilarious
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i think i know what exactly im writing to you and backwards from you
23:18 <+Ryozuki> yeah backwards xD
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> then why he didnt take this topic in private?
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> he wanted to humiliate that person
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> in a way that he is complaining
23:18 <+Ryozuki> why u cant dicuss something in public when u are on a online community?
23:18 <+Ryozuki> more when it involves someone from it
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> why you want to break the rules for having negative thoughts?
23:19 <+Ryozuki> and more when that involved person is important in the community
23:19 <+Ryozuki> nobody wants o break the rules, idk what u mean by negative thoughts
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> negativity was not the strongness for the system dude
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> nobody should do that
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> even konsti too
23:19 <+Ryozuki> ok ill stop, i cant understand ur malformed english
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> that was your exuse for having confusion? üòÑ
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> okay sy
23:20 <+Ryozuki> "confusion"? being confused?
23:20 <+Ryozuki> yes, i am confused by ur sentences
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> yep
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> then make it understandable
23:20 <+Ryozuki> see
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> by your own brain dude

23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> if i could study english again, i would garantee to you to make it righrt
23:23 <+Ryozuki> yeah but u are saying i dont undestand english, when in fact, it's you not being able to write it properly
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i said you dont understand my sentences, dont take this topic in an other way please
23:24 <+Ryozuki> see? you don't even understand what you say
23:24 <+Ryozuki> thats why this discussion
23:24 <+Ryozuki> is impossible
