08:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @heinrich5991 sometime the libtw2 serverbrowse just misses servers for hours, then i just restart it and it becomes normal again.
08:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe the connection to one of the masters was lost and the scanner just didn't reconnect? (pure guessing)
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> anyone using mosh and tmux on a regular basis here and has some tips and tricks? I sometimes end up with some janky setup to get scrolling and shit work
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: as much as I would appreciate a strong teeworlds base, I can just repeat what I always said.
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Vanilla's anti stl and very slow one man show maintainer, who isn't very active (I don't blame him for that, just fact) don't make it very attractive to me. I ofc allow you to use any code I wrote and put it into vanilla if you have the motivation for that
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Trying not to simp to hard I have to say Oy is a bit underrated. Imo he does a good job also merging stuff. Its not as fast as in ddnet but you can see him taking some time occasionally to go through all the prs. I get your stl issue. But this client side global pointer whatever its called refactor is not really stl related is it?

10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> It isn't but I'd have to make it for two code bases.
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I'd be better if oy gives teeworlds into other hands so that the codebase can finally be redesigned to be very mod friendly and more modern
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> It*
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea I am not going to push you just wanted to mention that I would appreciate it in case you did not think of it or something like that
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I see. Then my answer is. I've no motivation xd
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:( oky
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> gotta love those production only bugs..
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> re Oy being underrated: Oy was kinda unwilling to let other people merge stuff
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my pr is still there :monkalaugh:

14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time goes so fast
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea that is sad. I don’t say he is perfect.

14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> chillerdragion: you are perfect
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> gion oops
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga maybe we could do something to promote editing the wiki
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> we especially need to convey that every little change is very welcome. I think the thing we should fight against the most is people being afraid of editing @Ryozuki
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I mean we don't have to fight the people :D
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but them being afraid :p
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> set fund for bounty
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i found that from tela
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he was afraid of adding stuff xD
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'm afraid of drowning
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he made this https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/Binds
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its nice
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yeah its really good actually
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i added a mention to it on main
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> that article also taught me stuf :)

18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wtf is cd //
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> [timakro](https://matrix.to/#/@timakro:matrix.org)\:  stop backdoor the "cd" command
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> also why doesnt cd /// work?
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> E10) Why does `cd //' leave $PWD as `//'?
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> POSIX.2, in its description of `cd', says that *three* or more leading
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> slashes may be replaced with a single slash when canonicalizing the
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> current working directory.
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> This is, I presume, for historical compatibility.  Certain versions of
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Unix, and early network file systems, used paths of the form
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> //hostname/path to access `path' on server `hostname'.
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> TIL
