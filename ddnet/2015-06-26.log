03:16  * GreYFoX tips his virtual hats to you all :)
03:17 < GreYFoX> it seems I have missed out on a lot

17:38 <@deen> So, Broken will stop hosting DDNet USA. If we want to keep it running, we'll need to get a new server
17:39 <@deen> not sure if it's worth it or if CAN is good enough. Player numbers have been pretty low on USA
17:43 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1692
17:52 <@EastByte> hmm
18:10 < Edible> NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
18:13 <@deen> Edible: you're one of the few USA players?^^
18:13 <@deen> best solution would be to make DDNet more popular in the US
18:13 <@deen> maybe TW being released on Steam will do that
18:14 < Edible> yeah! of course i always play on novice, everyone on USA is always in either brutal or oldschool. so i go to other servers
18:15 < Edible> maybe it will, maybe it wont. I wouldnt get my hopes up. i think the whole steam thing happens every year
18:16 < Savander> <Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/fwnLH6xo8737
18:16 < Savander> <Savander> Its normal? My settings just went away.
18:16 < Savander> <Savander> (settings_ddnet.cfg)
18:16 < Savander> <Savander> ohm.
18:16 < Savander> <Savander> wrong channel.
18:16 < Savander> i sent it on wrong channel (meh)
18:17 < Savander> second time, before it was 1 month ago
18:17 <@deen> Edible: no, TW has never been on steam before
18:18 <@deen> Savander: hm, that should not happen
18:18 < Savander> and i can't reproduce it
18:18 <@deen> the same thing happened to Kayumi, maybe you can ask her how she solved it
18:18 < Savander> probably she setting up it
18:18 <@deen> it would happen if the client crashes while writing the config (while exitting)
18:18 < Savander> again
18:18 < Savander> (as me)
18:18 <@deen> no, i think it always happened to her =/
18:18 < Savander> hm, it's weird
18:18 <@deen> i told her to delete the config_dir and then haven't heard back^^
18:18 < Savander> i didn't change anything in conifg
18:18 < Savander> last week
18:19 < Savander> today i started teeworlds
18:19 < Savander> and "wtf, !? !"
18:19 < Savander> xD
18:19 <@deen> do you have a Samsung SSD? :P
18:19 < Savander> no
18:19 < Savander> xD
18:19 <@deen> because my samsung ssd sometimes overwrites files with 000000
18:19 < Edible> i'm pretty sure its been on greenlight a couple of times
18:19 <@deen> Edible: it's been approved on greenlight
18:19 <@deen> and will be released on Steam
18:19 < Savander> i have seagate 
18:19 < Savander> normal HDD
18:20 <@deen> if a file just randomly disappears, not much i can do
18:20 <@deen> if you can reproduce it, tell me =/
18:20 < Edible> please dont get my hopes up
18:20 < Savander> hm, but it happened only with settings_ddnet
18:20 <@deen> and always make backups!
18:20 < Savander> haha
18:20 < Savander> i'll!
18:20 <@deen> Edible: it will be released 100%, no need for hopes
18:20 < Savander> i wilL!

18:20 < Savander> look here
18:20 < Savander> if you want to help
18:21 < Savander> hah ^.
18:22 < Savander> lol
18:22 < Savander> i deleted settings_ddnet
18:22 < Savander> and it copied my "settings" from vanilla client
18:22 < Savander> and i  have almost all cfg.
18:22 < Savander> ^^>
18:22 <@deen> yep
18:23 <@EastByte> how can there be 5 tees killed in one frame
18:23 <@deen> EastByte: photoshop?
18:23 < Savander> yes
18:23 <@EastByte> ...
18:23 < Savander> it's 
18:23 < Savander> hmm
18:23 < Savander> 10 frames
18:23 < Savander> or maybe less, i have photoshop project
18:23 < Savander> on disk
18:27 < Savander> who made background music in teeworlds, haha it's funny ^^>
18:34 < Nimda> Allround2 by [A] Awesome just released on Solo at 2015-06-26 18:26
18:42 < Savander> custom messages used in ddnet are in file?
18:43 < Savander> or hard-coded into client?
18:43 <@EastByte> custom messages?
18:43 < Savander> from
18:43 < Savander> DDNEt tab
18:43 < Savander> e.h
18:43 < Savander> or HUD
18:43 <@EastByte> e.h?
18:44 < Savander> e.h <- mistake, doesn't matter sry ^:D
18:44 < Savander> impossible to delete messages on IRC
18:44 <@EastByte> still don't understand what messages you mean
18:44 < Savander> translations
18:44 <@EastByte> ah
18:44 < Savander> like "Show others"
18:45 <@EastByte> hm I guess they are spreaded in src/game/client/components
18:45 <@EastByte> probably not meant to be translated
18:46 < Savander> i thought it would be in /data/languages/, but it's unnecessary i guess ;P.
18:46 <@EastByte> oh deen actually used Localize() for the labels
18:47 < Savander> btw
18:47 < Savander> some translations are not in official teeworlds
18:47 < Savander> but here
18:47 < Savander> https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/teeworlds/language/pl/
18:47 < Savander> are translated
18:47 < Savander> maybe it's possible to merge it from there
18:48 <@EastByte> Savander: I think you can use strings like "Show others" and translate them in data/language
18:49 < Savander> i'll try
18:49 <@EastByte> languages*
18:52 < Savander> # DDNet
18:52 < Savander> Show others
18:52 < Savander> == Pokaż innych
18:52 < Savander> i hope, i doing it in right way
18:52 < Savander> but i doesn't work; P.
18:53 <@EastByte> not sure whether you to run some script before
18:53 <@EastByte> never worked on that^^
19:03 <@deen> i don't care much about translations, too much work, too little benefit
19:03 < Savander> so it's not possible yes?^^
19:03 <@deen> sure it's possible
19:03 < Savander> but in current state
19:04 <@deen> just edit files in data/languages/ and restart client
19:04 <@deen> that should be all
19:04 < Savander> don't know how
19:04 <@deen> with a text editor
19:04 < Savander> "Show others" at bottom
19:04 < Savander> and below == Translation
19:04 < Savander> doesn't work
19:05 <@deen> works for me
19:05 < Savander> o.O?
19:06 < Savander> weird.
19:06 <@deen> you have to leave one empty line inbetween, actually save the file
19:06 <@deen> and select the correct language
19:06 <@deen> also make sure to save it in UNIX format, not Windows one
19:06 <@EastByte> ^
19:06 <@deen> you could upload your changed file somewhere and we can tell you what's wrong
19:18  * Learath2 is doing his first nim script :)
19:18 <@deen> nice!
19:38 <@deen> feel free to ask if you need any help
19:52 < Learath2> deen: how can i move the nim compiler to /usr/local/bin like how much needs to be moved ?
19:53 <@deen> it's not recommended
19:53 <@deen> I'd instead add 2 paths to your $PATH
19:53 <@deen> /path/to/nim/bin and $HOME/.nimble/bin
19:53 < Learath2> hmm so if two users want a nim compiler they should both get their own ?
19:54 <@deen> but if you really want it, do ./install.sh /usr/local/bin
19:54 <@deen> sudo
19:54 <@deen> there were a few bugs with it, i hope they're fixed by now
19:54 <@deen> I guess many people who use Nim also hack on Nim, so it makes sense to have it locally so far
19:54 < Learath2> why is it not recommended anyway ?
19:55 <@deen> Because Araq doesn't like the *nix file structure
19:55 <@deen> it's easier to have everything in 1 directory, instead of split up inside of /usr/local
19:59 <@EastByte> oh I nearly reached 6gb with auto demos
19:59 <@EastByte> I think I'll move them out of my ssd
19:59 <@deen> definitely, symlink that to your HDD
20:00 <@EastByte> good idea
20:00 < Savander> okay
20:00 < Savander> translations works
20:00 < Savander> (not all)
20:00 < Savander> Not updates available not works ;P.
20:01 <@deen> if something doesn't work, it's probably not using Localize() in the source code yet. Just change the source code and send me a PR
20:09 < Savander> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/game/client/components/menus_settings.cpp#L1861
20:09 < Savander> i should just replace
20:09 < Savander> "No updates available"
20:09 < Savander> with
20:09 < Savander> Localize("No updates available")?
20:10 <@deen> yes
20:10 < Savander> okay
20:25 < Savander> gad
20:25 < Savander> no idea how to make pull request without one commit
20:25 < Savander> (fps limiter)
20:25 < Savander> it's even possible?
20:31 <@deen> yes
20:31 < Savander> how?
20:31 <@deen> the idea is to put every pull request into its own branch
20:31 <@deen> then you don't run into this problem :P
20:31 <@deen> because each new branch is based on the main one, not each other
20:31 < Savander> ou
20:31 < Savander> okay
20:32 < Savander> ;D
20:32 <@deen> now that you did it wrong already, hmmm
20:32 <@deen> git branch fpslimiter
20:32 <@deen> git checkout DDRace64
20:32 < Savander> i don't need this fps limiter
20:32 < Savander> useless
20:32 <@deen> git reset --hard 'HEAD^'
20:32 < Savander> because it works smillar to CPU Throttle
20:33 <@deen> git push -f
20:33 <@deen> git checkout -b translation-fixes
20:33 <@deen> and then commit your stuff 
20:50 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] savander opened pull request #228: Missing localize + Polish language support (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/vtlXo
21:19 < laxa> https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/614509767747178499
21:27 <@deen> Savander: 2 things to fix, see comments on the PR
21:28 < Savander> one thing
21:28 < Savander> was in mnu
21:28 < Savander> enu
21:28 < Savander> menu in HUD
21:33 < Savander> yes, definitly
21:33 < Savander> it's from there.
21:33 < Savander> it's only used in menu
21:34 < Savander> but hm
21:34 < Savander> you thought about, it's in english when you joining?
21:36 <@deen> yes
21:36 <@deen> the server doesn't know what localization your client has
21:36 <@deen> so don't translate parts in a preview that will be in English on real servers anyway
21:41 < Savander> fixedc.
21:41 < Savander> fixed.
