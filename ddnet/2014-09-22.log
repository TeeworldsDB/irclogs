00:36 < laxa> Nighty night !
00:41 <@deen> bye laxa who doesn't know lexy
12:56 <@deen> heinrich redirected http://ddrace.info/
13:39 < laxa_work> nice !
14:04 <@deen> hi Soreu 
14:25 < EastByte> hello
14:28 < EastByte> deen: so ddnet actually represents ddrace :)
14:39 < Soreu> hi deen
14:41 <@deen> cool, 40 people who searched on google for "ip spoofing teeworlds" went to ddnet.tw...
14:41 < EastByte> where do you get that info from?
14:42 < EastByte> referer?
14:42 <@deen> yes
14:42 < EastByte> ah
14:42 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/report.html
14:42 < EastByte> oh I might be one of them
14:42 < EastByte> 12345
14:42 <@deen> no idea why that comes^^
14:42 < EastByte> xd
14:43 <@deen> but the searches are always funny
14:43 <@deen> "my ddrace map in teeworlds is buggy"
14:43 < EastByte> <script>alert(12345)</script></td></tr><tr><td class="d2">Googlebot/2.1 
14:43 <@deen> ah nice
14:43 <@deen> xss
14:43 < EastByte> ah lol
14:43 <@deen> with logs
14:46 <@deen> tournament video is up
14:47 <@deen> Nice website: http://teeworlds.xzn.ir/
14:47 < EastByte> it advertises for ddnet?
14:49 <@deen> seems to
15:24 < EastByte> already at 256min on rocketfly2
15:24 < EastByte> and it only got a little bit easier
15:25 < EastByte> (256min and not finished yet)
15:25 < EastByte> but the first rank (4min) will be mine of course :)
15:32 < Soreu> last 500 mins too probably ;p
15:33 < EastByte> the last one has 100min
15:35 < EastByte> the fact that the map only has 13 finished speaks for itself :P
15:35 < EastByte> oh wow I failed
15:35 < EastByte> accidently pressed spectator
15:37 <@deen> shit
15:37 <@deen> there is no kill protection for going to spec?
15:38 < EastByte> nope :)
15:38 <@deen> might want to add that =/
15:38 < EastByte> who did /kill again?
15:38 < EastByte> laxa or Savander 
15:38 <@deen> Savander I think
15:38 < EastByte> Savander: do it :D
15:38 < Savander> what
15:38 < Savander> ??
15:38 < Savander> ;D
15:38 < Savander> ah
15:38 < EastByte> Savander: I just failed because of spec
15:38 < Savander> LOl
15:38 < Savander> ah ok
15:39 < Savander> i know what lol
15:39 < Savander> I didn't thought about "join to spec" in kill protection :P :D
15:39 < Savander> :D:D
15:43 <@deen> but you should really add it, Savander
15:43 <@deen> I used to accidentally kill myself like that all the time
15:43 < EastByte> just disable spec on kill protection
15:44 < EastByte> (with notification of course)
15:45 < Savander> i'll add this, because now i need to think where is "JoinToSpectator" event :PP
15:46 < EastByte> gamecontext
15:50 < EastByte> deen: do you think garbage collecting in gamedev makes sense?
15:50 <@deen> depends on the game
15:50 <@deen> for something like teeworlds it would be fine
15:51 < EastByte> I mean, if the game is well planed, manual resource alloc/dealloc shouldn't be a problem at all
15:51 <@deen> for the next game that barely runs at 30fps on 400W GPUs rather not
15:51 <@deen> hm
15:51 < EastByte> well I'm not thinking about the speed right now
15:51 <@deen> i had some trouble in teeworlds with that
15:51 <@deen> maybe that's my fault or it's not well planned in teeworlds
15:52 <@deen> generally you try not to allocate anything in games, right?
15:52 <@deen> at least while the game is running
15:52 < EastByte> I think so
15:52 < EastByte> but that means you have bounds everywhere
15:52 < EastByte> boundaries*
15:53 <@deen> why?
15:53 <@deen> ah yeah, but you can have dynamic bounds at least
15:53 <@deen> set at the map start or something
15:53 < EastByte> for example, you don't know how manye game objects the gameworld will have
15:53 < EastByte> but it's no problem at all to do alloc/dealloc there
15:53 < EastByte> I think gc is more because of lazyness
15:54 < EastByte> I don't have much experience in this topic though
15:55 < EastByte> when I started to use C I loved the feeling of allocation and freeing data
15:55 < EastByte> it feels so clean :D
15:56 <@deen> i'd say it's just one thing less to think about in a GC language
15:57 <@deen> you can still manually allocate and dealloc memory if it turns out that you need it in some place
15:57 < EastByte> depends on whether the language allows alloc/free
15:58 <@deen> I'm mainly thinking about nimrod, c, c++, rust
15:58 <@deen> languages i consider interesting for game development
15:59 < EastByte> hm yes
15:59 < EastByte> so would you use nimrod gc for hookrace?
15:59 <@deen> yes, with the GC running after the frame is rendered and we still have time
16:00 < EastByte> also serverside?
16:00 < EastByte> might be critical while handling >200 players
16:00 <@deen> will have to see how that works
16:00 <@deen> if it ever comes to that :P
16:01 < EastByte> ^^
16:01 < laxa_work> gogogo deen, I stoped to annoy :p
16:01 < EastByte> you did?
16:01 < laxa_work> I think so
16:01 <@deen> and I'm still busy
16:01 <@deen> also nimrod is unusable right now...
16:01 < laxa_work> Boah
16:02 < EastByte> I hope nimrod is not going to rot
16:02 < EastByte> ^
16:02 < EastByte> wow I'm funny
16:02 < laxa_work> !en-fr rot
16:02 < Nimda> Translation: pourriture
16:03 < EastByte> but I already am in a situation in which I can't decide between python,nodejs and nim
16:03 < Savander> ok
16:03 <@deen> for what kind of projects?
16:03 < EastByte> everything
16:04 < Savander> added, i needed re-download ddnet source..
16:04 < Savander> but, ye 
16:04 < Savander> i add spectator protection
16:04 < EastByte> let's say mostly serverside daemons
16:04 <@deen> i still use python for everything ddnet-related
16:04 < EastByte> like ajax
16:04 <@deen> and it's painful because i'm missing nim features
16:04 < EastByte> oh cool
16:04 < Savander> (i hope, i added it correctly :c)
16:04 <@deen> Savander: test it!
16:04 < Savander> i test it..
16:04 < Savander> and it works
16:04 < Savander> xd
16:04 < EastByte> I hate js, I don't wanna use it because it sucks
16:04 < EastByte> but I still do and it's like a standard already
16:05 <@deen> for me python has all the libraries i need and i already have python codebases
16:05 < EastByte> deen: did you see the talk about how asm.js might kill js in the future?
16:05 <@deen> no
16:05 < EastByte> okay nvm
16:05 <@deen> but i heard that we should make nim target asm.js
16:05 < EastByte> yes that might be cool
16:06 <@deen> would also be pretty easy
16:06 < EastByte> via C?
16:06 <@deen> nono
16:06 <@deen> the javascript backend just creates javascript text
16:06 <@deen> it's pretty easy to hack on
16:07 <@deen> but there also was some c -> asm.js conversion using llvm
16:07 < EastByte> yes
16:13 < Savander> wtf
16:13 < Savander> https://github.com/savander/ddnet/commit/0ecbf36de4373fe44018e03acecc75760293eddf
16:13 < Savander> -		str_format(aBuf, sizeof(aBuf), "[← %s] %s", Server()->ClientName(ClientID), pMessage); +		str_format(aBuf, sizeof(aBuf), "[â†� %s] %s", Server()->ClientName(ClientID), pMessage);
16:13 < Savander> why
16:13 < Savander> it change
16:13 < Savander> from [← %s]
16:13 < Savander> to [â†� %s]
16:13 <@deen> your encoding is wrong
16:13 < Savander> what the hell
16:13 < EastByte> your editor sucks
16:13 < Savander> Eclipse
16:13 < Savander> on windows
16:13 <@deen> can you set file encoding to utf8?
16:13 <@deen> that should fix it
16:14 < Savander> i set it
16:14 < Savander> and, then it make it 
16:14 < Savander> like that
16:14 <@deen> then that's weird =/
16:14 < Savander> sec
16:14 <@deen> because the file was utf8 before too
16:15 <@deen> Hm yeah, the result is utf8
16:15 <@deen> maybe eclipse interpreted the file as something else
16:16 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/gamecontext.cpp
16:16 <@deen> this should be fine
16:17 < Savander> https://github.com/savander/ddnet/commit/1278538a84a0ca775a98c45433247262d49d5751
16:17 <@deen> ok
16:17 <@deen> so, pull request coming?
16:18 < Savander> don't know
16:18 < Savander> how to make pull request
16:18 < Savander> xD
16:18 <@deen> https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request
16:21 < Savander> works??
16:21 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] savander opened pull request #44: Kill protection: Prevent joining to spectators (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/A03w5w
16:22 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- closed pull request #44: Kill protection: Prevent joining to spectators (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/A03w5w
16:23 < Savander> okay, so
16:23 < Savander> now i know how
16:23 <@deen> thanks
16:23 < Savander> to make pull request..
17:01 < laxa_work> deen: I can't help myself, but I just had a new idea :D
17:01 < laxa_work> That's called : The weekly challenge.
17:01 < laxa_work> Every week we choose / make a poll for a map
17:02 < laxa_work> and then people have to get the best time during the week to be featured on hall of fame
17:02 <@deen> sounds boring
17:02 < laxa_work> the only thing you would need to do is to host a specific server with that map only
17:02 <@deen> like the old tournaments
17:02 < laxa_work> yeah kind of
17:02 < laxa_work> that would make people run maps instead of just finishing like the majority actually do
17:02 < EastByte> but shouldn't be much work
17:20 < laxa_work> and that would help making the hall of fame grow

18:30 <@deen> Server is crashing again
18:30 <@deen> last message is always
18:30 <@deen>  [14-09-22 17:03:02][game]: kill killer='3:Crayonic' victim='3:Crayonic' weapon=-1 special=0
18:31 <@deen> weapon=-1 means falling into kill tile our out of map
18:31 <@deen> but i don't see a bug in Savander's changes and can't reproduce it
18:33 <@deen> but that change is the only one i added since then
18:34 <@deen> other servers, without it, don't crash
18:39 < EastByte> hn
18:40 <@deen> is there another way to get weapon=-1?
18:40 <@deen> because i can't find one and on that map are no kill tiles or falling down
18:42 <@deen> my bad, there are death tiles
18:42 < EastByte> but that wouldn't cause a crash
18:43 <@deen> got the crash!
18:43 < EastByte> WAHAH
18:44 <@deen> has to do with the map i guess
18:44 < EastByte> okay
18:44 <@deen> it synchronously kills 2 people at the exact same time
18:44 <@deen> still, server shouldn't crash^^
18:45 <@deen> so stupid
18:46 < Tobii> can you now also reproduce it before savanders change?
18:46 <@deen> yeah
18:46 <@deen> had nothing to do with that
18:46 <@deen> it's an old bug i did myself, but it only occurs on this one map
18:46 < EastByte> ^^
18:47 <@deen> when you have 2 people dying in the same tick while being pulled by the same dragger
18:51 < EastByte> hm I have a cool idea for a 1st april event
18:53 <@deen> yes?
18:54 < EastByte> haha, I will implement it and you will see then :P

19:13 < laxa> Where the player list tab rendered in game ? :p
19:13 < EastByte> scoreboard.cpp in components maybe
19:15 < laxa> nop ! menus_ingame.cpp :)
19:26 < laxa> love deen's comment on the code xD
19:26 < laxa> or maybe they aren't from deen
19:27 < laxa> well it is xD
19:27 < laxa> for(int k = 0; k < MAX_CLIENTS-1; k++) // ffs, bubblesort
19:27 <@deen> no it's not
19:27 <@deen> i don't comment :P
19:27 < laxa> git blame tells me you are the last to have changed the line
19:27 <@deen> i changed the MAX_CLIENTS-1
19:27 <@deen> or the space between for and (int
19:28 < laxa> there is no space :)
19:30 < EastByte> this is how it works: https://eastbit.net/public/videos/rocketfly8.webm
19:31 < laxa> beh too bad EastByte
19:31 < EastByte> :(
19:32 < laxa> deen: could you tell me what's exactly needed to compile windows "release" ? I am bored of downloading 35 MB from github :)
19:39 <@deen> i don't know
19:43 < Savander> :/
19:51 < laxa> deen: any idea what file I am missing if it tries to compile with gcc on windows ?
19:54 < EastByte> are u using the dev console
19:54 <@deen> no idea
19:54 < EastByte> if yes, try to remove config.lua and run "bam config"
20:17 < Savander> What the hell
20:17 < Savander> "strong and weak hook"
20:17 < Savander> ;/
20:17 < EastByte> you just realized?
20:18 < Savander> no
20:18 < Savander> but 
20:18 < Savander> why ?
20:18 < Savander> xD
20:18 < Savander> server problem?
20:18 < Savander> or what
20:18 < Savander> i know, it's everywhere ( i guess )
20:18 < EastByte> physics engine problem
20:19 < EastByte> I think it depends on the order the character cores are handled
20:19 < EastByte> deen knows more
20:27 <@deen> yeah, it's the order in which characters are handled because of how they're put into a linked list of entities
20:27 < EastByte> it fixing it will make everything weired
20:27 <@deen> unfortunately, yes
20:27 <@deen> hammerfly physics change etc
20:30 <@deen> pros hated it
20:37 < EastByte> a correctly working physics engine would need many hacks to make it ddrace like I guess
20:50 < Savander> i hate
20:50 < Savander> my mouse
20:50 < Savander> :?
20:51 < o_be_one> hi :)
21:14 < laxa> I guess I am too noob in C++ right now
21:14 < laxa> can someone tells me what's wrong with that ? : 
21:14 < laxa> if (m_pClient->m_aClients[i + 1] && str_comp_nocase(m_pClient->m_aClients[i].m_aName, m_pClient->m_aClients[i + 1].m_aName) > 0)
21:14 <@deen> == 0 at the end
21:14 <@deen> also check if i+1 is not too big
21:15 < laxa> it's in a "for"
21:16 < laxa> well, == 0 isn't exactly > 0 xD
21:38 < laxa> I am so fucking bad xD
21:43 < laxa> deen: http://pastebin.com/LUeTDTzc
21:44 < laxa> this code breaks everything, but it compiles.
21:44 < laxa> Need to know what's wrong :(
21:57 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=446
21:58 < laxa> deen: xD
21:59 <@deen> laxa: that's not bubblesort
21:59 <@deen> i don't know what you're trying to do
21:59 < laxa> it's my own bubblesort
21:59 <@deen> no, that is definitely not bubble sort
21:59 < laxa> well, it's a sort right ?
21:59 <@deen> no
22:00 <@deen> it just breaks everything and probably segfaults
22:00 <@deen> why do you set i to -1?
22:00 < laxa> to reset the loop
22:04 < laxa> deen: can we use std::sort in teeworlds code ?
22:04 <@deen> as i said, it's c with classes
22:04 < laxa> hum ok
22:06 < mr_pause> Hello
22:06 < laxa> ...
22:06 < mr_pause> What does it mean, "it's c with classes" ?
22:07 < mr_pause> laxa: Ca compile avec quoi ?
22:07 <@deen> doesn't use modern c++ features, like the STL or templates
22:07 < laxa> g++ sur linux, VS sur windows
22:07 <@deen> mostly standard c functions
22:08 < mr_pause> Well but you could use them right ?
22:08 < mr_pause> std::sort seems better than hand coding some shitty bubble sort inline
22:09 < mr_pause> Especially if coded by laxa =)
22:09 < mr_pause> (trust me)
22:09 < laxa> xD
22:09 <@deen> I'd prefer to keep the source in the same style
22:10 < mr_pause> Well at least use stdlib sorting functions i don't know
22:10 < mr_pause> What's the point using half of C++ ? =/
22:11 <@deen> ask the TW devs
22:11 < laxa> mr_pause: c'est pour ça que je proposais à redpist de tout recoder en C++ !
22:12 < mr_pause> laxa: ARGENT
22:12 < laxa> xD
22:12 < mr_pause> laxa: man qsort, utilise ca
22:13 < laxa> Mon sort fonctionne
22:13 < laxa> C'est pas ça qui merde
22:13 <@deen> qsort is NOT standard c
22:13 < mr_pause> deen: Well, still better than nothing =D
22:13 <@deen> also the language here is supposed to be english, not everyone understands french
22:13 < laxa> sorry deen
22:13 < laxa> !trace 37.161.45.139
22:13 < Nimda> 37.161.45.139's location: Colombes, Ile-de-France, France
22:13 < mr_pause> C was a long time ago =D
22:14 < laxa> wtf
22:14 <@deen> I'm pretty sure C is one of the most popular languages even today
22:15 < mr_pause> I mean, a long time ago for me
22:15 < mr_pause> So i don't really remember what's standard C or not =)
22:16 <@deen> it says so in the manpage
22:16 < mr_pause> Mine says:      The qsort() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9899:1990 (``ISO C90'').
22:16 <@deen> oh
22:17 <@deen> my bad
22:17 < mr_pause> I'm on OSX though
22:17 < mr_pause> xD
22:17 <@deen> yeah ,it's C89 and C99 as well
22:17 <@deen> might even work with VS

23:17 <@deen> then i don't accept it
23:17 < laxa> hum :(
23:18 < laxa> I'll ask for help to my friend mr_pause then :p
23:18 < laxa> or maybe you can help me if it works, to make the code better :)

23:35 <@deen> not at all iirc
23:35 < mr_pause> It does not want to compile in 64 bit arch
23:36 <@deen> no idea, always worked automatically for me
