00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> TSMC is also building a massive fab in Texas, but these things take sooo long
04:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> btw, the map Pogchy used the telegun/telegrenade quite nicely
04:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like it, thanks for creating it @Ryozuki ðŸ™‚
04:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-8127-how_do_i_crack_satellite_and_cable_pay_tv @Learath2 unwatched, but re the discussion the other day
04:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this year's offline ccc was also cancelled ðŸ˜¦
07:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice :brownbear:
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just when i needed a https cert letsencrypt is down https://letsencrypt.status.io/
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
08:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lucky
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Use staging `acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org` :wesmart:
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29338965
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hackernews is with me
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got my cert already btw
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pro tip: renew ur certs days before the expiration
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not at the last days
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine this happens then
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Actually, certbot renew should be in crontab and it should auto-renew all certs much earlier than a day. This was the main promise of letsencrypt, getting a certificate totally automated
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Being for free is just a side-effect of this: Since you can't forget to pay, you won't get a broken certificate for not paying
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (ddnet.tw still had a certificate failure recently, but I'm not sure what happened there, might have been a cloudflare issue instead)
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye i do it automatically
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never renewed it manually
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i saw some comments on hn
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen actually certbot is not part of letsencrypt as is
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> letsencrypt actually lists multiple clients for renewal, etc
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here is the list
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Letâ€™s Encrypt does not control or review third party clients and cannot make any guarantees about their safety or reliability.
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > Recommended: Certbot
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Good enough
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ‘€
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro do you have the teesmash server config with votes?
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen found it
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/unique-clan/unique-scripts/tree/master/teesmashcfg
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im glad we are open source too!
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a template
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think this script does the magic <https://github.com/unique-clan/unique-scripts/blob/master/build_config.py>
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen <https://github.com/unique-clan/unique-scripts/tree/master/teesmashcfg/maps>
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you can add the missing maps from here
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> smashy series
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> done
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ‘€
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki thanks!
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :brownbear:
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't like certbot, it feels so overbuilt
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I usually use acme.sh but would use something even more lighterweight if it existed
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I use https://github.com/diafygi/acme-tiny
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> golang
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah no python
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> golang is more blue white
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Python I can tolerate as long as it's something I never have to tinker with
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> after using rust i rly dislike golang error handling
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> feels dirty
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and wrong
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a good blog post on why golang is badly thought https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-want-off-mr-golangs-wild-ride
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Any error handling after rust feels pretty sad
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u should read it
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (btw this guy is one of the best rust bloggers)
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imho
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tho his articles can take more than an hour to read xd
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's the way I like my articles
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has one about C and utf8 and people that complain about rust having 2 types for strings: String and &str
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly good too
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They need to take as long as possible so I can get away from my miserable existence
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://fasterthanli.me/articles/working-with-strings-in-rust
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 read this
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has C on it
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only 75 mins
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it's C hate you need to give me a trigger warning
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if its c hate
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz its just stating truths
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, fasterthanli.me
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good way to spend an hour or two understanding rust's async e.g.
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay this article is silly. I started only depressed now Iâ€™m annoyed and depressed
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you know that in a language that has no concept of unicode, handling unicode requires you to do it yourself SMH
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or get this, a language with automatic memory management is easier to use correctly than one with manual memory management. Revolutionary
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > That was (part of) an environment variable! Those are stored right next to the program's arguments in glibc, the GNU C library.
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> isn't that the linux kernel that does this?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well the article explains why rust aproach is better
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you know if you cast away const you could break things? My mans saying this like all C programmers cast away const daily. In the decade Iâ€™ve been programming in C I have not seen more than 3 instances of people casting const away
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 iirc this article was made cuz there were a lot of c devs saying uh duh  rust has 2 types of a string etc
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> All in beginner quesitons
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the str searching functions in C casually cast const away
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > #include <stddef.h>
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > void *memchr(const void *s, int c, size_t n)
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > {
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >     unsigned char *p = (unsigned char*)s;
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >     while( n-- )
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >         if( *p != (unsigned char)c )
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >             p++;
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >         else
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >             return p;
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >     return 0;
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > }
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://clc-wiki.net/wiki/C_standard_library:string.h:memchr
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk what this kind of article is called but I hate it. Coding in one language like a braindead flipflop and comparing it to another without artificially hindering themselves
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 did u fully read it tho?
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i bet not
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Iâ€™m like one paragraph away from finishing it
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz he implements the utf8 in c too later
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i knew u would get kinda triggered xd
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `toupper(0) = 0` sounds reasonable
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The fact that String and &str exists can be justified without the need to pull in an another language and code in it like a baboon
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean it's the identity for all non-letters, including U+0000, I guess
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in fact, rust does the same:
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```rs
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > cat a.rs
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fn main() {
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     println!("{:?}", "\0".to_uppercase());
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> }
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> $ ./a
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "\u{0}"
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet there is some ambiguity in the standard he is talking about there
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > Lucky `toupper` has no way to return an error and just returns `0` for `0`, right? Or maybe `0` is what it returns on error? Who knows! It's a C API! Anything is possible.
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Converted character or ch if no uppercase version is defined by the current C locale.
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds pretty clearcut to return 0 if passed 0
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the function is a bit ouch though
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's UB to call it with a `signed char` or a `char` that is signed
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/string/byte/toupper&oldid=94327
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it the case in C too or is it some C++ oddity?
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I usually assume that these things are the same in C and C++, let me double-check
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the c11 standard, there's no UB
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah well
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is "a character"?
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heh, yeah those things can be a little vague
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe check the definitions at the start?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doing so rn
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > **character**
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > âŒ©abstractâŒª member of a set of elements used for the organization, control, or representation of data
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't know what to do with this
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> is there a way to save settings without closing the client? if not can we get one? \:)
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no :)
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.blog/2021-08-27-30-free-and-open-source-linux-games-part-3/
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually not bad list
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet not in there t ho
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, Teeworlds was in part 1 already
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Easy to learn, but hard to master, Teeworlds is a nice little MMO thatâ€™s a mashup of retro platform and shooting games. Customize your character, battle with up to 16 players, create your own maps, or check out some of the amazing community-created maps.
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >

19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> MMO sounds a bit weird
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tho
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> @heinrich5991 what about #4380?
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4380

23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i didnt wish to be born chill
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Is there a tutorial for ubuntu ddnet server setup?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> deen
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> typing..
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :justatest:
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> download version for linux from ddnet.tw, extract, run ./DDNet-Server (potentially in screen so it keeps running after you close your connection)
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> ufw allow 8303 and server working fine
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> I can't seem to find config file
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> data/autoexec_server.cfg
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Forgive my ignorance, I've only created servers for source engine games before.
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> thats not called ignorance
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Turkish community needs gores server and I want to provide it.
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Every Turkish player who wants to play gores has to enter German servers.
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> What procedure do I need to validate my server?
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The checkmark you mean? That is only for official DDNet and KoG servers
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so only the ones I run and Avolicious runs
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> I don't know exactly how ddnet global work. Many players in Turkey suggested that I open a server. 
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> Because they wanted a gores server in Turkey.
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> So if I can do something like authenticate/certify my server I would like to do that.
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No, you could ask Avolicious to run a KoG server in Turkey
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or you can run your own, but then the ranks are not connected
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and it's only on Internet tab, not KoG
