14:58 < o_be_one> hi :)
14:58 < o_be_one> players seems to be happy about the new CAN servers
14:59 < o_be_one> and pings for Canada is 20 to 30ms. For US its 50 to 70ms (some US players come here)
15:00 < o_be_one> the server seems to be very stable, i never lag on it.
15:01 < o_be_one> but idk how, Broken sent a message on the server without beein connected on it ... Is it possible ? Oo
15:02 < o_be_one> well ive read "join" message but not possible to see him
15:02 < o_be_one> even in status, and no left message
15:25 < NOOOOOB> cemetery IRC channel :\
15:39 < Axomar> Hey :)
15:39 < Axomar> Deen r u there?
15:39 < laxadedi> I think he is away for the day, not sure though Axomar 
15:41 < Axomar> Oh okay, is a other Tester or a Guy who can make the Map by Waschlappen released by Broken on the Testserver, i want test them. :/
15:41 < laxadedi> Are you a tester ?
15:42 < Axomar> I'm currently being tested, but I get the rights of deen and Saavik
15:42 < laxadedi> I don't understand you :)
15:42 < Axomar> >.<
15:43 < Axomar> deen and Saavik said i can test any Maps, but i have not all rights, better? :D
15:44 < laxadedi> so, what you need is just a map on testserver right ?
15:44 < Axomar> Jeah sure, i have rcon rights and the password :)
15:44 < laxadedi> where is the map ?
15:44 < Axomar> Only the Map on the Testserver
15:45 < Axomar> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=671
15:45 < Axomar> This Map pls :)
15:45 < laxadedi> Ah, I can't download it :(
15:46 < Axomar> Oh :/
15:51 < laxadedi> Axomar: I don't think there is a tester on this chan, you might have more luck in game to find someone who could help you.
17:50 < Savander> Good bye
19:44 <@deen> laxadedi: i don't know, why would someone want it deleted?
19:45 < laxa> no idea, I asked
19:45 <@deen> everyone else who asked me something is gone already^^
19:45 <@deen> Has anyone experienced problems with the ddnet.tw website loading slowly?
19:54 < o_be_one> no deen ive used the forum, no problem, very fast
19:58 <@deen> o_be_one: Seems like a few german providers have problems. I got 90% packet loss earlier
19:58 <@deen> and the other guy has 50% packet loss for 1 week now
20:01 < o_be_one> :(
20:01 <@deen> I actually had to send him new ddnet client on skype^^
20:24 < laxa> deen: question ! Why my ddnet's server version is not 6.2.1 ?
20:24 < laxa> it says 5.1
20:25 < laxa> server is : ddracepro.net:8303
20:25 <@deen> because you're running an old version?
20:25 < laxa> no
20:25 < laxa> I compiled last version this week-end
20:25 <@deen> maybe you forgot to restart servers
20:25 < laxa> or maybe I did something wrong
20:26 <@deen> check **/version.h
20:26 < laxa> oh I know
20:26 <@deen> it should say 6.2.1 there
20:26 < laxa> I compiled sql
20:26 < laxa> and I use not sql :D
20:26 < laxa> I don't have maria db running :(
20:26 <@deen> mysql also works
20:26 < laxa> really ?
20:26 <@deen> yes, they're mostly compatible
20:27 <@deen> i used mysql at the start for ddnet
20:27 < laxa> but for example, I tried running my servers with ddnet
20:27 < laxa> but records weren't working
20:27 <@deen> then switched to mariadb, but didn't have to change any code
20:27 <@deen> yeah, i silently changed the database format
20:27 <@deen> to allow for nicer queries
20:27 <@deen> there was a table for each map
20:27 < laxa> ok so
20:27 <@deen> now it's 1 table with a Map column
20:28 < laxa> if I set sql's shits
20:28 < laxa> I can use all features ?
20:28 <@deen> hmmmmm
20:28 <@deen> you can use /rank, /rankteam, /top5, /top5team
20:28 < laxa> well, it's not like it matters, I won't use, I don't have the use for it
20:28 <@deen> but points won't work, and neither will /mapinfo
20:28 <@deen> you need a table record_maps
20:28 <@deen> with information about your maps
20:28 <@deen> then mapinfo and points work
20:53 < NICOs> hey guys| HEY LAXA
20:54 < laxa> Hey
20:54 < NICOs> if i remember well you did an update on teeworlds...
