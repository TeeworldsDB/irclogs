12:17 <@deen> right right
12:17 <@deen> didn't think people would notice^^
12:25 <@EastByte> I will finish SilentNight first
12:39 <@EastByte> well already beaten by Themix
12:39 <@deen> ^^
12:50 <@EastByte> aaaan again
12:55 <@EastByte> this is quite funny http://eastbit.net/public/videos/themix_is_fast.webm
12:57 <@deen> haha
12:57 <@deen> first rank for 3 seconds
12:58 <@EastByte> and I enjoyed the glory^^

13:55 <@deen> Learath2: were you afk for a bit? not moving?
13:55 <@deen> Learath2: because afk players don't get a vote
13:59 < Learath2> yep i was
13:59 < Learath2> well if noone votes maybe it should also pass
13:59 < Learath2> nah that would be wrong
13:59 < Learath2> if only 1 person is in server it should always pass maybe
15:01 <@deen> i guess. feel free to add that :P
15:46 < Learath2> sure i will i just wanted to ask if that felt appropriate

16:05 <@deen> hi o_be_one 
16:19 <@deen> Any thoughts whether we should give players a veto right on map change votes if they're far in the map and not afk?
16:20 <@deen> because I'm adding that right now
16:24 <@EastByte> we should test it
16:24 <@EastByte> but how do you find out how far players are in the map?
16:24 <@deen> just their time =/
16:24 <@EastByte> hm
16:25 <@deen> no A* search through the map and locating them on it :P
16:25 <@deen> people will definitely complain, but they complain about every new feature
16:26 <@deen> and right now i get complaints all the time of people who had 100-200 min on a map and then a few noobs joined and voted another one
16:26 <@EastByte> the thing is the time isn't really expressive
16:26 <@EastByte> I often hang hours in a map just to help others
16:26 <@deen> nope, but we have many servers, so you can just go to another one
16:26 <@deen> doesn't hurt to change server quickly
16:26 <@EastByte> right
16:27 <@deen> better to err in that direction than the one we err in now
16:29 <@deen> and testing this voting stuff is always terriblwe
16:30 <@deen> because each ip only counts once, so i can't just run 10 clients, no i have to connect 1 through localhost (ipv6), localhost (ipv4), lan (ipv6), lan (ipv4), internet etc
16:30 < o_be_one> you cant just use time to know how far is a player cause players like broken can spend many time to do nothing for a while and far in a map, just to wait is afk friend or just for fun with his friend
16:31 <@EastByte> right but that's not a problem
16:31 <@deen> o_be_one: that's ok, they should keep playing, even if they're slow
16:31 <@deen> in that case it's ok that vote fails
16:32 <@deen> oh, and being afk would exclude you from vetoing
16:32 <@deen> just as it excludes you from voting at all
16:32 <@EastByte> how does that work btw?
16:32 <@deen> when you don't move for a few minutes, you count as afk
16:32 <@deen> you can tell, the eyes look sleepy
16:32 <@EastByte> and when will this status be removed?
16:32 <@deen> when you move again
16:32 <@EastByte> can I vote afterwards?
16:33 <@deen> yes
16:33 <@EastByte> that doesn't make sense to me
16:33 <@deen> why?
16:34 <@EastByte> so when I'm afk I can simply press some keys and vote
16:34 <@deen> yes, but you're not afk when you press some keys
16:35 <@EastByte> I count idling in tw while being on desktop as afk aswell^^
16:35 <@EastByte> so players can put a tee ingame, keep it idling and cancel all votes
16:36 <@deen> yes
16:36 <@EastByte> wouldn't it be a good idea to exclude people who were afk before?
16:36 < Learath2> people afk at the start of the vote should be excluded from voting at all imo
16:36 <@deen> so someone's playing a 2 hour map, goes afk 5 min somewhere at the start and suddenly can't veto
16:37 <@EastByte> he can't do is veto while being afk anyways
16:37 <@EastByte> his*
16:37 <@deen> sure, but he was afk at the start
16:37 <@deen> and that will kill him 2 hours later?
16:38 <@EastByte> I'm confused
16:38 < Learath2> me too
16:38 < Learath2> afk at the start of the vote not afk at the start of the map
16:38 <@deen> ah, i thought you meant who were ever afk before
16:38 <@EastByte> oh?
16:38 <@deen> how would afk people even notice that a vote has started? why would that matter?
16:39 <@deen> I'm not sure what you're imagining
16:39 < Learath2> atleast thats what i wanted to say not sure if thats the same thing east wanted to say :D
16:39 <@EastByte> they can pretend to me afk
16:39 <@EastByte> to be*
16:39 <@deen> EastByte: why would they? they could just move every few secs and not count as afk
16:39 <@EastByte> well right
16:39 <@deen> so yes, this can be abused
16:39 <@EastByte> but that requires botting/macroing
16:40 <@deen> no, they could just sit on the server and chat with their friends
16:40 <@EastByte> that's not idling^^
16:40 <@EastByte> well nvm, I see it doesn't matter
16:40 <@deen> ok
16:41 <@deen> want to come test it?
16:41 <@EastByte> yep
16:41 <@deen> r0q.no-ip.org:8902, pw nimrocks
16:42 < o_be_one> and what if i just click + alt-tab to keep my tee firewall or hooked ? Is it detected as AFK ?
16:49 <@EastByte> is firewall some nasty blocker term?
16:51 <@EastByte> deen: your server got attacked by SIGTERM
16:52 <@deen> come back
16:52 <@deen> i restarted it^^
16:52 <@EastByte> k
17:00 <@deen> 20 minutes fine as a default for when vetoing starts?
17:01 <@EastByte> I think so
17:01 <@deen> same we have for kill protection
17:01 <@EastByte> yep
17:03 <@deen> Here we go:

17:08 <@deen> ok, running on all empty servers, I'm expecting complaints by the night^^
17:09 <@deen> Also, now I finally see how many ddos attacks we really get on GER. The DDoS protection catches about 5 attacks on an average day
17:09 < o_be_one> woaw
17:09 <@deen> hah, circleci told me that ddnet repo didn't build!
17:10 < Learath2> deen: does circleci try to compile it on all target OS or just linux ?
17:10 <@deen> just ubuntu
17:11 <@deen> would be too nice if circleci offered all platforms
17:11 <@deen> and if they let me download the finished binary :P
17:11 <@deen> then I wouldn't need all my virtual machines
17:13 < Learath2> well we did have a setup like that for ddrace when grey was around
17:14 < Learath2> each commit triggered a build on buildbots and they just uploaded the finished package back to ddrace.info
17:14 <@deen> sure, that's nice
17:15 <@deen> but I think it's good enough to have it on my VMs and just run them when needed
17:15 <@deen> otherwise they take so much RAM and CPU for nothing
17:15 <@deen> it's crazy how Mac and Windows VMs eat so much CPU and RAM =/
17:15 < Learath2> true
17:17 < Learath2> its quite nice that circleci offers the first container for free
17:17 <@deen> first container?
17:17 < Learath2> You get 1 container for free
17:18 <@deen> dunno what a container is
17:18 < Learath2> the vm things that do the building
17:18 < Learath2> they call them containers
17:18 <@deen> ah, you have 4 for free
17:18 <@deen> 4 in parallel*
17:18 <@deen> I don't think I'll ever need more than 1 in parallel, not sure what kind of huge tests people run there
17:19 <@deen> it's crazy that you get all that computation power for free
17:20 < Learath2> well ddnet build doesnt have any tests
17:20 <@deen> right, don't think I want tests in a game
17:20 <@deen> the community is my test :P
17:20 < Learath2> well what would you test anyways :D
17:21 <@deen> it's crazy how they found soo many bugs and segfaults
17:21 <@deen> but haven't seen any now since forever
17:48 <@deen> except sometimes some software still crashes, but no idea why
17:48 <@deen> for example mysql sometimes segfaults
17:48 <@deen> (the server)
18:03 <@EastByte> deen: qz people seem to like the update
18:04 <@deen> qz clan? the veto?
18:04 <@EastByte> yes yes

18:42 <@EastByte> https://github.com/yegord/snowman <- cool an opensource decompiler for x86,amd64
19:04 < goo> hi deen! im not sure what is causing the high cpu usage or the network issues
19:14 < Getsuga> Sue za server :P
19:16 <@deen> goo: hi, hm
19:16 <@deen> nice to hear from you anyway! are you alright?
19:17 <@deen> goo: any way to contact Web Africa?
19:29 < goo> im alright thanks, winter here, and the flu is going around, got a cold myself though
19:29 < goo> and you?
19:29 < goo> web africa, not really, they are like any company
19:37 <@deen> I'm fine
19:37 <@deen> hm, would be nice to tell someone that the server is a bit fucked =/
19:39 < goo> in what way? does it need a format?
19:40 < goo> format reinstall
19:40 <@deen> no, don't think so
19:40 <@deen> it's just often overloaded, even though nothing in my system is causing load/cpu
19:41 <@deen> and network problems
19:41 < goo> ddos?
19:41 <@deen> don'T think so, no
19:41 < goo> the openfng server is often freaking out
19:41 < goo> sometimes certain people will lose conenction
19:42 <@deen> yes, same on all DDNet South Africa servers
19:42 <@deen> that's the problem I'm talking about

21:12 <@deen> Removed a rank yesterday where someone sent me a "fixed" version of a map with a legitimate fix, but also continaing a shortcut for himself
21:15 <@deen> hi lordtheuns 
21:15 < lordtheuns> hey hey
21:15 <@deen> South African server is making problems
21:15 <@deen> Lots of high load and connection problems
21:18 < lordtheuns> Yeah I have been told this by some of the users. I don't really have much to do with that vps anymore but i'll find out what has been going on there
21:18 <@deen> thanks
21:20 < laxadedi> ok, I have some time to try to compile ddnet on OS Mavericks
21:20 < laxadedi> deen: what's correct bam command for ddnet release ?
21:21 <@deen> bam release
21:21 < laxadedi> hum ok
21:22 < laxadedi> it's compiling like 377 files on mac
21:22 < laxadedi> I felt that was overkill somehow
21:22 <@deen> it's all in x86 + x86_64
21:22 <@deen> there's a special command to just do one of them
21:23 <@deen> release_x86_64 i gues
21:23 <@deen> guess*
21:23 < laxadedi> hum, is there any way to have some verbose with bam ?
21:23 <@deen> no idea, not a big bam fan
21:23 < laxadedi> I'd like the compile line from gcc for example
21:23 < Learath2> depends on what you want verbose
21:23 <@deen> -v?
21:23 < laxadedi> I want the -I options
21:23 <@deen> yep, works
21:24 < laxadedi> to know if compilation is searching headers in the right folders
21:24 < Learath2> oh yeah i did that while debugging -v 
21:25 < laxadedi> nice, ty

21:29 < laxadedi> (sorry for spam)
21:30 < laxadedi> somehow, my directory containing that X11/Xlib.h file is in /opt/X11/include/X11/Xlib.h
21:30 <@deen> so -I/opt/X11/include
21:30 < laxadedi> is that bam.lua fault or SDL ?
21:31 <@deen> dunno
21:31 <@deen> really
21:31 < laxadedi> Hum :(
21:31 <@deen> i think SDL
21:31 <@deen> but SDL shouldn't even need X11
21:31 < laxadedi> Ok, so I am going to make a crappy fix for myself only
21:34 < Learath2> your version of sdl somewhy wants to use x11
21:35 < Learath2> laxadedi: what does bam config output for you ?
21:36 < laxadedi> wait, compiling with crappy fix #1
21:37 < laxadedi> anwwww, new error
21:38 < laxadedi> freetype compiled with wrong arch or smt
21:38 < Learath2> well where did you get your freetype ?
21:38 < laxadedi> latest sources I think
21:38 < laxadedi> I think freetype not compiling properly for OS X
21:39 < laxadedi> ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture i386
21:39 < Learath2> well brew install --universal freetype is what got me a working one
21:39 < Learath2> i couldnt get it to work with one i compiled from sources
21:39 < laxadedi> That would explain that error :)
21:44 < laxadedi> Learath2: thanks, that worked :)
21:45 < Learath2> so you got it compiling ?
21:45 < laxadedi> Yup
21:49 < Learath2> oh i know why it compiled out of the box for me b/c XQuartz actually used to be a part of mac osx
21:51 <@deen> ah, they removed it?
21:51 < Learath2> deen: franken says /points doesnt work in south africa
21:51 < Learath2> https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201341
21:52 < Learath2> and yep X11 removed
21:53 <@deen> Learath2: should be fixed already
21:54 < eeeee> laxadedi: i usually compile teeworlds like "CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/X11/include bam client_debug". works and doesn't require editing bam.lua or anything like that
21:55 < laxadedi> ok :)
22:02 <@deen> eeeee: that's so boring. You should learn to appreciate that ddnet uses C, C++, Python, Lua, Nim and maybe 10 more languages
22:15 < Learath2> github needs to update their nimrod syntax
22:15 <@deen> do so please
22:16 < Learath2> dont know the procedure tho :D
22:17 < Learath2> ill ask github support
22:18 <@deen> you can change it yourself i think
22:18 <@deen> but sure
22:21 <@EastByte> Learath2: and maybe name it nim
22:21 <@deen> EastByte: that has been reported 10 times already
22:21 <@deen> their system doesn't allow language renames^^
22:22 <@EastByte> oh
22:22 < Learath2> wait until C is renamed to Cee and watch how they will rename it 
22:22 < Learath2> they just dont want to take the time for a little language like Nim
