01:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> lul
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> new cleint is pretty buggy
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> takes lots of time to reload
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> and when i alt tab
02:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> it freezes for some seconds
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> alt tab is windows bug
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or "feature" xd
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> doesnt freeze for me
04:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> never happened
04:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> to me
04:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> lagging like this
04:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @|UroboroS| Rockus.~ ok Windows settings -> system  -> focus assist (the one with the moon as icon) -> disable the automatic rules
04:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
04:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tell that anybody who uses windows, all happy
04:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> what does that do
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> what does it do @Jupstar ‚ú™
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> I remember alt tab started being slow after a windows update
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Amu~Cookie> for me
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> Exactly, this happens since an april update
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> It fixes ofc
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> or borderless
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> will help as well
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ did u just recommended me to buy a new computer? My macbook is not state of the art but very close to it. And dropping macOS isn't a good idea. We have some very important tees using mac as their only and or main machine.
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes i highly recommend you buying a new PC, so you aren't a slave for apple anymore, np.
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> As soon as apple dropped OpenGL support i don't see a reason why we should support it. Or do you want to write a metal backend and give apple, what they wanted... the right to controll your software
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont use my macbook as the main machine but its the only laptop i own that can run teeworlds with nice fps
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because apple is nice
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i spend 3 times the price on the razer blade pro and it cant run teeworlds half as smooth as my macbook can
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> also my ubuntu laptop sucks at it
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xDDDDDDDD razer nice
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> much better
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it runs windows
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and has a 1080
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> dude u generally buy overprived hardware?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> my ubuntu laptop cost only 500 and is from lenovo
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then install linux on your macbook, then its good xd
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ._.
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah sry, but i don't give apple any existence, i never seen something not "dick move" from them
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the os is beatiful
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can't argue on that, but i'm ok with tastes, if you like it ok. but that doesn't mean every developper should care about it, or needs to change its software because the maintainer changes something so common
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> opengl is the so highly accepted currently
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's just a sad dick move
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye i agree the openGL support breakup sucks
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> even most embedded system run it
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i agree
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and i also run windows on my main machine currently
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but there are many interesting and important people who are even more die hard apple fans than me and loosing these dudes is not good .-.
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> indeed
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> strange ppl xD
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if linux or even better FreeBSD would get over 50% marketshare on desktop pcs... i wouldn't see any reason for any other OS XD
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Vulcan is the future
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> i saw "Apple" I gave up
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> 2muchCancer4me
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xen> üè≥  ü•ñ
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Vulkan is actually pretty nice stuff
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's much lower overhead then OGL
18:49 <+Learath2> and it's not apple's work btw, it's mostly work by AMD donated to some non-profit
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> no
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> it is slow
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> form e
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> now that i updated teeworlds
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> it's different
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> not windwos update
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> lower overhead?
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Vulkan actually is lower than OGL in design
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i gives more controll over your graphic application, but doesnt need to be faster. it depends on what you need and how well the dev codes it
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Yea, lowe. but it means that you need to write more stuff before making triangle
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> For me, actually super beginner, OpenGL is much simpler
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> But Khronos Group made some wrappers I guess
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ofc opengl is simpler, vulkan is supposed to give more lower level access thus less overhead
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but in exchange you give up more simplicity
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Maybe i didn't understand your first statement. For me Vulcan give me more overhead, since i need to know much more to just start
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> but you are right
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I meant overhead as in the library creating overhead for operations not development overhead
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes vulkan does create a lot more development overhead
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Maybe i didn't understand your first statement. For me Vulcan give me more overhead, since i need to know much more just to start
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> geuss ill just not update anymore then xd
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> That's the solution, ya
