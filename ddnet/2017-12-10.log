01:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> huh
13:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Bobface> Does anyone know some details about the current ddos on GER servers? Layer 3/4 or 7?
14:27 <+fstd> couldn't you tcpdump it? or are you already nullrouted?
15:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Bobface> How should I dump it? I am not running the servers
15:26 <+fstd_> okay
15:50 <+Learath2> I actually don't see any unusual traffic in the dump
16:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Bobface> Well it is lagging all the time on GER since weeks now
16:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Bobface> But very inconsistent lag
16:05 <+Learath2> I might just get another server to test until they stop it but I doubt they won't ddos that aither
16:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Bobface> Do you know which kind of ddos it is?
16:12 <+Learath2> as said I didn't see it on a (albeit short) tcpdump I took yesterday
16:12 <+Learath2> we were getting a lot of SYN flood before this
16:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Bobface> okay thanks for the information
