00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you send that cmake php missing error as not a screenshot? ChillerDragon
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> nvm unpreventable because it's determined in the client, if it receives `NETOBJTYPE_CLIENTINFO`
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if we just don't send this i assume other stuff breaks
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if we put `TEAM_SPECTATORS` in `m_Team` when the netobj is sent, im sure that messes with xPanic logic and UI
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> my suggestion is to just not show the message in the client if `CServerInfo::m_aGameType` is not equal to any vanilla mode or any ddrace mode
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i guess we can check for fng too
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> only problem is that people use this for other stuff, like showing additional server info
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> many different strings here. substring for "fng" i think is also a lazy solution
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/966466496572317696/unknown.png
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> race modes ive seen: DDrace, TestDDrace, Race, +DDRace, iDDRace, XXLDDRace, and PPRace
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so i guess if the substring method is viable we can also check for "race"
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I'm not sure how DDrace has done away with teams, whether that's based on `CServerInfo::m_aGameType` or not
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but maybe there's some logic there to modularize and create a similar thing for *Panic modes
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ive spent way too long on this, gonna give it a rest
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, finally finished the #developer chat for the last 1.5 months
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only took like 3 hours ðŸ˜›
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yay now you can help me determine the best way to hide team balance messages from modes that are asymmetric
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> we could just build a list of "infect" modes in the client, is this an appropriate solution?
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no. add a flag to game info I guess
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if `CServerInfo::m_aGameType` is an exact match, we could include a flag not to show this message
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> hmm for servers? and if they support the flag and have a value for it, ignore message
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> since right now there is a flag for teambalance but it's on the client
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for servers to send to the client
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if the client sees the flag, it won't show the message
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea good idea
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well, either way it requires a change on ddnet client, so ill deprioritize it for now
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> having this kind of open-ended client-server relationship leads to some interesting solutions xd
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that change is probably quite easy and could be added
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea it seems like it is
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i could prep so the commit would be in tandem with it, but i would stick it in a new PR
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im making one for the rest of the issues
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and i need to ACTUALLY fix my github runner
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> they changed apt or ubuntu or something
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> huh, seems there's a somewhat active fork of my fork, translated to chinese
02:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://github.com/TeeworldsFun/teeworlds-xPanic
02:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> which is actually based on gerdoe's fork
02:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> xd
02:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> kurosio -> kaitlynia -> gerdoe-jr -> TeeworldsFun
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> most of this is just translations to Chinese, but there are some desirable changes, like changing the linked binary to say "xPanic" and other strings
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ah there's other maps too
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and this change? not sure <https://github.com/TeeworldsFun/teeworlds-xPanic/commit/3f84d5a17992e9685c30326cff89b3391b888ba0>
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe triple XP
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lol wait i think i know this person
02:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @FlowerFell-Sans hi
02:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this is your fork, correct?
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh wow, i think this change actually increases the xp cost, not decreasing it
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so triple the XP required per level
02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <M Emile> mind linking me the right github to suggest changes real fast?
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> btw i fixed my issue with GitHub actions, they updated ubuntu which affected my use of `ubuntu-latest` in `main.yml` so now I'm only testing on `ubuntu-18.04`
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's in #announcements
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <M Emile> i just go to issues and type it over there right?
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yes
02:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> confirmed compiles with my latest changes
02:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> todo: health as percentage, remove health broadcast, start level/xp discussion, rework turrets to avoid abuse
02:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> also all of the security issues are also somewhat urgent but we can chat about this when more europeans are online again lol
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> todo: health as percentage as m_Health hearts, start level/xp discussion, rework turrets to avoid abuse
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> todo: health as percentage in m_Health hearts, start level/xp discussion, rework turrets to avoid abuse
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <M Emile> i'm working on suggestions for turrets rn
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <M Emile> i've been chatting with reaz who also played the old versions back then, and we have a few different ideas
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <M Emile> i'll post the issue in a bit once we're done chatting
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sure
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if we expect it to be a long-form conversation we can turn it into a GitHub discussion instead of an issue, but i prefer issues mostly
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <M Emile> I'm still thinking we should find a few OG players who saw the different versions and played them
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <M Emile> because that's who we should be talking with about balance/gameplay tweaks
02:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> seems like in C we can just use something like `sha3-512`, see this accepted answer in C++ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51144505/generate-sha-3-hash-in-c-using-openssl-library
02:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> gerdoe recommended we use openssl
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> might as well use sha3 before people make the jump
07:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> what did you think kekw, its like one of the first kurosios projects
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i didnt know it was first
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but yea its a mess
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> do u think u could help with the hashing part
07:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> we would need to migrate current passwords

08:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ye ill try to do something this week
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> btw its better to make it from 16.0 ddnet sources
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ye but
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> too lazy 2 rebase + afraid of breaking shit + dont know C++
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://danlark.org/2022/04/20/changing-stdsort-at-googles-scale-and-beyond/
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> has anyone ever used imgui? looks cool af
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Wow you really need to mentally prepare yourself before reading that std::sort post :kek: :justatest:
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i prefer the rust one
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/emilk/egui
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here is the demo when compiling to wasm thanks to rust 1st class support for it <https://www.egui.rs/#demo>
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> have to learn rust if I want to use that tho :pepesad:
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> worth it
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I have the book but I don't have time
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Quite interesting, a little too heavy on the theory but very readable even so
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apparently there is a new stable sort
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> glidesort?
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i overread it on hn
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the fastest unstable one is pdqsort
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which rust uses already :BASED:

12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if there is a pattern that defeats the pattern defeating quicksort ðŸ˜„
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sounds very halting problemy
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD https://github.com/C0D3D3V/ddnet/commit/fe1cf90327ae2a0859d5d9669c384dfd8d9b0e1a
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> nice compatibility, very intuitive ^^
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> ðŸ˜³
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> imagine jsx in unity
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/966743845406662656/YZ111D6R96AL6UUILD7E.png
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ngl it might be a good idea to do ui with sth like react native
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A universal language for ui regardless of platform sounds nice
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @murpi  did you code this castle discord cog yourself btw?
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what castle?
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I also noticed @Ravie coding, everyone is a developer now, great to see
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for the April 1 event
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> yes
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was surprised by ravies pr
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly gud
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> after all the years playing teeworlds I finally caught the coder virus ðŸ¤§
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this is ridiculous
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> don't forget ill also eventually start coding :greenthing:
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it would be easier if i could y'know, compile xpanic on windows
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sheep best coffee
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ...
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> coder
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> now I want coffee
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just install linux
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> im thinking of making a visual assistant app for automapping
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> im thinking of making a visual assistant program for automapping
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea that would be nice. I built some crappy visual debug info for automappers just for personal use and it helped a lot to debug my long ass rules
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Also thought about some visual editor. Would be very convenient and nice for non technical people
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no can do guey
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/966779490611105862/unknown.png
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use this
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/emilianavt/OpenSeeFace
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its FOSS
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> hmm
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this part worries me though
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> "This is a tracking library, not a stand-alone avatar puppeteering program."
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> seems like it's not meant to do exactly the same thing?
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ryozuki starving to death because his local farmers didnt use a FOSS tractor
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like the vtuber scene doesnt have much linux presence
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> unfortunately
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or basically, the vtuber scene is just vseeface
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there is a huge overlap with programmers and vtubers though
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and being trans
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the trifecta
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not trifecta
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ok yes trifecta
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sorry i forgot what words were
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> literally the main two programs for vtubing are written by trans girls
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> veidotube and vsf
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/Inochi2D/inochi2d
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> live2d
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> er, not even
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's its own specific protocol
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://github.com/Inochi2D/inochi-creator
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> better
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its prob a open protocol
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unlike vroid
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the demo they have is cute, but my impression is that it's a toy program
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> for now
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the fox girl is better than ur vtuber
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> here's veadotube (i spelled it wrong originally)
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://olmewe.itch.io/veadotube-mini?download
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://olmewe.itch.io/veadotube-mini
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you can probably run it fine under wine
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it is such a CPU-intensive program, i dont rly want to try that dx
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it is such a CPU-intensive program, i dont rly want to try that xd
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wine only translate system calls, so shouldn't be a problem
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and wm calls
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I have one question about Automap if I am to make a program for it:
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> where in the ddnet script does automapping lay inside?
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> mm i still worry if it affects perf a bit
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> my pc already 100%
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> `src\game\editor\automap.cpp` and `automap.h`
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> probably because they have a continous loop, not because you have underpowered pc
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> same for ddnet, it uses 100% of a single cpu
