00:15 < bridge> <kaffeine0> I mean that personally I strongly tend to develop a software rather than making a game, and better code review and code quality will payoff by less bugs and easier features implementations. There is a lot of inherited issues, we don't need to contribute to that number.
01:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @nouaa epic. I had to giggle a bit when you actually posted in that weird "live chat" issue. But hey if it works it works right :D 
01:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 thanks for verifying my assumption that ddnet puts the token at the end c:
01:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I used the word "compatibility" because the vanilla implementation of the protocol uses lengths to determine packet end right? So a non ddnet 0.6.5 implementation would just ignore the extra bytes at the end. Or are those tokens only sent to ddnet clients? If that is the case why is it not using 0.7 style tokens?
01:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Ayo any vim users ever had the urge to bind something like ctrl+a followed by ctrl+b. My use case would be ctrl+k ctrl+t but ``<C-k><C-t>`` does not seem to work. I know there is the magic vim ctrl+w which waits but i wonder if i can make others wait too.
01:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``<C-w>a`` works but ``<C-k>a`` does not ._.
01:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wait it does?!
01:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh im jutst too slow the delay is so short xxxxxxxxxxxD
01:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok nvm C-k C-t works just fine. Was a skill issue of typing it fast enough into da keyboard 
02:05 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> What you protobuffin?
03:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 done all servers updated 🚀 c:
05:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Either I am not as git pro as I thought or there is a bug in git. Which is more likely hmmm ...
06:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Hmkay to be fair git dropped a warning but its interesting that git merge works and git rebase deletes code lol
06:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok nvm it was a me issue ours and theirs have different meaning in merge and rebase
07:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Chillerdragon: everything in my team search uses protobufs
07:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wowo pro
07:05 < bridge> <milkeeycat> website backend, rust server and ddnet server
07:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what do you use the ddnet server for?
07:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> isnt it getting its data from the master?
07:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ppl play there xd
07:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh
07:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It has to send data when someone finish a map
07:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> So website can change status of a run
07:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> To finished
07:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> And it closes the server
07:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay then i dont understand your project
07:07 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ;-;
07:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ill send a vod later
07:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> When show how everything works
07:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Vid*
07:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it will match you with someone in your skill level and then you can play on team server servers with them?
07:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what? ddrace?
07:09 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Yea
07:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It will not match tho, u will have to select ppl in team urself
07:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> So how is it different from just joining the server and asking for team in chat?
07:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> And is what ever feature you offer worth it to give up on farming ddnet points? ._.
07:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Eeeh
07:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Basically nothing
07:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 😄
07:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ?xd
07:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is it up and running already?
07:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> where can i try
07:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Build everything urself :santatrollet:
07:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> too lazy lemme know when you launched i wanna see it
07:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what is this. is this a reason for me to not learn rust
07:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
07:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> do i have to
07:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes
07:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> its the law

08:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lez go xd
08:41 < bridge> <matodor> pls allow 0.7 to die 🥺
08:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 0.7 is merged
08:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
08:42 < bridge> <matodor> :owo: OK
08:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its funny how everyone can merge 0 commits without write access
08:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> such a troll situation
08:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok lemme fix this mess
08:50 < bridge> <jxsl13> thanks @chillerdragon

09:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> getting there :gigachad:
09:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: only sent to ddnet clients
09:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: because they were first implemented in ddnet, probably without looking at the data on the network. I dislike ddnet's implementation
10:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see
10:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lets go change ddnet protocol to 0.7 protocol
10:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ayo @heinrich5991 any chance i could borrow your phone again? :D i got locked out of my minecraft account ._.
10:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: https://github.com/teeframe/protocol-documentation/issues/1#issuecomment-1952957118
10:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sure, I'll head to IRC
10:17 < bridge> <cyberFighter> huh
10:17 < bridge> <cyberFighter> how do you borrow a phone?
10:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah not now i gtg @heinrich5991 but nice thanks
10:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cyberFighter he sends me phone number i enter it as my phone number on account sign up xd
10:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if i need 2fa code i ask heinrich
10:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how about u enter ur phone number .-.
10:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont have a phone number
10:28 < bridge> <scrumplex> ChillerDragon: Why did you invite me to teeworlds-community :O
10:34 < bridge> <kekomonter> Anonymous
10:53 < ChillerDragon> @scrumplex because i just cloned prism so i remembered u existed
10:53 < ChillerDragon> why teeworlds community is here https://github.com/teeworlds-community/teeworlds/issues/71 and who teeworlds community is basically everyone
10:54 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 here now u rdy?
10:54 < bridge> <matodor> you can dial number `07` on any phone and the chillerdragon will pick up
10:54 < ChillerDragon> lol
10:54 < bridge> <teero777> true
10:54 < bridge> <teero777> i tried once
11:06 < bridge> <cyberFighter> chillerdragon: wtf
11:06 < bridge> <cyberFighter> never heard of that
11:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> never heard of someone borrowing a phone? Yea me neither I don't think its a common practice.
11:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yo @scrumplex is prism supposed to work compiled from source on debian? The profile icon is not displaying and i get some weird auth errors even tho in the browser ms said it worked
11:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is the azure app in the default branch not correctly setup for production usage?

11:15 < bridge> <teero777> leak!
11:16 < bridge> <cyberFighter> chillet can u send me ur minecraft account i lost mine also
11:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1710152154.png
11:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 i really do hope that is not a leak xd
11:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do i have to download the sussy binary blob again to make it work -.-
11:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oke scrumpli does not seem to be a build from source issue. Seems to be a ms issue. Even going to my ms account page in my browser is causing infinite loops. Dude ms builds the worst websites its crazy
11:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/issues/1223
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and this is why games without accounts are way more fun i was thinking about playing minecraft in the morning and now its after dinner
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> never add accounts to ddnet hehe
12:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> totally not copying cargo
12:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1216702244984983553/image.png?ex=66015944&is=65eee444&hm=41cce8157db0f38022f9efec7e29facafaca3a16e06c80103fceb20a22139e51&
12:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think copying is nice then users do not have to relearn just because you had to reinvent the interface
12:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> chiller wanna try edlang?
12:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/edlang/releases/download/v0.0.1-alpha.13/edb
12:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> linux only
12:11 < bridge> <scrumplex> you might be missing qtimageformats, which is loaded dynamically by qt
12:12 < bridge> <scrumplex> ChillerDragon
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> ./target-ed/edproject
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> Segmentation fault
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol rip
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> tested on my debian
12:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> omg im stupid
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki>  if has_main {
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki>                 link_shared_lib(&[object], &output)?;
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki>             } else {

12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki>             }
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> should be other way around
12:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Indeed I did not have that installed @scrumplex but i installed all packets recommended by the compiling wiki <:tee_thinking:478629518358085653> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1710156215.png
12:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @scrumplex also which troll did this ?!!?!? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1710156264.png
12:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there are comments in a multi line command this is not a copy pastable code snippet its super annoying
12:48 < bridge> <scrumplex> you could use our makedeb package instead btw
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes but i prefer from source
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then i do not need to mess with makedeb 
13:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 can u add a noise gate to the mic at pipewire level?
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> its funny googling this all results are noise cancellation
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is not the same
13:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> noise gate is super chear, it filters out sounds at < Xdb
13:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> noise gate is super cheap, it filters out sounds at < Xdb
13:16 < bridge> <scrumplex> ChillerDragon: i mean makedeb is just like makepkg on Arch Linux. It still builds from source. You just get the advantages of having an actual package
13:32 < bridge> <learath2> On a technical level it is possible. Idk if anyone implemented it yet though
13:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess discord filter is enough xd
13:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got a cardioid mic so i can use speakers while voice xd
13:42 < bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/VeJa-Plugins/Noise-Gate seems someone did write a filter for it
13:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/edlang/releases/tag/v0.0.1-alpha.14
13:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> i fixed the previous build
13:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> edlangc is like rustc
13:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> edb is like cargo
13:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> u only need edb tbh
13:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> i accept name suggestions
13:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> mail me at suggestions@edlang.org :EZ:
13:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> mail me at suggestions@ed-lang.org :EZ:
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 is there a kernel config that makes segfaults show on dmesg?
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> `program-name[13422]: segfault at 18 ip 00007f3481af310b sp 00007fff9ed04500 error 4 likely on CPU 7 (core 7, socket 0)`
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:49 < bridge> <learath2> I don't think there is a way to disable it even
15:51 < bridge> <learath2> Oh there is. It's not a kernel config tho, `debug.exception-trace`
15:51 < bridge> <learath2> Actually wait all sysctls should have a kernel option too
15:51 < bridge> <learath2> But I can't find it grepping huh
15:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> /proc/sys ?
15:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Dude @miguilim https://wiki.vg is so good
15:56 < bridge> <learath2> Found it, I was grepping wrong `CONFIG_SYSCTL_EXCEPTION_TRACE`
16:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: https://streamable.com/ypd4xk xD
16:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> couldnt upload that big vid on github ;-;
16:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat ah i see so its better organisation for 64p team runs than posting in #general
16:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not bad u have a shit ton of features and nice front end
16:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i personally am just not hyped about the use case but maybe others are. If this launches i will for sure sign up to spam some shits into this social media app.
16:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Speaking of social media.. i was browsing github and found this xd
16:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that was fun 10 minutes
16:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1710171458.png
16:54 < bridge> <Iza> team searcher is cool but to me it would only make sense for a larger community
16:55 < bridge> <Iza> for now you could've always join random servers and ask players to team which is what i always liked about ddnet
16:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon it would be bajillion times cooler if players could get real ranks there
16:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> But it's not possible x)
17:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> looks really cool 😮
17:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> think about whether people will actually use it though. it would be sad if even more effort was expended if it'll be unused
17:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Nobody will probably use it
17:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> But at least ill add this project to my portfolio :p
17:52 < bridge> <louis> real af
17:55 < bridge> <devinci24> HE/SHE/IT/THEY/WHATEVERTHEFUCK :trollet:
17:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Good that i didnt show report reasons :justatest:
18:14 < bridge> <murpi> You're missing a few gender options, take a look at this example: https://ra.co/register
18:41 < bridge> <teero777> just make a input text field at this point xd
18:42 < bridge> <teero777> they can write whatever they want.
18:42 < bridge> <teero777> *limited by utf-8
18:46 < bridge> <learath2> gender input should be an arbitrary precision vector in an infinite vector space
18:47 < bridge> <teero777> nah i exist in negative dimensions
18:47 < bridge> <learath2> :pepeW:
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> How about you can just upload any file as your gender, no file size limit
18:48 < bridge> <teero777> inifinite storage glitch
18:48 < bridge> <teero777> xd
18:48 < bridge> <teero777> my gender is shrek2.mov
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> if it doesn't fit on our servers we buy more servers to accomodate
18:48 < bridge> <teero777> my gender is shrek2_1080p_hd.mov
18:48 < bridge> <teero777> xD
18:48 < bridge> <teero777> nice
18:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I identify myself as zip bomb
18:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 😏
18:49 < bridge> <teero777> i was about to
18:49 < bridge> <teero777> but it wouldnt work xd
18:49 < bridge> <learath2> Do we have to extra
18:49 < bridge> <learath2> ct?
18:50 < bridge> <learath2> Worst case we can buy that decommisioned NSA plant in salt lake city that has a couple petabytes of disks sitting there rotting
18:51 < bridge> <teero777> i identify as an Exabyte
18:52 < bridge> <teero777> *not compressable
18:52 < bridge> <learath2> :pepeW:
18:52 < bridge> <teero777> i have no idea why ppl want gender on their website anyway?
18:52 < bridge> <teero777> better ads?
18:53 < bridge> <learath2> an exabyte of pure entropy would be hard to store, but I guess we can just ask google to help, they should have a couple exabytes
18:53 < bridge> <learath2> or it's a dating website
18:53 < bridge> <teero777> yea so put its like split in 3 pots xd
18:54 < bridge> <teero777> i would like to date a star destroyer
19:00 < bridge> <peter44h> I have not heard of this
19:02 < bridge> <peter44h> I can't find any evidence it's decommissioned, no doubt if it was the case they would be destroying all those hard drives
19:03 < bridge> <peter44h> Still crazy, I didn't know of this
19:05 < bridge> <learath2> My information about it being decommissioned might be wrong, iirc it was but it might not have been. Most information about this kind of stuff is usually 5th hand conspiracies 😄
19:07 < bridge> <peter44h> Understandable
19:08 < bridge> <peter44h> I mean, I wouldn't go as far as to say "conspiracy" because practically all of the ones about the NSA are literally true

19:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> the hidden inflation
19:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> both are same liquid content btw
19:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> where is ur portfolio
19:37 < bridge> <teero777> what context is this in?
19:38 < bridge> <learath2> corporate greed knows no bounds, you know they were already making an insane profit on the first one too
19:38 < bridge> <teero777> but why?
19:38 < bridge> <learath2> and there is nothing you can do about it, what you won't drink coke?
19:39 < bridge> <learath2> that's how the system is designed, more money more better
19:41 < bridge> <peter44h> Capitalism maximizes profit and literally nothing else
19:53 < bridge> <teero777> what do you do with more mone?
19:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I dont have one yet. I wanted to make a page on gh pages but 1. i dont have any projects to show 2. i couldn't come up with a design for the page(that's mostly why i didn't do it)

20:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> cool discord image
20:22 < bridge> <learath2> too late, already hacked
20:22 < bridge> <learath2> Did I tell y'all about someone trying to hack me yesterday?
20:23 < bridge> <learath2> I knew immediately what he was trying, but went along with it just to see what he sends me, bro took 1 hour to send me the worst virus ever made
20:23 < bridge> <learath2> When I called him out on it he just doubled down telling me it's not a virus but a game
20:35 < bridge> <devinci24> Was the game fun? :troll:
20:40 < bridge> <learath2> There was no game
20:41 < bridge> <devinci24> :feelsbadman:
20:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> even protobuf-compiler from apt has warnings :pepeW:

21:21 < bridge> <teero777> have you tried?
21:21 < bridge> <teero777> you can't know it wasn't legit after all!
21:29 < bridge> <learath2> I decompiled it, there is no game. It's a python script
21:30 < bridge> <teero777> ;(
21:30 < bridge> <teero777> send here i wanna see
21:30 < bridge> <learath2> It digs lots of information about your computer, and finds your ip, idk what it does with that though, didnt keep digging
21:31 < bridge> <teero777> where does it send those infos?
21:31 < bridge> <teero777> just spam with random info
21:32 < bridge> <teero777> spam them with random info
21:32 < bridge> <learath2> I did not look, when it was obvious it was a virus I ran it on a VM, it just collects the data then intentionally triggers a bsod
21:32 < bridge> <teero777> woah
21:32 < bridge> <teero777> lame
21:33 < bridge> <teero777> not even easter eggs?
21:34 < bridge> <learath2> Bro did not even bother to rename the python script he  hid in there, it was a compiled python script called `Zhack.pyc` embedded in a pyinstaller exe
21:34 < bridge> <learath2> If he called it `Game.pyc` I'd be less sus
21:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> even then, pyinstaller is already pretty sus
21:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, it wasn't a teeworlds mod
