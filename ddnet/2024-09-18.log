00:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> only to get trolled
00:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg i even was right
00:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> faku teero -.-
00:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @pathos3005 i have a "ChillerDragon's CTF GER1" test server. at 88.198.96.203:8309 the password is 123 feel free to report bugs and ill probably fix them in the next few days
00:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ i just realized ddnet servers announce them selfs as 0.6.4 xd imo we should update to 0.6.5
00:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> update to 0.7
00:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats already done
00:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> next is 0.6.5
00:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then i get triggered whenever i jump onto the server
00:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> WAIT WHAT
00:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wow
00:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you admit 0.6.5 > 0.7
00:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I am impressed
00:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i admit 0.6.4 < 0.6.5
00:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's ok chiller
00:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the dark side is pulling
00:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You are on the correct path
00:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller
00:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just install discord XD
00:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you miss all the fu
00:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> n
00:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat fun
00:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> #developer alone is enough time sink already
00:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> alr time to get some coffee 
00:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> afk
00:16 < bridge> <teero777> spreader of evil
00:37 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe it should be entirely different
00:38 < bridge> <Ewan> it is a 0.6 compatible client but to see the two as the same on the server end doesnt seem future proof
00:38 < bridge> <Ewan> because one is receiving updates and the other isn't
01:01 < bridge> <pathos3005> Thanks, will try it out -- just out of random curiosity, I'm also thinking about team colour coordinated bullets (red/blue shotgun pellets, red/blue grenades, red/blue lasers, red/blue pistol bullets), but I'm unsure where in the code I would need to change that. How much code do you think this is without adding console commands or settings?
01:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @pathos3005 server side not possible. how much code it is client side idk
01:29 < bridge> <pathos3005> Yeah for sure it's client side
02:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> @chillerdragon, I ran the tests locally, not looking at the network data, just stepping through the code. ctrl-c leads to CtrlClose being sent and in case of being kicked, no control message is being sent.
02:27 < bridge> <jxsl13> hughly confused, where that extra message might come from? your ddnet client disconnecting from the server?
02:27 < bridge> <jxsl13> highly*
03:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i tried kick and full server and saw the packet in tcpdump
03:18 < bridge> <jxsl13> my guess, that's coming frm somewhere else üò¶
03:18 < bridge> <jxsl13> can you try with th current master state
03:18 < bridge> <jxsl13> the
03:18 < bridge> <jxsl13> master branch
03:19 < bridge> <jxsl13> are you staying connected to the server with your ddnet client ?
03:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> cannot get the libtw2 dissector plugin running on macOS
03:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> ...
03:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> hm, progress
03:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> doesn't like arm64
03:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can also just use raw tcpdump or wireshark
03:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its plaintext anyways if you have a reason
03:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nah i gotta debug my bugs now -.-
03:25 < bridge> <jxsl13> dumb question: do you close your ddnet client that you use for kicking the go client while still capturing the network?
03:27 < bridge> <jxsl13> I see the comment, clearly something else
03:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> I know the problem
03:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> the example needs to be updated
03:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> updated examples
04:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> any idea how i can get rid of this spam ``Dummy is already connected/connecting.`` i have my dummy connect and switch to dummy on the same key
06:42 < bridge> <melo∆û> :monkaStop:
07:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: it's true that both 0.6 and 0.7 have version in server info but to get to version field i have to parse token first, and it's different for 2 versions
09:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @milkeeycat: every port should only have one version. Either 0.6 or 0.7 and when you get the token packet you also already know which version it is. The token packets from ddnet 0.6 and teeworlds 0.7 are different
09:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Seems like you have to introduce a version state per port
09:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So a connection for connectionless packets hehe
09:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :pepeW:
09:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Do you know how to detect the version based on the token packet already or where are you currently at?
09:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im in `CClient::ProcessServerInfo`
09:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i just have to know when parse 0.7 info
09:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so you already handle both kinds of tokens?
09:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not sure if 0.6 even has tokens 
09:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk the protocol 
09:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i didn't touch what already worked
09:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but I added some stuff to get correct token and send serverinfo packet
09:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when you get the token where do u store it
09:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i added a vector of connless packets
09:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> C++ bloat xd
09:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> which will be sent when they will have correct token
09:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how do you know which token belongs to which port?
09:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> anyways ideally you don't touch ``CClient::ProcessServerInfo`` the 0.7 bridge should not pollute the ddnet 0.6 code
09:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you could add a new ``PreprocessConnlessPacket()`` call here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/96ad30eb21dad20a307e2c6636004aca41fc887c/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L2508-L2509
09:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if it sees the 0.7 header it unpacks the 0.7 server info and repacks it as 0.6 server info so in the end it hits the 0.6 code
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> all of it master jedi
10:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im so confused on https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8977 omg
10:14 < bridge> <zhn> yes
10:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``pClient->UpdateRenderInfo(true, IClient::CONN_MAIN);`` sets correct teams for the main tee
10:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``pClient->UpdateRenderInfo(true, IClient::CONN_DUMMY);`` sets correct teams for dummy
10:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> setting none gives empty default textures
10:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> setting both sets only teams for dummy?!
10:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> NO WAY
10:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i did the best typo lmao
10:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i tried to type ``Sixup`` and ended up writing ``Xusep`` xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxD

10:44 < bridge> <zhn> lan comes

11:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Does it show if the player not in spec?
11:12 < bridge> <robyt3> yes, the client is a player if it is not a spectator
11:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is it possible to play on 0.7 servers using ddnet client? -.-
11:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I somehow connected to it only once and it doesn't work for me anymore xd
11:25 < bridge> <learath2> Ask chiller, he added the support for it
11:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: send help
11:27 < bridge> <robyt3> I also had that issue when working on some seemingly unrelated changes to 0.7 skins :pepeW:
11:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``connect 127.0.0.1`` connects with 0.6 protocol
11:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``connect tw-0.7+udp://127.0.0.1`` connects with 0.7 protocol
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat 0.7 added bot support to the master. Maybe heinrich ported it to 0.6
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh that was Oy 13 years ago
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/96808a11451f2ccf22346253bd22f8f559207ac8
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> might still be 0.6
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat iirc in 0.6 ``bool m_Player`` is true = in game and false = spectator and in 0.6 its spec/bot/ingame
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/c56fa9e6a20cfc9d7d16502e18c7d7633acdf492/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L1128
11:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ok, i did break 0.7 somehow :pepeW:
11:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rip
11:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it connects only once
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in 0.7** its spec/bot/ingame
11:36 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> bot like the serverside bots
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they are officially supported by 0.7
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is a client side antenna bot texture on the tees
11:37 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> they knew game was dead as hell
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and you can filter them out in the master server
11:37 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> so they added bots
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they didnt add bot
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just the flag for modders
11:37 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> bot support whatever
11:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> wait, I didn't break anything
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Oy does not care about players actually
11:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it just has wrong protocol in `server address` filed
11:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it just has wrong protocol in `server address` field
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nob
11:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> whew
11:38 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> what does oy even do
11:38 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> has anyone even heard from him
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for a living?
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> he was online this year
11:38 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> idk in general
11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk anything about him
11:39 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> mysterious person
11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> he is probably 50 yrs old and german
11:40 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> sounds just like deen lmao, tho idk about the age
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just a random guess from my side maybe he is also 30 :D 
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> heinrich might have some better intel on him
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> deen is quite different than oy
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I bet heinrich knows him IRL
11:41 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> in what way
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> deen is like 32 or smth
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he ain't that old
11:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> deen is new teeworlds player
11:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> new :lol:
11:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> he is super active and public
11:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Oy is og teeworlds player and inactive and there is little public info on him
11:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> deen responds to pullrequests within minutes
11:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Oy responds to pullrequests within years
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I just wonder why Oy got tw repo alone?
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> How did that happen
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Do we have history?
11:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> last time someone bumped the copyright year the pr got outdated before it got merged xd
11:42 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> lol
11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :lol: :lol: :lol: :lol:
11:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> deens entire life is fully public. his face, first name, last name, family status, his location, his work.
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> His kid was born on the same day as ddnet was founded
11:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> EVERYTHING IS PLANNED
11:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
11:43 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> his kid is ddnet
11:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also deen cares about the players
11:44 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> a ye true
11:44 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> but if oy doesnt care about players what does he care about then
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The question is, why is it soo insanely important to oy and the tw gang to keep teeworlds dead
11:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but maybe oy does too idk. I just remember someone quoting him saying something along the lines of "back in my days tw had 3 active players. idc if it goes back to that"
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I just so hard don't get it
11:45 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> maybe they think they cant get it back
11:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not sure what oys mission is im trying to talk to him since a few years
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And then?
11:46 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> game finished? i guess?
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> They don't care rn about tw, why does it matter if tw gets famous and they should care again
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> he is harder to reach than mrafk5991
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That is kinda lame
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Oh yeah super finished xD
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> heinrich is super ez to reach
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he responds to emails within 3 months
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lol
11:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the last 20 pings i made to heinrich went into the void
11:47 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> do dms instead
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Intentionally ignored
11:47 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ez
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Do a pr where you replace https master server with ftp master server
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and he will be there
11:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh yea he occasionally writes comments on gh
11:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks for working on this big ass issue btw @milkeeycat 
11:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can someone help me ping @lukure

11:57 < bridge> <lukure> are u ingame? XD
11:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
11:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i gtg in 5mins
11:58 < bridge> <lukure> where?
11:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 88.198.96.203:8309
12:20 < bridge> <lukure> i like that way Chiller XD
12:40 < bridge> <robyt3> ChillerDragon: closing keywords still don't work in PR titles
12:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> works in my github :p 
12:46 < bridge> <robyt3> Doesn't work with merge queue
13:12 < bridge> <zjasi> how is time being round up btw?
13:12 < bridge> <zjasi> if someone finishes 6.686s  is it 6,68 then or 6,7? and why
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mh?
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet is ticks based
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 1 tick is 20ms
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You can finish every 20ms
13:15 < bridge> <zjasi> yea i see thats why there is no .01 etc
13:15 < bridge> <zjasi> but 6.686 is round up to 6.69 technically
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but 20ms is 0.02
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there is no 0.006
13:16 < bridge> <zjasi> hmm
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The biggest weirdness ddnet has is, that it stores finish times as floats lmao
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I assume with huge times this can get inaccurate a bit
13:17 < bridge> <zjasi> yea idk what a float is dw xd
13:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> A float is basically a decimal with finite possibilities 2^32
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> minus some weird cases
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But anyway
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I am not aware of any rounding
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Do you have an example of a finish time that is rounded up or down?
13:20 < bridge> <zjasi> some people discussed in game that if someone finished on the unique race servers with a 6.686s time(fastest time) if it would be possible to do a 6.68 on ddnet
13:20 < bridge> <zjasi> but i guess cant really compare that
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah i assume unique race servers use some interpolated time
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the problem with interpolated time is. They are also not correct
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's like CS2 claiming to have sub precision shots
13:21 < bridge> <zjasi> i see
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's not incorrect, but also not really true
13:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Wot
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's not the same as increasing the tick rate
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's like CS2 claiming to have sub tick shots
14:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> a accidentally made range for local servers `8303..=8310` and was wondering why servers had 300 ping xd
14:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> a accidentally made range for local servers `8303..=80310` and was wondering why servers had 300 ping xd
14:38 < bridge> <teero777> could be. unique race time representation can subtract up to 2 ticks (40ms aka. 0.04) from the actual time
14:38 < bridge> <teero777> so generally if you replay the same run on ddrace servers it will be worse by up to 2 ticks
15:32 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, to lose 20ms precision which is ~2^-5.644, you need to spend 2^17 seconds on the map. So at about 1.5 days the times are no longer exact
15:34 < bridge> <learath2> They become off by half a tick, until day 3, at that point they become inaccurate by 3 ticks. I think unless I made a mistake somewhere
15:36 < bridge> <learath2> To be fair, actually just having better precision than 20ms isn't enough to represent all times
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Thanks for your input. I still find floats a weird format xd
15:50 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah I would probably do fixed point with integers
15:51 < bridge> <learath2> We have 2 digits of precision because of the ticks anyway
15:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> does teeworlds client show only 1 lan server? -.-
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Even if u do milliseconds directly in an u32 you'd have 200 million ticks üòÑ
15:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> forgot to ping 0.7 himself, chillerdragon
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 49 days
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh doesnt sound impressive
15:55 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah but we don't need the precision of milliseconds anyway
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I am one of these ppl that use 64-bit and call it a day anyway

15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> suddenly you have 213503982334 days
16:50 < bridge> <louis> lmao who made that
16:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> two nouis
16:55 < bridge> <learath2> > warning for file "downloadedskins/hpn_hat.23813.tmp": iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
16:55 < bridge> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks what was this one for? Should we fix it or is my built client just old?
16:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> one louis
16:56 < bridge> <robyt3> I get the same warning. Would be great if this was fixed in the skin DBs
16:56 < bridge> <beibei1184> Hi, I am a Chinese. I have a 2c4g server in Hangzhou idle, which has a four-year validity period. I want to donate it to ddnet to build a service in Hangzhou. Because the game experience in Hangzhou is too stuck, do you accept the server sponsored by the private sector @0xdeen
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This is simply a warning that libpng prints
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But yeah we should fix it ig
16:57 < bridge> <learath2> Things that we can fix we should fix ig
16:57 < bridge> <louis> hmm
16:57 < bridge> <louis> does this one work
16:57 < bridge> <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1285978032942878742/hpn_hat_fix.png?ex=66ec3bdf&is=66eaea5f&hm=165ccdbd9ce384485cfbd8578ca2289485796d446ad0d1439b267f937a5b4e29&
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @louis.place u can always simply reupload using the skin bot & #üì¨submit-skins
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u dont want to use the website tool, which is probs bit more annoying (?)
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it also wont change the original release date
17:00 < bridge> <louis> ok
17:02 < bridge> <louis> should be good
17:05 < bridge> <beibei1184> @tsfreddie Hi, I have a 2c4g server in Hangzhou, China that is idle and has a validity period of 4 years. I would like to donate it to the ddnet official to build a service in the Hangzhou area
17:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you can ask deen about it
17:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ddnet is quite bandwidth heavy tho
17:08 < bridge> <beibei1184> I can upgrade my configuration. I am in Hangzhou and the latency of playing this game is very high, basically above 50. Therefore, I am very eager to set up a service in Hangzhou
17:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> 50 sounds pretty reasonable to me. either way, a 2c4g5m server usually host about 8 ddnet servers, just so you know.
17:14 < bridge> <beibei1184> Thank you, no problem at all. I can upgrade the bandwidth and leave a message for deen now. If you agree, I can immediately provide the server
17:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it usually takes a reimage to debian, deen will give you the info.
17:16 < bridge> <beibei1184> I am CentOS 7

17:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> he's lying, discord had a database mishap where the time was rolledback 10 years. if you read this, it is actually 2034.
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Oh wow didn't expect to see you again in 2024
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Where have u been

18:02 < bridge> <zaerin__> Is custom resolutions buggy on linux?
18:06 < bridge> <zaerin__> I've added 1760x1080@144 through xrandr and it shows up on the list fine,
18:06 < bridge> <zaerin__> but when I switch to it from another resolution (1920x1080) it shows up as 1920x1178 on the title bar.
18:06 < bridge> <zaerin__> Launching the game with the resolution already selected makes it windowed
18:06 < bridge> <zaerin__> I've added 1760x1080@144 through xrandr and it shows up on the list fine,
18:06 < bridge> <zaerin__> but when I switch to it from another resolution (1920x1080) it shows up as 1920x1178 on the title bar.
18:06 < bridge> <zaerin__> Launching the game with the resolution already selected makes it windowed, but it shows up as correct

18:06 < bridge> <zaerin__> Launching the game with the resolution already selected makes it windowed, but it shows up as correct it should stretch in this case
18:07 < bridge> <zaerin__> I've added 1760x1080@144 through xrandr and it shows up on the list fine,
18:07 < bridge> <zaerin__> but when I switch to it from another resolution (1920x1080) it shows up as 1920x1178 on the title bar.
18:07 < bridge> <zaerin__> Launching the game with the resolution already selected makes it windowed, but it shows up as correct.
18:07 < bridge> <zaerin__> I want it stretched
18:08 < bridge> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks I don't think we have stretching, right?
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If you add your custom resolution to the supported list it should work
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> DDNet has no influence over streetching nor the list
18:10 < bridge> <zaerin__> it doesnt ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it should
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what GPU do you have√ü
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what GPU do you have?
18:11 < bridge> <zaerin__> Friends list & some server info gets full cut out on original resolutions too
18:11 < bridge> <zaerin__> amd rx 6700xt
18:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can also try gamescope
18:13 < bridge> <zaerin__> The title bar changes depending on which resolution you switch to the custom one for example:
18:13 < bridge> <zaerin__> 1920x1080 selected -> click on 1760x1080 -> title bar 1920x1178
18:13 < bridge> <zaerin__> 1600x900 selected -> click on 1760x1080 -> title bar 1600x981
18:14 < bridge> <zaerin__> I dont play from steam, will that work?
18:16 < bridge> <jxsl13> what do the character directions indicate -1, 0, 1?
18:17 < bridge> <manikoo> -1 left 0 stop 1 right
18:18 < bridge> <jxsl13> hm, what does the client do with those values in order to predict the character position, I wonder :?
18:18 < bridge> <manikoo> u shouldn't know it
18:19 < bridge> <jxsl13> ._:
18:19 < bridge> <manikoo> maybe yes
18:19 < bridge> <manikoo> move symbols upper of tee
18:19 < bridge> <jxsl13> how does that work together with velocity, pos and direction, might be the more precise question
18:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> if it does at all
18:20 < bridge> <manikoo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1285999017804824781/GAOIeXw.png?ex=66ec4f6a&is=66eafdea&hm=5c385f0714bbfdf86a42b03e41c2712826cea846aabd59d8e5a8d68cda88a6d3&
18:21 < bridge> <manikoo> maybe this
18:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> I think that might be something else
18:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> ah
18:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> there is also a jump key
18:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> might be the jump value
18:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's also next to direction
18:22 < bridge> <manikoo> i don't write the code :kek:  can't know all exacly
18:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> jumps are also showed
18:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> so left, right, stop might come from direction and jump from the jump integer
18:25 < bridge> <teero777> its just running the prediction aka. normal physics on the client to predict where ure going
18:26 < bridge> <manikoo> teero just want say "don't open our secrets" :troll:
18:27 < bridge> <jxsl13> I wonder how the maths works üòÆ
18:27 < bridge> <jxsl13> maffs
18:27 < bridge> <zaerin__> now my mouse doesnt move ingame
18:27 < bridge> <zaerin__> üò≠
18:27 < bridge> <jxsl13> or where exactly to look for the maffs in the code
18:28 < bridge> <teero777> check out `src/game/client/prediction/`
18:28 < bridge> <teero777> everything prediction related is there
18:28 < bridge> <teero777> most of it is a 1:1 copy of the server physics code
18:29 < bridge> <teero777> which is reudig
18:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> in germany we say "spaghetticode"
18:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> hmhm reudig
18:29 < bridge> <teero777> sadly ddnet physics are fucking shit
18:29 < bridge> <teero777> *performance wise
18:29 < bridge> <manikoo> but i like that
18:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> [like character](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/78d702d3b7b2a15af5f73e8862df1bbde51f2e79/src/game/client/prediction/entities/character.cpp)
18:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> cpp
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess so
18:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> ew, I need to know if a character is grounded to predict stuff... ew, need to know map content for that ._.
18:33 < bridge> <jxsl13> friggin rabbit hole
18:36 < bridge> <teero777> you can use twgame :trollet:
18:36 < bridge> <jxsl13> twgame?
18:36 < bridge> <teero777> https://lib.rs/crates/twgame
18:37 < bridge> <jxsl13> I'm doing Go ._.
18:37 < bridge> <jxsl13> maybe that helps for a reference
18:37 < bridge> <teero777> twgame has python bindings xdd

19:25 < bridge> <teero777> sure
19:25 < bridge> <teero777> wait
19:25 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, that sounds about right, `CSnapshot::MAX_SIZE` is just not big enough
19:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "In software, a stack buffer overflow or stack buffer overrun occurs when a program writes to a memory address on the program's call stack outside of the intended data structure, which is usually a fixed-length buffer."
19:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Is the snap builder on the stack or what
19:28 < bridge> <teero777> https://pastebin.com/xpua2BT7
19:28 < bridge> <teero777> here u go ig xd
19:28 < bridge> <teero777> it really doesnt say much
19:29 < bridge> <learath2> It tells you exactly what went wrong, what else do you want from it?
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ACHSO
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And lea even helped you
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with his jedi mind
19:30 < bridge> <learath2> `CSnapshotBuilder` is stored right next to `CSnapshotDelta`, when that `mem_copy` overflows it corrupts `CSnapshotDelta`
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @learath2 sry for off-topic, but did u watch star wars?
19:30 < bridge> <learath2> Nope, I really want to sometime, but just never got to it
19:30 < bridge> <teero777> ah lol yea im retarted ofc
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok, yeah seems like that's an age thing
19:30 < bridge> <teero777> thx
19:31 < bridge> <learath2> Actually I once asked a couple starwars enjoyer friends of mine which order to watch it in. They got into a fight and I never got my order
19:31 < bridge> <learath2> So I never watched
19:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You don't even need to watch it to enjoy it
19:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just for the memes
19:32 < bridge> <learath2> idk what the consequences of making this larger are, but I know you can't do it without a client change too
19:32 < bridge> <teero777> grandma sends starwars memes on facebook
19:32 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe allowing more parts would be fine, the clients that don't support that many parts might just drop the snap and not crash
19:32 < bridge> <teero777> idk this is about saving the demo ig
19:32 < bridge> <teero777> idk if loading will work either way
19:32 < bridge> <teero777> i hope so
19:32 < bridge> <teero777> xd
19:32 < bridge> <teero777> ahahah
19:33 < bridge> <teero777> i increased it to 2^16
19:33 < bridge> <teero777> now the client instantly crashes upon startup
19:33 < bridge> <teero777> xddd
19:35 < bridge> <learath2> excellent
19:36 < bridge> <teero777> works if its 1024
19:36 < bridge> <teero777> gonna try some stuff ig
19:37 < bridge> <teero777> okay lets see if it can handle 6402 aipgores runs
19:37 < bridge> <teero777> it can not
19:38 < bridge> <robyt3> This really looks weird. `CSnapshotBuilder::Finish` write to the `pSnapData` argument which is a char buffer of size `CSnapshot::MAX_SIZE`. The function then copies the offsets and the data into this buffer, but the data could be as large as `CSnapshot::MAX_SIZE` so it wouldn't fit together with the offset and the `m_DataSize` and `m_NumItems` values.
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> omg
19:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u leaked it

20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> but QPalette
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we are such weirdos
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sharing our linux setups as if we are cool kids
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought about it yesterday
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> and the only reason this is as cool as it is is bcs it's one of the few things you can't really throw money at to make better
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> it's solely about the time that you put into it
21:02 < bridge> <teero777> i got 10:59
21:02 < bridge> <Ewan> uptime?
21:02 < bridge> <teero777> y
21:02 < bridge> <Ewan> not bad
21:03 < bridge> <zaerin__> microsoft suddenly cancelled my product key after a clean install that was the last drop

21:04 < bridge> <zaerin__> microsoft suddenly cancelled my product key after a clean install
21:05 < bridge> <Ewan> i love how that site has grown
21:05 < bridge> <Ewan> i downloaded my windows iot ltsc and windows server ISOs from there
21:06 < bridge> <01000111g> I never got wayland to work with games. Even tho I thought fullscreen apps shouldt depend on x11 or wayland, i always have stutters on wayland... for me its a mysterium
21:06 < bridge> <Ewan> what wm?
21:07 < bridge> <zaerin__> Too late to return
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> you just open powershell and type the command on the right side of that image
21:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> you guys are on my list now

21:08 < bridge> <zaerin__> Im on linux
21:08 < bridge> <01000111g> gnome? is that a wm?
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> oh no there's a list
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> oh lol
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> not technically
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> but yea
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> mutter just sucks
21:08 < bridge> <Ewan> bad
21:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> i think gnome ships with Mutter ?
21:08 < bridge> <teero777> can i too?
21:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> ye
21:08 < bridge> <teero777> i lied before
21:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why does it say A?
21:08 < bridge> <teero777> it was 1051
21:08 < bridge> <zaerin__> I wouldve riced fastfetch if you said beforehand
21:09 < bridge> <01000111g> should i change it so i can rice my hyprland like the cool boys
21:09 < bridge> <zaerin__> its literally default
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> @01000111g I was running GNOME on wayland for a bit (on 150% screens) and every game would run at 75% resolution and have terrible baseline latency, FPS and stutters
21:09 < bridge> <louis> heh.

21:09 < bridge> <louis> any windows fans.
21:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> dont recommend if you've familiarized yourself for now
21:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH **deletes**
21:09 < bridge> <zaerin__> No ty
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> not necessarily hyprland but some wlroots compositor
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> you should have better results
21:10 < bridge> <teero777> should have riced

21:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> 11 hours of bot coding
21:10 < bridge> <teero777> ?!
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> the tiling features took me a while to get used to again (even after having run i3 on my laptop in high school)
21:10 < bridge> <teero777> tiling is the best
21:10 < bridge> <01000111g> yeah, I didnt got it to work properly on my intel/nvidia desktop nor on my amd based laptop ... at some point i gave up and used x exclusively, even tho everypne always talks about how nice wayland is
21:10 < bridge> <zaerin__> Precision Tower 3620
21:10 < bridge> <louis> u guys really need to try light theme
21:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
21:10 < bridge> <teero777> dont tower shame
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> xorg on GNOME is much more stable than wayland tbh
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> i hear XFCE works well on wayland now
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> havent used since 2020
21:11 < bridge> <01000111g> Why 60hz tho üò¶
21:11 < bridge> <zaerin__> new list incoming
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> yea

21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> my brain doesnt like it
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> nor does my power bill... or rather my conscience knowing that light theme will cost me an extra 2 cents per month
21:12 < bridge> <zaerin__> nixos ü§ù ü´∂
21:12 < bridge> <teero777> gentoo is missing
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> i did use light on windows for a good while but my screens are large and bright
21:13 < bridge> <teero777> @ryozuki
21:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> we lost ryo after he got a girl
21:13 < bridge> <01000111g> am i a noob if i dont know that snowflake os? is it gentoo or nixos?
21:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> ban
21:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is sad but true
21:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> (it's nixos)
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @blaiszephyr & u r only here bcs your girl is on this discord too
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòâ
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> wtf
21:14 < bridge> <teero777> üòâ
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> are u cheating on me
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòâ
21:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> basically jupsti and milkeey want stuff to be stable - zaerin and teero want customizable shit - and me and ewan just hate ourselfs and love reading manuals for 20 hours a day just to realise it's a single typo messing up our entire config
21:14 < bridge> <Ewan> yep
21:14 < bridge> <zaerin__> what is srt-bwrap üò≠
21:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> stop leak
21:15 < bridge> <Ewan> nixos has taken a legitimate toll on my mental health
21:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i want stuff to work* xd
21:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> same...
21:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i have pages and pages of things to fix in my notes
21:15 < bridge> <Ewan> and every time i look at it i shit my pants
21:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> real and true...
21:15 < bridge> <teero777> words of a windows user
21:15 < bridge> <teero777> be strong
21:16 < bridge> <teero777> ^words of a windows user
21:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> debian sid is the most unstable shit ever XD
21:16 < bridge> <teero777> true
21:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's just that every time i try arch, it's even worse or has fewer packages
21:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> its just a sandboxxed shell environment (?) - source: google
21:16 < bridge> <teero777> like in debian most of the stuff i want doesnt even fucking exist in the package manager since its 7 years behind to be "stable"
21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> arch is prob the best distro for learning
21:16 < bridge> <zaerin__> Same,
21:16 < bridge> <zaerin__> missing taskbar, 90s file manager, no clipboard
21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
21:17 < bridge> <teero777> pcmanfm
21:17 < bridge> <teero777> best
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> nautilus user here
21:17 < bridge> <teero777> nautilus bloat
21:17 < bridge> <zaerin__> Is discord really picking my terminal emulator as activity
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1286043453540798514/image.png?ex=66ec78cc&is=66eb274c&hm=5aea99faf52b24f34cf6ae8d67e8dad1c6ecde003680163f1b2bf261ed6aad11&
21:17 < bridge> <teero777> although i mostly use the terminal xdd
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> sometimes i like to browse remote filesystems graphically. and it integrates the best into gnome disks
21:17 < bridge> <01000111g> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1286043498646081668/attatchment.r1v9ti.png?ex=66ec78d7&is=66eb2757&hm=c6f7dd2dc892217c7f56467d2468af9c10b36303979383a1ab45089ad53ddc1a&
21:17 < bridge> <01000111g> this was my main desktop waiting in germany
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
21:18 < bridge> <01000111g> but nowdays i dont care bout looks cuz i actually have to work xdd
21:18 < bridge> <teero777> looks straight out of unixporn
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> i need to get my config to a stable point so i dont have to be managing it all the time
21:18 < bridge> <zaerin__> they all use neovim there
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> but then i want more...
21:19 < bridge> <01000111g> Yeah, i went with the nordic theme, but i didnt install a nice wm tbh
21:19 < bridge> <teero777> true
21:19 < bridge> <teero777> like everyone should
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i think gnome is actually the best as far as UX goes
21:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> the day you have a single shortcut to automatically open up a terminal with your config cd'd into and nvim started in webrc is the day you question yourself what you're doing with your life...
21:19 < bridge> <teero777> like most ppl should
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> their devs just dont care about anything but office use n shit
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
21:19 < bridge> <zaerin__> Spend 6 hours automating it
21:19 < bridge> <melo∆û> ._.
21:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i super + q and type "c", autocomplete `code --new-window ~/shit/ --disable-gpu`
21:20 < bridge> <Ewan> then i lose

21:20 < bridge> <zaerin__> I clean installed arch 2 times to figure out my bluetooth headset
21:20 < bridge> <Ewan> u just need to enable codecs in whichever pipewire session manager u use
21:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> laughs in `hardware.bluetooth.enable = true;`
21:20 < bridge> <zaerin__> still have to connect, disconnect, connect again to get the correct profiles to show up idk why
21:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i have bind in tmux to open projects i work on with key shortcut üòè
21:21 < bridge> <zaerin__> I tried.....

21:22 < bridge> <Ewan> mine
21:22 < bridge> <Ewan> but u cant
21:22 < bridge> <Ewan> cuz NIXOS
21:22 < bridge> <Ewan> it may not actually be this
21:22 < bridge> <Ewan> nixos is kind of smoke and mirrors
21:23 < bridge> <Ewan> as far as what packages and config files are actually being used
21:23 < bridge> <Ewan> when u type feature.enable = true
21:24 < bridge> <zaerin__> my entire workspace froze trying to screenshot the issue
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
21:24 < bridge> <zaerin__> basically codecs dont show up unless you connect it a second time
21:24 < bridge> <zaerin__> in pavucontrol
21:25 < bridge> <Ewan> oh are u using pulseaudio
21:25 < bridge> <Ewan> @blaiszephyr weird question. what NIC do you have
21:25 < bridge> <zaerin__> Pulseaudio (on pipewire 1.2.3)
21:26 < bridge> <Ewan> you're not actually using pulseaudio then
21:26 < bridge> <Ewan> pipewire reimplements the pulse protocol
21:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont think the config tool is necessarily the issue but i find pwvucontrol does generally work better
21:27 < bridge> <zaerin__> the ones missing are a2dp
21:27 < bridge> <Ewan> i think the cards tab is totally different

21:27 < bridge> <zaerin__> hsp is always there

21:28 < bridge> <zaerin__> I cant screenshot the dropdown
21:28 < bridge> <Ewan> aac is probably your best bet
21:28 < bridge> <zaerin__> Yeah it works great
21:28 < bridge> <Ewan> that looks like pavucontrol tho
21:28 < bridge> <Ewan> try pwvucontrol

21:40 < bridge> <Ewan> ik
21:40 < bridge> <dr.peper._.> I downloaded a lot of textures at once, and that's why I was thrown out of the game.
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, but who gave you these textures
21:41 < bridge> <Ewan> just add skins 1 by one as you need them
21:41 < bridge> <Ewan> who cares XD
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> your friend?
21:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> jupstar goes on a manhunt
21:41 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1286049531494006896/2000_skins_ddnet.rar?ex=66ec7e75&is=66eb2cf5&hm=9489fb9cb993c0063fad3b63b0ea1188ae27e9862fc9da963270050b675b6079&
21:41 < bridge> <Ewan> >
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i care bcs ppl should understand that sharing 4k textures is bad
21:41 < bridge> <Ewan> it isn't
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> alter
21:41 < bridge> <dr.peper._.> There are many intusiasts on Russian YouTube
21:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok thanks
21:42 < bridge> <Ewan> u dont zooz much do u jopsti
21:42 < bridge> <Ewan> there is a real need for it
21:42 < bridge> <Ewan> esp at hi res
21:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cmonm
21:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cmon
21:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> don't do this to me tonight
21:42 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
21:42 < bridge> <zaerin__> so close to rm -rf /*
21:42 < bridge> <Ewan> 1:42 pm
21:42 < bridge> <dr.peper._.> Since I'm from Russia, this is not a problem, but with solving problems like removing textures, it's a real trouble
21:43 < bridge> <dr.peper._.> Thank you, I'm off.
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah it's a problem that they share textures for 32k monitors üòÑ
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nobody has those
21:43 < bridge> <Ewan> if u use the vulkan backend i believe that skins will be backed by system memory if u have no vram
21:43 < bridge> <Ewan> ya
21:43 < bridge> <Ewan> well if they don't warn about the 4k skins it's bad
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the problem is, even on opengl these textures probably cause some laggs
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs they are really cache unfriendly
21:44 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
21:44 < bridge> <dr.peper._.> Yes, it is more so when weak computers it depresses the situation
21:44 < bridge> <Ewan> tho u know the real answer right
21:44 < bridge> <Ewan> that's a DDNet problem
21:44 < bridge> <Ewan> not a skins problem
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah maybe we should, depending on the users resolution or smth xd
21:44 < bridge> <zaerin__> where do they find 4k ddnet skins
21:45 < bridge> <Ewan> you can render at any res
21:45 < bridge> <Ewan> ach i gotta get some work done
21:46 < bridge> <Ewan> bbl
21:56 < bridge> <zaerin__> Got it from flatpak but now it crashes on any button click
21:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought this tool was way more popular tbh
21:58 < bridge> <Ewan> works great for me
22:04 < bridge> <zaerin__> It worked after rebooting
22:04 < bridge> <zaerin__> fixed my problem too
22:04 < bridge> <zaerin__> tyyy
22:05 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
