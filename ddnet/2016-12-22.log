00:03 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: I dislike the idea of vip anything
00:03 < Learath2> me too its horrible
01:21 < eeeee> says the @VIP chan member
09:15 <@deen> Well, people are free to donate to DDNet, but they will not get anything special for that on the servers. i consider it morally wrong to ask for money for virtual stuff like VIP rights or hats. just manipulating people into buying useless stuff, some people even get addicted and pay way more than they can afford
09:17 <@deen> and the donations generally cover the cost of each year, but that's only because we have pretty cheap servers
10:47 < eeeee> you just described the modern day economy
10:48 <@deen> eeeee: i know, but that doesn't mean I have to partake for personal projects
10:54 < eeeee> yeah i didn't mean to imply you should, just noted that's largely how it works
10:54 <@deen> I know
14:08 < DawnDN> Hey. Someone who I can talk about servers? English/german
