15:36 < wolf> deen^.^ can you delete the 0011hvad skin (the "wolf" skin) with the next client update please?? Aoe made it specially for me, and we don't want to see it on other tee!
15:36 < wolf> thanks:)
15:37 <@deen> wolf: hi
15:37 < wolf> that skin was never public, it's only shared on BB's site, but BBs dont use others BB's skin^.^
15:37 < wolf> hi:D
15:38 <@deen> All BB skins are included in ddnet client
15:39 < wolf> it's ok but other players use it too who is not in BB
15:39 <@deen> So?
15:39 <@deen> You can tell Aoe to remove it from BB, then it won't be in ddnet
15:39 < wolf> i just want to delete my skin
15:40 <@deen> Yeah, but Aoe will send it to me again
15:40 < wolf> i told it for him, and he didn't like it too, but he said me 
15:40 < wolf> to search u^^
15:40 <@deen> Sorry, but I can't remove one BB skin every time i add them all
15:41 < wolf> and where did you get it?
15:42 <@deen> http://bandanabrothers.comoj.com/skins.php
15:42 <@deen> This is what I download every time before I release
15:42 < wolf> ok i delete it
15:42 <@deen> Alright, won't be in next release
15:43 < wolf> okey, thanks:)
21:46 < Bossk> deen you there?
21:47 < Bossk> the shotgun strength just effects yourself, but not shooting at others
21:47 < Bossk> can i change that or isnt it implemented yet
21:47  * Bossk slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
21:50 <@deen> hi
21:50 <@deen> Bossk: oops
21:50 <@deen> My bad^^
21:51 < Bossk> np
21:53 < Bossk> deen: so can i keep the part i mapped and it will be fixed next version?
21:55 <@deen> No, it works
21:56 <@deen> I just tried shotgun_strength on others
21:56 <@deen> and it works
21:58 < Bossk> tune_zone_enter 1 "Overpowered shotgun-shots activated!" tune_zone 1 shotgun_strength 50 tune_zone_leave 1 "Overpowered shotgun-shots deactivated!"
22:01 <@deen> I'll fix it
22:01 <@deen> you can keep your map
22:01 <@deen> like that
22:02 < Bossk> :)
