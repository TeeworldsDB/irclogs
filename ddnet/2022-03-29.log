09:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @cheeser0613 can you check these translations by @Dan_cao : https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4911/files ?
09:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES_Violin:585724572926607361>
09:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> checked and it looks good
09:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks
09:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> it does also reminds me that "Show local player's key presses" is wrong
09:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> if you doesnt switch on it still show other player key input
09:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <cheeser0613> only player himself wont be show
09:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks troll flag
11:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I am in the process of creating a new HUD. 
11:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> One idea was to show in the HUD if you are in practice mode (see https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4754). What do you think, does this fit in the HUD or not? I asked Ravie (the creator of the hud.png), he said it wouldn't fit to the rest, because these are mainly tile based effects.
11:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> It is the same setting variable as show key presses of others. That's why you can't show only the key presses of your own player. This is displayed visually by activating the checkbox above it too.
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> with /showall
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/commits/pr_other_player_cam
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this should enough to spectate your dummy
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cl_mate_cam_size 50 = 50% height & 50% widht of your screen
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Independent of whether it fits, I think it would be good to have it visible somehow. Some people accidentally had it enabled and never noticed
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats pog
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when add
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the network code part is the thing that turns me down tbh
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for showall its ez
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah ye
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe send 2 clip zones
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but for everything else either dummy needs to handle it packets or new network code
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and to spec others you defs need new network code without showall
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> if you only allow spec of teammates that are not solo it would work üòÑ
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it would be cool to create a tiled window manager inside ddnet, and lay out different views of tees
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> easy for streaming tournaments
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah üòÑ

15:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @deen ffmpeg 32bit builds are indeed broken, even on wine:
15:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
15:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ```
15:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> x264 [error]: malloc of size 20031936 failed
15:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> [2022-03-29 14:15:13][video_recorder]: Could not open video codec: Generic error in an external library
15:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ```
15:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
15:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> honestly, where did u even find these builds? XD ffmpeg officially doesnt even support 32bit anymore it seems
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe we should just disable it there xD
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 32bit really dies out even on cheap ARM boards
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Scrumplex i see ur a polymc contributtor nice
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/958367607474503802/unknown.png
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> polymc > multimc
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> multimc author is a dick
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
16:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC>
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i sent 10‚Ç¨ more too
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> heh, small world isn't it? :D
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> its raining money today :POGGIES:
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I build everything myself
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks
17:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lol how do you build .lib files?
17:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> visual studio?
17:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> donate raspberry to our core 2 duo user xd
17:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would use iti first myself
17:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always wanted a home server
17:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i never do it
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> No SATA on the raspi so it might be annoying to use it as a storage server
17:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess you could add a sata controller, but it is some work
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh didnt know
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Can we use QuadsSetSubset to rotate quads or only mirror?
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> or in other words we have a method to rotate sprites of a quad without rotating the anchor points of the quad.
17:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rotate by 90¬∞? xd
17:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes
17:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> should work
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> QuadsSetSubset has logically only 4 correct inputs (if you want the whole sprite).
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> (0, 0, 1, 1)
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> (1, 1, 0, 0)
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> (0, 1, 1, 0)
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> (1, 0, 0, 1) 
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> However, these are logically only reflections.
19:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we have QuadsSetSubsetFree too
19:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just look how the rendertiles function does it with tiles
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> works thanks
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> Hello, I noticed that on linux when you build and run a server it shows twice in the lan tab, is it normal?
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it is possible you get IPv6 too
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> Oh i see üëç
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> It is also not possible to join them without being connected to "internet", like if im not connected to anything it wont connect
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> Is it normal?
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> Oh, ok üëç
