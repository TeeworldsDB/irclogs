01:59 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Sedonya speaks Arabic?
01:59 <+bridge> <sedonya> No, but this change does not require a high knowledge of Arabic

06:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> ping doesnâ€™t matter as much for gores. but i have to go to bed anyway
09:02 <+bridge> <learath2> Why is this string even translatable? ðŸ˜„
09:04 <+bridge> <meloÆž> Translating an URL.. Interesting
09:04 <+bridge> <meloÆž> Oh i See, this is meant to be Changed for different communitys
09:10 <+bridge> <meloÆž> @sedonya for context
09:10 <+bridge> <meloÆž> 
09:10 <+bridge> <meloÆž> https://wiki.ddnet.org/
09:10 <+bridge> <meloÆž> == https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Main_Page/zh
09:10 <+bridge> <meloÆž> 
09:10 <+bridge> <meloÆž> This is how the Wiki gets "translated" in simplified Chinese
09:10 <+bridge> <meloÆž> So its not Always meant to stay the same
09:27 <+bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1249626043418017802/1530736850952.png?ex=6667fc71&is=6666aaf1&hm=a710124dbfca15ae2a7888329c0279c6d72759fecf288232198e468bf40bdaab&

12:06 <+bridge> <meloÆž> Mornin
13:39 <+bridge> <egyt> Gonna fix it I guess
14:02 <+bridge> <sedonya> Oh, now I see why everyone thought it was tolling, but man, I actually made that change thinking it would be accepted :frozen:
15:38 <+bridge> <egyt> although it always sends to the wiki page based on your browser language
15:38 <+bridge> <egyt> although it sends to the wiki page based on your browser language

15:41 <+bridge> <egyt> and yes, I have Esperanto set as the browser language, because why not
16:20 <+bridge> <louis> wow first time i've heard of this language
16:24 <+bridge> <egyt> are you kidding?
16:24 <+bridge> <louis> i mean i've seen you mention it before but i searched it up now
16:25 <+bridge> <louis> tbh i thought it was just the language of some obscure country, not an independent thing
16:26 <+bridge> <violenser> And who is translating the wiki into Russian? Itâ€™s just that many tabs were not fully translated
16:29 <+bridge> <egyt> the community lol
16:32 <+bridge> <egyt> lmao
16:53 <+bridge> <zhn> it doesn't redirect you to main language page though
16:54 <+bridge> <zhn> yeah not so many players from ru community translated it in the past
16:55 <+bridge> <zhn> you can translate it yourself too just let us know in #wiki
16:58 <+bridge> <violenser> Ok
20:35 <+bridge> <meloÆž> anyone on here that used udemy for learning anything? thinking about getting a course on there for funsies about Kubernetes
21:04 <+bridge> <learath2> Do you learn well from video in general? I find I do much better with written material
21:05 <+bridge> <meloÆž> I Like visual Representation, and i think explaining Something visually can Help understand it properly
21:06 <+bridge> <learath2> But video tutorials are a very specific format. Do you enjoy that? Like not all video tutorials have good visualisation. Most are more like code alongs
21:08 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> the best way for me to learn something is do something yourself
21:08 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> the best way for me to learn something is do something myself
21:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah but you don't just guess
21:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> you do need some kind of material lol
21:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think most of my issues with video learning aren't necessarily an issue with the medium but most people just suck at visualizing their ideas
21:09 <+bridge> <meloÆž> yeah i like having someone explain in detail what he's about to do and how, so i can replicate it and maybe think of something i can do with it myself and then do that
21:09 <+bridge> <meloÆž> i mostly take inspiration out of these things and experiment
21:11 <+bridge> <meloÆž> but the courses are pretty expensive, and their monthly description is 30â‚¬aswell, but if it's good i dont mind
21:11 <+bridge> <meloÆž> but the courses are pretty expensive, and their monthly subscription is 30â‚¬aswell, but if it's good i dont mind
21:11 <+bridge> <meloÆž> but the courses are pretty expensive, and their monthly subscription is 30â‚¬ as well, but if it's good i dont mind
21:12 <+bridge> <learath2> Yeah, a video by 3blue1brown is very very distinct from most other math explainers
21:13 <+bridge> <learath2> If you do, then most of the udemy courses I saw are slightly higher quality video tutorials. So you'll probably find some value in there
21:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> coursera might have a free version for something so common
21:23 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> melon do you have mod rank in ddnet?
21:24 <+bridge> <meloÆž> no
21:24 <+bridge> <meloÆž> no(**t yet**)
21:24 <+bridge> <borsmatyas02> ðŸ˜¦
21:24 <+bridge> <meloÆž> sry :(
21:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1249808614739284089/IMG_5550.png?ex=6668a67a&is=666754fa&hm=291733ab8a92ddc1a4d8284f6f73846ed404a028425d2675aacd476cf7f82fd6&
22:44 <+bridge> <teero777> can anyone confirm crashes on arch linux using <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ddnet>?
22:44 <+bridge> <teero777> ive been crashing basically permanently on kog servers
22:44 <+bridge> <teero777> and now the kog server crashed
23:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> need more info
23:41 <+bridge> <teero777> can't provide crashlogs.
23:41 <+bridge> <teero777> running on vulkan. doesn't happen when using binaries from <https://ddnet.org/downloads>
23:41 <+bridge> <Ewan> inconclusive
23:42 <+bridge> <teero777> idk this happens when i lag insanely. it crashes after lagging
23:43 <+bridge> <teero777> compiling ddnet from aur gives a bunch of errors btw about system.cpp and bound checks
23:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> i havenâ€™t used the aur build in a while because itâ€™s based on the latest tag which crashed on startup due to a known issue
23:43 <+bridge> <teero777> compiling ddnet from aur gives a bunch of warnings btw about system.cpp and bound checks
23:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> arch has more intense security flags
23:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> I usually use the steam build anyway because it tracks my hours
23:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> but we will need some kind of information about it
23:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> just run it in gdb next time ig
23:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> or log to a file
