00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> @louis its 1024x1024
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @C√∏ke then they downloaded wrong
03:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> `Failed to fetch https://packagecloud.io/github/git-lfs/ubuntu/dists/focal/InRelease  402  Payment Required [IP: 54.193.34.251 443]`
03:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> give them the payment
05:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> love ya
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @deen so it fixes the different sizes?
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/773869354688708618/Screen_Shot_2020-11-05_at_5.19.59_AM.png
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if u still need to
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> > - [ ] Tested the change ingame
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i can do the tee command
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, couldn't test it
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ah ok
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> worked?
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, added screenshot
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :D
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> cool
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its good change
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's originally by Banana090, I just fixed it up
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> üëç
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> üëç
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> üëç
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is 15.1.3 the latest version?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> there is ddnet-master version which is newer, and there is my forked repo which is way ahead ddnet official client xD
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Are there really codebases which mix tabs and spaces in this way?
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ```
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> def function(x, y):
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> __if x:
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> >>>>for z in range(y):
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> >>>>__wobblify(z)
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ```
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Has anyone here encountered this indentation style?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro sometimes i see spaces to fit stuff for example in long function signatures
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but not for that
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Are there really codebases which mix tabs and spaces in this way?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ```
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> function crazy() {
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> __if (true) {
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> >>>>if (true) {
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> >>>>__if (true) {

16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> >>>>__}
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> >>>>}
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> __}
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> }
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ```
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Has anyone here encountered this indentation style?
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I changed the example to make it more clear ^^
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Because I wanna write another vim plugin to detect indentation style and configure the tab key to produce the same indent. There are only 5 of those plugins currently but they are all doing it wrong :)
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> And vim supports this crazy indent style and some of those detect indent plugins do too. But I'm saying there is no code like that ^^
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> Why would you need to do that tho
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie üåà> I mean if the tab size is configured differently it would probably looks horrible
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @louis hey once again, can you quickly lookup the broken driver version you are using rn? its in the device manager, when u select settings of the intel GPU probably
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro it's possible to configure vim to do that at least. to indent by 2 spaces and replace every 4 spaces indentation with a tab. But that always seemed like the worst of both worlds to me
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/773949815935074365/unknown.png
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh such a new driver
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> rip
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then we have to block like a whole year of intel driver
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or is it 09.03.2020
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am always confused by english dates
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think americans do mdy
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so this is 9th of march?
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it‚Äôs an american date, yes
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why is the US so hard headed on this stuff?
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Would it really kill them to use metric and write dates the reasonable way?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ravie if u online, can you quickly loopup your driver version aswell?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Why is the US so hard headed on this stuff?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ravie if u online, can you quickly lookup your driver version aswell?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2 feet tall
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> üêæ
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> does intel not know about year month date format :justatest:
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i love how the status in the screen says "This device is working properly"
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> while it isnt xd
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Jupstar ‚ú™
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/773952559592767488/unknown.png
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thanks
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I considered for a second to get a notebook with i3 8130u to see if I could reproduce it but they are all around 500‚Ç¨
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the funny thing is
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> deen has the exact needed intel
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> he could just debug xD
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doesn‚Äôt happen for him though I thought
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> he even has windows on it xD
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well he could just use louis driver version
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's my work laptop, so can't help much with that
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No non-work on work laptop?
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> kind of
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I‚Äôll check a couple friends laptops maybe one of them has an intel with 620uhd
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Also, I thought there is no good way to reproduce
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ravie found one
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> multimap easy non halloween, enable entities jump into the freeze at one spot
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> with gl 3.0
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> preinit vbo on?
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> without gl 3.3
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> when u spawn its the second freeze from right
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/773956791910006794/screenshot_2020-11-05_18-07-53.png
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> huh, reproduced
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that was easy
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> worked on halloween version too
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh ok
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How did we make a crash intel tile even? ;D
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i wonder too what is actually crashing inside the driver
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs while the map is loaded nothing is reloaded afterwards
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> CPU usage is at 0% now, so no infinite loop? I still hear sounds. When I alt-tab back into it it just flickers
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It happening on a tile is what‚Äôs very novel to me. These sorts of driver bugs should be random
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Something about the render thread seems to be broken somehow
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tho asan didnt show anything
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We send a command to the thread, it does something, which breaks the screen, after which the thread obv can‚Äôt recover because it doesn‚Äôt even know sth went wrong
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the best would be some bug with the map border
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that would be easiest to fix, but i could only imagine a overflow there
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs the renderloop does continue
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe its just a "0" instead of a value
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats causing it
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> any hints for how to debug it?
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well only things i could imagine are invalid rendercounts
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so <= 0 and >= 1000
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in CCommandProcessorFragment_OpenGL::Cmd_Render
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the m_PrimCount should be very high
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Since it doesn‚Äôt crash and our code just keeps running your only bet would be logging the stuff we do for sanity checking or a gpu debugging tool that could report insane values to us
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> same for
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> CCommandProcessorFragment_OpenGL2::Cmd_RenderTex3D
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Whether such a tool exists idk. Nvidia had sth iirc maybe intel does too
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Can we do something with Windows dump files?
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doesn‚Äôt windows only dump on crash?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> In task manager I can create  a dump
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, cdb can open dumps
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ do you want to add some logging? I don't really know where to start. Then I can build and run it
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah cdb can open these dumps with the executable and the symbol file
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I don‚Äôt think it will be of much help, since it seems transient
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A value/command/call we send/make just breaks the driver
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can try, but honestly, if the logging doesnt trigger for me, why should it for u xD
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> outside the driver we use the same code
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh was there anything in the new opengl debugging stuff we added?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if that thing would work it should show errors in the stdout
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/773960475695906857/backend_sdl.cpp
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> here some logging for high values
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There also seems to be a project called glintercept, if I could reproduce it I would also try that
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you dont zoom out or smth they shouldnt trigger
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you prefer github i'll upload it there @deen
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ‚ú™ so the debugging doesn‚Äôt work or it doesn‚Äôt show anything?
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Learath2 not for me at least
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tried with zink, mesa software and amdgpu
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> dbg_gfx 1 shows nothing
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Again, which one? Does it not show any errors or are we failing to enable debugging?
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Learath2 i quickly did an obvious error and that worked
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ yeah, if you could make a branch that'd be great
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> amdgpu even shows performance warnings xD
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen pr_TESTING
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> sad that zink is really ready yet :D
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i already get over 1k FPS with it with gl 3.3
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but mipmaps are really broken
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> cool
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, you know maybe a vogl trace could let us try to debug this outside
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it gets opengl itself into a state that‚Äôs broken, a vogl trace should reproduce it on our computers too. If not we can still inspect the calls, see if anything odd happens
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that doesnt explain why my 10 years old intel works fine xd
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It‚Äôs obviously an odd bug. Just rolling over and saying fuck you people who use this specific generation of cpus is hardly a solution
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I‚Äôm just trying to find a way to debug it, if we figure out which call is going wrong, maybe we can work around it
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Learath2 tbh nobody cares alot about GL anymore, renderdoc is the best but it only supports GL 3.3
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also a software renderer should easily find the error
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Learath2 tbh nobody cares alot about GL anymore, renderdoc is the best but it only supports GL 3.2+
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also a software renderer should easily find the error
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not if the software renderer doesn‚Äôt have the same bug as the intel driver
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I opened a bug at Intel inside of the driver tool btw
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wdym nobody cares about gl?
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Vulkan made people jump ship
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its natural but there should be still plenty using opengl
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ryozuki as soon as zink is good enough it will probably adapt to windows too
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Valve had a lot of opengl tools planned they just dropped because vulkan makes it easier to port games
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Especially with dxvk around
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs opengl support sucks xd
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Zink is an OpenGL implementation on top of Vulkan. Or to be a bit more specific, Zink is a Mesa Gallium driver that leverages the existing OpenGL implementation in Mesa to provide hardware accelerated OpenGL when only a Vulkan driver is available.
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it rly a real world case that there is a vulkan driver and not a opengl one?
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats not the point
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> there is always a vulkan driver
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so opengl isnt required anymore
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even on old gpus?
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well nobody supports old GPUs xD
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what about android
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i obviously mean that zink will be replaced inside the driver
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ofc not on older gpus, jupstar loves to pretend they don‚Äôt exist. Like all other gfx people I know
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do mobile gpus support vulkan
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Learath2 nah, but they will work just as now
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and everything that has vulkan will be updated some day
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well old gpus could support vulkan with a driver right? there shouldnt be a hardware limitation
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or is there
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the average lifetime support for GPUs that isnt NVidia is like 2-3 years
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> after that time only some rare patches come
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have my r9 390 since 2016 i think
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or the architecture didnt change
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its true its getting high temps, i want to update it
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It‚Äôs not financially justified to bring vulkan to older gpus
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ryozuki there probs are hardware limitations, but not in the past 10 years
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well as long as "no gpus" such as intel gpu thingies support vulkan then its fine i guess
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> integrated gpus*
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It‚Äôs much more profitable to move the industry to vulkan so people have to buy new gpus so the ceos can eat at nice fancy steakhouses
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it rly common for ppl to buy gpus?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ofc
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> every 4 years the kids have high end shit xd
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i guess ppl that play yes
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure, there are even fanboys lining up for nvidia ones, like the apple ppl
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> including me xd
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the marketshare of the 1000 series from NVIDIA is insane
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i remember me playing on windows xp some weeb game slow af
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sad times
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 have u played this legend <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Chase>
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I might move to an rx6000 in a year to move to amdgpu
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tho somehow nvidias proprietary driver still works the best, even though linus said fuck nvidia üòõ
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> definitly stay in amd if ur not hyped about this RTX marketing stuff
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the performance in linux is really good with AMD now
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 buy a ryzen 5000 and a new gpu
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u have smart memory access
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> easily beats most windows stuff with DXVK üòÑ
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its dope
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I‚Äôm on a 1080 and honestly it works great everywhere
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm curious how many fps you'll get with ryzen 5000 and one of the new gpus
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.amd.com/es/technologies/smart-access-memory
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 12-13k
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> without the HUD and entities i get max FPS of around 12k
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/773965374685315082/unknown.png
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I will get a ryzen 5000 in a month or so. My 4770k will be promoted to a NAS
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ do i need to enable something or is it logged automatically?
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm onboard with this feature yet. I don‚Äôt really like proprietary stuff
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > every 4 years the kids have high end shit xd
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™ gotta play fortnite 4k
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no output :/
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > @Ryozuki I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm onboard with this feature yet. I don‚Äôt really like proprietary stuff
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 im onboard this stuff cuz its good competition against propietary rtx nvidia stuff
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are kinda locking you into the amd ecosystem if you want full access to the memory
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Amd has always been very open about the tech. Hope they let linux have this benefit aswell without binary blobs
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hope yea
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use amd cuz it has good linux support
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh and I did play grand chase
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a man of culture
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 @Jupstar ‚ú™ further ideas for debugging?
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nvidia also has decent linux support now, I didn‚Äôt tinker with anything in ages
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/773966184248639569/IMG_20201105_184503.jpg
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen idk, I would look into glintercept and vogl as I said
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thzats my fps graph
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly cant take screenshot
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> seems to be some overlay üòÑ
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen i honestly don't know, i just saw the one weird value on louis screen where it rendered 10k triagnles
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™ do u have a new ryzen?
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 3800x
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so pretty new yes
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here i am with 2600
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u know ryzen 5 3600 is one of the most sold cpus
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its insane
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> didnt know üòÑ
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/773966936727355443/unknown.png
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 13k reviews
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on the spanish one
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its in the sweet spot
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not to pricy and rly good
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 101410 wow
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/773967081620111380/unknown.png
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> over 100k sold
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yep
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean 179‚Ç¨ for 12 threads
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 6 years ago i'd have need to sell my liver for that
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Your liver would buy you many of those üòõ
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i guess for the intel thing we can agree, its either the hardest to reproduce thing, or its an intel bug, that affects around 3-4 month of driver versions
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™ ryzen can put so many threads thanks to their awesome architecture
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or so i read
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why they can also fit 64 in threadripper
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ryozuki yeah the infinite thing
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> awesome stuff
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh it definitely is an intel bug. I wonder what it is so we can work around it
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i get around 300fps with software renderer on 2k screen, thats how good the CPUs are xD
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well cpus are better at other stuff
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Updating the driver fixing it confirms that it‚Äôs a bug in their code
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > i get around 300fps with software renderer on 2k screen, thats how good the CPUs are xD
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™ can u compile a program with ur gpu
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i remember when that nvidia guy said, that GPUs will replace CPUs xDDD
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or like 0.0001% chance that it‚Äôs undefined behaviour in our code behaving sane on one version
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES_YouSerious:660223260918546468>
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://ddnet.tw/gliInterceptLog.txt.xz
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> how do i open it? xD
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> xz -d
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it only shows random stuff
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh ok
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> seems like the KDE program cant handle it
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so these are invalid calls?
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> all calls
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> until the hang?
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don't know where the hang is, but it should be in there
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it also created an Images and Shader dir, I guess we don't need that
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anything interesting in images?
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen ah could you try gl major 2, and gl minor 0
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so gl 2.0
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that uses 3d textures instead of 2d array textures
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wonder if its just the 2d array textures that break üòÑ
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> (which i still won't fix), but then we'd have a clue atleast
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i need to rerun it
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah Intel GPA seems to also do tracing so I would probably try that too. This is all just what I would try not sure if they would give any result
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, i'd assume that the debug output form opengl is most useful
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> atleast i'd assume a driver that has alot of error checking at specific spots
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> huh. with glintercept fulldebug on it doesn't crash anymore...
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is it a software renderer?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, a dll that intercepts all opengl calls and prints them out
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> before passing them on
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's strange
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> might be timing related and it adds just enough time...
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> true
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because fulldebug calls a filesystem flush after each logging
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> uhm, is it normal that glintercept logs have ??? as arguments
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh @deen u could also try gfx_finish, which always waits before swapping buffers
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> random thoughts but who knows
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if its really just timing üòÑ
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://ddnet.tw/glintercept_fulldebug_nohang.tar.gz
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://ddnet.tw/glintercept_fulldebug_nohang.tar.xz
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 no, that was because I was missing headers
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i fixed that and reran it, but it doesn't crash with full debug tracing..
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> doesn't hang*
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen btw anything in gliLog.txt?
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, it's the flushing that prevents hanging
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Now the question is howto force it to flush in the end
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> doesn't register an exit handler..
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, it keeps logging opengl calls even after the hang
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, we already knew the graphics thread kept going as if nothing happened
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://ddnet.tw/glintercept_hang.tar.xz
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> gfx_finish 1 didn't help
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> OpenGL 2.0 works @Jupstar ‚ú™
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then its either shader or 2d array textures
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> does ddnet have rest api for db?
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> bad
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but ok
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> all we have is https://info2.ddnet.tw/info?name=deen and you can get the full database: https://ddnet.tw/stats/
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ after using timeout protection it doesn't hang. without timeout protection it hangs
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> when u disable it, it doesnt hang?
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I mean after using  timeout protection it doesn't hang
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> strange randomness
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm trying Intel GPA now, but can't get it to work yet
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Intel GPA doesn't seem to support OpenGL on Windows
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/gpa-user-guide-for-windows-host/top/supported-platforms-and-applications.html
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and the performance recording doesn't look so useful, didn't see any warning logging
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly once they are at gl 1.x they probably stay at that version
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> who?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the blacklisted ppl
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, just make it the default for them, but don't persist it
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, but like they know how to change the config
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if the configuration struct would support changing the default values on runtime
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that would be nice
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it would "think" its the default value and wouldnt save it to config
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can also warn about high ping?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well maybe its not an issue with the new filter
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's still an issue
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I see people with ping > 250 all the time
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :Sadge:
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So I'm out of things to try :/
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Is there a reason why we can't see other peoples key presses while they are frozen?
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ryozuki blocklist instead of blacklist, doesnt that sound good to u xd+
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or prefer denylist? XD
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> blocklist or blacklist is good
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> denylist sounds horrible xd
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> XDD
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/774001455602466856/unknown.png
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice one
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mixing both
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> XD
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh shit xD
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> didnt even notice
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> first time i see this ptrdiff_t
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno, i am just not used to use int as a datatype, so i probs didnt even notice that iam typing it xd
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™ `sizeof(aVersionStrHelper) / sizeof(aVersionStrHelper[0])`
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is this the best way
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> char aVersionStrHelper[MAX_PATH_LENGTH];
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont u actually know the size
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sizeof(aVersionStrHelper) / sizeof(char) would be the same too
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, but then its easier to change the size
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can also remove the sizeof(char) bcs its 1
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but who cares xD
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well just to be sure
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its the safest
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sizeof(aVersionStrHelper) would be enough
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont get it
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes, but the above is the safest
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so whats wrong with it
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™ idk most code just uses sizeof(aVersionStrHelper) without dividing
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its constant expression anyway
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it still feels antipattern to me tho
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well maybe others dont care
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno, i always code like i don't know the datatype
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but u know it
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> (the implemenation of the datatype)
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 watcha think
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> okkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then how about this: in 2000 years ppl only use int for strings, bcs unicode uses all 4 billion chars
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and the alien of the future will say "this guy from 2000 years ago... What a genius"
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™ hey ur more pro than me, if u think its ok then im fine
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES_YouSerious:660223260918546468>
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just dont want to make a religion out of this xD
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki what am I thinking about what?
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3255/files
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `sizeof(char)` is an oxymoron
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 why would u use `sizeof(aVersionStrHelper) / sizeof(aVersionStrHelper[0]` for a stack allocated array
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xDDD discord xDD
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> YO LETS MAKE A FULLSCREEN PREVIEW
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> discord gone crazy
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice pfp btw
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™ this is funnier with deen face
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't bother with dividing by [0] for char arrays
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it always appears out of nowhere
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> super big
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We don't do it anywhere in the code either
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what i told him
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i always do it
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it must be somewhere
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but he said smth about 2k years in future
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but shouldnt you adapt to the codebase?
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt that the normal sane thing
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> as said, i won't make a religion out of this
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we must all follow teecode religion
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u want it, force push to my repo
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES_YouSerious:660223260918546468>
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well even 2k years in the future sizeof(char) has to be 1
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> C++ and C standards both require it
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in 2k c wont exist anyway
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and ddnet less
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not even this driver list
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but maybe they wont use chars anymore for strings
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also standard can change in 2k years xD
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt c always keep backwards compat
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> register will be removed for example
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> from c++
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> `register` will be removed for example
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they can't change sizeof(char) without breaking a whole lot of assumptions
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only way I see it happening is you joining the commitee and changing it to prove me wrong
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, but we are 40 years into coding.
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so who knows what happens in 2k years xD
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust takeover
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES_YouSerious:660223260918546468>
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if rust gets better syntax and oop, not unlikely xdd
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> honestly the syntax isn't cancer for people just learning it without learning any other language first
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i know
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just like python
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the worst syntax xD
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's just designed to throw off the intuition of every single developer from the past
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont have to fight against rust
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> embrace it
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 which may not be a bad thing
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lot of ppl hate rust at the start
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see ito n reddit
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but they like it after getting the hang of it
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Rust is completely designed to make you feel inadequate and bad so that you give in to letting the compiler do everything for you
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> `!printf("ryozoozki dumb");`
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well the compiler just ensures u dont do anything stupid
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its more likely we get a new language in the next 2k years xD
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> one that is less logic error prone too
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well there are new languages everyday
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> salong they dont have python syntax
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its true tho rust still isnt mature library wise
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> cancerous
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly blender uses it for plugins xD
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> almost died
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont like weak typed languages
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they can be scripting but pls dont make it weak typed
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont like script lanuages
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nothing is more glorious than anticompletion
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> auto
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> completiong
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my iq lowering
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant type
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> python is love
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ‚ú™ java <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:hit:773232488247853067>
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i hear java, i think of modded minecraft killing my pc with 20FPS
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> class VerySmallJavaClass {
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ups
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nono
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> class VerySmallJavaClass {
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> int a;
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> };
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> VerySmallJavaClass pTest = new VerySmallJavaClass();
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> how much bytes has this xD
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 10GB
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> private final static volatile String MY_HOUSE_ADDRESS = "HOOOO";
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòÆ
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> StringFactory
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt java where there are lot of factories
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> now the fun begins
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> java is like Rome, infinite ways and all lead to the same goal
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think dependency injection removes the need of factories
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> JNI
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and u back to a good language xd
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://dagger.dev/
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES_YouSerious:660223260918546468>
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Oh yeah kotlin
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> almost as cancerous as python xd
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for me lua is worse
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lua looks ugly af
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mhh let me see
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh yeah
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bit strange
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> they took the worst from all languages
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> including pythonx xD
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NoTe> Hello
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NoTe> my friend trying to make an server but when he trying to join " there's no server " " on LAN "
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NoTe> my friend trying to make server but when he trying to join " there's no server " " on LAN "
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then he probably isnt in the same router
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> if he is trying to join your server he should look on the internet tab
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NoTe> > if he is trying to join your server he should look on the internet tab
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NoTe> @plsplsplslol nah , his server
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> is he filtering out servers that have no players on them
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its either a filter, or its the server that doesnt start correctly
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NoTe> good now
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NoTe> ty

21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :gachiGASM:
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> looks cool üòÑ

21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> some day when im rich, i make a pc that looks better than it performs
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so basically an Apple PC
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> liquid cooling makes the pc prettier
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i think it doesnt perform better than air
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just the same
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> put pc in fish tank :greenthing:
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i saw a pc
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> inside a special liquid
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no electrical conductivity but high thermal conductivity
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well pyshically its performs better.. imagine u have heat and just move it somewhere else üòÑ
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u could see the liquid boiling at the cpu
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it probs isnt worth if u arent completly overclocking
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> do gamers in antarctica get more fps
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> probably
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u get at -270¬∞C u around the level of supraconductor
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno if thats the english word but its an effect of quantons
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno if thats the english word but its an effect of quantens
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno if thats the english word but its an effect of quantum
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> superconductor?
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
