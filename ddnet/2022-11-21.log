00:00 <+ChillerDragon> head is nice to show the beginning of a textfile
00:00 <+ChillerDragon> ``head -n1`` gives you only the first line
00:00 <+ChillerDragon> -n2 would give u the first 2 lines for example
00:00 <+ChillerDragon> since that class is used multiple times and our interest is the first hit we good
00:01 <+ChillerDragon> now we are left with some junk on the right hand side
00:01 <+ChillerDragon> using ``cut`` with the delimiter < and > you can cut of those
00:01 <+ChillerDragon> lemme send some screen of the individual commands maybe that makes some sense
00:02 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668985238.png
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> hmm I see
00:03 <+ChillerDragon> but this bad flex for teacher xd
00:03 <+ChillerDragon> what kind of assignment is that even?
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> lol exactly
00:04 <+ChillerDragon> what tech did u learn to solve that?
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> well, I was a little advanced so he gave it to me
00:04 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668985378.png
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> well, I was a little advanced so he gave that to me
00:05 <+ChillerDragon> thats more good style i would say
00:05 <+ChillerDragon> but takes much longer to write than bash
00:05 <+ChillerDragon> bash is always faster
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> hmm i see, ruby seems to be really useful for that stuff
00:06 <+ChillerDragon> doesnt rly matter if its ruby, javascript or python in my opinion
00:06 <+ChillerDragon> it all boils down to the same thing
00:06 <+ChillerDragon> so it depends on what your teacher taught you to solve this xd
00:06 <+ChillerDragon> advanced in wat?
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> well, he didn't teach us anything, that's the funny thing about him, he just asked for a result and we have to give him the result he wanted
00:08 <+ChillerDragon> what kind of teacher is that?
00:08 <+ChillerDragon> school?
00:08 <+ChillerDragon> what subject? xd
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> IT in general i would say, one day we take a look at db stuff, another day he wants a script to do something etc..
00:11 <+ChillerDragon> Yea i would say if you were interested in that scraped value to stalk it being changed both my approaches should work okay, But as for your assignment i think there is no hope :D
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> he basically asked for a script that would get the value of something and then put that value in a compressed file with the date as name and send the archive somewhere on a server
00:13 <+ChillerDragon> wtf
00:13 <+ChillerDragon> thats like a lot of stuff
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> well, kinda doable in 3 hours
00:14 <+ChillerDragon> depends on what you know
00:14 <+ChillerDragon> also what server xd
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> that's why i like this noob, even he something doesn't know how to solve his own problems lol
00:15 <+ChillerDragon> i mean its basically just 3 more bash commands and you done but still your teacher seems confused xd
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> was a local one located at the school
00:16 <+ChillerDragon> those kind of tasks is where bash really shines
00:16 <+ChillerDragon> i mean file io is literally 1 character with 0 setup or depedencies
00:16 <+ChillerDragon> xd
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> I'll never forget the kind of t-shirts he wears lol, once he came to school with one that said "I could change the whole world if you give me the source code" lmaoo
00:17 <+ChillerDragon> for compression your have the 3 letter command ``zip`` for uploading it to the server you have the 3 letter command ``scp`` and generating a ``date`` is also not too tricky
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> i used tar for compressing, kinda do the same thing
00:18 <+ChillerDragon> ye
00:18 <+ChillerDragon> is that like classical school school? like highscool or something?
00:18 <+ChillerDragon> i would have had so much fun in that class xd
00:19 <+ChillerDragon> ah wait i think i barley knew anything back then i probably would be super lost nvm
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> date was kinda tricky, I used smth like that **"$(date +"%d-%m-%y-%H-%M-%S")"**
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> yeah highschool
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> IT school or whatever you call it xD
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> we learn mainly networking & some cool stuff
00:23 <+ChillerDragon> yea depending on what kind of date you want but also then you can just google for the format
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> sure, anyways! was great to talk with ya nobo
00:23 <+ChillerDragon> my fav is this ``date '+%F'``
00:23 <+ChillerDragon> ye if u got more bash questions lemme know xd
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> yes "daddy"
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> yes, "daddy"
00:24 <+ChillerDragon> UwU

00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> now let's stop flooding this channel with my bullshit :twinbop:
00:32 <+ChillerDragon> u emoting madlads confused poor ``file`` command into thinking this chat log is binary data? xd
00:32 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668986987.png
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> theoretically, this should probably be done as a build step, not as a build generation step
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (ChillerDragon)
00:32 <+ChillerDragon> wouldnt help
00:32 <+ChillerDragon> vps ded either way huh?
00:33 <+ChillerDragon> i feel like it actually died so hard all tw servers that were running crashed but idk how that would have made sense so im probably wrong
00:37 <+ChillerDragon> ah no its not emojis xd
00:37 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668987307.png
00:37 <+ChillerDragon> i assume this causes it
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > why is that not an default :c
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because I can't guess whether you want IPv6 or IPv4
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: or rather, because you won't be happy with my guess that it's ipv6 only
00:39 <+ChillerDragon> do we have a ipv6 supremacists overhere? xd
00:40 <+ChillerDragon> imo its sane to go with ipv4 as default
00:40 <+ChillerDragon> rather than crash the server
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll not produce software that works better on ipv4 than on ipv6
00:41 <+ChillerDragon> xd
00:41 <+ChillerDragon> yo btw whats your opinion on 0.7?
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why would running it as build step not help with the vulkan shaders stuff?
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that way, you get the concurrency you specify
00:41 <+ChillerDragon> a
00:41 <+ChillerDragon> sure that would be nice
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: what do you mean "opinion on 0.7"?
00:42 <+ChillerDragon> as in opinion on ipv4 vs ipv6
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> teeworlds seems to be more dead than usual
00:42 <+ChillerDragon> xd
00:42 <+ChillerDragon> 0.7 in ddnet?
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like adding support for more software
00:42 <+ChillerDragon> or do you want to drop vanilla support 
00:43 <+ChillerDragon> > teeworlds seems to be more dead than usual
00:44 <+ChillerDragon> i think part of the reason is that ddnet client users get tired to switch client
00:44 <+ChillerDragon> your QUICC stuff kinda sounded like you want to drop vanilla support but im not sure
00:45 <+ChillerDragon> thats why i am asking if you care about ddnet <-> teeworlds compabilitiy
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I want to add a new way to establish a connection
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it will be incompatible with the old ones, yes
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I didn't want to drop support for the old ones
00:49 <+ChillerDragon> ok u dodge me it fine
00:49 <+ChillerDragon> good nite :)
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't understand your sentence
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good night though
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> @heinrich5991 i can't access demo's map using your libtw2, both from demo reader and demo writer
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> How :feelsbadman:
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it might not be implemented
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Looks like so :saddo:
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seems the map is always at the same offset of the file
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> depending on the demo version
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Yep, and size is defined by header byte
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you could get the size with the library (or yourself)
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and then just read the map file from the offset until offset + length
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for hte map
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Fair enough, just was trying to avoid doing something myself :nouis:
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (or you could try PRing the libtw2 repo to add support for map reading. it might be a little bit convoluted though)
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Sounds like a perfect variant but i can barely read ur code, not saying about writing something good myself, too nooby in rust :feelsbadman:
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry that I didn't write docs for it
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in newer code, I try to add documentation 🙂
01:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Btw its kinda hard to use libtw2, maybe i didn't understand something about cargo, but i had to use smth like `demo = { git="link to libtw2 repo" branch="master" }` cuz just `libtw2="0.0.0"` quite didnt work
01:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's correct. I didn't release it on crates.io because I didn't want to make stability guarantees :/
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :justatest:

09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Actual shell with data types and structured data
11:54 <+Ryozuki> day 3 of trying to match huffman bits
11:54 <+Ryozuki> idk what im doing wrong
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Put prints after all steps and see where it differs
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Log driven debugging for smaller algorithms is often quite helpful
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think heinrich's teeworlds huffman implementation works, maybe compare with that if you'd rather have a rust reference
12:20 <+Ryozuki> i copied kinda the cpp to rust 1on1
12:20 <+Ryozuki> and i get a shift overflow panic on debug
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1044210879618617344/image.png
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does it overflow on cpp or im doing smth wrong
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mathcing the behaviour doing a checked_shl and unwrap_or 0 gives wrong results
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> matching
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://gist.github.com/edg-l/13adde550ff81c038c5593b743156c8c>
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont wanna copy his code
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its ugly too
12:26 <+Ryozuki> hmm changing the order of the sort makes it not overflow
12:26 <+Ryozuki> but the bits dont match his table
12:26 <+Ryozuki> is the table even accurate
12:29 <+Ryozuki> im taking his table as a source of truth
12:29 <+Ryozuki> but never checked it
12:32 <+Ryozuki> the bad thing is tw huffman is huffman with quirks
12:34 <+Ryozuki> or idk
12:34 <+Ryozuki> i must suck
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't remember. I can take a look though if you are stuck
12:38 <+Ryozuki> well i sent a gist
12:39 <+Ryozuki> to see the bits it produces run cargo t -- --nocapture
12:39 <+Ryozuki> updated it
12:40 <+Ryozuki> <https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/doc/huffman.md>
12:40 <+Ryozuki> the table in the appendix
12:42 <+Ryozuki> actually u can try it here

16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Create a directory next to the cmakelists. Cd into the directory. Do `cmake ..` then do `make` it's not even supposed to be difficult :/
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> And it is written in readme.txt
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> :nouis:
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do assertions allow optimizations in c ?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> In rust it allows some
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://gist.github.com/jFransham/369a86eff00e5f280ed25121454acec1#assert-conditions-beforehand

17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What flavour of assertions are we talking about? builtin_unreachable is optimized around by both gcc and clang
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So if your assert failures do resolve to a call to unreachable, you will get optimizations
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The teeworlds kind where we just dbg_break as far as I know can't be optimized around
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (I'd guess rust relies on the exact same mechanism and lets LLVM handle these)
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ah
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Assert macro in rust is like a if check and a panic
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> So llvm optimizes that cuz the if condition
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One thing I don't remember is if LTO can handle these nowadays. E.g. I pass an assert that an array is of length n, then I pass it to a library which asserts on it aswell. Do we get to elide that idk

17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Can you screenshot then too?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Can you screenshot them too?

17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <- Mahdiyar> This is now complete
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That file DDNet-Server on the right there is the executable
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On linux executables don't have a special file extension like .exe
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Your project structure is weird tho :justatest:
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <- Mahdiyar> Yes
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <- Mahdiyar> xD
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <- Mahdiyar> Is this project right for Linux? @Learath2
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> You built it from linux, so yes, its for linux
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <- Mahdiyar> that's good
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <- Mahdiyar> Thanks for helping 
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <- Mahdiyar> @uwu

17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <- Mahdiyar> @Nouaa 🌹
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> ? Why do I bounce more when i open chat but when I dont there is not a bounce at all? :XD:
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1044296427033071707/chatbug.demo.mp4
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Because
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> that doesnt make any sense at all
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> new technique dropped :poggers2:
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Yesterday it worked perfectly fine? Weak and strong didnt change
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is bizarre wtf
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> Perhaps stop botting?
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Nice but the thing I like about bash is that it is usually preinstalled so that’s kinda a dealbreaker for me
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Ryozuki)
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Nobo
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soh KEJ ИнтерКосмос Кузнецова ✪> @noby
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <- Mahdiyar> I want to run DDNet-Server but it doesn't have format! @uwu
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> which format
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <- Mahdiyar> I click on DDNet-Server but it doesn't open
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <- Mahdiyar> @uwu
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 what is a `InputDiffWithoutNew`?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i bet it's server handling input differently when chat is open
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've found something a little too unreasonably annoying in gentoo. Container stuff is a little too underbaked
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WarHammer> Xd
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WarHammer> Linux
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WarHammer> ./DDNet-Server
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WarHammer> if it give an error
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WarHammer> Try "chmod +x *"
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WarHammer> What a hell bro
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WarHammer> 61°
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It doesn't have something like containers/common to bring in all the config file examples and docs and stuff, so each container system is left to install their own, which makes it pretty annoying
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> what would be the least spaghetti way to access entities such as shields inside CGameTeams?
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> its fahrenheit
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with carbonara
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> with fork (spoon not recomended)
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> with fork (spoon not recommended)
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dunno is there no other way, e.g. in a higher level component?
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else just access it over the whatever provides u these entities xd
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What sort of access do you want to other entities?
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you try to do? shields seem like gameplay, and CGameTeams manage the teams. I'd guess you should rather approach it from the shields
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it's gameplay
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I'm implementing a kind of pickup that needs to get reset when a team goes empty
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> register from the pickup into the team that it should notify u as soon as it is empty
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or create a new method on entities that is called when a new team is created
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that sounds reasonable
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the second one makes a little more sense given the structure we have
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A virtual method on CEntity that is overridden by your new entity
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> wouldn't I still need access to entities from CGameTeams for this?
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could also create a proxy method on whatever you have, gamecontroller, gamecontext, gameworld
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why does the entity even need to exist before the team was created
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how are we handling it with smth like doors?
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> those unfortunately all exist before the team is created
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have sth like ResetRoundsomething
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That goes and resets all switches
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i guess thats the spot to add it then isnt it
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or create a new logic that is better designed xd
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> once u touched server code u doomed anyway
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> after 2 years someone will ping u and tell ya u changed physics
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, in there you'd do something like `for(auto &e : GameServer()->GameWorld()->Entities() e->OnTeamReset();`
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't even know if we expose Entities outside of the gameworld though
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which might be one more thing you have to add
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One more restart, fingers crossed I didn't miss any other kernel configuration requirements that are written nowhere
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 seems I can't even teehistorian_dump any file, did we change something?
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> teehistorian died and nobody noticed?
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where do you find InputDiffWithoutNew?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (only access to web interface rn)
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Step 1) Take any(?) (newish maybe?) teehistorian file from the archive
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Step 2) Run teehistorian_dump on it
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like something that Zwelf might have changed
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only tested, 5 files, 1 was truncated improperly, I thought that was the issue, but it happened on any other random teehistorian file on ger2 aswell
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> oh I see CGameContext has a public m_World, somehow I missed that, I guess I was looking more for a getter function like everything else has
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, seems like something that Zwelf might have changed
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's when we get a an InputDiff without a preceding InputNew, or a InputNew after having already received an InputNew
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, here: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/b99d8dc2595d0914b9a844dad7b98b0aaedca8a8#diff-36d364171c742e82de9fd14f7a80241d3a7588df2bc27936fa788ba0f7ff7fd5
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> seems like libtw2 needs an update
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> where is libtw1
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's teeworlds 🙂
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> where is learath1
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so many questions xd
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where's heinrich5990
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I probably shouldn't get started on this ^^
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ryozuki
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> meh
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ryozuki0 are you there
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ryozuki is simply already perfect
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it doesnt need versioning
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> who gives heinrich discord nitro so he can change his tag number to 1995
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please donate to DDNet instead
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so you can abuse doc comments in rust to have any syntax u want
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```rust
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> use bash_to_rust::btr;
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> fn main() {
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>     btr!(
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>         /**
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>             echo "hi_chillerdragon"
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>         # */
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>         # if u need */ line has to start with ///
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>         /// whatever bash s/*/
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>         /**
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>             ls -l
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>         */
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>     );
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> }
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> pretty funny. so u can basically implement any language directly inside rust macros
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> does it also have a mode where it gives u all tokens unparsed?
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so basically the text as string xd
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway i'd say u can claim that u know rust now chillerdragon xd
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just write bash
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I absolutely hate whatever demon company is behind docker
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They seem to have arbitrarily decided that to pull some PUBLIC images, created by open source developers, for their software, requires a log in, not all but some images
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This corporate tinge to the entire containers thing gives me nausea
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> podman pog
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> podman relies on the same disgusting backends
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yah
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can disable a repo
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i had the same as u
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with the login
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i removed a redirect
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on the default config
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and just use the google repo
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont remember
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> default config is dumb
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> google repo is also shit :pepeW:
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> gentoo installing podmans testing registries.conf is also stupid
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 and u know what they block by default?
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the hello world container
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was like
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wtf is going on
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i had to edit the config xd
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly got brain damage from installing this stuff
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye containers suck
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use nixos
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for servers

23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Dude it's in like 2 months xd
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I only like races. Competitive best
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The arch default registries.conf is also pretty unhelpful but atleast it's not completely wrong
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> What are u even trying the whole day to encounter such situations
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> speedruns are competitive
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yeah but it's more fun live
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the speedrun is live

23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I like when 4p play there
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Against each other
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dislike those the most

23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unless
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its tetris

23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> me?
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yes
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm literally doing the tamest docker task, trying to compose a mariadb nginx php stack
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that sounds like not the tamest thing
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's running more than one container
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It fails on running the first single container, dw
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Discord mapping 79 entire gigabytes of address space is quite funny 😛
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> haskell maps 1 TiB by default, I think
