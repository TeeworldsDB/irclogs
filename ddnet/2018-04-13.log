02:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @cinaera basically boils down to whether we store personal information
02:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> given that anyone can take any nick â€“ I'm not sure
02:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> note that the gdpr was passed two years ago, it will only be enforced soon
03:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <SkyHDTV> https://youtu.be/crvYLDAsNps
09:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> haha nice finally
09:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> He fully raged about the shit ddnet servers once and that they should be upgraded. Then i asked if he ever donated or is planning to do so and he didnt sound like it will ever happen
09:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cool c:
12:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon He donated before in 2016: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/commit/f65c052abebcb3d8842e074d7a571027b18ce11b
12:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lul
12:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that was after 2016
12:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe he was a faker
12:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or he lied to me xd
12:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i could donate agian too some cents xd
12:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> my last donation is long ago
12:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But he donated 60 â‚¬ then and 100 â‚¬, not really comparable to a few cents...
12:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> add donor role
12:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> im not trying to compete with this rich boii im trying to support ddnet a bit c;
12:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i can donate in bitcoin ?
12:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bitcoin shitcoin, can't buy new GPU bcs miners ;~;
13:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is it still so bad?  looked into buying new pc parts in the future
13:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sadly yes, still completly overprices
13:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sadly yes, still completly overpriced
13:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i didnt buy any hardware to mine my bitcoins ._. @Jupstar âœª
14:53 <@heinrich5991> deen: maybe this is the year when donations will fully cover even previous years' expenses :)
14:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Less players, more donationðŸ¤”
14:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nope, donations always stop after year is fully covered ðŸ˜‰
14:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <noby> donations always stop [going towards ddnet] and into deens pockets
15:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @noby lul

22:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does
22:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> some1 know how i can launch a private git repo on my vps and connect to it without having to type the password all the time
22:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> timakro once helped me to store my ssh pubkey in some git manager what ever thing but i dont remeber what the name was
22:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> gitolite
22:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> at least that's what I use
22:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah ye that was the name thanks
22:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll go over the changes again, @Jupstar âœª 
22:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What about this glOrtho -10? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/4fec86a3548fd1c2447d2b9d412bb72efff4386b
22:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª Why have you removed these in backend_sdl.cpp?:
22:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 
23:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> -       glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
23:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> -       glLoadIdentity();
23:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And another suspicious one:
23:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> +void CCommandProcessorFragment_SDL::Cmd_Update_Viewport(const SCommand_Update_Viewport *pCommand)
23:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> +{
23:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> +       glViewport(pCommand->m_X, pCommand->m_Y, pCommand->m_Width, pCommand->m_Height);
23:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> +}
23:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And I get lots of this when starting client without opengl3:
23:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> [2018-04-13 23:08:33][graphics]: unknown command 8
23:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> [2018-04-13 23:08:33][graphics]: unknown command 13
23:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 8 is CMD_CREATE_BUFFER_OBJECT, 9 is CMD_RECREATE_BUFFER_OBJECT, 13 is CMD_CREATE_BUFFER_CONTAINER. I guess those should not be created without opengl3
23:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guess that's all the suspicious stuff I have
23:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 1st bcs no z coordinate, model view is default already identity too, viewport for DPI, if DPI awareness isn't not supported . gonna look in the rest
23:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> But it cannot happen that old opengl calls newer opengl commands
23:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> So of can't break any SDL or gl context
