11:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think ill switch to openbox
11:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i just tried dwm and got 400 fps there too xd
11:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wait maybe its a setting somewhere
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ˜‚
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> openbox master race
11:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i thought maybe refresh rate config
11:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i set it to infinite
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> even the biggest win95 fans know, openbox is the future
11:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and omg fakin suckless terminal cant run my irc xd
11:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this webchat is amazing fallback
11:07 < bridge> <TsFreddie> hi chiller
11:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i gotta admit gnome is the most performant when it comes to starting firefox
11:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dwm took like half a minute xd
11:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yo fredson
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> for me it takes 1 second
11:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> on gnome for me too
11:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gnome masterrace
11:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Mr.Gh0s7 dwm is scam it as bad as gnome xd
11:09 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD
11:10 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> dwm by scamfull.org
11:11 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> well I get 2 300 fps with dwm and no dgpu so idk
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i get 1000 fps with my phone
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> oh nvm
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> openbox back at 400 fps too
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> so its a setting for sure
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> send me your hardware, i'll test
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if it aint work, i keep the hardware
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> np
11:12 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :kek:
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> shit ddnet minimized
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> how to get it back
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> alt tab
11:13 <+ChillerDragon> wow openbox is very usable!
11:13 <+ChillerDragon> do people actually use it as daily driver?
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> SDL_VIDEO_X11_NET_WM_BYPASS_COMPOSITOR=1 ./DDNet
11:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> its kind of the base for other WMs
11:14 <+ChillerDragon> hat was your speedy command again?
11:14 <+ChillerDragon> the 17k fps command
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> uff let me search

11:15 <+ChillerDragon> Can i reorder my screens ._.
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> openbox put em randomly
11:16 <+ChillerDragon> wait is there no copy paste? xd
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, i used it like 3 times, when i tried some stuff
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bcs that shit just starts, without any delay or whatever
11:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> enough to open a browser and search the internet xD
11:16 <+ChillerDragon> yes very unbloated indeed
11:17 <+ChillerDragon> so unbloated it doesnt even render a background x
11:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah xd
11:17 <+ChillerDragon> which is some bloat i actually miss
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but bro no joke
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it runs so fck smooth xD
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> resize is completly instant with it
11:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> also look at this beatiful design when u move around windows

11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bcs it gives a fuck about redrawing the background
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> like the old WinXP days
11:21 < bridge> <nori> lol
11:24 < ws-client> <chiller@openbox> ah u openboxing too now?
11:24 < ws-client> <chiller@openbox> im gaming a bit
11:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah i switched for u
11:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so we the cool kids
11:25 < ws-client> <chiller@openbox> i lost 90% of my tw skill due to setup issues
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and the remaining 10% are your bots? :^)
11:25 < ws-client> <chiller@openbox> yes
11:25 < ws-client> <chiller@openbox> also wtf where is my healthbar?!
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bloat
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok on a 4090 u probs also get 17k without entities
11:26 < ws-client> <chiller@openbox> i have 2k fps
11:26 < ws-client> <chiller@openbox> xd
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 2k fps bro
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> even with nuoveuoum drivers u get more
11:27 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> speaking of drivers have you installed any?
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> he has nvidias
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> he also hit 17k FPS once
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but somehow he destroyed it again
11:28 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD lol
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1110987446897881088/image.png
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the winner pose
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if nvidia would support wayland without bugs he probs would have more
11:43 < ws-client> <chiller@openbox> ok f it if everything is shit might as well use gnome xd
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but srsly, there must be a reason
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> did u change nvidia settings or smth
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> set everything to max performance
11:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 2k fps is ridiculous
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it was 3k
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and i was on a 4k screen so its fair i guess
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> no xd
11:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok xd
11:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> skill issue then
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes and no
11:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a
11:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 3k fps gnome
11:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ez
11:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i cant play with this setting
11:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> honestly i think gnome was never the issue
11:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> very pog gnome best
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> don't blame software you dislike is an option?
11:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok but srsly were did my hud go? xd
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it went to invisibility
11:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes!
11:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is that ur config? xd
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah
11:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lel how
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ah and nameplates off
11:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``cl_showhud 1``
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i forgot
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i didnt disable the full hud
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> only stuff nobody needs
11:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i need it !
11:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> t0 ganster
11:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok ima revert u scam command
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> gangster
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's for pros
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if u can't remember what happens u picked up, u should play less t0 ðŸ˜‚
11:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ?xd
11:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i need to see my taser ammo bru
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i c, then train vanilla without hud
11:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh boi
11:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is no taser in vanilla
11:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> kulturbanause
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> thought u meant laser and misspelled ðŸ˜„
11:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i wood never muissplee sometuhi
11:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay fk fps more important is i am very happy with how it actually feels now and its smooth as botter

14:49 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> now my sorting function won't look for valid positions and will do it's task faster, stonks
14:49 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> (only 6 empty positions are there and the function only sorts out 6, success)
14:52 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Now all is left is to make a nice GUI for making entities and... programming all 256 entity data... oh fuck I forgot that one

14:55 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I'm making the Teeworlds map editor in godot

15:16 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I thought you'll be offended :kekW:
15:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im making edlang
16:44 < bridge> <Chairn> just discovered there is something called `git worktree` allowing me to not duplicate git folders but still have different folders with different branches
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sounds useful indeed
17:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> rust is bad because I still don't have the patients and skill to learn it
18:03 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I used picom --benchmark-wid <ID> and I get 2 700 fps now
18:04 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ChillerDragon do you use a compositor?
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bra the space is so confusing xxd
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in ur prev message i thought it was a typo
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> what is your hardware tho?
18:18 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ryzen 5 5600G 16GB ram no dgpu
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> oh nice
18:29 < bridge> <Voxel> same
18:30 < bridge> <Voxel> plus i wouldnt even know what to make so.lawl
18:53 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> you could try to do advent of code in rust :D
20:08 < bridge> <Ewan> good afternoon ddnet
20:09 < bridge> <Ewan> your dwm may be fast but mine has mica and acrylic blurs ðŸ˜ƒ
20:09 < bridge> <Ewan> beat that
20:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> kde has so many weird effects u can enable xDD

20:22 < bridge> <gerdoe> lmfao
20:22 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
20:22 < bridge> <Ewan> they are good
21:18 < bridge> <deen> I do get annoyed about Rust being relatively immature still. Lots of necessary features are still in discussion, so a bit annoying to build some important software on top of it
21:19 < bridge> <deen> I'm releasing DDNet 17.0.1 if no one complains soon
21:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a balance between being safe and not releasing smth u cant fix due to backwards compat contract
21:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think they take what cpp did wrong seroously
21:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but well, this is like ddnet imho, you want smth, u gotta push for it urself first
21:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> like new features
21:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
21:29 < bridge> <gerdoe> is there a need to add getplayer alias and getplayerunchecked alias for bound checked getplayer and just m_apPlayers[id]
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah they should simply make no backward compability changes, every here and then
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's not like a breaking change means a lot of effort to adapt most of the time
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in worst case some crate can compensate it by emulating the old behavior
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i'd in fact claim cpp's biggest problem is that they hold back for too long
21:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i mean cpp99 and cpp11 are like two different languages xD
21:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> nothing is ever perfect anyway

22:57 < bridge> <Learath2> The gameworld really isnâ€™t intended to be copied. It contains references it doesnâ€™t own and frees stuff it doesnâ€™t own
23:01 < bridge> <Teero> hmm ye makes sense if you think about antiping
23:04 < bridge> <Ewan> wow I didnâ€™t know anyone actually used artix
23:04 < bridge> <Ewan> how is it

23:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> You coded it so quickly?
23:28 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Actually really fun to make UI, unless there is a Godot developer who hides variables inside signals, so that the only way you can access it is to fucking ask for the variable via signals
23:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :poggers2: :poggers2: :poggers2:
23:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Fast af
23:28 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I wanna kill that dev so bad, here is the code
23:28 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1112130338790051840/image.png
23:29 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> FOR A FUCKING BACKGROUND VAR
23:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Did u inject Godot into tw or other way around
23:29 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I replicate the stuff from it
23:29 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> most things I can achieve in Godot, besides memory management
23:29 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1112130464052953188/image.png
23:29 < bridge> <Ewan> this is all i got
23:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But is it just gui yet or functional editor xd
23:30 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> If I add the conditions to the popups, then it is functional
23:30 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> yet I still need to code in more stuff, like the save / load, the groups and the envelopes
23:30 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> the buttons above can be from the same object but with different scripts, so it's ez
23:31 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> then it's mostly done, I watched a godot youtuber making a Teeworlds like map editor and I'll inject it into mine :toptri:
23:31 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vr2sruWHAkg
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Then gg
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> That was quick
23:32 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> :feelsbossman:
23:32 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> a bit buggy, a bit more difficult than Arch but enjoyable
23:34 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Well, see you in a month when the editor is ready xd
23:34 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> I don't think it would take so much time, the guy made a fucking good job with the editor
23:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I tried gnome, openbox and dwm with x11 no idea what a compositor really is
23:38 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@Reteah)
23:39 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> can you try `picom --backend glx --no-vsync`?
23:41 < bridge> <Ewan> no reaction to my screenshot. crazy
