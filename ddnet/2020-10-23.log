06:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Spyry> these methods don't work
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 @Jupstar ✪ We have someone who has the hang at specific part of map:@noby Can you guys help with debugging?
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how can i help
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Run it with debugger in Debug build until it hangs, then have one of them look into it remotely
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont wanna give ppl access to my pc
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i can try to run it with debuger in a bit
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i had the hang btw i dont think it was noby
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i havent joined that server
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis did u downgrade you driver again btw?
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh I mixed up your names because htey have same color and length 😄
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and both from usa
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean i upgraded it from broken vers then the new one was also broken so i downgraded to one in the middle
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so all 3 broken
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> btw idk how to load a debug or smth
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so i dont have to run wit debugger?
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i have no idea but on vs i ran with debugx64 or smth
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and it says this
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @noby no 😄 except u get a hang too, which i doubt 😛

16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk if im doing it ri ght
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i proably wont since i have old client but i could try anyway after this round if itd help
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i honsetly doubt anyone except intel and windows will have this bug
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh i dont have windows
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even if the bug is inside the audioclientcore, it might still be related to intel
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but do have intel processor
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> some of the devs have intel too, but on linux
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i have osx
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i know 😄
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> aha
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> nvm its not with thata audio thing
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if i just launch client and exit it shows up too
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh ok
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well if you really want to debug, you need a debugger and a debug build, but i already tried that with that other person who had the same bug
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> only a driver update fixed the hang
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean i can constantly reproduce it as long as that server is up but idk how to debug
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ would your gfx_debug help to find issues?
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they can try, maybe intel reports something bad
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis do you know how to open a client with a .cfg?
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just put the wanted settings in cfg? but idk how to run it
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you need to create a link/shortcut whatever and put -f test.cfg behind the path in the properties of the shortcut
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or shift rghtlick open power shell here
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and then ./DDNet.exe -f test.cfg
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok ill try
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> inside test.cfg put dbg_gfx 1
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> btw i can only reproduce on the server thats about to restart soon so
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it will probably always work on that map
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yea it might be
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or `./DDNet.exe “dbg_gfx 1”`
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what server isit
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ill try it just in case
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> good to know @Learath2 😄
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok i did that
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ./DDNet.exe “dbg_gfx 1”
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> now what
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idek if it works
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in the console it should show enabled opengl debug
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> [gfx]: Enabled OpenGL debug mode
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @louis when does it hang
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i joined the server and it seems normal
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> beginning of maap when i try to do the filter
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ok i made it past hte start line
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ill try with new client
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the ./DDNet.exe “dbg_gfx 1” didnt seem to work for me
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> do i put a .cfg file with thaat line in the saame folder as ddnet.exe
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> theoretically its also possible intel doesnt support that extension xd
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i passed start line with new client too on the server
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :X
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> eh ig i cant help then
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis are you using opengl 3.0 or 3.3?
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> im using opengl tho
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you checked opengl 3.3?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh not in the vs build nvm
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok now i do and ran it but doesnt show the [gfx] thing
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah btw
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u need nightly for that
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> sry xD
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ..
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i have steam betaa
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> can i just do it in there
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just press f1 and see if that option exists
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think it's in the beta yet
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dbg_gfx 1
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no it doesnt
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it should be in nightly
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok where do iget nightly
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wasnt it merged 1-2 days ago
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if you have steam nightly it should work, let me check
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://ddnet.tw/news/nightly-build-revived/
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen we still don't save symbols for releases, do we?
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in steam beta the option is there
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, no symbols
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> regular Release build
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its not in there for me
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ill just download it from that link
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if we talk about
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769204363859198032/unknown.png
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye i had that
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we are veering off course here. @louis since you have visual studio I assume you built your own client, does the hang happen on your build too?
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its there, or is the windows nightly not up to date @deen ?
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes learath2
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean i just cloned the current github/ddnet code then ran ddnet.exe from it
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you build the latest version? From github?
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And did you switch configuration to Debug, before building?
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769204827308818482/unknown.png
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> like this?
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if so then yes
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, so if you get the game to hang, can you alt+tab out?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah i did
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> im pretty sure nothing happened in the debug console tho
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ill try again
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok im tabbed out now what
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> pause in debugger
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> let me check how to pause in vs
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if i tab back in the screen flashses black and off and i can still hear sounds/ shoot my gun lol
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the green arrow should be a pause button now
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It feels awfully like the render thread is stuck in a loop
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh there waas a blue pause button
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes it feels like it
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> that said "break all"
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i already checked xD
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok now what
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it opened a place in the code
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you need to find the gfx thread now
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Amazing, my visual studio doesn't work. I love how "foolproof" these IDEs are. Really glad I spent 20G to install a dud
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol do i just continue and pause till i find something with gfx
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah, there should be a view somewhere that lists the threads
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769206376751824916/unknown.png
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well it's one of the thread_run threads
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the thread im on now has some gfx stuff
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice then show the callstack
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> english plz
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769206776066867260/unknown.png
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769206836515438632/unknown.png
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh it's just running a buffer as always
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cmd_render is btw old graphic stack
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> honestly, pls try the dbg_gfx 1
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe it actually shows something useful
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh i was misspelling dbg_gfx thats why i didnt find it
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis what is your gfx_opengl_major btw?
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or what is the name of the map
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even if 10000 triangles arent the world, its also not nothing
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 2
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Need to restart computer to install an application that exists completely in userspace.
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769207956184498186/unknown.png
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 3
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its 3
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok and map name?=
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its Multeasymap but its not the halloween version
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok ty
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how do i go backwards in cd
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> nvm xd
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i was playing with dbg_gfx 1
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and it froze
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> now what
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> look in the console
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if it shows smth
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> where can i find the non halloween version btw
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its horrible xD
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk the powershell console doesnt show anything
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> im not running it thru vs btw
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, if the console doesnt show anything, then nothing is wrong
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> btw, can you quickly summorize some stuff, were there ppl playing, were you zooming?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769206776066867260/unknown.png
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this image says the primcount is over 10k, and i cannot reproduce that
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> there were some afk nobos but not a buncha people on my screen or anything
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i was default zooz walking around spawn
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh i really think a tool like ubsan or asan would find this in 5 seconds xD
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how do i use those
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i honestly dunno if they are easy to compile under windows
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> use flag -fsanitize=address for asan and -fsanitize=undefined for ubsan
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if its complicated i probably wont be able to lol
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let me try building with asan and ubsan
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll tell you if it's hard or easy
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would be nice @Learath2 😄
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Maybe it's something weird with your custom entities :feelsamazingman: @louis
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> will be interesting how the value of 10k comes in, must be either a underflow/overflow or a stack/buffer overflow
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> maybe nouis has custom hacked client 👀
16:51 < Ryozuki> test
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> autocrashed for wearing a santa hat when it's october
16:52 < Ryozuki> antiping shouldnt predict non-frozen players if you have >200 ping, since its useless
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it should be a setting
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont find it useless
16:52 < Ryozuki> u dont get it
16:52 < Ryozuki> antiping for non-frozen works fine if
16:52 < Ryozuki> the ping is less than 200
16:52 < Ryozuki> at 200 it gets crazy
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its not like there is a magical cutoff at 200
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it just gets gradually worse as ping increases
16:52 < Ryozuki> well its around there
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> some people still find it useful
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well past 200
16:53 < Ryozuki> if u use antiping for servers where u have less than 100 ping u use it to have the 0 ping feeling
16:53 < Ryozuki> and tees wont teleport
16:53 < Ryozuki> but when u are on a 200ping server tees do teleport
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i mostly play on servers between 100-250 ping and i think antiping helps alot
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u get used to the teleporting
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for dummy drag its still nice
16:53 < Ryozuki> it could trigger someones epilepsia
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> he said non frozen tho
16:53 < Ryozuki> im not joking
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for afk drag its nice
16:54 < Ryozuki> xd
16:54 < Ryozuki> yeah for afk yes
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> dont zooz on noby's server if you're worried about that, fair warning
16:54 < Ryozuki> but if others move it gets messy
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> dont zooz on my server at all
16:54 < Ryozuki> make screen be grey tones
16:54 < Ryozuki> then zooz on noby
16:54 < Ryozuki> no epilepsy
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ..
16:55 < Ryozuki> :troll:
16:55 < Ryozuki> :monkaLaugh:
16:55 < Ryozuki> rip
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @ryozuki pls send me ur IP address
16:55 < Ryozuki> ryozuki.xyz
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I broke the damn IDE, now I need to reclone the project because there is no way to find where tf it stores "CMakeSettings.json"
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> need to ban for zoozering
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Amazing tool so far
16:55 < Ryozuki> Learath2 windows?
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> i though ryo is banned
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why
16:55 < Ryozuki> im on irc bumm
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BµmM>> cheater
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> did u actually get banned from dc?
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @ryo
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why
16:56 < Ryozuki> i told u in dm
16:56 < Ryozuki> why u wouldnt trust my dm
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> not
16:56 < Ryozuki> lmao
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont remember u saying the reason but rip
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> abuse
16:56 < Ryozuki> i was rude
16:56 < Ryozuki> according to someone
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> beware if you make a mistake in your `CMakeSettings.json` there is no way to fix it
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> pls dont start drama now ty
16:56 < Ryozuki> yeah noby
16:56 < Ryozuki> dont start
16:56 < Ryozuki> drama
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im just asking .-.
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we are currently debugging something
16:56 < Ryozuki> what are you debugging?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we try to find a overflow in windows
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> nouis client freezes on a certain server
16:57 < Ryozuki> a needle in the hay
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ubsan and asan dont show anything in linux with gl 3.0, so really impossible to reproduce
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> still possible that the driver itself creates the overflow
16:58 < Ryozuki> when i used valgrind time ago
16:58 < Ryozuki> i saw mem leaks involving the driver stuff
16:58 < Ryozuki> _dri stuff
16:58 < Ryozuki> iirc
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but if its inside the .so its not from teeworlds
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or at client close?
16:58 < Ryozuki> yeah
16:59 < Ryozuki> idk if its at client close
16:59 < Ryozuki> obj:/usr/lib/dri/*_dri.so
16:59 < Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/valgrind.supp
16:59 < Ryozuki> thats why i made this file
16:59 < Ryozuki> cuz drivers and stuff had leaks
16:59 < Ryozuki> outside tw
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok 😄
17:00 < Ryozuki> that emoji looks funny on terminal
17:01 < Ryozuki> :joy:
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ive had valgrind report leaks in really weird places before tho fwiw
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> like inside of printf under normal use conditions
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> inside printf is unlikely, printf doesn't allocate or free anything
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> sometimes valgrind just cant track these stuff
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it was one of those stdio functions
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> snprintf or prinf or something
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> valgrind just hooks malloc and free, it can't really miss much of anything
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> rlly? o_0
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i could be misremembering which utility did this but i was pretty sure it was valgrind
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there actually could be an issue in the version of glibc you were using
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not like glibc developers are aliens that don't ever make mistakes
17:04 < Ryozuki> glibc are gods
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> that could be true too, i think it was on my old laptop when it happened
17:04 < Ryozuki> mistakes are for humans
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
17:04 < Ryozuki> you can always search a bug tracker
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> (or it was some rlly weird error i made in my code that only was caught upon the printf? seems unlikely if u only pass it variables but idk)
17:04 < Ryozuki> https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-72/product_id-767/GNU-Glibc.html
17:05 < Ryozuki> "GNU Libc current is affected by: Mitigation bypass. The impact is: Attacker may guess the heap addresses of pthread_created thread"
17:05 < Ryozuki> funny stuff

17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/ASAN-Blog-Post-Image-2.png
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> am i right that
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ```
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> printf("%s\n", fn());```
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> this could show as being a leak that originates within printf but
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ```
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> char *arg = fn();
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> printf("%s\n", arg);```
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> this couldnt?
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> like if it was improperly freed it would show the leak as coming from somewhere else
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> assuming that fn returns memory that it allocates
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769215407713419294/image0.jpg
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> always crash at this spot, a lot easier to reproduce if opengl is off i found out, and cant reproduce on LAN same map as far as i know
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
17:08 < Ryozuki> nice book 
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis can u try the 2 images i posted
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> thx ryo
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby I don't think that would show as one originating in printf, your allocation will be done before the call into printf
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> true i guess
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Jupstar ✪ howd u get that second picture
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the project properties thing
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for the ddnet client
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on the right isnt there a list?
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> DDnet
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> DDNET-server
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and so on
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rightclick ddnet
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> After downloading 5 extra gigabytes and having to restart the editor 10 times, I have managed to get a asan build of ddnet
17:22 < Ryozuki> i wonder what they do to use so much space
17:23 < Ryozuki> i wonder if CLion supports msvc
17:23 < Ryozuki> https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/quick-tutorial-on-configuring-clion-on-windows.html u can i guess
17:23 < Ryozuki> its a way better ide
17:24 < Ryozuki> but paid
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> r u on windows rn @Learath2 ?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> xd i cant even fin dit
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's apparently not a concern. The last time I was complaining about space told me I'm a poor peasant if I don't have an extra couple hundred gigabytes of free space on my ssd/hdd and an internet connection that is slow
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ yeah on windows rn
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis send picture of the whole IDE xD
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769219802345766982/unknown.png
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ohh
17:25 < Ryozuki> its hilarious you need to download the entire visual studio to get the compiler toolchain or whathever it is
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its a direct cmake build
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ryozuki, you can have MSVC without visual studio as part of the windows sdk
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis open CmakeLists.txt
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and find
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> `target_compile_options(${target} PRIVATE /wd4800) # Implicit conversion of int to bool.`
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dublicate that line and change the thing after PRIVATE to /fsanitize=address
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that breaks everything
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why that
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it won't link, it will break your IDE
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wtf xD
17:27 < Ryozuki> lol
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @louis you need to modify your Visual Studio installation first
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This thing in your start menu
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769220521732341810/unknown.png
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just build a SLN with cmake honestly xD
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then u can modify everything
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769220567874142238/unknown.png
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i did learath
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i had the sanitizer thing enabled i think
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you install ASan?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay delete that line
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol ok
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to add it somewhere else to get it properly linking
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> right click CMakeLists.txt
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> select `CMake Settings`
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769220963223994378/unknown.png
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> CMake Settings for DDNet then
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Duplicate the first configuration
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The third button is duplicate
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769221232548773908/unknown.png
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> After that click Edit JSON
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then you add `"addressSanitizerEnabled": true` to the new configuration
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like this
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769221511621115964/unknown.png
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think i did it
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now choose the new configuration you created up top
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u mean the file next to green run button?
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The one to the left of the file
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It should prolly say `x64-Debug` right now
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait lol
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769222575619309578/unknown.png
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you probably made a typo in the json, show json
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ```json

17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> }
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ```
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you need a , after []
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oops
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> now do i run ddnet
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think so, fingers crossed it should build and run
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> fingers crossed its just the driver thats buggy xddd, jk
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why would you even want that? 😄
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should use a kernel 0day to monkey patch intels buggy ass drivers
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs then we just need to disable intel on windows xD
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or wait for the windows update or smth
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769224621434077214/unknown.png
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it says this idk
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i couldnt select a startup item
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> scroll down a bit
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769224820550270986/unknown.png
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hm
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait let me make sure i had it instalaled
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah this happened to me too, after modifying my installation 3-4 times
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it just worked
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Visual Studio and Windows are more akin to a carpenters hammer than Linux
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just restart everything, turn off electricity, turn off the local internet, and windows will work
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to hit it really hard a couple dozen times and it sometimes does the job, sometimes completely breaks your work and you need to start over
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> maybe it has to be `/fsanitize=address` instead of `-fsanitize=address` ?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `enableAddressSanitizer` does the correct one for clang-cl
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> huh, @Learath2 knows how to work with msvc's cmake integration
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I know who to ask next time 😄
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but all options of MSVC compiler always begin with `/` as far as i know
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I learned a bit of it right now to help louis, the only person who can reproduce the bug 😄
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Comrade well, VS handles it
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if the correct version is / it will use /
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it seems it passes the wrong option directly to cl.exe 😄
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It obviously recognizes the option so it tries to link clang_rt
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> The only time I froze similar to louis is when I was connecting dummy, seems random though
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> The only times I froze similar to louis is when I was connecting dummy, seems random though
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> cl: Command line warning D9002: ignoring unknown option '-fsanitize=address'
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> that's MSVC definitely, not clang
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> only Microsoft's compiler has these stupid numeric errors 😄
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok im adding some random  modifications to vs hopefully it fixes it
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> that's MSVC definitely, not Clang
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I found a foolproof way to get it to work
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cmake.org/download/
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You use cmake, instead of VSs god awful cmake integration
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> can't he just use cmake for it?
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> ```
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> nmake
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> ```
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> i use this always instead of broken VS 😄
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> only Windows SDK is needed as @Learath2 said
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the cmake gui is even easier
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok what do i do
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just open select vs, finished
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> download cmake
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> run cmake-gui.exe
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> select ddnet root folder as source directory
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> select ddnet build directory as source_dir/build
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> click configure
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> select vs
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wait
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 1h
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (beware when devs say something is easy. it's not :P)

17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> click open project

18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> - Open CMake (cmake-gui) and select the source code directory and the empty build directory.
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> - Press Configure button.
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> - Select generator matching your Visual Studio version. If you want to build 64-bit version, use Win64 generator.
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> - You can now change build options in the CMake window. Press Configure button again when you're done.
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> - Press Generate button.
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> - Press Open Project button. It should open Visual Studio with the generated solution.
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> step by step 😄
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> eeeeeezzzzzzzzzz
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> vs will also automatically update when cmakelist changes
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it overrides many things configured in CMake
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> build type for example
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> so it's better to configure everything in solution properties inside VS
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> Windows is so unfriendly platform for developers and so many people still use it 😄
18:04 < Ryozuki> maybe windows dev dont even use cmake
18:04 < Ryozuki> they use the ide directly
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes, many of them use that XML trash generated by VS
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but cmake uses the ide correctly 😄
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769229984215728138/unknown.png
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> uuh is it supposed to look all red
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes
18:05 < Ryozuki> and many windows dev dont even use c++, they are into c#
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ban
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> c# is java in green
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> @louis just hit Generate and then Open Project
18:06 < Ryozuki> what does in green mean
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its a german thiing probably
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i just use it in english
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it means basically, its the same
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but C# is still much better than Java 😄
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> i think
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs its impossible todo worse xd
18:07 < Ryozuki> i prefer c# over java too
18:07 < Ryozuki> i only used it for terraria plugins tho
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i programmed in c# with xna when i was like 16 or smth
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then java minecraft plugins xxD
18:07 < Ryozuki> i also did some mc thingies xd
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but when i switched to c++ and assembly
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it opened a new world for me
18:08 < Ryozuki> the elite
18:08 < Ryozuki> now u gotta become hipster
18:08 < Ryozuki> and join rust
18:08 < Ryozuki> facebook and microsoft are hiring rust compiler engineers btw
18:08 < Ryozuki> to improve it
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i want a c syntaxed, rust safe, range based programming language, so no more logic errors or anything else
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We made louis spend so much time on this, we still didn't even get it to build 😦
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769231174962249758/unknown.png
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oki open project now what
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> select vs2019
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/ASAN-Blog-Post-Image-2.png
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on right side there is DDnet project
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rightclick that, make it default start porject
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then add the thing in the image
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> @louis did you select Visual Studio 2019 Win64 as generator?
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> otherwise it's 32-bit build
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i selected x64
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> good
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> currently only available for 32 bit builds
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok i think i got it
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @plsplsplslol huh
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (bottom right of the screenshot)
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yes
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh lol
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> MSVC ASan is 32-bit only? oh come on... 😄
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's fine since 16.7
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/asan-for-windows-x64-and-debug-build-support/
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you maybe have an older VS?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> well, inline assembly is not available in 64-bit MSVC as well, so who knows
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> im on 16.4
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ill updaate
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> see you tomorrow then 😄
18:16 < Ryozuki> rip
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> btw, just saw, i even added a dbg msg that says
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "Requested OpenGL debug mode, but the driver does not support the required extension"
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if debug mode is not supported
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> by the way, what if ASan in MSVC is totally useless, so all this is just a waste of time?
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then we tried at least
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> and UBSan is not available at all there
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tbh, i tried the exact spots the intel users had the crashes in
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with ubsan and asan and valgrind, nothing
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its either something windows or something driver specific
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but no reports from nvidia or amd users yet 😄
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wow i have to restart computer to apply vs updates
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Is there a way to contact Intel GPU driver team?
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis yeah, learath2 complained about the same before
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen it can still be a overflow
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769206776066867260/unknown.png
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont understand and cannot reproduce a primcount of 10k here
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that is not a typical overflow value
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or you mean some multiplication overflowing?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe a buffer overflow
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> writing stuff inside the buffer
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> mhm
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can be completly unrelated to the graphic things
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so we're one step forward it seems, that's nice
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe nvidia and amd are just dropping these invalid commands or smth
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, that was my hope, that we're doing something wrong, but some drivers are more tolerant of that
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because then it's something we can fix
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I've been running asan+ubsan for days now locally, haven't found anything more interesting than what I reported
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok hi im back
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769238475751948318/unknown.png
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> what do i do
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is that the crash or smth @louis ?
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it askss me to do that before i run ddnet
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can u cancel it? xd
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769239218957451284/unknown.png
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Learath2
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Heh, I had the same error at work yesterday 😄
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but I didn't know the solution
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> :justatest:
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis try a from-scratch build?
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> sounds like it crashed there or smth xd
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have absolutely no idea 😦
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why must life be this difficult?
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769241678728658947/unknown.png
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i get this when i try to cmake the source files from the github
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> show the output from the windows below stop button
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769242192031121418/message.txt
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u forgot to fill the ddnet-libs
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how do i do that
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-libs
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ?
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> do i just put this in the same folder or
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> follow the instructions in ddnet README
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> To clone this repository with full history and external libraries (~350 MB):
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> 
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> git clone --recursive https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
18:58 < Ryozuki> if you did get the sources with git then u can do git submodule init --update
18:58 < Ryozuki> or osmething like that
18:59 < Ryozuki> git submodule update --init --recursive
18:59 < Ryozuki> i always get it the other way around
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> update --init
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think I'll ever try anything on windows again, I spent 4 hours of valuable time to accomplish nothing
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> windows best
19:01 < Ryozuki> :joy:
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :antijao:
19:02 < Ryozuki> Learath2 isnt using nmake easier
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> when will fl studio support linux :(
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ryo how is it going on the banned side of things
19:02 < Ryozuki> cool i guess
19:02 < Ryozuki> how is it there
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tried with nmake too
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :justatest:
19:02 < Ryozuki> discord emojis dont translate to irc sadge
19:03 < Ryozuki> 😰
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what about normal emojis
19:03 < Ryozuki> they do
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 🤐
19:03 < Ryozuki> if they have unicode representation iguess
19:03 < Ryozuki> 👺
19:03 < Ryozuki> oh
19:03 < Ryozuki> this looks funny
19:03 < Ryozuki> https://imgur.com/tr3shU2
19:04 < Ryozuki> some look good some not
19:04 < Ryozuki> Learath2 the trusth is probs that windows wants you to use c# and forget about c stuff
19:04 < Ryozuki> their c# tooling is way better
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> [ddnet] <jao> you are unbanned now
19:05 < Ryozuki> nice troll
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have never, in my entire life worked with such horrible tooling
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think part of it comes from unfamiliarity
19:06 < Ryozuki> @noby did u know irc shows that as a one liner
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wym
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> VS includes 5 incompatible copies of clang, 2 incompatible copies of MSVC
19:06 < Ryozuki> wedym by incompatible
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> hi
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> [ddnet] <jao> you are unbanned now
19:06 < Ryozuki> can u actually use llvm in windows?
19:07 < Ryozuki> "[ddnet] <Ravie> [ddnet] <jao> you are unbanned now" it looks like this in irc
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. they have a drop-in replacement
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The 7 aforementioned compilers each link to 15 different clang_rt libraries each
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ravie @jao please stop trolling
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So 7 * 15 clang_rt pieces
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want to link it in debug mode you can only use msvc to link to clang_rt
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> clang-cl can only do release mode
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what trolling lol
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> that's what a troll would say
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but if you link in release mode lld will still get confused and use /MDd for some reason
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> god knows why
19:08 < Ryozuki> whats MDd
19:08 < Ryozuki> i dont know windows flags
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao sry, meant noby
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> link with debug libs?
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dynamically
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```Defines _DEBUG, _MT, and _DLL and causes the application to use the debug multithread-specific and DLL-specific version of the run-time library. It also causes the compiler to place the library name MSVCRTD.lib into the .obj file.```
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's like I'm trying to build a sand castle using dry sand
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 the first 2 hours was unfamiliarity, now that I'm intimately familiar with VSs internals and how it butchered clang to make it fit in it's archaic structure I'm allowed to be pissed at the shitty tooling microsoft pushes on people
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> kek now im getting c++ ads on yotube
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> time to learn c++
19:15 < Ryozuki> :justatest:
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> didn't work
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769248129388118076/unknown.png
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok i got past the memset not found thing
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> now what
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> now see the callstack
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then u know why it crashed
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ddnet wont even run
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it says that first
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i couldnt run asan with gcc, it also crashed directly, so dunno xd
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cant @Learath2 just build you a debug executable
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I broke mine too, been trying to get it to build again for the last hour
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh xD
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis more info when you click on details?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or can you ignore it with the checkmark?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah i ignored it
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hopefully it doesnt implode my laptop or something
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but ddnet runs
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> great, then get it to hang like before I guess
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok its spazzing out what do i do, do i pause it?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> like the ddnet froze and all that
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no asan error written?
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> where do i look for thaat
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in the vs output probably
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bottom right
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769250103113941063/unknown.png
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk what this is
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can you upload the whole output?
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> sec
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well it keeps spamming that if i freeze or not
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> even when im on main menu
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> might be that stuff from earlier
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> oh
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> call stack for one of them?
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/769250739783467028/unknown.png
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> this is call stack when client is freezing
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well its paused rn
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but no call stack of the Access violation?
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but thats not the crash 😄
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well now he already ignored it xD
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think the access thing is because i ignored the memset thing
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk arent there call stack graphics stuff there? it could be that
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if it would crash there it'd be easy to reproduce on linux
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they question is, what memset fails potentially
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the memset could e.g. be inside the intel driver xd
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is the client not crashing with opengl 3.3 @louis ?
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you mentioned smth like that
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye its harder to get it to freeze
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but i remember it freezing sometimes it hink
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah sounds alot like a overflow somewhere
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i wonder what happens if i just comment out random things and see if it works
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ would these things help https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Debugging_Tools ?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> most are outdated and dont show useful stuff, the best (renderdoc) only works with gl 3.3
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe the nvidia and amd tools are good... but wont work on intel
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> OMG
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I did it
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis you could try disabling some things like antiping and cl_predict 0
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i will after i eat, brb
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 ?
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> btw, i couldnt reproduce at the same spot same map on LAN while it almost always worked on the ddnet srv, so it *might* be serverside but idk
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think it's timing related
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so one thread has to write garbage just at the correct time
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> gfx_asyncrender_old 0 might fix it then
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I got it building with asan, I got it running with asan
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not sure if it worked though 😛
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it might be prediction related. Seems to happen when louis jumped through freeze
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I set LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=true on Linux and can feel a short hang every time I jump throuhg freeze
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not visible in fps graph, so might be related
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay it doesn't work, it slows down the executable alright but it doesn't report anything ever
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis tried vsync on?
19:55 < Ryozuki> Learath2 maybe the ddnet is perfect
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ryozuki I thought so too, so I added a bug, that didn't show up either
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok im back
20:10 < Ryozuki> hi back im dad
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Make a vote in announcements for channel to post "looking for teammate" messages
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @deen still crashes with cl_predict 0 and antiping off
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> kek
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its that one specific spot in the map
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ill record a short vid
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> hi dad im banned   ... oh wait, that's you. :kek:
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Attaching and editing stuff on the forum is a real pain btw. Attachments randomly get lost.

20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> only some parts freeze me (at the end of this clip i got frozen)
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> forum is dead
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> maybe it's consistent? X amount of time, X amount of time through freeze
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> maybe it's consistent? X amount of time, X amount of times through freeze
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no if i just join at the start and jump thru that part it freezes too
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> only thing consistent so far is location
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ill see if it crasshes if i spec it
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye it does, if i go into spec and put my spec camera around that area it crashes as well
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> where to post mapres then jao?
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> #showroom
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen can you dig deeper into it, bcs i cannot repr, maybe its some prediction code that is brokenß
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen can you dig deeper into it, bcs i cannot repr, maybe its some prediction code that is broken?
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> stuff just gets lost in the mess of showroom.
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> more people will see it than the 3 people who still use forum
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> forum is good tho
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its neatly searchable + alr has a bunch
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> id post it in both
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if u cant attach maybe try creating an imgur album or smth
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis ur video is broken for me xD
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'll just download it xD
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok seems like discord is broken
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I overwrite 1000 bytes on the stack and this program doesn't crash
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> @louis try going spec and looking around the rest of the map, make sure it's only that spot, you're getting closer to the starting line, which I noticed would cause me to freeze for a split second (same with the finish line)
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> but, it would only happen when I ran over them, which you're not
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe the demo recorder?
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Yea, maybe that issue I had was related to the video recorder client, I don't remember it happening to me recently
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Skeith just crasshed
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> which he apparently is on the demo recorder client
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> specced around the map befrehand, didnt rly freeze
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> which i think is the issue, cause i was having weird freezing issues as well when i used it in the past
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> isnt video recorder in normal steam
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> is it?
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> should
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Oh yea, true.
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Wonder why it stopped freezing for me then, I'
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Wonder why it stopped freezing for me then, I've only had issues with dummy
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I think @Zukita ? was having issues with crashing as well, somewhat recently
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, I'm done, they just said ASan is supported to gloat, it is not supported at all
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll go drown in sorrow
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh :/
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dr memory is broken af too under windows sadly
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it can't possibly work properly with the hacks msvcrt does
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> set ASAN_OPTIONS= windows_hook_rtl_allocators=true
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> claims this post:
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/addresssanitizer-asan-for-windows-with-msvc/
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> OMG IT WORKED
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what did u do
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I am unsure
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I forced it to link with static msvcrt
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I forced it to link the static versions of the clang_rt pieces
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and I added /fsanitize=address
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then, now we only need to give it louis
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd

23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> whats the current state btw
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> did louis test the build?
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @deen does it mean you have an api for getting player's points?
