10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> do first time 10 second
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> im suggesting add wiki functional to ddnet discord bot
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> like you saying $wiki kog
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and it sends link to page about kog with kog discord link
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> :greenthing:
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> make client for phone and playstation, xbox,...
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> Invade world
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ye this is similar to my idea
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> we could integrate it with wiki pages i guess
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> there is a client for phone
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> not maintained tho
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> and android only
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> iphone = üò¥
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> making something for consoles means get right to use sdk

12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> default one
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @uwu what was your cmake line?
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> i used just cmake .. first
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> and then `cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchains/mingw64.toolchain`
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> but i dont get any files either
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> im on windows 10 btw :kek:
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> cant use visual studio in this situation
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> so using mingw
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ok nvm using msbuild is good solution either
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> @Discord Mod scam link
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> suggestion : add a refresh button for reload mapres
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/874256667338997800/screenshot_2021-08-09_13-42-43.png
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> did you install mingw btw
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> yes
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> toolchain file is meant for crosscompile
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> use Mingw generator from cmake
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> -G "MinGW Makefiles"
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> might be easier to use msys or smth tho, guess they have gcc directly in the path
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Ryozuki\: https://blog.dave.tf/post/ip-addr-parsing/
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> netsecurity gangs  said that go's std and rust's std::net ip parsing is vulnerability
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> netsecurity gangs  said that go's std and rust's std::net ip parsing are vulnerability
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> I want to find out who first entered the team to give him a leader (for example, only the leader will have the rights to click "kill"), if we do this by iterating through the array to find out if it contains this value, will it be adequate?
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/874270926861107240/unknown.png
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> netsecurity gangs  said that go's std and rust's std::net ip parsing functions are vulnerability
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> leader?
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> oh ok i got it
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> u can add var to team that will indicate who is leader
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> it will represent his id
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> who will enter first - leader
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> the problem is to detect first players nobo
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> to find out who entered first, the easiest thing is to make a loop through the array, will this solution be acceptable for a pull request?
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you can do two things:
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> for-cycle
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> or
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> refactor CteamsCore
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> `int CGameTeams::Count(int Team) const`
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> if Count(team) == 1
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu>     leader = true;
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkalaugh:
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> a loop through all teams sounds fine I think
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Careful, there is no guarantee this change would be accepted. If you don't want to work for no reason maybe you should create an issue for discussion first
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkaS:
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye ips are wacky

21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Does anyone have some knowledge on gobjects?

22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Two Zero> How do i make my LAN server public for my friends?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> sv_register 1
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> in config or in f2
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> in config or in f2 console
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Two Zero> Ok ty
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> no, sv_register is not for lan servers
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> afaik
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> they should see it in the lan tab without
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> `How do i make my LAN server public`

22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> there was an issue before with icons and everything
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> dont know what happened ot it
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkalaugh:
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> #3655
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> #3836

22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3836
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> how many requests of servers.json can i ask form the master?
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I've designed icons for something like that a while ago, just the guy who was gonna code it disappeared or something
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkaS: disappeared
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I still have them if somebody is down to code it
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I would appreciate if u will send them to me and i will try to add them
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @uwu  it was never decided what the layout/resolution should be so here's a random one for now
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/874407038950719558/icons.png
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> okay, thx :D
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> btw no hook hit/no hammer hit/ no shotgun hit. and etc. Is controlled by 1 tile
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> On that screenshot i decided to draw them as 1 title "No hits"
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> no hook is a separate one and other weapons are a setting on no hammer tile
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> oh, there are settings for it? :o
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you can disable it with switch
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> shotgun/grenade/laser
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> if you give a number to no hammer tile on switch layer then it has different effects
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Okay, i just will render it as 1 title if all are disabled
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> explain this, I think my wiki summary of it is incomplete then
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I don't remember exactly but I think 0 disables hit on all weapons and 1-4 are shotgun/nade/laser
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh ok I have that
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I thought it was something hammer specific I didn't know about lol
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> idk tbh, maybe it is
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well it sounds like something that should be a thing
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I tested the weapons for each ID and added to the wiki
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> is there really no thingy exclusive to hammer then?
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no it includes it
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I think default and ID 1 is for hammer
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> rest of the weapons after
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it would make sense if 1 is only for hammer
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or is default no hit for all
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> can't rmbr
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think 0/default is for all
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> would make sense
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I need to expand the map layers a bit
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> into individual pages, then reference them
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> there are nuances in each layer that are worth explaining in new pages
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> like how tune zones ignore global tune, some things aren't in front layer, things that have to be in switch to work properly vs ones that can be in any
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> what do you guys think about solving #3878 with /team -1 that invites player to first enpty team?
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3878
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> empty
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you could also write about stuff that doesn't have to be in switch layer but can be for extra functionality
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I don't think /team -1 would be obvious to players. it is to us because programmers
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it should be a new command
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> too much sugar then
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> /nextteam /new team /randomteam
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I don't think it's a big deal
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its like 50-100 lines of code
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> /emptyteam is also good
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> when this thingie adds only two xd
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> why can't it be moved to a file to dedup
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh wait cpp makes that annoying
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> remove cop
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> remove cpp
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i mena not only /team -1
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> sounds like another cryptic command that you find out from someone after years of playing, like /mapinfo {map} or /top5 {number}
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you can write any invalid team and it will invite you
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> just support a keyword then
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> /team empty is the best solution probably
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but conflicts with another issue
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> it can't be handled that way
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or comment in that issue I think
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> someone wants /team [name]
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> why
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> why not
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> we already have /invite player
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you still have to enter the number
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and it should work for unlocked teams
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> what number tho
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> whatever number the player that invited you is in
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> can't you pass nickname here
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> can you? I've never tried
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i think i did
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but i don't remember
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> in that case it makes more sense to allow it to non-lockef as well
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> even easier to impl
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> in that case it makes more sense to allow it to non-locked as well
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ye
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> try it on a server
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I won't start ddnet right now
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and actually I'm going back to work lol
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> anyway adding new command like/emptyteam without wiki state about server commands is useless
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> because anyway new players will know it from old olayers
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> im in bed rn
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lol
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Im in bad too
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I don't think relying on players to point it out is good. just make a note of it in news and change log
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Im in bed too
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it can be any syntax really as long as it's obvious
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Same bed:monkalaugh:
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> note that we have pages for server client console commands
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> shouldn't we have it for chat commands too
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> we both know only like 10% uses that xd
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I mean it's in the page
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> I think it's convenient to join by nickname, and in some cases, I also thought about it. /teamrandom or /teamempty also sounds good, but is it really necessary? even when connected, the dummy will be used rarely, and it is not so difficult to enter a number
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> bcs players use chat instead of console
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> doesn't mean that random team is a bad idea, maybe some will like having a new color every time
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> sometimes its really annoying when you try to enter your favourite teams and they're all locked
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> also it guarantees that it's not someone else's bind even tho it's rare, so what's wrong with thay
