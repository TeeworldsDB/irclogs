03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> wtf i found that bug
03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how can this actually be fixed tho
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i guess making it understand escape characters? but then people can just add those to their names too
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> add whisper id command
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ig thatd work
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> or u can escape the escape character
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> then they can put 2 escape characters in a row
03:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> escape characters arent designed to prevent intentional trolling
03:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> does anyone actually play with quotes b4 name
03:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just implement whisperid and itll fix for the 1 case in all of ddnet
05:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> then you put 4 escape characters
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> who came up with zsh?
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it should be illegal to write such shitty documentation
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 😅
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> use fish, the friendly interactive shell 🙂
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why, do people even come up with new shells?
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bash works completely fine
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 fish has automatic r-search 🙂
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when you type a command you have typed before, it's a simple ctrl-f away (it's nice for interactive use)
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (and it has the paradigm that you don't need to configure anything for it to work well)
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm fine with ^R
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is kinda "how can you say this?" when you have never seen or experienced the other thing ^^
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's more don't fix what's not broken
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that attitude would help a java developer to never discover that functional programming also has benefits
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> modern java has a lot of the useful parts of functional programming
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because some java programmers did research functional programming and figured that it would be useful to add to java
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wait, you're on mac, right? I think mac has an ancient version of bash, too
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes, they deprecated it...
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so now I'm setting up zsh, one painful 50 minute google search at a time
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> use fish? ^^ no setup needed
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> "Web Based configuration" and "Try in browser" scares me very much
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that you *can* try it in the browser scares you? ^^
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can completely configure it from the command line, I never configured anything from a browser
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't even know how to open that settings browser
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes, I'm very much hoping they compiled it to js with emscripten and it's not coded in asm.js or something
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> C++
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, I guess it deserves a try
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I have to google for 50 minutes to customise my ps1 again, I'll download powershell instead
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to spare you the surprise: it's not POSIX-compliant. `(command)` instead of `"$(command)"` (and the quoting rules are a bit more sane)
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what do you need in your PS1? 🙂
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it has user, host, cwd, git branch, return value != 0 by default
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need my own PS1
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want my own colors
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `[user@host] cwd [return] prompt`
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. okay. I don't know how configurable the PS1 is, it probably is
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't mind some git status at the very start
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well we'll see in a couple minutes
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#prompt
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, the configuration looks saner then zsh atleast
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> apparently fish can't use the old style of 256 colors
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I'll have to convert colours, but this makes me wonder, why do people keep breaking things that aren't broken?
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you elaborate what you mean by "old style of 256 colors"? @Learath2
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like the actual set of 256 colors supported by most of the terminals, that were defined since at least 1999
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is quite a fluid experience I must admit
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 you ever use funced?
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 no, I used funcsave in the past
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> used to export a function from the local environment into the global
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 have a question about funced?
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes, it won't work
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If i use it with EDITOR=vim or with -e vim, it doesn't even open anything
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let me check
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well it seems to open a vim but it's dead, somehow?
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if I :q enter it quits the vim it didn't open
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> meh, it works for me, that makes it a bit harder to debug
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you tried a different editor yet?
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes, it won't work with any
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nor does it work with other terminal emulators
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eh
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does it work with `funced -e fish`
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ?
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well atleast it displays the function
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's pretty broken though, it is scrolled all the way down, if you try to scroll up it breaks the entire display
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you open `vim` in that shell at all?
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (without funced)
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep, works perfectly fine
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `type funced` gives you the source code of funced
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it also only opens the editor in a non-fancy way
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't even know what to look at
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> me neither
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, `eval vim .bashrc` doesn't work for me
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what is that supposed to mean?
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eval vim doesn't work either
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmmm
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eval vim should work
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eval should just allow a variable to be used as a command IIRC
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eval nano also is broken
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> compare eval env with env plz
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> compare `eval env` with `env` plz
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no difference at all
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eval vim works perfectly fine in bash, so it's a fish thing
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll compile fish from source, maybe that'll help
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm sorry, I see why you would abandon fish at this point ^^
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet it's some macOS quirk anyway
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess if I can't modify fish_git_prompt I'll just trim the whitespace afterwards 😛
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#autoloading-functions
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can put the function there `~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish`
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's an adventure for tomorrow, already spent 2 hours on setting up my shell
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just did a `| string trim`
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 any interesting plugins for fish?
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the reason I picked fish is because I didn't want to add any plugins
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's supposed to work out of the box. I didn't research plugins
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you have a suggestion, you can use ctrl+f to complete it, or ctrl-rightarrow to complete the next word
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> my parsing fails on some old maps, where the speedup layer data block doesnt have the expected size
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> as far as i know speeups require 6 bytes for each tile, in those maps however, there are only 4 bytes for each tile (if you want an example map: `ze_Gold Rush_8ab831ee.map` from heinrich5991s collection
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> can anyone tell me whats up there?
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> it happens on quite a lot of maps
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why u use fish?
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never had problems with bash, and i tried zsh but its just overkill
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because I like the completions @Ryozuki
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also have completions
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```sh
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> # enable programmable completion features (you don't need to enable
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> # this, if it's already enabled in /etc/bash.bashrc and /etc/profile
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> # sources /etc/bash.bashrc).
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if ! shopt -oq posix; then
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>   if [ -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>   elif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     . /etc/bash_completion
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>   fi
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fi
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fish has completions as you type
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> without pressing tab
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont like that
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fine, but you asked me why I use fish
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's why
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i also wanted to know learath
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Patiga ze_* doesn't sound like a ddnet map
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why fish and not zsh tho
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because zsh was a configuration nightmare apparently (scroll up)
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i could dig up many more map names if that helps
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are there any that sound like ddrace maps?
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `koule3_fac7db22.map`
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki bash is deprecated on macOS, might aswell try something new
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> deprecated???
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bash is getting updates
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Patiga yea, sounds ddrace-ish
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki system bash isn't, I think
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> macOS isn't getting any of them
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Patiga I'll bisect
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> because they moved to zsh, but zsh is a PITA
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Patiga still in a lecture though
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like a bold move by macos
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> trying to deprecate the most famous shell
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga hm, does it work in modern ddnet clients?
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> koule3 is included in ddnet btw
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> lemme check
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but is it that exact version?
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> is loading in the editor and for a server smth different?
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> or is that exchangable?
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not same
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> eh
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> different code paths
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki it's the apple way, break compatibility at every single step, leave programmers and developers baffled, call it an improvement and your fanboys won't even complain
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> wtf that koule map is actually a skynet map o.o
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well it shouldn't even load well in editor if it's broken?
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 wdym by system bash
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki well, you can still install any software you like on a mac
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> including a modern bash
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but they deprecate it cuz they want not cuz its a outdated software
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes you can, it'll probably break at every step of the way because of conflicts with the system one
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the map gets succesfully loaded by the server as well as the editor
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they are probably planning to make the system bash interactive in a couple major versions
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> non-interactive*
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah well
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but the speedup layer is empty
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga interesting, so it's the wrong amount of bytes per tile but it works?
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, the speedup layer is indeed broken though 😄
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it is another artifact remaining from ddrace -> ddnet
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not sure if it still compiles but you could compile ddrace and try loading it there 🙂
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh ye, i could also check out that repository
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I found the commit
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 4 bytes you say?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i always somehow thought that ddnet just build upon ddrace and ddrace just sorta vanished so i just need to check out ddnet's repo^^
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ye
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye, that's true I think
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> re ddnet vs ddrace
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> maybe some aligning going on with a short
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes yes
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> could you share the commit?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, bit slow
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just had to do something in the uni exercise class
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 20930ce68bc8b7648307d149caaf8ba73de12d80
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> all good
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you happen to know how fish enables ls colors?
13:53 <@Learath2> ah it's a function
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `type ls`
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `man <fish-builtin>` also works btw
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a feature I sorely miss in bash
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `man cd` e.g.
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well man ls wouldn't work would it?
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> class CSpeedupTile
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> {                
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> public:
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga>     unsigned char m_Force;
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga>     unsigned char m_MaxSpeed;
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga>     unsigned char m_Type;
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga>     short m_Angle;
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> };
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the `m_type` is probably for extendability, so you could add similar tiles?
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably, I don't think we use `m_Type` yet
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> 👍
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so it's uninitialized? or is it 0?
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah no it's not
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we do use it
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i can check in maps, though i guess it should be 28
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's always supposed to be TILE_BOOST for now
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> uh whats tile_boost?
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> there already is `m_Force`, those sounds pretty similar
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 28
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ye ok, that matches up with its index in the speedup layer png
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://wiki.ddnet.tw/game-tiles/speedup/ :)
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice layer 😄
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually don't understand this code at all
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why don't the tiles inherit from CTile?
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the tiles are separate for speedup etc. layer
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they don't have rotation etc.
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why isn't the tile part just generic though, these are all tile layers
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I don't quite follow
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the speedup layer data is in a different position than the normal tileset data
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 as in the final datafile?
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> its the index pointing to the data block has a different position in the  item_data
15:26 <+Konsti> DDNet RUS on 83% RAM and big laggy? Is it an attack?
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Konsti: doesn't look like an attack to me
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 is it possible to get teehistorian2demo to output to stdout?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> USAGE:
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     teehistorian2demo <TEEHISTORIAN> [DEMO]
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `./teehistorian2demo <TEEHISTORIAN> /dev/stdout`
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> really? I don't think that'd work
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that works for all the unix commands
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unless I did something wrong, it should work for my program, too
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```ddnet bin/teehistorian2demo 9ed38e1c-3005-40b2-9c0f-8eb5ac6c0c73.teehistorian /dev/stdout
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 9ed38e1c-3005-40b2-9c0f-8eb5ac6c0c73.teehistorian: Io(Os { code: 13, kind: PermissionDenied, message: "Permission denied" })```
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so I did something wrong, nice
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which makes sense to me, tbh, root owns that device
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> echo abc | tee /dev/stdout
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `tee: /dev/stdout: Permission denied`
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> linux distro?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, macos
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Debian
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's on ddnet.tw
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, maybe I wrongly assumed that this is available on all systems
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try `echo abc | tee /proc/self/fd/1`
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/51184ae37e0518fd90cb437a2fbc953ae558cd0d/Documentation/admin-guide/devices.rst#compulsory-links
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to be in the tty group to handle input like this
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `tee: /proc/self/fd/1: Permission denied`
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> because `lrwx------ 1 teeworlds teeworlds 64 Apr 28 17:15 /proc/self/fd/1 -> /dev/pts/0` => `crw--w---- 1 root tty 136, 0 Apr 28 17:15 /dev/pts/0`
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but if you redirect stdout, then it's no longer that tty
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `echo abc | tee /dev/stderr 2> /tmp/rrrrr` works
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so does
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `echo abc | tee /dev/stdout | cat`
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it'd work with php's passthru aswell, but I guess you might want to change that in the future to use a - for stdout like other unix programs?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds good
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> although
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that gives a special case for files called `-`
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well you could also try to detect whether you are being piped
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's even less portable though
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> would a `--stdout` flag satisfy you? or is it too non-standard?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't quite mind either way
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe just output to stdout if there is no [FILE] passed?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh yea, that would work
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> binary data into stdout is a less then pleasant experience but it's what everyone except xz does
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, but it has bad UX when you just type the command
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm really trying hard to keep this all in php, but I so want to use ajax 😛
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I know you're strong, you'll do it!
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 😛
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> meh, it works, it looks sorta ugly but I guess this is the best we can do without js
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sorta works?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/704720735255527474/Screenshot_2020-04-28_at_18.48.17.png
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have the header `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`?
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yay it works
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you think maybe I should send a chunk early on to trigger the download start?
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how would you do this?
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd send the header, I'd send TWDEMO, i'd flush
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, sure 🙂
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you maybe tell php to flush the headers?
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> would be less hacky
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can, but I'm not completely sure that alone would trigger a download
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> let me check
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, wait if I start it early, idk how I'd fail it if we can't manage to get the file from the backend
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, how fast do you know whether it's a success or not?
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the download and the decompression take a while
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> both can fail
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tbh teehistorian2demo can also fail, but I can't signify that either
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, maybe if I kill the connection it'd fail the download?
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, I'll have to handle the chunking by hand then
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's good enough for now
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> new osx update, new xcode breakage \o/
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @heinrich5991 what about players-cache python3
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I'll have to take another 3 month break as macOS compilation is broken again
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> bug: tabbing into ddnet fullscreened while watching a video crashes game, freezes computer
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also i get tons of random visual bugs, not sure why. would be open to debug w someone
