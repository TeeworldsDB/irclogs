07:08 < bridge> <pioooooo> this is still shown ingame
07:11 < bridge> <Ewan> gm
07:12 < bridge> <Ewan> just used nix to migrate my entire Minecraft server in one swoop
08:37 < bridge> <Assa> ide with graphics and fluff, but I was annoyed by it
08:37 < bridge> <Assa> gm ^^
09:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Migrate where @mpft
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> from aws to a server of a friend's
10:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** a
10:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i thought like from bukkit to spigot or some shit xd
10:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** was so confused
10:09 < bridge> <Ewan> nah
10:09 < bridge> <Ewan> it's on paper tho
10:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** paper BTW
10:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** sori i old man
10:09 < bridge> <Ewan> true
10:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** whats my age?
10:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** !roll 1 100
10:09 < chillerbot123> 28
10:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** leak
10:09 < bridge> <Ewan> generous
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> it was previously running in ec2 so I just had to remove the import for the AMI specific config and add qemu the qemu, and it took 3 commands to deploy onto an existing server that had ubuntu on it
10:12 < bridge> <Ewan> used nixos-anywhere to do a remote installation & kept all of the configuration declarative
10:13 < bridge> <Ewan> reimaged the vps with probe hardware for the target server, install nixos, rsync world folder
10:14 < bridge> <Ewan> those commands being* probe hardware for the target server, install nixos, rsync world folder
10:14 < bridge> <Ewan> all the config is the same
10:14 < bridge> <Ewan> it was previously running in ec2 so I just had to remove the import for the AMI specific config and add the qemu guest one, and it took 3 commands to deploy onto an existing server that had ubuntu on it
10:14 < bridge> <Ewan> holy fk
10:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yea idk about nix and it sounds cool and all but if i migrate a mc server from ec2 to another provider i do ``git push`` and ``git pull`` and am done xd
10:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if the world is too fat for git i do good ol ``rsync``
10:36 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon do you have time to look over the envelope sync fix? I put very much time into it yesterday to get it perfectly ._.
10:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes im about to do it
10:41 < bridge> <Assa> calculates envelope times in nanoseconds, backend uses ms :pepeW:  nah I'll rewrite this as well soon
10:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** guys the filter is so hard
10:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** what about some "%d servers are hidden because of your filters" thingy somewhere at the end of the serverlist
10:45 < bridge> <Assa> chat filter or what?
10:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** master
10:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** especially with "no login required" on by default
10:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** half ddnet things kog shutdown
10:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thinks*
10:46 < bridge> <Assa> for me this never turned on? ü§î
10:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** must be your hack client
10:47  * bridge <Assa> Nightly
10:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** there is so many options to filter and exclude and they can even be hidden if you change your view
10:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** accidental filtering is a real problem
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> I only filter by country
10:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** omg how to join kog with ddnet client
10:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i cant test ur pr without my password manager xd
10:48 < bridge> <Assa> yeah exactly, that's why I gave you the task xD
10:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** rude
10:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** who hacked me?
10:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** my dyncam is on
10:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i think booting old ass clients did that. Maybe 0.6.5 vanilla has it on by default or sumsin
10:49 < bridge> <Assa> RCE installed, already got your server pw
10:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wtf ``cl_dyncam`` is ``0``
10:50 < bridge> <Assa> it actually has, i can remember this
10:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** is this some goof ah ddnet follow mouse config
10:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oke i just factory reset ü§∑
10:54 < bridge> <Assa> maybe, but sometimes I am just practical.
10:55 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon you should also test the moving freeze quads thing you mentioned with prediction time. The feature uses prediction ticks now, because the normal tick was too unreliable
10:55 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon you should also test the moving freeze quads thing you mentioned with prediction margin. The feature uses prediction ticks now, because the normal tick was too unreliable
10:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i tested with the settings i always play with and it broke ._. 
10:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** no further tests needed
11:00 < bridge> <Assa> oO?
11:00 < bridge> <Assa> you mean the kog thing broke?
11:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yup
11:00 < bridge> <Assa> does it use synced envelopes?
11:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** uhm idk
11:01 < bridge> <Assa> if yes, then the map is broken.
11:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** works in older client tho
11:01 < bridge> <Assa> sync does not mean, to sync with server time. This missconception caused all the problems leading to this feature beeing broken
11:01 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yup all "Sync" is red
11:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** for all envelopes
11:02 < bridge> <Assa> yeah, that's wrong then, because as soon as you hit the startline it resets
11:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** well it used to work
11:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it also prints some kind of delay in chat when hitting start line
11:02 < bridge> <Assa> well before it was broken before
11:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** hm
11:03 < bridge> <Assa> well before it was broken
11:03 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** well as i said one does not simple fix a kog map
11:03 < bridge> <Assa> then get rid of this feature, patch it out entirely
11:03 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and this breaks gameplay in a bunch of maps so you would first have to contact avo and make sure this can be handled correctly
11:03 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** or nobody will update ddnet client
11:03 < bridge> <Assa> avo?
11:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @avolicious
11:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** gigachad of kog
11:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** german qshar
11:04 < bridge> <Assa> you already broke maps when you disabled this feature
11:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** disabled which wot
11:04 < bridge> <Assa> now I unbreak this feature and new maps are broken
11:04 < bridge> <Assa> like what the fuck
11:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes its hot topic
11:04 < bridge> <Assa> sync does currently NOTHING
11:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i hope you knew what you were getting into
11:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ikr
11:05 < bridge> <Assa> synced and unsynced envelopes both just sync with server time.
11:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i assume the estimate pr stale time is at least 6 years xd
11:05 < bridge> <Assa> I am a german, ofc I know what I am getting into, i am going to complain to the manager
11:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** karen ah
11:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** where a deen
11:06 < bridge> <Assa> btw if you unsync the envelopes, it will magically work again
11:06 < bridge> <Assa> because that's similar to the old behavior
11:06 < bridge> <Assa> and if you unsync the envelopes, old clients work as well
11:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** well i pinged avo
11:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** let him comment
11:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lemme predict his answer: "why ping me i do not do maps please delete my number! also dont break the client wtf we used it like that for years"
11:09 < bridge> <Assa> @0xdeen either we fix envelope sync, or I am going to remove the feature entirely because it has no purpose. I just need a clarification
11:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lmao he really did the "i need a deen" move
11:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** there is no way he will answer
11:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wanna ping heinrich as well? xd
11:10 < bridge> <Assa> heinrich even suggested stopping envelopes before hitting the start
11:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa u need to write that on github
11:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar
11:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** omg i dont have his name in backlog
11:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** assa sos help me ping josspit
11:11 < bridge> <Assa> @jupeyy_keks
11:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thanks
11:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** jopsti you have 24h to click merge on #10128 or i will delete your maintainer role
11:11 < chillerbot123> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10128
11:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** omg fixing the stale pr issue is harder than i thought
11:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** can we give assa maintainer pls
11:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and kebs
11:19 < bridge> <Assa> why do I need maintainer if you can merge yourself?
11:19 < bridge> <Assa> I'd understand if this is your own issue
11:19 < bridge> <Assa> I'd understand if this would be your own issue
11:21 < bridge> <Aoe> @chillerdragon 
11:21 < bridge> <Aoe> There won't be any progress on this unless a maintainer approves it on the Github issue. Is there still need for more discussion? I can open a town-hall thread, if more opinions are needed. But it currently has 11 likes, which is the highest I've ever seen on Github.
11:21 < bridge> <Aoe> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9845
11:23 < bridge> <Aoe> Been using it for about a month now, and I can never go back to not using it...

11:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa it is a user facing change. It needs approval from two maintainers. I as pleb new maintainer can not just yolo it in especially if josspit had critical comments.
11:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i would have to farm deen status first to merge stuff without looking left or right xd
11:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Aoe I am maintainer since like 2 days I am not a bigwig yet. I do not feel comfortable approving it. Especially because I am not fully aware of the technical details. I rather look into other pending things first.
11:39 < bridge> <Assa> I don't know the maintainer rules, but then okay I guess. What qualifies as a user facing change? If I update rendering it's also user facing xD
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> starting to look like a real shell

11:54 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> @ryozuki good morning :3
11:54 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> quick question
11:54 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> do i just use the `wayland` flag for packages with this issue? https://bugs.gentoo.org/958957
11:54 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> Ghostty breaks with `-wayland` :angy:
11:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Aoe I took some time to at least write a detailed comment. Might help ü§∑
11:54 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> but me no want unneccessary stuff
11:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa yea idk somehow everything is user facing. I have some vague defintion in my head. Like something a user can notice change and can complain about. Or a clear new feature. Or a change of a old one.
11:57 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon are you unsure about #10690 ?
11:57 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10690
11:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah i guess, or dont use ghostty use alacritty
11:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** I would just yolo merge it in but I could see rossbit nitpicking every single line, cuz its what he does xd
11:58 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> hmm true, both are gpu accellerated anyway
11:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use alacritty
11:59 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> this looks more like something Juppey may look at and say "mmmmmmmmmmmm meh"
11:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> and now edos shell
11:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa i am not comfortable enough yet looking at the diff and seeing that this did not add any bugs
11:59 < bridge> <Assa> In this case I am pretty confident, it's also tested and it makes sense logically and it also clears a bit of ram, big :justatest:
11:59 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** then use !merge
11:59 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> :justatest:
12:00 < bridge> <Assa> ?
12:00 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> i thought these commands can only be triggered by maintainers Chiller
12:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa i dare you to write !merge in this chat if you have balls

12:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lmao
12:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xxxxxxxD
12:05 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** shit missed opportunity
12:06 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** the bot is a bit rigged ngl
12:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** some features dont work from discord. Some rng is rigged. The bash interpreter is fake. The merge is fake.
12:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** useful af
12:07 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ok back to closing prs
12:11 < bridge> <Assa> the reminder tool is cool, would be happy if you'd iterate on it

12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @blaiszephyr i finally fixed the ffmpeg stuff, but now i am blocked on a new wasmer release, bcs rust changed some linker internals üòÇ:
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/143835
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So hopefully next week it builds again
12:25 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> :POGGIES:  awesome
12:25 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> when i'm done with gentoo setup i'll do redo the envelope editor changes
12:26 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> this time a little more ‚≠ê proper ‚≠ê
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `export LIBCLANG_PATH=${MSYS2_LOCATION}/mingw64/bin`
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This was most likely the fix btw
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Either mingw changed or the windows CI changed
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> apparently it found the libclang shiped by the windows CI from gh
12:26 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> oh.. weird that msvc threw the same error tho
12:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it was a bit different i think
12:27 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> both failed on the ffmpeg build because c++, so i figured i initially thought its an upstream issue XD
12:27 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> both failed on the ffmpeg build because c++, so  i initially thought its an upstream issue XD
12:33 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> but ye, Ryo - i'm enjoying my time in gentoo
12:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr whats left

13:58 < bridge> <robyt3> I assume you have a skin with that name in your `skins` folder, which is not loaded due to the name being too long
14:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @robyt3 yes looks like it.. but why would i have that skin??? xd
14:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @pioooooo:

14:33 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> yeah i unmounted the other 2 for now
14:33 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> my HDD is not needed as it only contains games, and the other SSD currently holds windoof
14:33 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> my HDD is not needed as it only contains games atm, and the other SSD currently holds windoof
14:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> imagine not using english locale
14:43 < bridge> <remakepower> Wow
14:43 < bridge> <remakepower> Gentoo
14:44 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> de superiority
14:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> an os for people with nasa pcs
14:45 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> I can imagine llvm taking 3 days to build on my laptop for sure
14:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kollpotato u have potato pc?
14:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> no i have pro laptop
14:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> with intel cpu graphics
14:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** gamer
14:46 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes
14:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @robyt3 I have no skin called heinrich in ~/.teeworlds/skins <:tee_thinking:478629518358085653>
15:01 < bridge> <learath2> Frieren bg, no wayland, no systemd. Very based setup so far
15:02 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> :Prayge:  limine bootloader, xfs fs
15:02 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> -wayland use flag
15:02 < bridge> <learath2> I'm still very skeptical of y'alls xfs pick
15:02 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> xd
15:02 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> xfs is gentoo's default
15:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I use debian btw
15:05 < bridge> <remakepower> arch is also similar.
15:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> what is wrong with wayland
15:07 < bridge> <learath2> Weird governance, half assed backwards compatibility through xwayland, and finally vsync
15:07 < bridge> <learath2> It's systemd but for display servers
15:08 < bridge> <learath2> It's the systemd of display servers
15:08 < bridge> <kollpotato> systemd is not perfect but it works
15:09 < bridge> <learath2> That must be rather new btw. I remember the handbook suggesting ext4 until at least 2 years ago or so
15:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wat is a xfs (sent from my debian gnome desktop)
15:09 < bridge> <Assa> @robyt3 can you requeu #10688
15:09 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10688
15:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fakin github
15:09 < bridge> <learath2> I will not be commenting on this so as not to spawn the systemd knights
15:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> this channel has seen much worse
15:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i couldnt care less about systemd smh
15:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah its just an init system
15:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> which does 50x more than init
15:12 < bridge> <learath2> I love systemd, please dont kill my family
15:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** I love bigd
15:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> big data?
15:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes
15:12 < bridge> <remakepower> ü§î
15:12 < bridge> <learath2> You say that as if that's a good thing
15:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> no i dont say anything
15:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> suckless community hates it
15:13 < bridge> <learath2> I've said too much already. There are resources if you seek the truth
15:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> there is no truth anywhere
15:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> only opinions
15:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** one day ill switch to suckless tw client written in a single C file
15:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> u already have an assembly one
15:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** no config or console... just recompile duh
15:13 < bridge> <learath2> Now I'll need to go into hiding, lay low for a while
15:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kollpotato but the assembly client is bad for gaming
15:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** no gfx or mouse support
15:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** im not doing graphics in assembly ._.
15:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> mouse sucks
15:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> all vim enjoyers only use keyboard
15:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ok mr hjkl gores gaming pro
15:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> and gfx is too expensive
15:15 < bridge> <kollpotato> u did gores on touchpad xd
15:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** still a mouse :p 
15:15 < bridge> <learath2> Do ascii art gfx backend
15:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but i am indeed a touchpad gamer
15:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 already kinda did
15:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.b1250869-79cc-43c7-bd5e-dfc2488497fa.png
15:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** u recognize the map? xd
15:16 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> LINEAR
15:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd no
15:16 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> idk you're leaking AB output so one of your servers
15:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** <:justatest:572499997178986510>
15:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ye its my fng srv so its basically top right of ctf5
15:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** left*
15:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i think xd
15:17 < bridge> <learath2> Wym antibot, does mr no bans ban people for botting???
15:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** no
15:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** only shame
15:17 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> no he publicly shames them
15:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you can see guts being shamed
15:17 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> as seen in the server message
15:17 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> XD
15:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** im cyber bully like that
15:17 < bridge> <remakepower> ü§î Is that pure ctf5 map?
15:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** nah
15:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its some fng edit
15:17 < bridge> <learath2> You know what, I wonder if calling their mothers names would work better than bans
15:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @remakepower but the ascii renderer is severly bugged
15:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** might as well let LLM hallucinate an image
15:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 bans bad
15:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but i do indeed sometimes ban
15:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but i also deep freeze and kick a lot
15:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** my mods love banning ._.
15:19 < bridge> <remakepower> Is the dark grey part is unhookable?
15:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i think so yes
15:19 < bridge> <remakepower> Hm
15:20 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> hi yes i'm mod who bans
15:20 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> well, depends - i also usually pubclicly shame them before
15:20 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> but then i get a "fuck your mother" in cyrillic
15:20 < bridge> <Obliterator¬≤> :Shruggo:
15:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> wow u must get paid a lot do so much
15:20 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.a8b572f4-d152-423a-9e23-67609ab33160.png
15:20 < bridge> <Assa> Wtf? But your mother is such a nice person! :justatest:
15:21 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** seems to be right side not left
15:21 < bridge> <Assa> no this is clearly the left side
15:21 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** it usually also shows tees as ``o``
15:21 < bridge> <Assa> you are missing the bottom there
15:21 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but it got bugged away
15:21 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** same as half of the map xd
15:21 < bridge> <remakepower> Where is the `o`
15:21 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa arent u render layer pro?
15:21 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** go fix my code
15:21 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thanks
15:22 < bridge> <Assa> Currently working on making the map rendering able to be standalone
15:22 < bridge> <kollpotato> better than twgpu
15:22 < bridge> <Assa> if this is done it should be easy peasy to inline into console
15:22 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** epic
15:24 < bridge> <Assa> guys we are very close to an editor integration of rendering :owo:
15:28 < bridge> <pioooooo> done
15:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thanks @pioooooo 
15:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** road to 69 prs
15:31 < bridge> <Assa> Today I am impressed, usually sunday is merge day :deen_star:
15:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** chilor mainter every day merge day
15:32 < bridge> <Assa> Assa contrib every day PR day
15:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ono
15:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** bbut 69 prs
15:32 < bridge> <Assa> oh yes, maybe I should throttle in and out in order to keep 69
15:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ur prs so hard ._.
15:33 < bridge> <Assa> too big or too technical? :justatest:
15:33 < bridge> <Assa> the hardest one so far from my POV was the shader one
15:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** too hard to merge
15:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** #10679 will be stale forever
15:33 < chillerbot> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10679
15:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** called it in 2025 already mark my words
15:34 < bridge> <Assa> I just need to ping deen hard enough until he tells me to shut up :owo:
15:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and watafak am i supposed to do with https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9795
15:35 < bridge> <Assa> I tell you now a story, and then you decide if I should close it myself
15:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ono
15:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i dont want to be the feature killer
15:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** this pr is big drama
15:35 < bridge> <Assa> I noticed, that you can create slides with the new speedtiles by setting max_speed to 0
15:35 < bridge> <Assa> I noticed, that you can create slides with the new speedtiles by setting max_speed to 1
15:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** cool story
15:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but no i will not comment
15:36 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** aint no way that you will blame GTA 6 delay on my ass
15:36 < bridge> <Assa> so instead of having this as site-effect-mechanic, I wanted to make them their own tile, before people start spamming new speedtile slides
15:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** interesting thought. Go comment it on gaghob
15:37 < bridge> <Assa> it's hard enough to get new tiles in. I am more in favor of the targets, recorder tiles and tune lock tiles
15:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** o jes
15:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** me 2
15:38 < bridge> <Assa> I wanted to allow the new speedtiles to have max_speed 0 and then they would behave the same as this slides, but this turned out not to work due to the editor bug placing invisible speed tiles
15:38 < bridge> <Assa> I'll revisit this in the future tho
15:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i know dis bug
15:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i bugged many maps with it
15:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** im mapper like that
15:39 < bridge> <Assa> opens old map like Cave 1, why speedtiles everywhere?
15:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ok coffe can not fix sleep deprv anymore im starting to get loony. Time to off the machine. But 69 prs soon. Dw I will fight for what I promised during my election speech!
15:40 < bridge> <Assa> When I wanted to allow max_speed 0 force 0 speedtiles I needed to have this fixed asap, before people start to release maps with new speedtiles and force 0
15:40 < bridge> <Assa> I guess I should close slides
15:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** I DID NOT SAY THAT
15:41 < bridge> <Assa> a dedicated tile with existing functionality would have been nice, but the bug with weak/strong kills it basically
15:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** im gonna get cancled gg
15:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 daily reminder for https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10063

15:52 < bridge> <Assa> how can we push louis to keep working on his fantastic PR?
15:53 < bridge> <Assa> @chillerdragon can you comment on #10556 before it will stay forever open?
15:53 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10556
16:00 < bridge> <learath2> :ganyu_scared:
17:37 < bridge> <robyt3> I agree with https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10556#pullrequestreview-3047988219, this breaks maps for all old clients because of the version check. Either we add a new mapitem alltogether, or a new field. Either the new value is ignored by old clients and they still read the old value, or the new value augments the old value by the milliseconds but the old value still describes the seconds.
17:42 < bridge> <Assa> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10556#issuecomment-3112498668
17:43 < bridge> <Assa> This is the core issue, unsolvable
17:43 < bridge> <robyt3> Either add a new item them or don't change the version, I suppose
17:43 < bridge> <robyt3> Items can also be differentiated by their size, although this seems less clean to me
17:44 < bridge> <robyt3> Either add a new item then or don't change the version, I suppose
