00:46 <+laxa> deen: I have a strange bug, but it's only on windows and I am not playing actually, but you might want to fix it and I might need to make an issue
00:46 <+laxa> but when I change my keyboard layout on windows (french <=> US), it works for typing, not so much for binds
00:47 <+laxa> if I press the Q on my phisical keyboard, it always work even if I change the layout
00:59 <@deen> laxa: Not sure what you mean. but keyboard layouts are ignored for key binds now, we use scancodes directly
00:59 <+laxa> did it changed recently ?
00:59 <+laxa> because it used to work until recently afaik
01:08 <@deen> yes
01:18 <+laxa> then that explains why

18:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> i have a question
18:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> does every server have its own source
18:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> if u make a custom server
18:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> What do you mean?
18:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You don't need to compile sources for every server
18:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I mean, teeworlds-server
22:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It's possible to exclude certain gamemode?
