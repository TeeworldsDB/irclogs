00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> are there some more rules than ingame /rules and ofc the discord rules?
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> all the staff member have their own rules for their own rights right?
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> xd
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> or which rules are we talking about? xD
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i guess mostly the "dont complain publicly about staff members" rule
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> how did this rule get created?
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> welf got cyberbullied? XD
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yes :pepeH:
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> for real thats why? XDD
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> no
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> i could imagine now
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> i could imagine tho
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> mostly to avoid witch hunting and useless drama
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> because it always ends up with 2 sides flaming each other
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> tbh
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> no one follows this rule or even know it exists
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> how would u know
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> lot of ppl complain privately lol
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> probaly because people are lazy af
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> not rly worth always to complain about everyone
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> also public complains are usually made while still mad
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and just random callouts
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> @Learath2 hi bro go %appdata%/teeworlds and send me settings_ddnet.cfg
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> i fucked up mine!!11
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> no u
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> how about
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> rule: dont complain about players in public
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> xD
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> ddos on back in the days everyone saying vali ddosing but hes not
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh no, how dare people think a known ddoser might be the person ddosing
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Have there been any changes to the 45Â° bind (cl_mouse_max_distance 2). At use it feels like there is some kind of prevention forcing you in your position.
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think so, I don't see any commits that touch it
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> i dont feel any changes
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> some friends said they felt the same way idk. Hold down the bind and try to jump to test
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> ?XD
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> The bind works fine
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> nope
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> 11.2.1 ?
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Syltoox> idk if its about the version xD
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :ww:
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I use DDNet 9.4 ofc
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> sometimes it works for me tho. kinda random
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> but the bind even works with vanilla client :danAmazing:
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> is ddnet being ddosed
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> or is spyker crying
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <|UroboroS| Rockus.~> because his inet sucks
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> 10.8.6
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> best
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> whos spyker tho
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont know spyker?
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 11.0.3 is best
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 can i somehow change the address ddnet is getting its updates from? i dont want the updates available button anymore since i dont update to newer than 11.0.3
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can i somehow change the address ddnet is getting its updates from? i dont want the updates available button anymore since i dont update to newer than 11.0.3

01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Dev
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut remove it from the code

01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no I can't
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :/
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't have any tools on windows

01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> anyways
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can ask heinrich maybe
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or just follow his tutorial on the forum
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Delete Windows
02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> then install linux
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Canis Lupus> Use Debian
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Canis Lupus> or use another build system, you don't really need cmake, use Tup
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @jao yo im here sorri was a long night
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and raining
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and no internet connection i wasnt able to pr the anboucne thingy
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol @onby im trying to break ur no sleep records xd
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> good luck

08:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> hope uve got plenty of speed

08:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> oh
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> well any pull requests made past 2-3 days of no sleep are probably not very useful xd
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hehe we will see
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i feel dope
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well a bit dizzy
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i didnt drink or go to toilett or move for 8 hours lol
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> staying hydrated is important especially if ur not sleeping lol
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> was busy chillin in some queue
08:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut it used to be possible, but now the client gets its news, ddnet server list and newest client version all together from https://info.ddnet.tw/info
08:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> where do the messages from modhelp actually go
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess a hidden mod channel
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lel
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @noby you don't want the spam we recieve with /modhelp
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> did u get my message
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut I can't see the version update thing in wine
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but if you're on the 64-bit version of ddnet on windows, try replacing the 85 with a 31 at offset 0x5b911 with a hex editor
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (make a backup first)
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the file `DDNet.exe`
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> eh nvm, this was version 11.2.1
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let me download 11.0.3 (that also explains why I didn't see the version warning)
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut do the same at offset 0x5f8bd
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. change the 85 with a 31 at offset 0x5b911 in `DDNet.exe`, version 11.0.3, with a hex editor
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is A* the best path searching algorithm for 2d?
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's pretty good, depending on what you need
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. on a plan with collision and without teleporters, it's optimal, I think
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *on a plane
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (not for ddnet, its more topdown view)
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> ban 5991 f3 :GWqlabsFeelsGoodMan: :Swordd:
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 what? xD

12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @noby ah the /modhelp channel is gone :0
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. change the 85 with a 31 at offset 0x5f8bd in `DDNet.exe`, version 11.0.3, with a hex editor
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut we figured it out now ðŸ™‚
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what?
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah yes xD
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a hex editor for windows is e.g. http://frhed.sourceforge.net/en/

14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> huh?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Masterizer> Hey guys, did you read what I wrote some days ago about ninslash ?
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> @heinrich5991 if you still didn't find the reason of long connecting, try to check the server time. If the time was changed when game servers were up - it might cause this problem.
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 wasn't the TKEN stuff meant to stup the join flood?
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can't take up a slot until you respond iitc
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's an fng server
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they do it with ddnet aswell
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> you guys found the problem why we cant join ger?Å±
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faceless> Not only get, i cant join rus as well
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> saw one where snail was alone and the rest of the server was flooded
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faceless> Not only ger, i cant join rus as well
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> why the server allowes limited people
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> wth
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> are the ips all from the same type of ranges?
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we can't snap a billion players
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> like server hosting ranges specifically
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> we didnt say a billion, only a few hundred
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> isnt big number
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but then people could just scale the attack up to that number?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i think anyone who can ssh into that server could see which ips are trying to connect in console
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> could be a solution for reboot the system?
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> then it refreshes datas and stuff
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> no
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but in some cases blocking the offending ip ranges in firewall can help
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> is it 100% works or just a tip for faster connecting
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ? im talking about the ddnet rus fng server that seems to be flooded with fake connects
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> oh shit
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> never knew that stuff

16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> @Ryozuki catalonia has a gay flag tho
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ZimE a tool that regenerates the QR codes for the 2 factor auth secrets from the database file
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ezy legends say it was made by a man with 4 fingers in blood on a shield while he was diying
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> reboot the system and delete sytem32 :monkaS:
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> delete system33
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> @Learath2 where you get the databasefile
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> why did he remove links to the discord channel
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> You can download them on ddnet.tw @ZimE
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> from the website
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @worstwish aparently this server and forum is cancer
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ZimE you can get it on a rooted android phone
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> @Learath2 whats the goal with this tool, i dont understand
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Google authenticator makes it pretty hard to move to a new phone
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> there is no catalonia flag in
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> discord
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ezy> disrespect
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so I made a tool that extracts the data
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so I can re-add it on my new phone
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> isnt 2FA optional?
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> optional if you want to get hacked
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 authy is better
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> google auth sucks if u lost mobile and the codes
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but then what's the point of 2fa? if you can restore all your 2fa codes with one username and pw
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> then your security just has one extra password
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know how it works
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Lol if you loose your phone and codes you deserve it xd
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @NeXus shhh no
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> yes
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> github has a no tolerance policy about it
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you lose it they won't help you even if you give them legal id and credit card you used for payment
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> some people on other servers tell me, that there were donations stolen on ddnet, that's why this is happening
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> dont know anything about it, just sayin
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd feel even safer if I could have a device just for 2fa
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> yikes stolen
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> how stolen
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Yuzu no need for conspiracy theories, all donations received and where they go is put up on /funding
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> just transported it from there to here, dunno anything
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> so you know what tees are writing out there
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If any donation was missing on /funding the person who donated would complain, if any of them hadn't went to where they went to we'd have servers shut down because we didn't pay for it
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZimE> just use stronk password, no need 2FA
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well if you use 2fa, even if someone finds your stronk pw you are fine
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> isnt it possible to change to a big hoster like amazon who can scale the power for ddos ?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> AWS isn't cheap
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also game servers don't really scale that easily, can't just load balance ðŸ˜›
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> fix servers
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> why not reboot it
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> what could possibly be worse from it
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> losing data or smth?
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nah
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mostly using active players
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think that rebooting the server will help though
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> nobody have fun right now
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> there just there, cuz they are always there
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yuzu> they are just there, cuz they are always there

17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> did you just fix it or it was automatic
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> w89
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Btw using ddnet 10.8.6 and joined in normal time
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> w8
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> nevermind
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i guess i know my problem
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i have connection lost on some servers which are cannot enter me
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> otherwise there are other servers that can let me join
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> conn_timeout 100
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :feelsamazingman:
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> lol
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :GWokayman: :Pepestanflower:
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Guess i was lucky, cant join anymore xd
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> make a test for try joining to every server
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> idk why i did it , but useful at some point

18:59 <@deen> Yuzu: To clarify about "stolen donations". Everyone who doesn't specify their nickname in the donation gets an email from me asking about how they want to be credited. Some never reply to that email, one had a disabled email account.
19:16 <+o_be_one> (i confirm im in credits since long time!)
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I cant see ger Servers
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :feelsbadman:
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> And cant join ofc
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Is there a ban on 79.210.94.25? :feelsbadman:
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti might just be the general non-connectivity of ddnet servers right now :/

20:05 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #1200: Share libcurl resources across requests (master...pr_ddnet_http_reuse) https://git.io/fNIGP
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 have a bit of time to talk about http masters?
20:30 <+Learath2> sure
20:30 <@heinrich5991> k
20:31 <@heinrich5991> so my current design looks as follows:
20:31 <@heinrich5991> servers register with all master servers, clients check one master server to get all servers
20:31 <@heinrich5991> servers send info to master server, every time it changes (with some backoff, maybe)
20:32 <@heinrich5991> (that stuff all happens in json, btw)
20:32 <@heinrich5991> as a change from the previous protocol, a server is allowed multiple addresses (for ipv4+ipv6 support)
20:33 <@heinrich5991> [maybe that should be restricted to "at most 1 ipv4 and 1 ipv6 address, at least one of those"
20:33 <@heinrich5991> ]
20:33 <@deen> player names and scores? do servers keep an http connection to the master open to keep pushing updates or make a new connection on each change?
20:33 <@heinrich5991> the PR above lets curl reuse connections
20:33 <@heinrich5991> (and it actually does that, I checked)
20:34 <@heinrich5991> for backward-compatibility, the masters also send the list of other servers (only their IP addresses), for the client to ping individually
20:34 <@heinrich5991> this will be extended by running a serverinfo fetcher on the masters later, so that this list of IP addresses can be dropped eventually
20:35 <@heinrich5991> possible extension: some sort of live-update protocol over TCP where the clients only get the changes, instead of downloading the whole list again
20:35 <@heinrich5991> the master server would be a process that updates a 'static' file in a reasonable interval (maybe 1 second or so), for the webserver (like nginx) to serve
20:35 <@deen> why not over https and just use some json diffs thingy?
20:36 <@heinrich5991> yes, https
20:36 <@heinrich5991> oh, you mean the diff stuff
20:36 <@deen> yeah, you said tcp
20:36 <@heinrich5991> yea, that sounded like it was more fit for TCP
20:36 <@deen> why?
20:36 <@heinrich5991> if you want live updates instead of updates on client pull
20:38 <@heinrich5991> but yea, that part isn't as important to discuss, we can do that later when the rest of the stuff works
20:38 <+Learath2> hmm
20:38 <@deen> well, it would be nice for live notifications of friends joining
20:38 <@heinrich5991> true
20:38 <@heinrich5991> could be abused though, this part
20:38 <@heinrich5991> without having cryptographic user identities
20:39 <+Learath2> am I following this correctly? the master now also has all serverinfo so people don't have to getinfo?
20:40 <@heinrich5991> yes
20:40 <@deen> so no more accurate ping?
20:40 <@heinrich5991> yes
20:40 <@heinrich5991> we can add a checkbox to ping servers
20:41 <@deen> sounds good
20:42 <@heinrich5991> cool. Learath2?
20:42 <@heinrich5991> :)
20:42 <+Learath2> without the liveupdate stuff, sound's like it might be a lot of traffic
20:42 <@deen> without the liveupdate just update when user presses refresh
20:42 <@deen> should be less traffic than currently
20:43 <@deen> only 1 connection, 1 GET, compressed json
20:43 <@deen> and can trivially be put behind some cheap anti ddos
20:43 <@heinrich5991> yes
20:44 <@heinrich5991> that was part of the requirements
20:44 <@heinrich5991> that it would be possible to be put behind the free cloudflare offering
20:44 <@deen> well but that's why I wondered why you said tcp :D
20:44 <@heinrich5991> diffs are dynamic in nature
20:45 <@heinrich5991> well, I don't know. let's call that extra for now, and let's see how far I get with the rest :)
20:45 <+Learath2> I don't see any problems with it btw, sounds nice
20:45 <@deen> what about vanilla servers?
20:46 <@heinrich5991> [20:34:14] <@heinrich5991> for backward-compatibility, the masters also send the list of other servers (only their IP addresses), for the client to ping individually
20:46 <@heinrich5991> [20:34:42] <@heinrich5991> this will be extended by running a serverinfo fetcher on the masters later, so that this list of IP addresses can be dropped eventually
20:46 <+Learath2> we first provide a list of ips
20:46 <@deen> but vanilla servers will only register on one master, not all
20:47 <@deen> so the master has to get the list from all other masters?
20:47 <@heinrich5991> yes. the backward compatibility stuff has to fetch IPs from all 'legacy' masters
20:48 <+Learath2> are the cheap ddos solutions good enough for 1 sec resolution?
20:48 <@deen> so a potential attacker can still register their vanilla server to get all ip addresses of tw players
20:48 <@deen> what about having the master fetch player counts from legacy servers too?
20:49 <@heinrich5991> yes
20:49 <+Learath2> yeah a fetcher would isolate that
20:49 <@heinrich5991> the extension will fix that
20:49 <@heinrich5991> but my experience shows that I have to do work with milestones
20:49 <@heinrich5991> to get anything done
20:49 <@heinrich5991> in fact, the curl sharing stuff was just extracted from my WIP http masterserver branch ^^
20:50 <@heinrich5991> maybe we could use my already existing rust tool for fetching vanilla server infos. I'd need to extend it for 64p stuff though
20:51 <+Learath2> I was also seeing if there was any ip re-use during the join flood but there appears to be none
20:51 <+Learath2> so it most probably is spoofed
20:51 <@heinrich5991> k
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @onby ^
20:58 <@deen> heinrich5991: stealing ideas from the mozilla playbook? integrate some rust into existing c++ project with lots of legacy code? ;)
20:58 <@heinrich5991> nah :P the master would probably run in python or so, I'd guess
20:58 <@deen> we have existing fetch code in c++ already
20:58 <@deen> why not c++?
20:59 <@heinrich5991> you mean the client code?
20:59 <@deen> yes
20:59 <@heinrich5991> it looks messy to me
20:59 <@deen> it is
20:59 <@heinrich5991> and if we're going to code a new master anyway, we can just code it in python
20:59 <@heinrich5991> I think that sounds appropriate for a http endpoint
20:59 <@deen> what about performance?
20:59 <@deen> agressive caching?
21:00 <@heinrich5991> the server list is written to a file, for nginx to serve
21:00 <@deen> or about millions of servers trying to register in an attack
21:00 <@heinrich5991> that way, the python script doesn't have to perform very well for the clients
21:00 <@heinrich5991> yes, that could be a problem
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we probably should keep it C/C++ imho
21:00 <@heinrich5991> I don't have a go-to-language for high-performance http applications ^^
21:00 <@deen> c++
21:01 <@heinrich5991> I personally don't want to write new internet-facing services in C/C++
21:01 <@deen> what's the difference if it's an http application or a game client/server?
21:01 <@heinrich5991> currently, I'd probably either look at go or rust
21:01 <@heinrich5991> the *new* thing
21:01 <@heinrich5991> I wouldn't want to write a new internet-facing game in c/c++ either
21:02 <@deen> so you're not going to contribute any more c++ code?
21:02 <@heinrich5991> I am
21:02 <@heinrich5991> but I don't really want to start a new codebase in c/c++, if I don't have to
21:02 <@deen> just not if it lands in the mastersrv binary?
21:03 <@heinrich5991> the existing code for mastersrv is pretty much nothing, one could check whether one could reuse the browser code
21:03 <@heinrich5991> i.e. the existing master server code doesn't help writing the new master server
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if we are carebul about it, It shouldn't be too tough to make sure this is safe
21:05 <@deen> ^ famous last words
21:06 <@deen> I can understand the unsafety issues heinrich5991 has tbh
21:06 <@deen> especially since we use C with classes and not exclusive modern C++17 without raw pointers etc
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it's pretty much the standard for low-latency applications
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/AUIyA/479c9238ef.png
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> this tech team seems outdated
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if some1 needs some tech contact imo heinrich is a better spot to visit than HMH
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜¦
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :p
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> who the hell is HMH
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> lol
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> see?
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> i prefer heinrich over anyone
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> he is my favourite
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ik worst is troll but HMH was some active dude but i havent seen him in ages
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> ?
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> I'm not a troll

21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> also here should only be jao
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> gdin should be tech
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> did he do some tech?
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i didnt know dinner is invloeved in any tech stuff.
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I actually have no idea what dinner does except  doing yt and playing good c:
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess you can make a PR adding jao to the community team, if you want ðŸ™‚
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I'm not admin

23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> wtf
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> what is even the point of it
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> on a non lucrative game...
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddspeed.ovh is not valid
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> .-.
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ye
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nobos
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> 32 slots servers sounds interesting tho
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> anti ddos
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> x
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> no i mean actually
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> gameplay-wise
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> maybe its a good compromise
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no sucks
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> why
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 64 isnt enough
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> a full 64 server is rly spammy
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so 32 isnt better
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and blocky
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 32 is good
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> block is nice c:
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> just fix maps
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> my server is only 32player
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> not on ddrace
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> block is nice on block
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> block is a bad thing pretty much everywhere except for block servers
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> if u wanna block go block
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it's annoying if u can't join a srv
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yes
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i would love to see 128 servers
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> whats nice in fighting people who just wanna race
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> with each other
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> lol
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> imagine trying to votekick someone when u need 64 f3's
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> xd
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon i think it doesnt work rn tho
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/466714167827759104/Screenshot_1.png
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye i know it
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddnet++ has stole it already hehe
