01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> anyone know how the dying animation is made in tw? is it with assets? the spawn animation is made with assets right? (the pink clouds i think), but what about the dying? when the tee splashes
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Reteah> I think it's those 3, not sure tho
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Reteah> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/981704260666408960/particles.png
02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> sorry for hud, makes it bad visible, but could it be that it's without assets?
02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/981712692345712680/dm1_saavik_2022-06-02_02-11-48.demo.mp4
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> oh, yeah you could be right, just many., small and with tee color
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/981713883389657128/splash_x01.mp4
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> you are right
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> seems like that initializing all members of class implicitly delete the default constructor...
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think i need to retake a c++ class
02:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> howd you make the cursor so unstable?
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> idk, maybe that's the reason xD

03:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @louis do you need help with your pr to clean it up a lil bit 😄 ?
03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think it works now
03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> uhhh im not sure how to remove all that history lmao
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you can squash all commits into one
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```bash
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> git checkout l-ouis-comfort-update-1 
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> git rebase -i master
03:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```
03:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> in the editor, replace all `edit` with `squash` except the first one (top one should be your first commit)
03:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> then `git push --force`
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ah i see
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i did it all in github web editor which probably is why it is so messy lmao
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it would probably even be easier for me to do it in terminal but i was lazy
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> oh, from web editor, i don't know if its possible to rewrite history
03:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> or, just create a new branch and just add the correct file at the right place and delete the old branch then reopen the same pr
03:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i see
03:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is it good to go thru that effort to fix it? like does it help with the main github history or something
03:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it's easier for us when looking for commit that inserted a bug
03:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> less commit to check
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and cleaner history is nice as well
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> though it's a matter of taste
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what is libwebsockets and why do i not have it
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ./DDNet-Server: error while loading shared libraries: libwebsockets.so.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i built this for sure with the libraries
05:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> might have figured it out
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> which distrib
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ubuntu 18.04
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> LTS
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did you compile yourself? @lynn
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah, i compiled all the libs listed in README
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> even the websockets one
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and also tried to run without websockets too
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> so u've installed the package yes
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @lynn do you want to have websockets support?
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> dont care, just want the thing to run
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i guess whatever i did worked tho
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok 🙂
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you don't care, you should build without
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wonder how it was even enabled, I think it's off by default
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think i uninstalled libwebsockets
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or something
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> its on by default lol
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmm. `option(WEBSOCKETS "Enable websockets support" OFF)`
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can we try something?
09:57 < JuliasCeasar> Do you guys have girlfriends?
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> 2
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> going to bed, let me know in dms
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> anyone know how assets / skins are rendered to the ingame appearance? is it a library or raw c++ code? which library?
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> like the splash animation when a tee dies. there are many small assets that spawn where the tee were and move out. what's the code for that? i want to figure out how to create another animation, by either creating a new type of assets, or just reusings what's there
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> i have a crazy idea of making a tee split, with nice animation and divided hitbox for laser / other weapons.
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> like this 😅 , but might be hard
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/981849709343805481/planetdoom_Trim.mp4

14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> windows doesn't have that header

14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where do you get that error?
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> on the master branch of ddnet on windows (after initializing the ddnet-libs) and compiling
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> but it might be a toolchain problem, I guess ddnet doesn't compile out of the box and requires mingw?
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it should compile out of the box
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> without mingw
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you post the full error?
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> yes, sec
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> cannot reproduce and compiled successfully oO I changed nothing.
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> I guess thank you for rubberducking 🙂
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I swear the printer wasn't working when you didn't look ^^
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> you can't make it up, but my environment is heavily broken with my windoofs/wsl/ubuntu/mingw/cygwin setup so yeah
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I explored all notetaking apps out there: I like obsidian but don’t like that it’s not open source and it’s devs seem to be neolibbrained. Logseq is way too ideological with it’s attempt at trying to discourage hierarchy. Evernote is completely proprietary. Standard Notes is free and open source but only the plain text part.
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I heard onenote is good if you don't mind proprietrary
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is xournalpp a note taking app?
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’m going to take chillers advice and use paper for now and the second I get some free time I’m ripping off Obsidian and releasing it under MIT license
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I could use onenote for now instead of paper I guess, equally unsortable but it’s nice to use
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Reteah> How to add a "dummy" player serverside? I want to add a "dummy" player and it's score shall be the team's score.
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Reteah> I found an InsertEntity fuction  but I don't know how to use it.
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what are you trying to do? add a dummy that players can interact with?
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Reteah> not really just to keep track of team score
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Reteah> Ah I forgot I'll also need a way to add dummy players to interact with others :p
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I just saw this funny video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0EqbeCdAbQ
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> And in the comments:
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> "how did u make the moving freeze tiles tho?"
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> "they are part of KoG servers. I used a KoG test server executable, its included in the download.
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> You need to open a sv with that  executable. Then when creating a map add a quad layer named "QFr" for freeze. Or "QStopa" for a wall.
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> At last, animate your quad with envelopes. The collision is tied to the quad position (only quads from qfr and qstopa layers), and they are always square/rectangle  shaped
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I like to make the quads invisible and then add an image, wall or something"
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Do we already have a discussion about such a feature? I have not found anything
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I mean if this is polished up a bit and is less like a workaround, it could be pretty cool.
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://pyscript.net/ 👀
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @c0d3d3v yes, would be cool
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> The moving tiles of kog are still buggy tho, for example, if u are too fast (not even that fast) movung unfreeze wont unfreeze you
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> The moving tiles of kog are still buggy tho, for example, if u are too fast (not even that fast) moving unfreeze wont unfreeze you
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> they don't have DDNet quality developpers :poggers:
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> reitw proposed it in this channel a few weeks ago i think
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> here
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> i hope they did their website in python then
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i want to use ssg. pelican or hugo. is ddnet.tw made with jekyll? i saw something about jekyll in a commit message.
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> maybe i would use jekyll, cause i never used ruby before
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ddnet.tw is a mix of pure html, php, python with uwsgi, jekyll
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> and am interested
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> don't need to know ruby to use jekyll
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i just like to get a "feeling" for different languages. ruby is a japanese programming language right? that makes me curious. or maybe i got that wrong.
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Reteah> any ideas?
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> `MACRO_CONFIG_INT(ClZoomBackgroundLayers, cl_zoom_background_layers, 0, 0, 1, CFGFLAG_CLIENT | CFGFLAG_SAVE, "Zoom background layers")`
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> 
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> Hi, anyone knows why this parameter is 0 by default? can I make PR to change it to 1? 
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> for example due to it I can't make hats for players that would adapt to different zooms
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Create another CPlayer but control it from the server
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Faulty because most background layers look better when you don't zoom them
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> does it work if you give your hat para 1 (or the smallest possible)
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ?
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> it works just on small range, next there will be a shift
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, too bad
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I remember some map had something like hats, how did the mapper solve it?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the bus in kindergarten at the start for example
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> works with zoom
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think I made that or part of it, but I don't remember how 😄
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> if you make para x is 0 and para y is 1 it will work fine
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> so bus on same y
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> I will check, but think so
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> same problem example
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/981954979076116520/unknown.png

18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> yes, not zero
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Totoro also has a bus
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> some map by Ama you had a light in your hand
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> There are several cave map where the tee has a light in hand
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Winter Mines (not sure for this one), Cave i think
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Lost Story (2?) has a rocket
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, that map, Cavings I, has the same problem
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but it's also broken with dyncam
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, those where always broken with dyncam
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't want maps to forbid dyncam and zoom
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> they don't forbid them, it's just slightly off
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, but I mean to make it always work
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> dynamic camera not a problem I think, I play without it at least
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not sure it's possible
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't know any player using dyncam
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> server can forbid zoom to client
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> more useful in frag game
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but not dyncam right now
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> give Y para 1 and X para 0 or so
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> thats how it works on noby fng
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh it was mentioned already
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> checked Lost Story 1/2, everything that mooving with you use just one axis
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/981965061587341352/unknown.png
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> hook sign that use 0,0 has same issue
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/981965164637208606/unknown.png
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> looks like no one does that because it's impossible 🙂
20:06 <+ChillerDragon> @Reteah if you dont mind additional features lemme advertise ddnet++ to you. It ships with dummys (tees controlled by the server) and if you further want to make them move have a look at this file https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/blob/dcce0c8e31dbe49a414562501d54305bd16d7e2c/src/game/server/entities/dummy/sample.cpp
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Reteah> ok Thanks I will take a look ❤️ (irrelevant but I thought DDNetPP was DDNetPersian lol)
20:11 <+ChillerDragon> xd
20:11 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 any chance this ddnet++ server crash makes some sense to you? https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/Yn its a few commits behind ddnet master. Is this a known and maybe even fixed issue?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HappyFray> when i load the site then it goes to the other one wtf?

20:45 <+ChillerDragon> borderline pasteservice worthy
20:46 <+ChillerDragon> go make sume github issue
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> nextstep would be to open an issue, but I am already issue spaming
20:46 <+ChillerDragon> make fake github acc
20:46 <+ChillerDragon> i got like 20 github smurfs
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> any admins?
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> @Robyt3 thank you! Now i am surprised this was working at all in other OS
21:08 <+ChillerDragon> Did it always look that weird with flag render order? And i never realized? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1654196750.png
21:08 <+ChillerDragon> i guess it renders flags first then tees. And does not care about me squeezing my flag between the other thee and his flag xd
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Reteah> Can DDNet instead of `Team <number>` display `Score <number>` in scoreboard? Or is it managed clientside?
21:17  * MrGh0s7 slaps MrGh0s7 around a bit with a large fishbot
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Reteah> Turns out it's managed clientside.
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> wtf?
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> back then when we did stack tower with flags blue flag was over red
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i mean we couldnt see red flag cuz blue cover it
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> oh ok
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> i forgot how do i open an issue
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> thxs
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> New issue button on the right side
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> ok its just issues lmao
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> idk i tough it was more comple
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> idk i tough it was more complex
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> similar to your 20 discord bots
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> what kind of score do you mean?
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> add collision with teams opposite flag, so you can tower on red flag
22:21 <+MrGh0s7> I wanted to have per team score. My first idea was to have "dummy" players in each active team to keep track of it. But then if I could change the "Team <TeamNumber>" it would work
22:25 <+MrGh0s7> I guess for it to make sense I should also say that I want to port/remake fng to ddnet code and teams should have a score.
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> how can i tag it as a Discussion ?
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> not sure if you can do it but try finding a + icon on the Labels tab
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> humpf, i can't build anymore on windows with Mingw 😦
