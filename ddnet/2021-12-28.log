00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> why is there no margin anymore right to the ping display?

00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> should be like this yk

00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> ocd moment
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> has anyone any clue about what this piece of code does? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/skins.cpp#L218-L266
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> It looks like it's used to determine what base color is used when using custom color, but the code is quite obscure to me
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and i think there's some mistake (step is set depending on png format, but not pitch)
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> has anyone got any clue about what this piece of code does? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/skins.cpp#L218-L266
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> let me check
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 do you want to take a look at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4529 or should I merge it by eye-balling the changes? ðŸ™‚
07:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep that looks like a mistake to me, the loop at L234
07:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Took a look, but didn't test
07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It seems to turn the entire skin greyscale and re-weight it around rgb(192,192,192), Only thing I'm not certain of is how we end up coloring it
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Whether use custom color is set or not the renderer is seemingly set to the given custom color
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does anyone even know when the renderer uses the given colors or uses the texture colors?
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> help how to make fun game physics -.- https://zillyhuhn.com/OpenTube/videos/users/chiller/chichilku3_gravity.mp4
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chiller u know how gravity works?
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> no -.-
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u need to increase the velocity downwards
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by x amount
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> every time
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ok that much i know \:D
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> every second*
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ur not doing it?
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur velocity going down is constant
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobo
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> my code had buggo it was normalizing it to zero at the same time \:D
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i think i fixed it now but not sure if its fun gravity
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> **horizontal velocity** should increase by a certain amount, when holding down any key which triggers the movement, making it slippery, but satisfying.
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> When the key's released, thus no movement, what Teeworlds has: devide it's velocity by the amount you prefer. (from 0 -> no stopping to 1 -> instant stop. anything inbetween is gonna make the stooping motion fast or slow.)
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> **Vertical velocity** aka gravity should be like this:
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> -if you are not on floor (no floor detection)
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> -and nothing is interupting it, f.e Teeworlds dj:
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> --add velocity to it every frame.
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> 
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> the first one makes it, so that you cannot increase the force, while you are on floor, so you won't fall down extremely fast, when leaving platform.
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> 
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> the second one is for priority. If you want to jump, but don't want your down velocity to affect your jump speed, you just deactivate gravity, until you hit (velocity <= 0.0), then you reactivate it. About jumping, I don't have a global solution for it right now.
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Pro is, you can make almost every variable global, which will have better control over your preferences
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Con is, idk how effective this solution is on C++ or Python
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i just set negative y vel on jump not deactivating any gravity
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> not sure if i want dj
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen updater failed
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 would it be allowed to broadcast 2 servers that are both the same, but with different player lists so people can actually find people that are on my server when there are > 64 players online?
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> with redirecting traffic to the main port?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or finally show all players in serverinfo xd
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut would be allowed. fixing ddnet client would be nice as well ðŸ™‚
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i am looking into it rn
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> dont have the time rn tho
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ?
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I cant update to .8
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 15.8.1?
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> update how?
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what console output on failure?
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ingame updater
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what operating system?
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Windows 10 xd
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i didnt check the console and didnt find any log file
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then download fresh version from ddnet.tw
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> good fix
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> did you run a server while trying to update?
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that is expected to fail
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I can check console tomorrow
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can't fix with a bugreport that doesn't have anything except "updater failed". So unless you can reproduce it, we are kinda stuck ðŸ˜›
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I was updating from .7 or so to .8.1
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, it is pretty common that this thing breaks so i thought just a small reminder is enough
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm trying to install wine on macos, let's see if I can repro
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> usually deen comes around with an "ah"
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe because i didnt update from 15.8
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but from 15.7.(?)
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> latest .7
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think it was just 15.7
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that should be supported
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't see any reason why it should fail, nothing special changed
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I will see tomorrow
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> works for me in Wine
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Discord electron app just randomly starts using 3 of my cores at 100% for a couple dozen seconds then stops
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My new years wish for this year is that companies will relearn the value of making actual programs as opposed to webapps pretending to be programs
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> I dont get the last 2 loops and the one after the 'find most common frequence', although i guess this one finds the maximum
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> most common frequence is the most common grey in the skin
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the last reorder loop seems to re-scale the greys to make the most common 192 for some reason
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now that I'm not completely sure of, I guess it's just a random value that was deemed to look good
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> vanilla doesn't seem to do the re weighting step anymore
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it uses skin parts, so different parts can have different averages which will achieve the same effect
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> im doing python script to see what it does exactly
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well it makes the skin grey and it re-weights it as I said ðŸ˜„
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But maybe you can make the script and play with the 192 value to see how it changes the result
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That reminds me, every few hours Discord (in Firefox) stops sending messages for me and I have to refresh the page
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not sure if it's just me, but happens on at least 3 devices
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It happens in electron too, I either have to restart the app, or I have to wait it out
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Good to know, so not a problem of my network
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt happen to me
