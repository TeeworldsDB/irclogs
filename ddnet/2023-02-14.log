07:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @Robyt3\: you got a ETA for the new map format? Is there something blocking?
10:11 < bridge> <Robyt3> I haven't really decided how to continue for heinrich's comment"I'd either write our own backward compatible extension to save those, or simply not support saving them."
10:12 < bridge> <Robyt3> I'd at least have to port the bezier rendering for the client I guess, probably also for the editor
10:13 < bridge> <Robyt3> I'll see if I can make some progress later this week
10:32 <+ChillerDragon> nice thanks

12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I guess I've said that one trillion times now
12:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but there was no issue on github
12:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> now there is
12:30 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Would be surprised if someone doesn't know yet
12:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I have emoji

14:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> man lalrpop is awesome
14:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im gonna make a simple language
15:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop>
15:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it is implemented using lalrpop itself
15:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
16:22 < bridge> <ReiTW> It'd be the best for DDNet to have its entire chance to redesign alot of things. Implement new stuff that couldn't have been done before with vanilla compat etc..
17:01 < bridge> <Faulty> Downloadable content? ðŸ™‚
17:10 < bridge> <Faulty> Btw, I spoke to Dune recently and he said he has contact with the oy, but there are no proposed majorly impactful features in PR that would have a big enough impact on the game, and seems no time to check for minor fixes
17:10 < bridge> <Faulty> Btw, I spoke to Dune recently and he said he has contact with the oy, but there are no proposed majorly impactful features in PRs that would have a big enough impact on the game, and seems no time to check for minor fixes
17:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oy has to pass on the flag to someone else
17:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but oy wants tw to die
17:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so let it die
17:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ddnet is the future
17:15 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> :troll:
17:18 < bridge> <Faulty> Also, asked about that, he said
17:18 < bridge> <Faulty> > that's already a very big milestone that takes a lot of skill
17:18 < bridge> <Faulty> > I don't think anyone that recently contributed to teeworlds can do that
17:18 < bridge> <Faulty> Therefore, if someone has enough skill and desire, they can try to write it and add it to teeworlds, I'm ready to help from my side, but if this doesn't change things and the oy continues to be inactive there is always the option of merge the same in ddnet and reject tw support ðŸ™‚
17:19 < bridge> <Faulty> Downloadable content?
17:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :tw_facepalm:
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> nobody will ever contribute smth important again to teeworlds, as long as oy stays egomant
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ddnet lives bcs of its active community
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and bcs the community at least to a certain point has smth to say
17:58 < bridge> <cankick> how to do use webhook

20:35 < bridge> <newlesstee> How to change the hud? to shield and hearts ?
21:10 < bridge> <newlesstee> ```cpp
21:10 < bridge> <newlesstee> pGameInfoEx->m_Flags2 = GAMEINFOFLAG2_HUD_HEALTH_ARMOR | GAMEINFOFLAG2_HUD_AMMO;//GAMEINFOFLAG2_HUD_DDRACE;
21:10 < bridge> <newlesstee> ```
21:10 < bridge> <newlesstee> what wrong?
21:11 < bridge> <newlesstee> Ammo doesn't show
21:13 < bridge> <newlesstee> health and amor works
21:52 < bridge> <newlesstee> Help
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> just look in client why its not triggered
22:14 < bridge> <newlesstee> I looked in the client, and I need this flag
22:14 < bridge> <newlesstee> But don't work
22:15 < bridge> <garyalvarez> You can earn $10,000.00 with your pc or phone in just 72 hours, to get started click on and ask how https://t.me/isheilabilly
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> look what code path fails
22:16 < bridge> <Robyt3> Add `dbg_msg`s to the client to figure out if the flag is received successfully
22:17 < bridge> <newlesstee> I'm not compiling the client
22:17 < bridge> <Robyt3> If you want to figure out why it's not working you'll have to
22:17 < bridge> <Robyt3> Or you can keep guessing
22:18 < bridge> <garyalvarez> You can earn $10,000.00 with your pc or phone in just 72 hours, to get started click on and ask how https://t.me/isheilabilly
22:22 < bridge> <newlesstee> but it doesn't make sense, I put this flag and it should be working, probably it's not reaching the client
22:23 < bridge> <Robyt3> That's why you should add some `dbg_msg`s in the client
22:23 < bridge> <newlesstee> Or is there something that I need change too
22:23 < bridge> <newlesstee> Ok
22:24 < bridge> <Robyt3> Do your weapons have infinite ammo? If you just add the flag on a DDRace server than the ammo is not shown because all ammo is infinite on ddrace servers
22:31 < bridge> <newlesstee> Yes
22:32 < bridge> <Robyt3> So it's working as expected. I tried on a local server and the ammo count is 0 if you have infinite ammo, so it doesn't show any ammo in the client.
22:37 < bridge> <newlesstee> How to change this?
22:42 < bridge> <Robyt3> In `character.cpp` change `m_Core.m_aWeapons[Weapon].m_Ammo = -1;` so it gives 10 ammo when you pickup a weapon
22:42 < bridge> <Robyt3> `-1` means infinite ammo
22:43 < bridge> <Robyt3> Also remove `GAMEINFOFLAG_UNLIMITED_AMMO` and maybe some other race related flags
22:45 < bridge> <Robyt3> In `server/entities/character.cpp` change `m_Core.m_aWeapons[Weapon].m_Ammo = -1;` so it gives 10 ammo when you pickup a weapon

23:12 < bridge> <Robyt3> Looks alright. Just make sure that's the `server/entities/character.cpp` and not `client/prediction/entities/character.cpp`

23:31 < bridge> <Izanagi> Werenâ€™t there plans to bring back the old ninja freeze?
23:31 < bridge> <Izanagi> Is there still something going on with it or?

23:33 < bridge> <Izanagi> Itâ€™s unrelated to the current topics rn, sorry
23:34 < bridge> <newlesstee> oh, sorry
