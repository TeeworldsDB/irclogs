02:19 <+bridge> <cauldron> @Jupeyy_Keks remember the demo render flag? i tried to implement it. i would be glad if you would look into it: https://github.com/lkitsche/ddnet/tree/demo-render-flag.
09:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Cool will later look if I don't forget
09:17 <+bridge> <Voxel> what does this do :o
09:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Allows to render a demo with start parameter
09:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> So that the client can be used in a script to render multiple demos in a queue
09:22 <+bridge> <Voxel> Ooh, nice@
09:22 <+bridge> <Voxel> Ooh, nice!
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 sos how do computers work
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/35
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> mind explaining the generated protocolglue.cpp? :) 
09:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> check this chiller
09:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.nand2tetris.org/
09:52 <+ChillerDragon> i somehow expected when looking up a 0.6 msg in this array ``gs_Msg_SixToSeven[]`` by using the msg id as array index i get back the 0.7 msg id but that does not seem to be the case
09:52 <+ChillerDragon> i never played tetris
09:52 <+ChillerDragon> cancle me
09:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its not about that
09:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> do i need sound? im in a cafe
09:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> The site contains all the project materials and tools necessary for building a general-purpose computer system and a modern software hierarchy from the ground up
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> poggers so i can go into da woods and build a gaming pc out of the mud and stones i find?
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> like minecraft
09:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xdd
09:55 <+ChillerDragon> all the nand stuff melt ma brain
11:06 <+bridge> <Learath2> That should be the case if a message is binary compatible
11:07 <+bridge> <Learath2> If not you get a -1
11:07 <+bridge> <Learath2> Atleast that's how I remember it
12:20 <+ChillerDragon> Oh so its not about translating ids just to check if they have the same parameters
12:24 <+bridge> <Learath2> It's both
12:25 <+bridge> <Learath2> If there is a positive number in the array, it means the message is binary compatible and this is the id you need to use
12:25 <+bridge> <Learath2> If there is a -1 it means the message can't be autotranslated
15:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> does it work? looks a bit over complicated but maybe our code is also not really well done for this case
15:47 <+bridge> <cauldron> it builds and works, but doesn't quit after finish render, but rerenders xD
15:47 <+bridge> <cauldron> i just put on a new condition g_config.cldemorender on all the do_buttons and so on, so it would "dig itself" into the menu and then render.
15:47 <+bridge> <cauldron> i didn't know how to change the init process and know when the other stuff is ready. i tried to do it as a "deeplink"
15:47 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Seems a bit hacky how it uses different flags to trigger the UI code. You could add a separate command `render_demo <filename>` instead of adding a hard-coded command line parameter. The command would start the demo player with the given demo, render it and quit. Then you'd use an external script to launch the client with this argument multiple times to render an entire folder.

16:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> epic
16:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> is it a learning AI or just a "normal" AI
16:02 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Reinforncemt Learning RL
16:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ah really cool
16:03 <+bridge> <cauldron> yes, it's hacky. if i could, i would do it this way. but for now it was the 'easiest' way without.
16:03 <+bridge> <cauldron> yes, it's hacky. if i could, i would do it this way. but for now it was the 'easiest' way.
16:07 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i need to learn a bit of "machine learning"
16:07 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> well i should say Q-Learning
16:07 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> to make a crafting solver for ff14
16:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ez
16:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> currently the solvers use genetic algorithms, but i was told thats not efficient
16:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but in rust
16:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> for this sort of problem
16:08 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> obvious
16:09 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning
16:09 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
16:14 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> btw the KoGAI has a public github repo
16:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> aimazing

22:13 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> best idea, who's gonna implement it :troll:
23:12 <+bridge> <uwu> I bet he asked murpi to make submitting issues on ddnet website first
23:40 <+bridge> <HestiaSpider> so yall making ai's to play tw fr ?
23:41 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> it plays KoG not Teeworlds (subcategory of tw)
23:42 <+bridge> <HestiaSpider> what is KoG ? What does it mean ? Why would it play only on this mod ?
23:42 <+bridge> <HestiaSpider> i have too much questions coming
23:45 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> KoG is King of Gores search it up on ddnet server list. KoG is the easiest mod for training an ai to do it while we still have fun to do so
23:49 <+bridge> <HestiaSpider> Alright. Can we watch it training ?
23:49 <+bridge> <HestiaSpider> Alright. Can iwatch it training ?
23:49 <+bridge> <HestiaSpider> Alright. Can i watch it training ?
23:49 <+bridge> <HestiaSpider> also Why would it play only on this mod ?
23:50 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> no xD I train it on my local network so for you to watch it I'd have to give you my ip which I don't want
23:51 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> What do you imagine AIs being? You train it for smt it plays everything it doesn't work like that.

23:56 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ah xD
23:56 <+bridge> <Alexander> No offense to you, love you
23:56 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> KoG is no fun that's why make the ai do it xD
