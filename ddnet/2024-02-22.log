02:46 < bridge> <remakepower> Could we add a .soundmap file send by server. Then server could send client custom sound by it with CNetMsg_ExtraSound, and server could stop it by CNetMsg_ExtraSoundStop.
02:46 < bridge> <remakepower> Maybe it's not useful for ddnet

02:47 < bridge> <remakepower> Could we add a .soundmap file send by server. Then server could send client custom sound by CNetMsg_ExtraSound, and server could stop sound play by CNetMsg_ExtraSoundStop.
02:48 < bridge> <remakepower> But i think if we add this we'll get more interesting mod, isn't it?
02:50 < bridge> <remakepower> We can create the file by ddnet editor
02:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well that wasnt quite under 24h but my github acc is back <:poggers2:1008007455936094328>
02:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i for sure need to get less dependent on this platform

02:52 < bridge> <remakepower> And i think it
02:53 < bridge> <remakepower> And i think it a great change for some custom sound needed mod like TeeWare
04:44 < bridge> <Ewan> that mouse is nasty dude
06:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> To everyone who was wondering why i got banned on github. It is because i copied all prs from teeworlds to a community fork.
06:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Please let me know if you want write access to that repo.

06:20 < bridge> <peter44h> How can that get you banned?
06:22 < bridge> <remakepower> Ah, that a bad message, but this project is great (I think)
06:23 < bridge> <remakepower> Official project updated 8 months ago
06:36 < bridge> <syrinok> Why does the graph move over like this with dummy connected

07:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> its called touch feedback
08:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds a bit like forth (or maybe even lisp(?))
09:00 < bridge> <teero777> Do you mean tactile feedback?
09:00 < bridge> <teero777> Or haptic
09:00 < bridge> <teero777> Ehatrver
09:00 < bridge> <teero777> Whatever
09:00 < bridge> <teero777> Never heard someone say touch feedback before
09:10 < bridge> <teero777> @nouaa mornin
09:10 < bridge> <nouaa> morning, son
09:12 < bridge> <nouaa> yummy
09:13 < bridge> <teero777> Thats why I hate complicated designs with many spots to clean. Very annoying

12:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon https://github.com/teeworlds-community/mirror-bot/blob/master/mirror-bot.sh you really like bash. wouldn't it be easier to write pyson or js script
12:16 < bridge> <TsFreddie> chillerdragon: why
12:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i love a good personal space
12:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1210183590894374962/image.png?ex=65e9a24c&is=65d72d4c&hm=2f80a15bdd8febe4853d683f63554767dedddefd2640c0256005c413356a3375&
12:19 < bridge> <TsFreddie> chillerdragon: why are you inviting people to the repo instead of that org btw
12:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie i spend some time waiting for people to reject the idea and then i went through a bunch of people i thought might be interested
12:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie you contributed a lot to tw
12:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> has anyone rejected you
12:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie the whole org might get bit out of control i do not want to run around see if ppl created garbage repos
12:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can do write process only members iirc
12:20 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can do read write only members iirc
12:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dont think anyone has rejected yet
12:21 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean technically no one can really reject a fork, but i suspect people might not be up for contributing.
12:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I totally get that. I do not expect anyone to actively work on it. I just want the people that are active in the scene to have voting power in case they want to approve a pr.
12:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> teeworlds repo itself has nothing to do with  why i stopped contributing to it
12:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I know you are busy 24/7 game dev
12:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not that I did much anyway
12:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but if you feel like pressing approve on any prs you can do so now c:
12:22 < bridge> <TsFreddie> bro i wish. working does not feel like game dev man
12:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i tried to leave out sending invites to the people that might not be interested
12:23 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089> also are you just giving out free write accesses
12:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> well chiller why tf is my inbox empty then?!
12:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat bash is best
12:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i invited you lol @meloƞ 
12:23 < bridge> <meloƞ> ?!
12:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: did u send invite to oy? :DDD
12:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> oh refreshing helps

12:24 < bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
12:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat i did not send invites to tw ppl yet i will wait a bit for the reactions from you guys
12:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> did you turn on branch protection
12:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im not a tw person :twinbop: (sad one, not happy one)
12:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i do plan to invite dune, oy, sonix etc but i give them a bit of time to respond on irc to maybe voice their disinterest
12:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat but you are one of my top5 fav githubbers
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> @milkeeycat your "improve startup time" lives forever in my heart
12:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie yes you have write access but you can not push to the branch nor merge prs
12:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> only approve and it needs 3 yes votes
12:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye that make sense
12:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> > voice their disinterest
12:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> 
12:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> that's very assumptious of you
12:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it might happen
12:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sometimes ppl say that they do not like a certain idea
12:26 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't like idea that aren't mine
12:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
12:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its yours now
12:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can have it
12:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> no thanks, i already had my own
12:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nah you cant give it back
12:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i dont like most of my ideas after a week
12:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if anyone complains it was freds idea
12:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
12:27 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i should get off work
12:28 < bridge> <meloƞ> agreed
12:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat i even added server support for this stunt xd
12:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1708601283.png
12:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can spam the holy teeworlds channel now from chat.zillyhuhn.com pls dont do it ._.
12:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> are you going to open a discord for the "community"? given you probably don't even use discord now
12:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> thanks, i definitely will
12:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:justatest:572499997178986510>
12:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie no :p the project doesnt need me
12:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> github and the official teeworlds irc should be enough communication platform
12:29 < bridge> <TsFreddie> who's merging then?
12:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie everyone who got an invite
12:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can merge if it has enough approvals from others
12:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> konsti, spsomeone and headshot could be merging dick picks right now and i wouldnt know
12:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> do you have a bot that do that?
12:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nah its github feature
12:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> worked fine in my test run https://github.com/teeworlds-community/teeworlds/pull/1
12:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> f my life then
12:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why @TsFreddie 
12:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> get rid of bam first
12:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> shut!
12:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why f ur life
12:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> bam is great
12:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bam maximalist entered the chat
12:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nothing. i just feel like i don't know anything about github anymore
12:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk if any repo uses that stuff
12:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it is too great, we need to protect it from the outside world
12:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe bitcoin does
12:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i should get off work *2
12:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Time to git gut in teeworlds source code and write my real first LGTM
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao konsti accepted xd
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat xd
12:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> :poggers2:
12:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> btw should it still be called teeworlds :justatest:
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why not?
12:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> rename to catworlds?
12:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Basedworlds
12:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> rename it to teewars and handle the lawsuit like real man
12:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> rename it to teewars and handle the lawsuit like real men
12:36 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if it really takes off like "everyone" would hoped so. it might just turn into a modding monster with extended protocol everywhere in which case might not be compatible with actual teeworlds
12:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
12:37 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I should get off work *3
12:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> lmao Freddie will just overtake
12:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh yea thats not the plan @TsFreddie the plan is not to take off and replace teeworlds. Just get some merges in that fix bugs and deprecations. Not to add protocol breaking features.
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also relistically speaking not a single person gives a shit so nothing will happen. But at least i can say i tried xd
12:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i thought it was my idea
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> right
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my bad
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> modding monster it is
12:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> let see if everyone can collectively really reject the 6th weapon and the 0.8 water
12:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :D 
12:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> im getting off work
12:41 < bridge> <zhn> make teeworlds a real engine
12:41 < bridge> <zhn> add scripting :kek:
12:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> make it a unreal engine
12:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> just use godot
12:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> In bash
12:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao
12:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon rewrite https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/blob/master/bin/buildChangelog.mjs in bash and send it to me or u no longer true bash enjoyer
12:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> if someone came in and just refactored everything into rust then ill learn rust
12:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> get ATH lua scripts back >:(
12:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> @gerdoe hear that? we have a new project

12:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> xd
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fred wat if i told you i have a bash script that does that
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> refactor to rust
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/bash-to-rust
12:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Can you write doom in rust 0.o
12:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Can you write doom in bash 0.o
12:50 < bridge> <miguilim> can you document all changes between 0.6 and 0.7 pls? 🙏
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no because i got skill issues
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @miguilim its on ma todo but for the meantime you can ask me i implemented a client side bridge and might still remember most
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/shared/06_vs_07.html
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i only compiled this cring list so far
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a bunch of msg ids changed
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the packet header changed
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 0.6 packet https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/06/packet_layout.html
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 0.7 packet https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/07/packet_layout.html
13:00 < bridge> <miguilim> :pepeW:

14:21 < bridge> <teero777> What kind of quality of life fixes?
14:21 < bridge> <teero777> Can we just copy over features from ddnet? xD
14:21 < bridge> <teero777> For examples the community things
14:21 < bridge> <teero777> For example the community things
14:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it
14:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's time to open teeworlds client 2nd time in my life :poggers2:
14:23 < bridge> <teero777> true. I think I have like 150hr on steam teeworlds xd
14:23 < bridge> <teero777> Basically opened 2 times
14:24 < bridge> <teero777> Idk if we could get the feel of ddnet into Teeworlds it would be very cool. The skin alignment and the lack of antiping(idk if it still isn't there) kind of put me off
14:25 < bridge> <teero777> The skin system is great but I feel like the settings are missing many things that I'm used to from ddnet
14:26 < bridge> <teero777> Last time i played with the tw client it was kind of a downgrade.
14:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 ideally we start by looking at the prs that are already pending on the repo. And then keep it low profile on features. More like compiler deprecation warnings and fixes of crashes and so on.
14:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is it just me or there're not that many options ._.

14:33 < bridge> <miguilim> your documentation says about the teeworlds huffman weight tree
14:33 < bridge> <miguilim> and gives this link https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/26d24ec061d44e6084b2d77a9b8a0a48e354eba6/src/engine/shared/huffman.cpp#L7-L20
14:33 < bridge> <miguilim> however, this value is not available on teeworlds 0.6 code, do you know where can I find it there?
14:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> damn sql is really getting to you now lol
14:48 < bridge> <zhn> this one https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/808ccd7913d8a463423e3ffdb2715e859878fcbb/src/engine/shared/huffman.cpp#L7 ?
14:49 < bridge> <zhn> bruh why can't i delete embed from phone
14:51 < bridge> <zhn> it have the same line even on 0.6 branch
15:00 < bridge> <miguilim> ? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/0.6/src/engine/shared/huffman.cpp

15:15 < bridge> <miguilim> :poggers2:
15:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s the same Huffman for both versions.
15:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also same frequency table
15:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There should be more. Did you investigate what happened?
15:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> nop
15:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im fighting with docker now
15:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> will something bad happen if i rm rf `/var/lib/docker` :thonk:
16:50 < bridge> <miguilim> is there any snap item I have to send every time?
16:51 < bridge> <miguilim> I don't know when to send which snap items. I still didn't get this logic
16:52 < bridge> <miguilim> I would send all object snap items (such as weapon, pickup, projectile) that should be visible on screen every time and thats it XD
16:53 < bridge> <miguilim> what do I do with snaps like obj_game_info, obj_game_data, obj_player_info?
16:54 < bridge> <miguilim> and about these, do I need to send them every time if they are visible on screen?
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @chillerdragon epyc idea, but we'd also need the website and steam account. so pls throw up your hacker skillz to obtain them
