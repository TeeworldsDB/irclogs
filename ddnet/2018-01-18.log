13:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon why don't you use cmake already?
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ._.
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i like ban c:
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ups
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> we're going to remove bam soonishâ„¢
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> pls never quote this
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> it was a typo
13:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> it like bam*
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> no pls dont remove bam its best
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> why would you?
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> maintaining 2 compiling systems?
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ye!
13:39 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> xd
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon I guess you're not compiling ddnet?
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ddpp
13:40 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i latley destroyed my enviroment path variable and wasnt able to compile anything on my main machine
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> check how `configure.lua` looks like in ddnet, and adjust the `configure.lua` in your ddnetpp
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i now figured out how to set it agian and i have MinGw setup and i can type g++ everywhere and it runs
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i use official ddpp configure.lua
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> tbh, cmake looks much easier at the moment
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> especially the `loadfile_` function
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> you don't need to compile bam for yourself
13:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> ðŸ˜„
13:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i understand bam but not cmakes so i guess cmake is much moire complicated
13:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> I'd guess it's rather that you learned bam first ^^
13:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> well tbh i dont understand shit
13:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> xd
13:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I mean, i either can't use cmake. But im not C dev
13:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> so I just follow instructions
13:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> and it works
13:42 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> ;D
13:43 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> lul i fixed it
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i took my laptop config.lua and configure.lua und replaced em
13:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> maybe the config.lua waas missing. but i thought bam creates the config.lua it self
13:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> yes, it does
13:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> have you followed my advice? ðŸ™‚
13:46 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> what advice?
13:46 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> to learn cmake?
13:46 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ah no
13:46 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i took ddpp luas from my laptop
13:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> [1:41 PM] heinrich5991: check how `configure.lua` looks like in ddnet, and adjust the `configure.lua` in your ddnetpp
13:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> [1:41 PM] heinrich5991: especially the `loadfile_` function
13:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> nono
13:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ddpp has different lua files i think
13:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> looking at https://github.com/ChillerDragon/DDNetPP/blob/dd14d8f9c244819e9c4eb913ac49fdd7a30584d6/configure.lua, it seems that what's missing is exactly the `loadfile_` function of ddnet
13:50 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/6bf4a6e2ee1c99fa19127a94d94a008a7dd2beaa/configure.lua#L6-L8
13:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon here, it checks that the file is not null, exactly the error you observed
13:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> oh
13:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> great
13:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> why don't you believe me? ^^
13:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i try to figure out how it works later and fix it if my brain allows me to
13:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i belive u .-.
13:51 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ur pro
14:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> So it only Checks If the file Exists? But why Is there no Else where it catches the error?
14:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> it only manipulates the file object if it is not `nil`
14:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> `nil` is kind of like `NULL` in C++
14:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> so if the file is not found, `loadfile` returns `null` and `setfenv` would fail
14:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> because `setfenv` fails on `nil`
14:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> thus the function checks for `nil` and only calls `setfenv` if `file` is non-`nil`
14:26 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> Yes i get that
14:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> But my Version crashes if its nil but the new ddnet Version does nothing If its nil?
14:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> the new version returns `nil` if `loadfile` returns `nil`
14:35 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> (allowing the caller of `loadfile_` to deal with a nonexisting file)
14:36 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ezy> Rly
14:36 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ezy> Nice feature
14:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> ?
14:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> Ah Nice
14:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> @heinrich5991 i tested it now, the question is indeed different, i didn't look carefully at it when i found it, but the answers seem to answer the problem i described
14:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> so yes, it works
14:56 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @timakro have you confirmed that there was a problem before? as in: were the timestamps accidently updated when the stars were?
15:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> i accidentally updated timestamps on the unique race severs when rating maps for our new point system, luckily i had a backup with the correct release times @heinrich5991
15:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> ok, so you did indeed confirm that there is a problem
15:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> thanks ðŸ™‚
15:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> ofcourse?
15:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> ^^
15:23 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> Guys, guys, I look fun at you, but I'd like to know if my problem will be fixed?
15:24 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> have you looked at `ui_mousesens`?
15:24 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> does it look like a reasonable value?
15:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> yeap
15:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> not `inp_mousesens`
15:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> i understand
15:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> ok
15:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> all looks fine
15:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> do you know something that changed in your setup?
15:26 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> Nothin?
15:26 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> Nothin.
15:26 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> so one day, it just changed the way it worked?
15:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> I tried to reinstall the client. Created a new config, ran the game in compatibility mode
15:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> still nothin
15:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> Maybe it's a coincidence or not, but I ran into this problem after windows 10 update
15:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> Oh I'm not sure
15:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> But I'm not sure
15:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> windows sucks -.-
15:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> +
15:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> I would use Linux if the programs I needed worked on Linux
15:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> I have a question. Is it possible to somehow transfer the sensitivity from Old mouse mode to the new?
15:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> I don't know about your original problem tbh
15:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> also not your second ._.
15:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> xd
15:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> you could try adjusting it until it feels the same?
15:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> That is the problem. Because I can not exactly find the same sensuality that I had on old mouse mode
15:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> That is the problem. Because I can not exactly find the same sens that I had on old mouse mode
15:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Skyrx> And what is the meaning of the new mouse mode?
15:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 why are some ddrace commands registered in ddracecommands.h and others in gamecontext.cpp? it's not like they are vanilla commands and ddrace commands.
15:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> hmm
15:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> it seems like it's supposed to only ddrace commands in `ddracecommands.h`
15:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> so maybe leave `vote_no` there
15:57 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki ^
15:57 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> ...
15:57 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> sorry ðŸ˜¦
16:01 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> @heinrich5991 "I don't think we should disclose internal ranks to the chat." why not?
16:02 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> for example because we currently don't
16:02 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> thats not a strong reason :/
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> in a pull request that is about adding a `vote_no` I see no reason to change other functionality, and definitely not without a reason
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> *without a specified reason
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> it would be useful if we implement helper
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> people don't ask them for stuff they can't do
16:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> while if it said "moderator" they would assume they are mods
16:04 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> when they actually are just helpers
16:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> it would be useful after we implemented helper
16:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> I don't like these ways to show off your rank
16:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> if there are multiple moderators on the server we also don't show who of them forced the vote to no
16:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> adding this info could point ppl in the direction of who let their vote fail
16:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> hm actually it would be nice if it announces the person who forces the vote. players could direct their questions to the correct persons instead of having to guess
16:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> adding this info could point ppl in the direction of who let their vote fail - why is this bad?
16:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> moderators or admins shouldn't hide from that
16:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> "adding this info could point ppl in the direction of who let their vote fail" - why is this bad?
16:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> +1
16:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Hiding moderators has advantages and disadvantages. 
16:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Since you are hid, you don't need to care about insults into your direction, when you force vote (earth have unlimited amount of personality).
16:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> But if you are not hide, then moderators could feel trapped, if the do right decision, but "bad" for these who voted/etc.
16:13 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> that's my opinion. There's more means, but i won't tell all of them here
16:14 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> if you can't handle the bad feedback you get from making correct decisions, then you should definitely not be a moderator
16:14 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> there is no need to hide moderators action if the moderators behave correct
16:14 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> you're there to resolve issues, not to be untouchable with power
16:14 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> why not? I think hidding is good
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> some people are just out there trying to annoy people
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> if they know whom to target, that just makes their job easier
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> And it's not like, handling bad feedback.
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> if you want to complain about a moderator, you can, but not in-band
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> moderators should be abel to hold some evil words in chat lul
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I bet, you are not infallible
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> if you can't handle people annoying you, you shouldn't be a mod
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> but why should we force them to? ðŸ˜›
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> But that doesn't mean, that they have to hear that words
16:15 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> from poeplee
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> it's volountary, don't put yourself in the position if you don't want it
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> because it feels more transparent for the people
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> since we don't PAY them
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> to handle it
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> all for the community
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> nobody forced em to be mods
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> moderators should be okay with getting hate imo
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> well, we're on a mod shortage
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> AFAIK
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> players should ALWAYS be able to know who made what actions, otherwise mods can just do what they want
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> so handling mods nicer seems to be a good thing
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ye
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> players should ALWAYS be able to know who made what actions, otherwise mods can just do whatever they want
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> no
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> x
16:16 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> d
16:17 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> people can complain about moderators, we can find out who did what
16:17 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> then hire some mods who can handle chat flame lol
16:17 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> people shouldn't need to complain to us, they should be able to resolve the issue with whoever made the decision they want to complain about
16:17 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> that's a bad system
16:17 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Jao, world isn't perfect ðŸ˜ƒ
16:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 made new commit
16:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> And you should know, that there's no equal situations.
16:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> for example, in the Rust community, there's a team not composed of moderators of the other teams that just deals with complaints about staff members
16:18 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> what do you mean @Savander
16:19 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> Moderators can't always resolve the issue
16:19 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> it's not possible in real world
16:20 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/996/files#diff-a2df712cfb938eda9a173f36c865c2ccR3398
16:20 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> `const char *pOption` plz
16:21 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> If they make a decision, they should be able to resolve the issues that come with it
16:21 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> And if not they can still direct them to admins
16:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> It's more society subject than making simple 1 - 0  decisions
16:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> Thats better than having angry players complain about hidden mods
16:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> They always will be complain
16:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> because, admin "did wrong thing"
16:22 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> because, "LOL, im funny, i will insults you but then no, i didn't want to say that"
16:23 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> "lol im blocking, its funny". NO I DIDN'T, SHOW ME DEMO. etc
16:23 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> Thats their right
16:24 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> But from my experience you can talk to players and explain why you made the decision
16:24 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> Often they understand the reasons behind it
16:24 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> It doesn't matter, if they are trolls
16:24 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> they will do it anyway
16:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> So?
16:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> Not everyone is a troll
16:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I know, and not everyone have to know, who voted
16:25 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> Why?
16:26 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> We actually donâ€™t allow mods to ban/force etc with fakenames
16:26 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> Idk if that was known
16:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> not to me
16:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> I think deen was very much against being able to get a list of moderators  on the current server
16:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> sounds like the opposite stance
16:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> Deen is admin
16:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> Not mod
16:27 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> XD
16:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> Admins can get away with everything anyway
16:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜¦
16:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> ðŸ™‚
16:28 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> To be honest, im no profesor of sociology.
16:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> To tell you what's better, for people.
16:29 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I know advantages and disadvantages
16:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> "[4:28 PM] jao: Admins can get away with everything anyway" that sounds bad ðŸ˜¦
16:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> And for me, moderators could feel offended very often if we show people who voted for example. They are volounteres, they should feel good on that positions
16:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> And for me, moderators could feel offended very often if we show people who voted for example. They are volounteres, they should feel good on that position
16:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> But w/e ryozukis solution with just saying mod or helper doesnâ€™t give away what person it is, so where is the issue?
16:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> Wtf mods arenâ€™t there to make themselves feel better
16:30 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> And for me, moderators could feel offended very often if we show to people who voted for example. They are volounteres, they should feel good on that position
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> We don't have moderators, you shouldn't know that
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> They volunteer to help the community
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> and we lose more
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> teeworlds community is quite small
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> Lol
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> so it's worth to make them feel comfortable in their positions.
16:31 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> I would rather loose the few mods that donâ€™t fit (canâ€™t handle it)
16:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I'm done here, you know my opinion ðŸ˜ƒ Maybe anyone else will spread his word. ðŸ˜›
16:33 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> we don't need to make the life moderators unnecessarily hard though
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> but mods are supposed to acknowledge what they did anyway
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> or do you want mods that ban people and then just hide away
16:34 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> no
16:35 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> but if there's a troll on the server and not them not knowing the mod's name is deescalating, then that's a good thing
16:35 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> if it's not such an obvious troll, the moderator will hopefully warn the player beforehand anyway
16:36 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> in such situation the troll would just spam the whole server "who banned me????????"
16:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> that's more deescalating than trying to discuss and explain the reasons
16:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> I should also point out that the obvius trolls already know who is the mod, atleast happens with me ðŸ˜¶
16:37 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> that's more escalating than trying to discuss and explain the reasons
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> ye and if there are multiple mods on the server, the troll would just spam all of them
16:38 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> instead of only one
16:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> that sounds like a good thing
16:41 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> insults targeted against a lot of people are less effective IME
16:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> what do you mean with less effective?
16:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> and why does it matter? mods should be able to handle hate by trolls, that's what they signed up for
16:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> if you happen to be liked by trolls, you're doing something wrong
16:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> mods should be able to handle negative comments
16:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> but I think that if we have the option to make them have to handle less negative comments, then we should take that option
16:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> even if the takes the option from normal players to easily direct their questions to mods that issued actions?
16:54 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> not a good tradeoff imo
16:55 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> even if the takes the option from normal players to easily direct their questions to the mod that issued actions?
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> mods will hopefully warn and talk to "normal players"
16:56 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> reducing the impact of this specific downside
16:57 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> and what about just differentiating between mod and helper?
16:57 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> does it have downsides too?
16:58 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> it also makes the mods more identifiable
17:02 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> but players will assume that there is a mod on the server that can ban people
17:02 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> that effects all players on a server, not only one that has a question
17:02 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> that affects all players on a server, not only one that has a question
17:03 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> btw, we should also make a command to show moderators list
17:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> if we perhaps to make moderators action visible
17:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> the best would be too highlight mods in scoreboard
17:05 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> the best would be to highlight mods in scoreboard
17:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> vanilla support ?
17:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> + chat command
17:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> ye both
17:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> c:
17:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> [MOD] prefix
17:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> ?
17:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> nuuu lul
17:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> xd
17:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> different color if thats possible
17:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> all would fake
17:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> and rip name lengjt
17:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> it should be color
17:06 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> idk how it works either but gogo devs xd
17:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i do the chat command haha
17:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> why? We could animate that MOD or something hehe
17:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> you didn't play on "City"?
17:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> ðŸ˜›
17:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ye
17:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> no
17:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ddnet city xd
17:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> i mena, City mode
17:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> i mena, City mod
17:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> yy
17:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> ikr
17:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i know what you meah
17:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> they also have these clan swaps
17:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> shows rank some seconds and then switches to actual clan
17:07 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> It was idea, it's not like we will implement it
17:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> I just suggested, that if we want to
17:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i dont know ...
17:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i highlighted my supporter in ddpp in the motd
17:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> show activity of modes
17:08 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> you join and u see who is supporter and who is online rn
17:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> but its not live...
17:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <jao> probably not, because people could actually find mods to ask for their needs then ðŸ˜®
17:09 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i think the chat command is a good first solution
17:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> /authed
17:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> 
17:10 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> == admins ==

17:42 <+ddnet-discord> [freenode] <nemo> our rule for admins is that they are all the devs w/ commit access, plus a slightly larger group of regular contributors
17:43 <+ddnet-discord> [freenode] <nemo> it's kinda like - people who just want admin probably shouldn't have it. contributors are invested
17:44 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Justafish> heeey, waddap, my name is listed there
17:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <worstwish> nice pic
17:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> namo that means i should get rcon on ddnet because i did a typo fix in the ddnet src? xd
17:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> oops
17:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> nemo*
17:51 <+ddnet-discord> [freenode] <nemo> heh
17:51 <+ddnet-discord> [freenode] <nemo> I didn't even get commit access until I'd submitted like half a dozen features to our engine
17:51 <+ddnet-discord> [freenode] <nemo> and unc0rr was sick of merging them for me
17:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> i dont have commit access too
17:52 <+ddnet-discord> [freenode] <nemo> usually most FOSS projects aren't dumb enough to give commit to typo fixers â˜º
17:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> well not "too" becasue u have one xd
17:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> but u said "plus a slightly larger group of regular contributors"
17:52 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> so all regular contributers get ingame admin? c:
17:53 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <ChillerDragon> would motivate guys to help contributing to the ddnet src xd
17:55 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Justafish> why not just pull the repo down, make a new branch, then ask for a merge request?
17:55 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> It's how it works now, no?
17:56 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> we are basing on pull requests
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Im 'corneum> i was wondering if teehistorian has any limit matters of playtime or rank. like for example if i have a rank300 with a 500minute time. does teehistorian record it?  also how does it cope with /save?

18:23 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Savander> good question

18:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> 
18:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki>     The choice between "int* p;" and "int *p;" is not about right and wrong, but about style and emphasis. C emphasized expressions; declarations were often considered little more than a necessary evil. C++, on the other hand, has a heavy emphasis on types.
18:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> 
18:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki>     A "typical C programmer" writes "int *p;" and explains it "*p is what is the int" emphasizing syntax, and may point to the C (and C++) declaration grammar to argue for the correctness of the style. Indeed, the * binds to the name p in the grammar.
18:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> 
18:45 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki>     A "typical C++ programmer" writes "int* p;" and explains it "p is a pointer to an int" emphasizing type. Indeed the type of p is int*. I clearly prefer that emphasis and see it as important for using the more advanced parts of C++ well.

18:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Im 'corneum> anyone else always opens up ddnet.tw on computers in stores?
18:47 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> int* maketh not sense in C++ either. It looks odd when you declare multiple int*s
18:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Ryozuki> yeah yeah, sure :P
18:48 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <Learath2> For int* to make sense we'd also need it have int[20] arr
