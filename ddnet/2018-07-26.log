00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no. unfortunately not
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is it too hard to make or is it because everyone plays ddrace anyways
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's because it's hard to make
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ^
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lot of games implement the game logic in a scripting language
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the engine in c/c++
00:03 <+Songoku> at least ddos illegal, but maybe the economic damage isnt high enough...
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is also 0 documentation on how the code is organized... its hard to get started
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> thats sad. :/
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (the ddnet code also has quite some ugly places, where layers are not properly separated. stuff like that would have to be broken up before something like that would work)
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there are also some big if statements that are really hard to decrypt
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `if(Temp.x > 0 && ((pCharCore->m_TileIndex == TILE_STOP && pCharCore->m_TileFlags == ROTATION_270) || (pCharCore->m_TileIndexL == TILE_STOP && pCharCore->m_TileFlagsL == ROTATION_270) || (pCharCore->m_TileIndexL == TILE_STOPS && (pCharCore->m_TileFlagsL == ROTATION_90 || pCharCore->m_TileFlagsL ==ROTATION_270)) || (pCharCore->m_TileIndexL == TILE_STOPA) || (pCharCore->m_TileFInde <message clipped>
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw use 3 ` for multiline code
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> all of this, just to produce buggy blockers
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is a single line
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in the source
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but it will look better still xD
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u cant fix the buggy blockers
00:07 <@heinrich5991> Songoku: police wants very clear evidence AFAIK
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cause maps use them
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes ðŸ˜¦
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 will there be Something Like "prefix skin [fokkonaut]" in the changelog? xd
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i wish i could code
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @fokkonaut im the one who does most changelogs :D
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum what are you doing? school? uni? work?
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can start learning
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> work. dont try to get me started :D
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki will there be?
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> even my bro gave up on c++
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on next update, if i remember to (most times i do) yeah
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oki
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> nice
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like c++
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like programming in general
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it feels really nice when u get things working
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i like turtles
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant find this in any other activity
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i can find that in mapping
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> specialy when u spend over 4 hours
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ˜®
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum what do you work if I may ask?
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> its called Kontruktionsmechaniker. i usually weld or drill work on miling mashines and lathes sometimes. no computers :D
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so proper work ðŸ™‚
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not shifting bits around ^^
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> "actual" work ye
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> easy to find a job likr that, now that everyone wants to be a dev ðŸ‘€
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXKs1ZSgMic 
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can we have something like this? different paralax in different corners
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> or more corners per quad?
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats rly interesting
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> tl;dw?
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> different paralax on different corners on quads to create a 3d effect
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> we already have this right
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> how can i do it?
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> para x and para y
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yes but thats only for the whole quad
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> then separate the quad
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what do you mean
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> have 2 quads
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> but they will have one picture each. what i meant was one picture thats has different paralax within itself.
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> like when you choose 2 corners of a quad and move them in the editor
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> won't it be the same effect
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i dont think so.
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> why not
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> try it out
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> don't u just put one with larger para x and y
00:33 <+Songoku> good night
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i dont think you can create something like in the video with the editor now
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> do you mean like the sides of the objects
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yes. or the ground
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol is the testing channel free to use again?
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Im 'corneum doesnt have dev role
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> yed
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> :pepeH:
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :pepeH:
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> ha i'm safe i have the role
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> yes
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :pepeH:
10:46 <@twvoice> NameError: name 'host' is not defined (file "/home/ddvoice/.sopel/modules/iphub_voice.py", line 40, in on_join)
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> @heinrich5991 I have a feeling this is a bad idea
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gabbo> SYS has a shitty support when you have an issue, and the network would be much better if you had the server in germany :/
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> suggestions welcome
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://ovh.de/dedicated_server/all_servers.xml?range=game
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see prices from ~100â‚¬ and up :/
11:17 <@deen> FRA up?
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> You won't need a game i guess
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> Game is especially for the protection that they offers
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> So a different filter for some games, like steam games, mc, and also programs like teamspeak and mumble
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> game were the cheapest though I think (on the overview)
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyone up for a 'quick' round of ddrace?
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> any ovh server is much stronger then what we are using right now anyways, and their game series servers usually start from 65 euros
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I only saw 100â‚¬
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for germany
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh yeah, guess they ran out of cheaper configs or sth
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://www.ovh.de/dedicated_server/infra/1801eg12.xml 78 â‚¬ for Frankfurt
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyways, we have a FRA uo now
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or you mena the Game ones?
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I ment the game ones
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah yeah, game is 100 â‚¬ up
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't really need the game ones anyways, their configs are more then enough
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> let's see how ovh's firewall everyone and their mothers kept asking us to try for ddnet performs
12:38 <@heinrich5991> deen: btw, even if travis fails, bors merges the PR onto current master and checks whether *that* builds
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> FRA is also fine for german players
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you should keep the france server
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 can you have a look on #1220 and #1224
13:11 <@heinrich5991> btw, do you know the fish shell, deen?
13:12 <@heinrich5991> it doesn't have the "> multiple-files.*" feature, but other than that, it's a nice shell that doesn't require configuration :)
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, the idea is that we will look how the anti-ddos works against our attack patterns
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen france starts to lag too
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i suggest ask @qshar what hoster he has. KoG FRA always works perfectly
13:43 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: do you find `Index = Index < 0 ? Find("default") : Index;` clearer?
13:44 <@heinrich5991> the `if` immediately tells me that the function doesn't mess with the index if it's valid
13:45 <+Learath2> I do, but others might not, it's just the way I always normalize things so I immediately know what it does
13:45 <+Learath2> yeah keep the if
13:46 <+Learath2> I like one-liners for these kinds of things that you always do
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 what do i need to change for my PR?
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> replace by that one line from you?
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nothing, it's fine this way
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so you will merge it like that?
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah sure
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay^^
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 if you change your UI and add that X you have only 3 buttons, wouldnt that look odd? i have another preview (it is vanilla skins but with sunglasses) if you want you can add it and then there are 4 buttons again.^^
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 if you change your UI and add that X you have only 3 buttons, wouldnt that look odd? i have another pefix (it is vanilla skins but with sunglasses) if you want you can add it and then there are 4 buttons again.^^
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I actually don't want to add another skin set
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok ðŸ˜ƒ
13:52 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: mind taking a look at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1223 while you're at it? ^^
13:53 <+Learath2> okay but that's the last one :D
13:53 <@heinrich5991> thanks <3
13:56 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: maybe return a pointer from endswith aswell?
13:56 <@heinrich5991> we could do that. which one?
13:56 <@heinrich5991> start of the suffix?
13:56 <+Learath2> start of the suffix yeah
14:08 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: done
14:08 <@heinrich5991> (rebased due to merge conflicts with timakro's PR)
14:09 <+Learath2> merged
14:10 <@heinrich5991> thanks for taking the time :)
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @deen add 20-30â‚¬ to that 78â‚¬
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> The problem with ovh firewall is the low capacity of adding rule
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> You can't filtee u32 and place a rate limit
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> You can't filter with u32 and place a rate limit
14:24 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: `bors r=Learath2` what does this one mean?
14:24 <@heinrich5991> consider this reviewed by Learath2
14:25 <@heinrich5991> I fixed a collision with another PR
14:26 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: https://bors.tech/documentation/
14:35 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: oh fuck "ADD . /ddnet"
14:35 <@heinrich5991> I guess I'm supposed to execute this in the ddnet directory :D
14:35 <+Learath2> oh yeah sorry, I wanted to make it possible to build whatever you have, not just the github master
14:36 <@heinrich5991> sounds good, and it was probably obvious
14:36 <@heinrich5991> but I downloaded the Dockerfile and executed it in a empty temp directory ^^
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 make your UI ready :p
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not right now, have other things to do
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oki
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the ddnet client i compile myself ignore storage.cfg
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wtf
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where's your custom storage.cfg?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it keeps putting its shit into appdata
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its in the cmakebuild folder
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so where the .exe is
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do you start your client?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> via msvs?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> double click
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mh
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it worked
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bot
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not anymore
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mh.......
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like it might be the commit
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that could be true because
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `str_startswith`
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i just grapped the latest release
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> erm
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the latest version from github
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> latest source
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> before ive done that it worked
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 didnt oyu test it?
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, tbh
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just fixed the obvious bug
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```diff
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>              if(pLineWithoutPrefix)
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>              {
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> -                AddPath(pLine);
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> +                AddPath(pLineWithoutPrefix);
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>              }
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut fixed
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nice
18:47 <+Learath2> deen || heinrich5991: My ssh key from this computer doesn't seem to have root everywhere
19:23 <@deen> Learath2: so? ssh ddnet.tw and go from there
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> DDNet FRA, RUS, Chile and Brazil are down. Is there common between these issues?
19:28 <+Learath2> deen: I don't have root there on this key either :P I apparently only have this one on GER
19:29 <+Learath2> did someone copy things around?
19:29 <+Learath2> also deen root@ddnet.tw doesn't have root at leaf servers iirc
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @RafaelFF FRA, RUS, Chile are being DoSed by one person, the pattern on Brazil looks different and has been going on for longer
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> DoS or DDos?
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Can't tell from here
19:32 <+Learath2> brazil kept removing the iptables rule I added
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> one server with spoofing would be enough to create that kind of load though
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The attack on GER, RUS and FRA is spoofed dos (ddos)
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there is no repeating ip
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> why is it lagging so much then?
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because it's hard to handle that many packets reasonably
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> creating a shitload of useless packets is easier than parsing them, decoding and deciding if they make sense
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ddnet-multithreaded soon
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I implemented recvmmsg btw
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> didn't seem to help though, still spending most time in kernel
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the linux network stack cant do much more then 50m per core if i remember from that article on cloudflare blog
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen how do you bench this btw
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> look at load during attack, stayed same
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> look at htop -> nearly all in kernel
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> should we put opening braces on their own line in ddnet code or is both fine?
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> curly braces
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> yes, on seperate line
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> would ddnet accept a pull request that you can zoom on BlockWorlds (BW) and have the eyewheel there?
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will just give it a try xD
