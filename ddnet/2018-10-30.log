00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think 0.6.5 also includes a very big CONNECT packet to increase the cost of reflection
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao what is shift left click supposed to do?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> in editor that is
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> draw a brush ?
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What if you have nothing selected?
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Currently it just crashes 😛
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I guess it shouldn't do anything then
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The old behaviour before it started crashing was that it painted tile 1 instead
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao should I restore it or should I make it do nothing
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> sounds more logical to place nothing than a tile you didn’t select
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah thought so but maybe it's some weird mappers trick everyone uses and I break their flow. You never know, better safe then sorry 😛
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> can only speak for myself there, but should be fine
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it can probably even fuck you up if you thought nothing would happen and then there is a bunch of hookables 😄
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heh now it only crashes if not attached to a debugger...
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> shift on empty
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u currently select "air" and use it to clean
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> right?
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use it a lot
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if i got it right
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nah literally no brush, shift drag
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, found an oob access
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> oh yea maybe ryozuki is right
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ah no nvm
18:17 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #1368: Fix editor crash (master...dd_pr_shiftcrash) https://git.io/fxdwX
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Bojidar Marinov ^^
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the better solution would be to just not call `FillSelection` if `m_Brush.m_lLayers.size() == 0` but HMH left a comment about how `.isEmpty()` didn't work well for `FIllSelection` so I wasn't sure.
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> @Learath2 I think no... Maybe (m_Readonly || (Empty && pBrush->m_Type != LAYERTYPE_TILES))
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> or something of the sort
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> since otherwise, the `if (Empty)` later on becomes useless
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh yeah, I think the `if(Empty)`later on sounds stupid though
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why set the tiles to 1 when we don't even have a brush?
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean calling FillSelection with gibberish then just hoping the function doesn't use it sounds stupid to me
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> well, IDK
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> in this case, Empty should be removed from the parameter list
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish @HMH was here 😛 It's mostly his code
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aaand as always the git blame goes to copy refactor to trunk for the Empty thing
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok, I think I have some significant amount of free time now. What would you like me to work on? Porting DDNet to 0.7? (I'm not doing this without a good plan) Accounts? Getting the Issue count down?
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Issues sounds good to me personally
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and you had some unfinished PR about reserved names
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but i guess it's more fun to work on something new, so do that if you prefer
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just have to make sure that it's something we actually want, not sure if 0.7 fits that bill
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The reserved names thing I think I'll close and add a scoreboard colour for authed people
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1367 maybe you know why this happens
20:50 <+Learath2> I checked around for this a bit, couldn't really figure out why
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> don't waste your time on porting to 0.7 xd
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> +1
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thanks for fixing the editor stuff btw 😛
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean I have an idea about the sensitivity thing but not sure
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Somehow it feels less cool to leave my name out of DDNet website now that Elon Musk does the same: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-10-30/elon-musk-isn-t-the-nothing-of-tesla
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1055653541317042177
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> real elon musk
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see how the editor mouse moves faster when it uses the exact same code as the menu for rendering the mouse 🤔
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont get it too
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 but if u look at it, the cursor is smaller, it feels like editor has 2x resolution
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah, It explicitly renders the cursor smaller
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `IGraphics::CQuadItem QuadItem(mx, my, 24, 24);` menus.cpp
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `IGraphics::CQuadItem QuadItem(mx, my, 16, 16);` editor.cpp
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😵
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought maybe the render function was called twice accidentally which would move the mouse one extra time, but that doesn't seem to be the case :/
21:36 <+Learath2> also it doesn't seem to be exactly 2x the sensitivity :/
21:38 <+Learath2> feels more like 4x
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ZOOOOOOZ
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @onby look this
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :thonkery:
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> soon someone will ask for aths smoother aim
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> xddd
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this mouse sens thing is mind boggling
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> instead of adding anti bot they add zooz shit from ath
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :ddnet: :GWfroggyWeSmart:
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> smooth zooz has nothing todo with cheats. Its super usefull for moviemakers c:
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon do you have a 0.7 built? If so can you check if the mouse sens issue happens on there?
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or anyone else that has 0.7 built
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> I agree with snail btw
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> on mac?
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On any os, the mouse seems to move faster in editor
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like 4x faster
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> like a fresh 0.7 build from current github?
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i can build one
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> My mouse is faster in editor even in 0.6 lul
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but ms is always fucked in tw
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Gwendal well yeah the bug is in 0.6 I just want to know if it also exists in 0.7
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i bought multiple laptops to play tw and i had no success yet and since i am not at home where my tw machine lives i have nothing with me that can run tw properly
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Oh right
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so i can take an older rls
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if it doesn't I'll check how it was fixed. If not I'll ask someone in #teeworlds to take a look
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/releases
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> linux and windows are released on github
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u can test it there
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I could test it I wouldn't ask for help now would I? 😦
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk maybe u didn tknow
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why cant u test it
22:03 <+Learath2> Only have my mac for now
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well as i said teeworlds is always fucked up for me xd
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i tested an older 0.7 release on macOS and it seems to be a bit faster in editor
22:04 <+Learath2> Okay I'm out of ideas. Anyone figures it out they can have 10$ in bitcoin :P
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh bridge is still one way
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only have a mac for now that's why I can't really test it
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also ```22:04 <+Learath2> Okay I'm out of ideas. Anyone figures it out they can have 10$ in bitcoin :P```
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> pf if i figure it out i want to be able to give you bitcoin and you pay my vps because it doesnt accepts my btcs lul
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why are you not able to test it on your mac?
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 is the irc spam over?
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao yeah havent seen it in a while
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> unblocked the bridge then
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no release for osx and I don't really want to bother getting the libraries and stuff in place
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> `        if(CtrlShiftKey(KEY_E, LastE))
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby>         {
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby>             g_Config.m_ClEditor = g_Config.m_ClEditor^1;
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby>             Input()->MouseModeRelative();
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby>             Input()->SetIMEState(true);
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby>         }`
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is it the MouseModeRelative? xd
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 u should flw me on github great free daily content
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1524
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i provided a build but nobody wanted to put it in the release
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @ChillerDragon go add smooth zooz
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i wont dev or play tw until december @snail ._.
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but then i can surly try to add the zooz ❤
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby hmm, I'll check
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hey btw @snail when did u last play teeworlds?
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> dunno
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> few weeks ago i guess
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> rly busy atm
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> adding zooz = konsti
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is stackoverflow down/erroring for u too?
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant live without it omg
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > is it the MouseModeRelative? xd
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that was also my guess last time I looked into it
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> alright my special character issue seems to be related to the fact that i'm building my server on armv6h 😦 i'll keep digging
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @♪♫ tried -fsigned-char ?
