12:36 < Savander> hi
12:45 < cris272> hey, deen, when we play with dummy, you can close eyes of the unplayed tee, like when we spectate
12:57 <@deen> hi
12:58 < Savander> Console have history, until exit the game, but RCON Console have history until disconnect from server. Why? I can't login to another server and press arrow up/down to check what i did?:/ 
12:58 <@deen> hm, not so easy
12:58 < Savander> F1 Console*
12:58 <@deen> since the server doesn't know anything about dummy
12:58 <@deen> so the client would have to go to spec mode for the dummy, but then inputs, like the hammerfly don't work any longer
12:59 <@deen> Savander: because it's another server, makes sense to me
13:00 < Savander> i think, you should can check what you did or repeat command on another server without write it again.
13:03 < cris272> ok deen
13:03 < Nimda> Killstreak 2 by Tuna just released on Solo at 2014-10-19 13:02

13:18 < Savander> woah xD?
13:18 < Savander> heh funny thing
13:19 < Savander> Roll the cursor on the server on server list
13:19 < Savander> press f1 or f2
13:19 < Savander> and press two times 
13:19 < Savander> left mouse button

13:20 < Savander> oh it works with everything hehe, ;D
13:23 <@deen> yeah, inputs often reach the wrong place in client
14:05 <@deen> BeaR: i cleaned up some compiler warnings, i hope the mem_free is correct: http://git.io/WcQ-5g
14:07 < BeaR> hm, well unfortunatly I used mem_alloc for embedded and new for external :d
14:08 < BeaR> could you switch this one to mem_alloc? https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/game/editor/io.cpp#L654
14:09 < BeaR> btw should I rather save the uncompressed audio file? not sure if wavpack could crash on decoding
14:09 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/txigMA
14:09 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 d213a30 def: Change new to mem_alloc (thanks BeaR)
14:10 <@deen> uncompressed would be too big I think
14:10 <@deen> maybe we should add an opus decoder :P
14:11 < BeaR> what's the advantage?
14:11 <@deen> opus is small
14:11 <@deen> http://www.opus-codec.org/comparison/
14:12 < BeaR> looks nice
14:14 <@deen> not sure if it's worth it, but wavpack is pretty huge
14:21 <@deen> would also be nice to have indexed pngs, but need to keep backwards compatibility to other clients
14:22 < Savander> GIF could be very nice..:c But impossible i guess?
14:22 < Savander> for vanilla?
14:22 <@EastByte> nope gif is not nice
14:22 <@deen> GIF has huge filesize and only 256 colors per frame
14:22 <@deen> why would that be nice?
14:23 <@deen> PNG is always better afaik
14:23 < Savander> but
14:23 < Savander> for animation
14:23 <@deen> no GIF animations please!
14:23 < BeaR> teeworlds animation system is just poor (:
14:23 <@deen> you could do animated PNGs, but i guess it's not teeish
14:23 < Savander> hoh?
14:23 < Savander> animated png?
14:23 <@deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APNG
14:23 < Savander> why not teeish
14:23 < Savander> ppl make animated waters etc
14:24 <@deen> the animation would have limited fps
14:24 < Savander> in envelopes
14:24 < Savander> btw. ye animation system in teeworlds is poor 
14:24 <@deen> when you make an ingame animation it looks nice, GIF would look jerky
14:24 <@EastByte> it's not poor
14:24 <@EastByte> the envelopes editor is poor though
14:25 < BeaR> no rigging, no IK, (no bezier curves), can't switch attachments, ..  :D
14:28 < Savander> woah
14:28 < Savander> change envelopes to smth like affter effects have 
14:28 < Savander> lol
14:29 < BeaR> whats the difference ?
14:29 < Savander> keyframers, timeline
14:29 < BeaR> (never worked with AE)
14:29 < Savander> xD
14:29 < Savander> bezier curvers
14:29 < Savander> scripts to animation xD..
14:30 < BeaR> added bezier curves to 0.7 (:
14:30 < Savander> and
14:30 < Savander> you can connects
14:30 < Savander> two another settings
14:31 < Savander> the if position is changed then rotation will be changed to or smth like that
14:31 < Savander> basic 
14:35 < BeaR> heh, save the audio sample compressed as .wv ~27mb, via teeworlds huffmann encoding ~38mb
14:35 < BeaR> expected more tbh
14:36 <@EastByte> you expected more for raw audio data -> lossless huffman?
14:36 <@EastByte> I would be happy with that
14:37 < BeaR> I expected huffman would give me ~50mb or more :D
14:37 <@EastByte> haha
14:40 < BeaR> hm actually huffman compression: 5% advantage over raw data \o/
14:42 < BeaR> well the huffman table is build for compressing the network data, so basically compressing chat strings :D
14:42 <@EastByte> and for erasing null bytes
14:43 < BeaR> y
14:43 < BeaR> how's the progress on your account system (: ?
14:45 <@EastByte> I'm a little bit stuck in asyncio and python
14:46 <@EastByte> (for the datagram channel)
14:47 <@EastByte> and I somehow need to do tcp socket polling in tw
14:48 <@EastByte> net_socket_read_wait() only supports one file descriptor
14:48 <@EastByte> :q
14:48 <@EastByte> ups
14:49 <@deen> select?
14:49 <@EastByte> yea, would need to replace net_socket_read_wait()
14:49 <@EastByte> oh and the client doesn't even do polling
14:54 <@EastByte> and in python (asyncio transport) I have to set the write buffer limits (low and high) and wait for pause_writing() / resume_writing() for flow control
14:54 <@EastByte> https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-protocol.html
14:54 <@EastByte> I'm little bit busy right now though
14:55 < Savander> Woah?
14:55 < Savander> git commit -m "/rank with some one fixed" -> on github -> C:/Program Files (x86)/Git/rank with some one fixed
14:55 < Savander> lol
14:56 <@deen> what does git log say?
14:57 <@deen> I'd think that's some weird git on Windows behaviour, not github
14:57 < Savander> https://github.com/savander/zcatch/commit/054ced91777c7355a65853efbcc2d4c5556a8b6a
14:58 < Savander> don't know, i use pure git
14:58 <@deen> or even better, it's probably cmd on windows doing something weird
14:58 < Savander> maybe, weird..
15:02 <@EastByte> windows and weird, havn't heard that before
15:02 < Savander> :D
15:02 < laxa> Learath2: you there ? :p
15:15 < BeaR> deen: can you update wavpack to the latest version? (except you want to move to opus :D )
15:16 <@deen> sure i want to move to opus!
15:16 <@deen> why, BeaR?
15:16 < BeaR> increase security
15:16 <@deen> ah, i thought new features
15:20 <@deen> there is no update as far as i can see
15:20 <@deen> http://www.wavpack.com/downloads.html#sources
15:20 <@deen> TW uses the Tiny Decoder
15:20 <@deen> current version is 4.40
15:38 < laxa> Nice !
15:38 < laxa> Finally configured my smtp authentification <3
15:43 < Learath2> laxa: i r here now
15:43 < laxa> Learath2: I have done what I wanted :)
15:43 < laxa> don't need your help anymore :p
15:43 < Learath2> :(
15:43 < Learath2> okay then :(
15:43 < laxa> I have dovecot running to give auth system for postfix
15:43 < laxa> all working fine now :)

16:27 <@deen> i added the static stuff to get working binaries for linux, not sure if it even worked
16:27 <@deen> i still don't know how to properly build binaries that are compatible with all linux distributions
16:28 <@deen> for now i just use an old debian version to compile
16:39 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
16:40 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
17:00 < Savander> Any contact to television hosts?
17:00 < Savander> ehm, teevision :P
17:01 <@deen> no
17:12 <@deen> nuborn and m apparently got rocket and hammer prediction working
17:12 <@deen> would be nice to get into ddnet client
17:15 <@deen> this is the http-inside-udp attack we're getting btw: http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ssdp-ddos-attacks-on-the-rise/
17:17 <@deen> someone should find a vulnerability in these home routers and patch their firmware to disable ssdp
17:17 <@EastByte> that would be the easiest and best solution, yea
17:18 <@deen> even the users will be happy since their internet stop lagging
17:20 <@deen> 16 million home routers affected, nice
17:23 <@deen> that makes me wonder, could you use teeworlds servers for ddos amplification?
17:23 <@deen> can you request a map download to another ip?
17:23 <@EastByte> has been discussed before
17:23 <@deen> or do you need a handshake before?
17:24 <@EastByte> the handshake seems to be doable over ip spoofing
17:24 <@deen> ouch
17:24 <@EastByte> but map download is request<->response right?
17:24 <@deen> at least you can get a big chunk of the map without a response
17:24 <@deen> that's how fast download works i guess
17:24 <@EastByte> hm yea right
17:24 <@deen> you can probably get crazy amplification values
17:25 <@deen> scary
17:25 <@EastByte> what about 64pl server status?
17:25 <@deen> ah yeah, that's big too!
17:25 <@EastByte> isn't that small aswell
17:25 <@deen> and even easier to get
17:25 <@deen> quakenet has the same problem
17:26 <@deen> https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-017A
17:26 <@deen> not quakenet, quake network*
17:27 <@EastByte> ah
17:27 <@deen> ddnet server has some limit for a single ip
17:28 <@deen> so it doesn't send too much, but I don't think this works for server status requests already
17:28 <@EastByte> it has a dst ip limit?
17:28 <@deen> only for players who are ingame iirc =/
17:28 <@EastByte> hmmmm
17:29 <@EastByte> do you think it's a good solution to get rid of all non-handshake protocols?
17:30 <@deen> no
17:30 <@deen> server status requests would take too long
17:30 <@EastByte> anyway amplification attacks currently are not fixable at all
17:30 <@deen> i think they should just be limited to something reasonable, like once per second
17:30 <@EastByte> and they are easy to block using a hardawre firewall :P
17:30 <@deen> they are not so easily blocked once they're > 100 gbit/s
17:30 <@EastByte> oh yea, a limit on serverside is a good idea
17:31 <@deen> but then you need to remember the ips
17:31 <@deen> and you could attack the server by spamming from many ips and filling its memory
17:31 <@EastByte> well, remembering the ip for ~5 seconds isn't heavy
17:31 <@deen> yeah, probably fine
17:33 <@deen> I'm blocking ssdp with kernel filter now
17:34 <@deen> won't do much good, but anyway
17:34 <@EastByte> hm it would be a great benefit for everyone if hardware firewalls would get cheaper
17:34 <@deen> also, 10 gbit/s network isn't all that useful when the cpu/vm can't handle that much^^
17:35 <@deen> it would be a great benefit for us if datafabrik finally got theirs
17:35 <@EastByte> I mean ovh build up something on their own
17:35 <@EastByte> on processing unit per ethernet slot
17:35 <@EastByte> or something
17:35 <@EastByte> one*
17:35 <@deen> usually the problem is that the network is just overloaded
17:35 <@deen> so a firewall wouldn't help
17:36 <@EastByte> it doesn't overload is firewalls are between early nodes
17:36 <@deen> ah yeah
17:36 <@deen> but they don't install firewalls there, do they?
17:36 <@EastByte> I don't think so
17:36 <@EastByte> but if they would get cheaper...
17:37 <@EastByte> could be a standard then
17:37 <@EastByte> so you can buy firewall rules at some nodes in the internet
17:37 <@deen> yeah, that would be cool
17:37 <@deen> and easy to block ssdp, ntp, dns attacks
17:37 <@EastByte> yea
17:39 <@deen> hm, we should have gotten ddos protection on GER 1 week ago
17:40 <@deen> guess I'll ask again
17:40 <@EastByte> hm now I know what I can build using my atmega8
17:40 <@deen> haha
17:40 <@EastByte> a 1 mbit/s hardware firewall
17:40 <@deen> great!
17:40 <@EastByte> yea L)
17:40 <@EastByte> :)
17:40 <@deen> you should sell it to DE-CIX
17:40 <@EastByte> probably
17:41 <@deen> but that's probably the problem
17:41 <@deen> hardware firewalls are way too slow for DE-CIX and friends
17:42 <@EastByte> well I thought it can be "parallelized"
17:43 <@EastByte> their repeaters can forward the packets to specific procession units
17:43 <@EastByte> and from those you need millions
17:48 <@EastByte> hm as far as I know home dsl providers are blocking specific packets when it comes to flooding
17:48 <@deen> yes, then it's clearly expensive when you need millions of million dollar equipment
17:48 <@EastByte> in mass production nothing is expensive :P
17:49 <@deen> NSA should have that kind of hardware in mass production :P
17:49 <@EastByte> ^^
17:50 <@EastByte> right
17:51 <@EastByte> hm let's build our own datacenter in ger
17:51 <@deen> sure
17:54 <@deen> something like OVH is really missing in germany

20:16 <@deen> because no tournament on ger
20:17 <@deen> hm, protection not working
20:19 <@deen> now it was activated, still laggy
20:19 <@EastByte> and hallowed is giving him attention >.<
20:29 <@EastByte> wow he wants to attack hitbox
20:46 < Java_> Hey Guys
20:46 < Java_> Guess who's back from the netherlands.
20:46 <@EastByte> hi Java_ 
20:46 <@EastByte> deen: best moderation ever :D
20:46 < Java_> And my conclusion about amsterdam: The only culture consists of drugs and whores!^^
20:46 < Java_> Could someone invite me to the private channel, please?
20:47 <@EastByte> I'm not in there
20:47 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: can you?
20:47 < Java_> Thanks!
20:48 <@EastByte> me too please :)
20:55 <@deen> it's a wonder we're up at all
20:55 <@deen> 2 dedis down at HH again
21:00 <@EastByte> deen: wtf stream
21:00 <@deen> hm, they downed hitbox?
21:00 <@deen> great...
21:00 <@EastByte> or they found hallowed's ip
21:01 <@deen> hm yeah, can't find hallowed on any server anymore
21:02 <@EastByte> that's interesting
21:02 <@EastByte> he should atleast idling there
21:04 <@EastByte> not sure whether its isp forced reconnect
21:04 <@EastByte> oh vali is there
21:06 <@EastByte> deen: okay that's bad
21:07 <@EastByte> we should tell hallowed to turn skype off
21:07 <@deen> yeah, vali & Captain Teemo were in team during tournament
21:23 <@deen> but they actually seem to be playing
21:23 <@EastByte> yea, I don't think they are attacking anymore
21:24 <@EastByte> did you make a firewall rule for ssdp amplification?
21:26 <@EastByte> iirc the hallowed faker was the guy with that kind of attack
21:28 <@deen> yes
21:33 < Nimda> SunDay 2 by Gridwyn just released on Moderate at 2014-10-19 19:58
21:49 <@deen> Bad Tournament =/
21:50 <@EastByte> nvm
21:52 < Savander> why?
21:52 < Savander> map was really good
21:52 < Savander> maybe some lags at start
21:52 < Savander> but later everything was good
21:54 <@deen> i heard lags all the time
21:54 <@deen> even playing on FRA instead of GER is bad for many
22:09 <@EastByte> hm I bet there are people out there who want to test their server infrastructure against attacks
22:10 <@EastByte> maybe we can lend a server weekly
22:11 <@EastByte> just telling them that we host events with about 500 players online and we are searching for a sponsor
22:13 <@EastByte> we should ask in ovh forums :)
22:16 <@deen> you can do it, i don't think that will work
22:18 <@EastByte> hm, an activity of ~500 players for ~4 hours, who would say no :)
22:20 <@EastByte> moreover everyone wants to support an open event for an opensource game
23:46 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went down!
23:59 <@deen> they're finally shutting down GER because of the attacks =/
