11:29 <+DMTee> hola
11:34 <+Ryozuki> hi
11:34 <+Ryozuki> esp?
11:35 <+DMTee> si
11:39 <+Ryozuki> from?
13:30 <+DMTee> halo again, is there a reason u cant login to ger ddnet servers for a long time?
13:30 <+DMTee> some ddos protection?
13:31 <+DMTee> or is my ip somehow blocked?
13:34 <+jxsl13> ger is being ddos'd for a while now
13:34 <+jxsl13> as it seems
13:52 <@EastByte> we constantly under ddos and the server provider is doing some weird filtering
14:19 <+xandaros> Do they really have to filter out all the traffic? Our server provider manages to filter only the high-traffic clients when we are being DDOS'd (Though admittedly it wasn't all that effective)
14:26 <@EastByte> nfoservers cannot distuingish between clients, it only filters based on signatures in each packet and we are receiving legitimate- and ddos-traffic while both are looking similar
14:34 <+DMTee> ok thx :)
14:34 <+DMTee> eastbyte arent you the guy who was involved in teeworlds-netzwerk?
14:35 <+DMTee> you  hosted my servers at the beginning :D

19:52 <+Learath2> well no other point in being a certified asshat 
20:07 <+Songoku> hi m< ckiwnt is not connectong to some DDNET-servers anymore, any idea?
20:07 <+Songoku> my client...

21:20 <@Nimda> Tatooine 2 by Gridwyn & Rapture just released on Brutal at 2016-09-10 21:17
21:59 <+ochristi> I do not get it, what is the point in attacking a community run server? Only thing I can imagine, it must be a very sad person.
22:31 <+Ryozuki> Yes
22:32 <+Ryozuki> But i think he wants players and dont know other way than ddos
22:37 <+ochristi> the one hosting "...Unofficial"?
23:05 <+Learath2> can you believe the amount of money he is pouring in to ddosing ddnet
23:39 <+Ryozuki> Idk hope he get poor and live on the street, but im sure its a kid using fathers credit card
