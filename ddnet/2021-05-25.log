00:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> doing PRs means i have to either stop mapping with 25% of my time, playing 25%, server admin 25%, and eating and sleeping 25% xd
00:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oops i forgot working
00:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well, maybe it's accurate like this
00:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what good is sleeping. cut that üòâ
00:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> true
00:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what are you admin'ing?
00:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://xkcd.com/320/
00:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> teehou.se servers
00:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i need to set mariadb up but it's frustrating
00:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> my cmakelists.txt doesnt recognize my mariadb install
00:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> oh yeah this site needs a lot of maintenance
00:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> xd
00:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does it say? @lynn
00:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no, not the web server
00:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the game servers
00:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> mm ill have to show you later
00:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but it doesnt recognize some directive, or mariadb is not found there, cant remember which
00:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when did you last try? I simplified something there a couple of months before
00:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when did you last try? I simplified something there a couple of months ago
00:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oo yeah it was after that. ill let you know later, i have to do something for work now :P
00:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> w√∂rk w√∂rk
00:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @lynn do u know about the wonders of tailwindcss?
00:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yes i love tailwind
00:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i have never used it on a project but i have encouraged its use at work
00:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use it at https://edgarluque.com/ + rust backend
00:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i should have used it for teehou.se but maybe i still can
00:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> nice
00:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stupid embeds
00:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> xd
00:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> incredibly large
00:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what they are adding is even more awesome
00:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they added a JIT  compiler
00:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can do stuff like mx-[100px]
00:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> works on mobile too
00:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it will generate it
00:10 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> nicely done
00:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thanks :music:
00:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode>
00:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> neat lil site
00:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> teehouse looks good, altho i like more contrast
00:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> o this is an interesting feature
00:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah
00:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i just tried to do it quickly
00:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> material ui or blueprint ‚ù§Ô∏è
00:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I like tailwind too tho
00:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @NeXus material and bootstrap make the website look rly generic always
00:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
00:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i agree
00:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> what
00:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i can smell a bootstrap website from miles off
00:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> its the same as tailwind but better
00:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
00:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> you design your own theme
00:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ofc
00:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> you dont use the default boilerplates
00:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tailwind is way better lol
00:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> lol no
00:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> havent heard of blueprint
00:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does bootstrap remove unused css classes?
00:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats a pro already
00:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> and bootstrap is something way different
00:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> who speaks about fucking bootstrap√ü
00:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
00:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> did you ever use materiual ui
00:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
00:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i used it long time ago along with react
00:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://material-ui.com/customization/theming/
00:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Yes
00:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> You create Themeproviders
00:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> changing colors doesnt make it stand off
00:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it looks like any material web
00:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> bethesda.net and medium.com both use material-ui
00:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> but yeah just can change the color :nouis1:
00:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> also I dont believe you ever used material ui
00:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> and randomly bringing up bootstrap even though I never talked about it
00:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> stupid convo
00:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> xd
00:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it seems more heavyweight than tailwind, i think that's the appeal of tailwind for me
00:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I love tailwind dont get me wrong
00:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> When you have a good structure in react you should only import modules when needed anyways
00:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah u said blueprint
00:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i misread it totally
00:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tbh
00:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
00:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Might be a bit more heavy but frameworks like next.js do remove unused css aswell
01:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> You probably had teeskins in mind
01:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> And its a shit site I agree
01:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> 3-4 years old now
01:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I actually did start to rewrite teeskins from scratch last year mid covid when I had a lot of time (with material ui) :p
01:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/846525231329968189/unknown.png
01:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> But I lost motivation lul as always
01:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that looks nice
01:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Yeah design wasn't done but looks way better as the current version. But the main part is functionality which I really like. You can filter like everything, do a search combined with authors + asset type if you want
01:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> You can basicly click everything and it filters
01:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> and I finally seperated backend and frontend in two different repos
01:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> lul
01:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> You can basicly click everything and it filters in real time
02:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/846548547338895422/unknown.png
02:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> my brain is dead
02:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i couldn't remember what i was doing in my minecraft server directory so i did "git status"
02:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im seriously screwed up
05:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> me at 3 in the morning
09:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <pult1133> ALL PLAYERS WHO PLAY IN DDRACENETWORK MAKE NICK WITH "The last" WE MAKE FAMILY THE LAST AMOGUS-(ES)
09:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
09:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> u said that in every channel? .-.
09:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what time is it in murica
09:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u ever sleep
09:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
09:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> 00:14
09:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i barely sleep xD
09:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah its not that late
09:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i sleep from like 3-4 to like 10
09:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> go to work at 10 from my pc lol
09:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
11:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <becc> `You must install SDL to compile the Teeworlds client`
11:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <becc> Keep getting this error message
11:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <becc> I am on Debian 11 and used `sudo apt install build-essential cmake git libfreetype6-dev libsdl2-dev libpnglite-dev libwavpack-dev python3` to install all dependencies including `libsdl2-dev`

11:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <becc> I can run the server successfully
12:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That doesn't look like DDNet code, did you try `cmake -DCLIENT=OFF`?
14:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <becc> oh my fault, ddnet works fine
18:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> fps lock option somewhere in settings would be good
18:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> isn't refresh rate slider just that
18:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> (also I think we should make the slider go from 0 to 30 or at least 15 directly instead of having 1 or 2 in there to make it stuck for almost a second.
19:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but we could rename the gfx refresh rate to FPS
19:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs currently it says refresh rate in hz
19:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not very intuitive
20:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> should be cl_download_skin VALUE1?
20:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/846819474455658516/unknown.png
20:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> should be cl_download_skin VALUE1? and then it works?
20:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/846819474455658516/unknown.png
21:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ertan> hwid ban when ?
22:47 <@deen> never
22:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It has to be the path to the skin file, it gets appended
22:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so the skinfile path would be https://tee.world/teeworlds/data/skins/default.png
23:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nooback> oh
