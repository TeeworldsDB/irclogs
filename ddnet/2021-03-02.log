00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it makes a dns request with the IP address
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to a dnsbl server
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which server?
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which server we use is a secret, so it's not so easy to circumvent
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> understandable
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thought that, but was still wondering bcs I might want to add stuff like this to my server
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well technically it's not secret which server we use, we host our own with a script that I did make public iirc
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://gist.github.com/Learath2/c921f906b7c3952f8e3ff17c76d596a4 here it is, you can implement the `Provider` class however you want to check whatever you want
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> o.o
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's extremely impressive how long the switch people managed to keep their exploit to dump the root key private
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The longer they go the more intrigued I become about how they managed to get to it 😛
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 nintendo switch?
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good old consoles that dont encrypt the fcking cartridges
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a pain to emulate modern consoles
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, the 2 people on earth that managed to break it are finally going to make a write-up about it this year since the new switch doesn't use the same secure processor
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i still play on the gba from time to time
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I spent 2-3 weeks trying to dump that key just out of sheer jealousy
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 look at the accounts issue on github
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> is it konsti crying like a baby again or is it konsti insulting people again? if it's either of those I'd rather have breakfast first
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 btw, what do u think about implementing a proper UI for common commands
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g show a proper UI table for top%
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> top5
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and ranks
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that is cached by the client
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like TAB
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u can open it
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could, but it smells like a low impact feature for the work
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nothing like that actually xd
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I replied
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now is time for nutrients
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 imagine encrypted whisper msgs that mods can read
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> *
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> decentralized is the way
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Several platforms implement refutations of Zooko's conjecture, including: Twister (which use Swartz' system with a bitcoin-like system), Blockstack (separate blockchain), Namecoin (separate blockchain), Monero OpenAlias[5] and Ethereum Name Service.
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u know there are decentralized domain names
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well if you trust us the whispers are already not readable by anyone except people with access to the server who can gdb or wireshark them out
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> secure meaningful and decentralized
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://unstoppabledomains.com/
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Notice all the refutations of Zooko's conjecture rely on some kind of blockchain
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets implement teechain then
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "trust us"
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont want to trust u
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, me neither, that's why my main goal was keeping this decentralized
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/816251526275399680/1B_Tbick3pcn5BDpCGo-5LA.png
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://medium.com/@ugChainOfficial/ugchain-decentralized-game-account-system-44c43d9ce23b
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I theorised a couple semi-centralized solutions to this where ddnet would run an official phone book of sorts, it'd require some trust that we don't meddle with the phonebook (which is the problem they solve with blockchain btw) but meddling would be detectable on the client side for people they already know
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly don't want blockchain anywhere near teeworlds code 😛
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it would be fun
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but blockchain is a buzzword
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we just want blocks of merkle trees
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> sell pts for btc
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> xd
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> btw for decentralised dns, how do they decide who owns a name? first come first serve?
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://handshake.org/
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> read more here
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> decentralized certificate authority sounds so much like an oxymoron to me 😄
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll take a look
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > INTERNET NAME TRANSFERS USING COINS TO PREVENT SYBIL ATTACKS
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like if someone is an "authority" it's by definition not decentralized, no? 😄
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Handshake uses a coin system for name registration. The Handshake coin (HNS) is the mechanism by which participants transfer, register, and update internet names. The community will be able to initiate auctions and place bids for top-level domains using HNS or trade their HNS as they see fit, with differing value per name.
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Therefore, Handshake allocates the majority of its initial coins towards the FOSS community with absolutely no obligation attached, as it is this community most relevant with decentralized software and tools. The goal of the initial design was to account for all possible stakeholders. More info.
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually a cool project
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Handshake's value is derived from its network of users. Metcalfe's Law asserts that an increase in userbase increases the value of the network (sub)exponentially. This means that allocation of value to potential developers and users of this system be a benefit to everyone, with network effect derived benefiting all users.
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, do you see at a quick glance how they handle initial registrations?
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> man monospace websites always look cool
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can see how it works out after that, but the initial registration would be what concerns me. Who decides the price of a domain? Who gets a domain? The first one to register it?
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Handshake uses a coin system for name registration. The Handshake coin (HNS) is the mechanism by which participants transfer, register, and update internet names.

11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this?
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the value price is decided by demand
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as in with any auction
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as is*
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Feels like it would add some serious complexity to an otherwise simple solution. If you thinking of doing this for accounts
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh arch linux participates in this
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://handshake.org/grant-sponsors/
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, this is rather difficult to hide complexity, which is when I sort of gave up on decentralized the first time I went implementing this
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can do it the cool way or the boring way
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i rly dont want it to be centralized
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to ddnet
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but also other mods would need to implement support for this
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At the end of the day, when we have a decentralized system we have asymmetric crypto, when you have asymmetric crypto you have massive keys which are impossible for humans to memorize
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I theorised another idea similar to Kerberos where ddnet would be sort of an authentication provider and other mods can authenticate their players aswell
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Could even let users authenticate each other if we get crafty
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. you authenticate with the provider to get a ticket proving who you are, you gimme the ticket, I get the ticket validated by the provider, now I know if you are who you say you are or not
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess something like this could be less centralized, but proper decentralization really looks ugly for the users or relies on blockchain
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> haha can certainly see why it is the boring way. If there is an easier solution for the sexy decentralized version then I am all for it. However, the system is centralized already by virtue that ddnet is the authority of records
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Blockchain ranks when?
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats actually a good use case
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well technically not, there is no way to generate a "proof of finish" 😛
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i wonder how any other party than ddnet can verify it
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway I really want to discuss all this but it's either all transient on discord or extremely slow on github
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well not like we reached any conclusion here
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tho its true making it decentralized is more work
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if we wanted to finish this fast we would just make a simple auth like webs do
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not only more work it's also a technically unsolved problem
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> except for blockchain, which I guess if we wanted we could piggyback off of another blockchain that's large enough to be secure 😛
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> litecoin
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is a game actually
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that uses litecoin
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its a mmo
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unlike 10 mins that btc has for transactions, litecoin has 2.5mins iirc
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.litebringer.com/
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I can only do so much research on this myself. I read a couple dozen papers, I researched how all the authentication models work and how they ensure certain properties. I couldn't find one that looks like what we'd ideally want
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm hoping we can talk on github and figure out what we all want and what we can compromise on to find a model that fits us
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the problem here is that cryptographic keys dont allow easy human identification of someones name?
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That and crypto keys are not recoverable
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i dont care much about the second
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we cant also just have unique names
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We'd need people to store a string of tokens like they do for wallets
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how is that different from storing ur config
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw i think on steam u can use cloud storage for config
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you lose your config, it's a bad day but not the end
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we could save the key with that
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for steam users
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You lose your account key and you lose access to your ranks
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well right now its not like ur ranks are truly urs either
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its just simbolic
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> symbolic
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I also think a local address book is a very weird concept for the users to understand
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🥴
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If there is no authority on names, you could technically friend a fake Aoe and you'd think he is Aoe
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u build a "web of trust"
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like the gpg web says
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean there is a reason we don't all use gpg signed/encrypted mail 😄
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its cuz ppl are windows normies that dont care
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's cuz it's not really that intuitive imo
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im sure there are programs
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to easy manage gpg keys
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thunderbird
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> allows it easily
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if the ddnet client allows to easily manage this for dummies
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need some point of trust, in the gpg format it's a friend
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont see the problem and how it is related to gpg being hard to use
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the point of trust here would be discord
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and admins
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> initially
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and known ppl
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not that gpg is hard to use, it's that the concept is rather slippery imo. The web of trust does not instill much trust in me at all
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Notice how you immediately went to a "central" authority (discord, the admins) instead of relying on the web of trust
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to build the initial trust
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we need discord
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since meeting in person
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or how people that use gpg for mails usually have their websites host the public key
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is a rather hard thing
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Where you can rely on the DNS authority to verify who owns the key
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if the dns authority disappears gg
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the dns authority here cant kow
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> know
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for sure
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who is who initially
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its the same
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u would add the records manually
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, it's a definite possibility. It's just one I don't think the average gamer follows easily
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> trusting discord
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gamers :monkalaugh:
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gamer moment
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This really would be an apocalypse scenario, but it's still recoverable because at the end of the day it's a physical entity that holds the root servers
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have the governments/government organizations acting as a central authority about who actually owns the root servers and we have a point to start building the trust again
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> I am prepared to be shot down for even suggesting this, but what are peoples thoughts on having a 15 minute focused discussion on certain Github Issues? Feels like we could save so much time if done over VoiP with all interested parties. Could use doodle to align times and discord to discuss.

11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are you a native english speaker?
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine not being a native english speaker and having a rly technical discussion, well idk for u but i am much better at writing
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Good point - I suppose it is dependent on how comfortable people are speaking English. The idea is though that it is less about having technical and lengthy discussions. Most of the back/forth is figuring out people's perspectives and agreeing on objectives. E.G. for the /swap PR everyone's thinking isn't too far off but getting agreement on the specific penalty and best way of applying is taking time.

12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean the specific medium of discussion doesn’t really matter that much. Only that it’s real-time and we are all there at the same time. If people are more comfortable with text we can do it here too
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But it’s usually the fact that we are not all at the same place at the same time
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> You are right. It is more of a timing issue than a text vs voice. Then I will change my suggestion with that in mind.

12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’d be great if we could do something like this monthly or weekly even. I’m in for anything that helps progress
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Even better, a weekly non-compulsory session. Can get through the more difficult discussions and align on bigger ideas. I don't want to be the new guy who sets meetings so will wait for others to give their thoughts as well. But if everyone's keen we can use something like Doodle to find a time that works for most.
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> wew
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> i feel offended
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> i want a command that send an emote every second that i can on/off
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> someone can do that for me ? (i dont know anything in cmd tw stuff)
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> sure
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> what mod
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> and you have to compile urself and i won't test xd
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> oh wait u meant client side? you could just bind a bind then (that would be your on/off switch). one of the binds (e.g. hook) you set to `"+hook; emote 3"`, and the other one ("off") would be just `+hook`
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> oh wait u meant client side? you could just bind a bind then (that would be your on/off switch). one of the binds you set to `"+hook; emote 3"`, and the other one ("off") would be just `+hook`
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> TLDR:
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> make one bind that executes:  `bind mouse2 "+hook ; emote 3"` (ur "on" switch)
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> and another one: `bind mouse2 +hook` (ur "off" switch)
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> assuming you have hook bound to mouse2
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> oh wait u meant client side? you could just bind a bind then (that would be your on/off switch).
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> make one bind that executes:  `bind mouse2 "+hook ; emote 3"` (ur "on" switch)
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> and another one: `bind mouse2 +hook` (ur "off" switch)
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> make one bind that executes:  `bind mouse2 "+hook; emote 3"` (ur "on" switch)
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> and another one: `bind mouse2 +hook` (ur "off" switch)
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sounds rather annoying
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> let him, if he does not want to make any friends...
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> shh, let social regulation do its thing
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> i cant bind the two on one key ? like a toggle..
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Could someone please help me understand the database structure? Is there a wiki for it? I know there the SQL import at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet but want to check if there are other tables. 
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> 
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Specifically, looking for a table with the servers and associated country code.
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Zodiac there is no such table AFAIK. it's sv_sql_server_name in the config
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 not entirely sure what you mean by endlessly long, `aD5nkOWIkP+0NiNdYTMtkpgkXG6ZTD5gOUzSozd6o0A=` is a wireguard key. you still can't really expect anyone to memorize it
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking of a non elliptic curve solution when I first envisioned it and those are much longer
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But elliptic curves do indeed make it smaller
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You can download the db and check it out
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Maybe ill add the db structure info to the wiki when i have time
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Btw u can view how a table is made by "show create table" or smth like that
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> In mysql
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> What are you trying to do?
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Yeah thanks, I did and was helpful. I was just wondering whether there was another table specifically for DDNet captures your active servers, names and regions. Based on yours and heinrich's response there isn't 🙂
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> I'm trying to create a SQL statement similar to that of https://ddnet.tw/ranks/ger/ where you get the ranks by country. 
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> 
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Looking around the code, I think it is generated as a script:
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/scripts/ranks.py
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ah ye
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Deen may know
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Cool, will wait for his advice. I think I got it but there are a few edge cases that I might need help with.
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Zodiac Yeah, it's just the ranks.py and filters record_race by `Server like "GER%"`
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> I guessed as much. Thought the actual server name was used in the search but that makes things easier. I'm trying to get the same result from the server. Should be easier enough now to implement. Thanks 👍

20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> sometimes we need find the other side (from 2) before we go into ,i  hope put  a fast way for find it
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> like writ /spec cp2
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/816386432494338098/unknown.png
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> Tutorial vids in the game menu
20:10 <+ChillerDragon> could already be achived when my pr gets merged :troll:
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Boti.> Tutorial Tab in the game menu and friends menu
20:11 <+ChillerDragon> set_view in combination with eval_if and a community db could allow for ah well yikes only one cp bind we still miss variables or functions
20:12 <+ChillerDragon> @hussainx3 which cp2 tho? the first that is found? what is if cp2 is in two places in the map?
20:13 <+ChillerDragon> iterate throught them on every /spec cp2?
20:13 <+ChillerDragon> also would collide with spectating the player cp2
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the general idea is good though, I think
20:13 <+ChillerDragon> yea sounds useful
20:14 <+ChillerDragon> might make it even more userfriendly by not taking a number?
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 😊
20:14 <+ChillerDragon> but use the closes in tele and get the first out tele
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> client side tho? So a chat command is weird. Thats so weird in 0.6
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> 0.7*
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> more a console cmd
