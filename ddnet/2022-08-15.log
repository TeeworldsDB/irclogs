07:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Wtf
07:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Girls want to chat with you
07:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Idk why i even clicked lol
08:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Girls never want to chat with u. Don’t believe
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://www.thegamer.com/unity-ceo-game-dev-monetization-fcking-idiots/
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently we are all fucking idiots
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> im a fucking idiot and im proud
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> well, if tw would be a mobile game, I would say the same :uhoh:
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Also, entertain > monetization
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No. Just money. Make more money
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> be bill gates, lesson learned
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it just shows you how poisoned the well of "the game dev industry" is
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> it always was, since you were able to buy games on cds or floppies
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> but since internet made it able to play games for free, which is drivven by developers who wanted others to have fun, it kinda went on this direction of "finding other ways to make money"
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you enjoying making games and don’t focus on monetization? Fuck you, are you braindead? Money is where it’s at. - CEO of major company
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :kek:
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> only if you make it from scrap
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Did the timecp command stop working?
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <teini94> isnt /timecp for creating like new checkpoints but only for the time since u joined the server and gets removed after?
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <teini94> 
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <teini94> and has nothing to do with these "leaderboards"
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> checkpoint times are saved to our database
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> and AFAIK the timecp command queries the fastest cp time from a player directly from our db
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If so, then it's a bug and I broke it
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕵𝖔𝖊𝖑> can someone explain to me why you want to remove the cl_show_quads binds?
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> because people press it inadvertantly and don't know how to revert it back
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it's just a bind, the option is still here
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝕵𝖔𝖊𝖑> OK thanks
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It was a mistake to have a bind for it and the only way to remove a bind for everyone is to rename the bound command. People who use it will have to rebind it manually.
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> or just keep the bind for old people but update it for new clients? ig people had time today to find out the key
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> or just keep the default bind for old people but remove it for new clients (next update)? ig people had time today to find out the key
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice easter egg
