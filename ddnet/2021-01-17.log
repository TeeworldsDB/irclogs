00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I increased the number of CHN servers a bit
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Kenzoo we have teehistorian, but don't parse it well yet
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so we could offer that info in the futrure
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but that's also only since 2018 I think
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Yeah there where some nice pages
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Old screenshot from one of those
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/800175985446092872/IMG_20180618_213351-1.jpg
04:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> We maxed out our bandwidth (5mbps) on chn3 yesterday
04:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> So maybe add more on the XiangYang one which ever that one is
05:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @deen please make a vote about giving everyone strong on everyone without changing in-game physics at all. I know only stupid people will be against it, but I'm done getting frustrated of that weak hook and I would fix it if u guarantee it implemented
05:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> > without changing in-game physics at all
05:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> the tee that hooks first gets the strong
05:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> so nothing changes but the order of calculation
05:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> which doesn't matter
06:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> <a:pepesweat:566993607861469185> maybe do two physics routes with a config toggle and update some map that specifically needs weak hook if there is any.
06:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> /weak is much easier
06:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> if there is none i can't see the downside
06:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> it is possible to give only one person weak hook
06:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> there are some shitty crappy maps
06:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> is  it possible to give only one person weak hook>
06:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> ye add /weak
06:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> like 500 years old with all that "jump over freeze 300 times" that sometimes require specifically weak
06:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> is it possible to give only one person weak hook?
06:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> what do you mean by that
06:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> if it is a physics processing order thing, i would be quite weird to untie the "fixed" physics batch and process only one character out of order.
06:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I should think about the system around it. In my mind there is a system which I already described. The one that hooks player first gets the strong on him
06:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> it would be*
06:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> in this case nothing changes in game phyiscs
06:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> every other one gets weak on him until he rehooks
06:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> so it works the opposite. If someone asked system to have weak then everyone gets strong on him
06:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> for the maps that require weak just wait until someone reports it then u can just fix the map
06:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> genius
06:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> theres like maybe 3 of those maps in total
06:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> genouis
06:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I though about just deleting to the fuck that parts
06:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> adding time penalty tile
06:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> then we can just have everybody strong
06:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> the only downside it that the soothing voice of louis explaining weakhook would become irrelevant
06:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> fuck that, weak hook sucks a lot
06:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> no good reason for it to stay
06:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> don't fuck louis plz
06:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> louis cool
06:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> probably should test the case when both tees have strong on each other and see how it feels and differs
06:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> reverse speedfly good
06:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> louis should submit ddnet to GDQ sometime after the covid thing.
06:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> <a:pepesweat:566993607861469185>
06:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> much more parts are weak impossible
06:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> fastest 100 points on new name random seed glitchless
06:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> i thought almost all ddnet tech is a "glitch"
06:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no they're features :justatest:
06:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :kek:
06:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> "glitchless" is kinda impossible
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> just joined random map and there is already a tee trying to make weak inpossible part
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/800238221325762580/unknown.png
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> not sure if it's really impossible or just insane hard
06:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> possible
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> weak is good
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> dont remove
08:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> and accounts bad
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Does anyone know why I have "no matching overloaded function found" error while calling from the same header file and it appears to be ok before build attempt?
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/800266054504546364/unknown.png

08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> everything is called in the `gamecore.h`
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Oh I guess I see that
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> No I don't
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD> you said its called in the same file? than it could be a problem if distance is defined below where this code is. if that's the case, forward declare the functions
09:58 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 ye thanks for the support i fixed my system :) i downgraded to linux-lts paired with nvida-lts and now all works again seems like there was a driver update that broke my system and that seemed to happen while i reinstalled my system so i blamed my self instead of the driver
09:58 <+ChillerDragon> i wonder how such a thing is not on the archlinux news tho i am still a bit confused
10:00 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait it has but that was some time ago maybe i followed the arch news back then and downgraded to lts already
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> ChillerDragon Do you have time :X?
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie I have stopped some CHN3 servers and run CHN4 again
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> great. thx
11:19 <+ChillerDragon> yea @Trafalgar Law
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> you can also pm me on irc btw via the web thingy https://webchat.quakenet.org/?channels=#ddnet
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> hm that link is broke idk how to create a proper one xd
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> lol only stupid ppl against it?
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> Weak is part of the game...
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> weak is bug
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> pretty annoying bug
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> yes but maps adopted it
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> some parts are almost not doable with strong
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> But that's a whole other discussion. I just find it pretty rude that you say all the people against it are stupid :pepeH:
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> alias /spec to /weak (don't actually tho
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> Don't let the Russian trash talker change our hook
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> 😄
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> 👀
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> Don't let the Russian trashtalker change our hook
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> ChillerDragon lets go on a tw srv and write there
11:55  * blim slaps ChillerDragon around a bit with a large fishbot
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is it somehow possible to fix laser door skipping with too much speed e.g. using jetpack?
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Need it for my mod
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you'd have to change the code for the check
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> currently it just checks your current position I guess
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you'd have to check the distance the tee moves and whether that intersects with a laser door
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen ok thx
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> btw, this weak hook fix is not good
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Does not make any sense
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if the tee is frozen you cant get weak
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> appart from community not wanting the change, the change itself is flawed
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> bad change
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im amazed he thought this was a good fix
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > -If you hook someone while he's already hooking you - you gain weak. And stay weak for this entire hook until you rehook while not being hooked by that person.
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is the stupidest thing ever
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can we run a couple servers with the actual proper fix?
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has been voted no
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to see the effects of it
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not this fix. This one just sounds goofy
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> it's good but you'd better run a test server with it first
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean a proper saturated add after equilibrium
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> because I'm not sure if it can't crush anything
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @Ryozuki stop crying)
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u should just leave forever
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> like your voice matter something
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like urs matters
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think anyone really knows how the actual fix would feel like
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> everybody is annoyed by u
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I fear it would feel awkward, but maybe it doesn't?
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> of course it is. I've achieved something in that life 😏
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> it's just like you have strong and that's all
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur a cringefest
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As said I don't mean the weird strongswap
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @Ryozuki how old are you? Feels like acting of 14 yo child who thinks he means something in this world
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur reflecting mym an
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my man*
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or projecting
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> but what do you mean then?
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean a proper fix like teeworlds#2478
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hilarious
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> teeworlds/teeworlds#2478 that is
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2478
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would say u fit more of a 14y old pushing this after people voted no
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and saying ppl who vote no are retarded
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just an educated guess
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This should give everyone the exact same hook strength
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I feel it might break speedfly, but who knows, maybe it doesn't. No way to really know without testing
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> you can't because it will feel a very different then it was
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I fixed it the way it doesn't change anything at all. That's why solution is so dirty
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do you know? I don't because I didn't test it
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I assume you either tested it or you are god
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Firstly I've tried to make it normal and created an Update method supposed to be called once per tick to update hook physics, but that turned out to be wrong
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> also it's obvious
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> because your velocity is calculated everywhere before and after core update when hook influence being calculated
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> so it would be different no matter what you do
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not obvious at all to me what the impacts of it would be. It's only obvious that it will be different
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I've tried hard all day on imaging the solution that would keep existing approach but be clear and normal, but there is no way. The way physics implemented now is so wrong that no matter what you do you will fix something accidentally
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now that's bad for people with allergies to difference like Konsti but differences on the order of 1 or 2 ticks don't concern me, they are imperceptible to all but the pickiest of players
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and maybe not even them, which we could find out if we run a test server
13:00 <+ChillerDragon> @Trafalgar Law you can mostly find me on fokkos server i even have tw pings on currently but might be afk
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 i have applied that tw pr in my mod and it works nice, also added a config var to simply calculate the old way again
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so i can toggle it
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut have you tested whether it breaks speedfly? I've been investigating why speedfly happens at all and it seems to have some relation to the strength of the hook
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> speedfly only works with strong
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nope, you can reverse speedfly too
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but that wont work ofc anymore
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> reverse speedfly is with weak
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What I'm wondering is what happens if everyone has the same hook strength
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> That doesnt matter, its about the strength of the top player
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and as I read the code everyone should end up with a hook little weaker than the strong hook of past, sooo can people still speedfly as if the top player has strong with the patch?
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think they have exactly the same strength
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> It looks like it at least
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> when hooking a tee over the ground without moving
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I thought it'd be slightly weaker, but if it's the same I guess it should work still
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut do you have a server running with it right now? I'd like to see if it feels different
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> Just leave everything as it is, then there won't be any unforeseen new bugs 😄
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I did a test like here: https://wiki.ddnet.tw/game-mechanics/hook/
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 and i got the same results for both tees, but i didnt check position in the code
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just checked it with my eye xd
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yeah my server, it has weak hook 1 tho, let me quickly set it to 0, just connect
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's good enough, if I was thinking about it correctly it would have differed by a tile or so, you'd easily see that by eye
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> good
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sv_weak_hook disabled now
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you can try it
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you seem to have atleast sort of fixed fast download for ddnet clients
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 20k is not bad 😛
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I did nothing
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I'm just dropping less packets today
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I tried to fix fast download twice now but i gave up
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it always worked on LAN
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but it got stuck on production
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it is a bug that makes it very hard to reason about things though, it'd be nice if things were symmetrical and consistent
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've been looking at 4 demos of people speedflying, with top hammering, reverse speedfly, normal speedfly etc. and with the asymmetry of the physics it's really hard to think about what actually happens
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> It's like u want to fix the hf bug
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> Xd
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hf is not a bug, hf is a direct result of how the physics were imagined
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it has very clear dynamics
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> No more like the bug that you can move around in a 64x64 box
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> Better let us fix all of this bugs and broke the game :troll:
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 97 players xd
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> Better let us fix all of these bugs and broke the game :troll:
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Cøke a tee is 28 inits long and a block is 32
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> you only need hook to start speedfly, later the tees don't need to even touch
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My ping isn't too bad but your server feels rather slow. I think 97 players is taxing the server loop quite a bit
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Cøke a tee is 28 units long and a block is 32
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 yeah maybe xd
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ravie are you sure? I haven't finished up the tools to check this yet but I had a feeling it was the result of the tees oh so slightly clipping into eachother and the physics pushing them out
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> lol
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Speedfly is that you dont really touch at all, thats why the bottom tee hammers so fast
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So you cant even touch each other
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and your hook with strong keeps both tees stable
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not "lol" it's not an obvious interaction at all, unless you analyzed it I don't see how you could confidently make that comment
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :D
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> your strong hook while it can keep you stable doesn't generate any velocity
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, I saw and worked with the code for pushing tees out
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thats why i instantly thought its not this
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Learath2 well at least when I do it using deepfly bind, after the first hammer there's a visible gap between tees sometimes
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neutronias / Mo(2) / Martin> Good to see there's still DDRace development. 🙂
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its fng
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> you don't have to hook at all
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can speedfly without hooking? 😛
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> yes
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How would that work? Tee needs to get lifted
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bottom one
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I remember that odd video where the guy did it
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Show me
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah I think with 2 hammerers
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Hammer is creating up velocity
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @murpi true but in reality u never do that
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I sadly don't have the tools to extract my memories into webm format yet
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the top guy hammering is slightly pulling the tee below in that case
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> with some rng bounce timing and deepfly bind you can do it from tower
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> Lol how you know such things @Ravie
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> im abit confused, why would players be opposed to having strong given the vote in #announcements. Something im missing?
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> yes
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I've spend hundreds of hours messing around and trying to make weird new parts :p
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/800339985433755658/Base_Profile_2021.01.17_-_13.23.37.03_Trim.mp4
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> 😄
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> People don't like changes in general, which is common in old niche games like this one
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> And also weak hook is a major part of the game in my opinion
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i wouldnt want to fix it too
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I don't understand how people can just say "it's good how it is so don't touch it" and not strive for improvement
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> Well I mean in gores for  example it makes sense. But in ddrace it's a "feature"
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Not directly a feature but its a bug thats so well integrated that it even has official ddnet support xd
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> It's not about denial of improvements. That's why it is discussed. It's simply seen as a game mechanism
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> is it really? we have a handful of parts that use it ever, it mostly only causes confusion in new players, old players either use /spec or /save to just trade it anyway, it doesn't even make anything impossible it only makes it harder
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> Yeah whatever you like to call it these days
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xddd
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> I will look for a part where you can see the use of weak
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> I will look for a part where you can see the use of weak @Learath2
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are a couple, some drag parts are easier with weak e.g.
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> To "look" for a part shows how its not important xD
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I "think"(tm) it would be impossible to do that part where you hang off of someone with strong on Stronghold 3, but maybe not even that
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> well you know I find it makes things interesting if you have to deal with such things like weak
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It has "official" "support" because it's a completely invisable game mechanic. We added an indicator for it recently and we have prediction support for it because the prediction would be wrong without it
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b3z> But also I am not playing that much anymore so maybe ideas have changed in the tw world
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, we did a vote and people don't want it changed, I'm fine with that, but doesn't mean I won't argue my point. I honestly can't wholeheartedly say I either support or disapprove the change, because I haven't tested it
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the vote is basically "do you guys want a change?" community: change bad
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> from what I've seen on fokkonaut's server, it didn't feel drastically different to fly, throw or hh people
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> probably super irrelevant here but i deleted weak hook on fng a couple years ago and people have either actively liked the change or not noticed
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> noone has ever complained about it ever
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah I think you either hate weak hook or not care about it, so it would still make more people happy to fix it
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> In fng
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> XD
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In fluid pvp gameplay you would never notice it
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> read the first three words of my msg x_x
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd only be concerned about tricks and timings
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> nah i notice the weak hook when i play on default fng servers now
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> read the first three words of my msg x_x coke
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> in fng you basically drag a dummy to get him into spikes
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would probably need to readjust for a day or two to be able to do freezehammers again e.g.
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yeah that or hooking close enemies when u shoot them
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and when ur dragging the frozen tees weak is just annoying
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I know one place where weak and strong would be a decent mechanic. If you can somehow force the weak person to do a long deep drag
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> especialy if ur moving fast and tryin to throw them as u go by
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also when you hook a frozen tee while you're both on the ground or form below, slide physics really suck
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> with weak?
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also when you hook a frozen tee while you're both on the ground or from below, slide physics really suck
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's significantly easier to drag someone when you are strong
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ++
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though as I said, since there is almost no part that is impossible to do with weak or strong, it's very hard to force such a situation, so I'd be extremely surprised if any maps have such a mechanic
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess a deep drag part, followed by a swap, followed by another deep drag part can force both people to do a deep drag and thus atleast make one tee suffer dragging with weak
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but again, of the collection of hundreds of maps we have, how many have two deep drag parts following eachother with a forced swap in between
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> many hard drag parts are really crap or nearly impossible to do with weak
13:40 <+bridge> [freenode] <b3z> also true.
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, which would be a concern of mine if the mappers actually intended to make people suffer through them as weak
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> usually you either get /spec or you get to choose who goes into deep, because as you said it's crap to drag with weak :P:
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> in drag-heavy maps /spec is really a must imo
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but /spec is not always a good thing, it lets you do tee collision fuckery and sg bug
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, my point is I don't think it's a major feature, I think it's just a quirk of physics that we learned to live with
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could always look into making spec not allow you to unspec if you are colliding with someone as it's unlikely people will change their minds about strong/weak changes
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> though that would allow a new form of blocking 😄
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> maybe just add a command for giving strong hook that doesn't make your tee disappear
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess we could just reinsert the tee to the top of the entity list
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut you seem to have an issue with ingame serverinfo packets for ddnet clients btw
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> seems you only report 63/64 there
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not possible
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Has to be clientside
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because I 100% dont do
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sorry, I must have had a partial complex seizure and saw 63/64 instead of 97/128, because that's more likely than a mistake in one of the most ridiculously complex parts of the code riddled with dozens of branches handling different types of serverinfo lol
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Its not that deep for fddrace
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/blob/b24dabe21b2f683c814b17b99fd978056c14d996/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L1723
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Check SendServerInfoSevendown
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hey, I can only tell you what I saw, it can be a client bug too.
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thats what I said
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is it with people being extremely defensive and confident this month? How are you all so sure you make no mistakes?
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am just confident about this situation, lol. I know my code well
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And @Learath2 I havent seen that issue before
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Bravo, 10 years working with ddnet code I would never be so confident as to concretely claim much of anything about it as it's riddled with spaghetti and UB
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I aspire to be as confident as you and jupeyy one day
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> as someone with a mod based on ddnet i could never be that confident
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> in my own code or otherwise x_x
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ie i would assume its a server bug at first
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aaanyway, I have much real analysis to learn. I bid thee farewell. I'll take a look at the serverinfo parsing later anyway, will keep an eye out for a bug on the client
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont know how you guys can shit talk like this now. I changed this part of the code to specifically NOT report 63/64, but x/128, then before I said its not a bug in my mod I even checked the code before and sent the link
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> who is shit talking
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mimimi
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :thonkery:
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We aren't shit talking, atleast I'm not. I'm just very impressed
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Dont make fun of the situation now
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I doubt u r impressed by anything
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Seriously, I honestly don't feel that confident about anything I write in the context of ddnet
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've coded many parts of the code to specifically do one thing and it ended up doing something else through the most convoluted means imaginable
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i spent 30min fixing ddnet compiling on macbook just to test a 1 line pr i submitted why do. u think im kidding
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i had times like this too
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but not too often
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i mean i was fairly sure it would work
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but still xd
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> odd, but still admirable
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Showing 241 changed files with 68,858 additions and 6,231 deletions.
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 @fokkonaut since the player count in the server info tab comes from snapshots, I think the maximum amount of players there would be 63 or 64
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just a small mod
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Add another number like ID that shows how strong every tee is
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> 1 is the weakest, 64 the strongest
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 that explains it
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut I don't know how you can tell @Learath2 that he's looking the wrong way though
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ᶰ°Konͧsti we added something similar for the next version I think
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> HMM
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> even if you coded it "the right way", there can still be bugs
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh wow you guys are pissed because i said its not possible and has to be clientside xD
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Like
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ????
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have a lot of `x + duration * tickspeed >= tick` in the code, I wonder if there is a way to prettify that
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> SecondsPassed(int secs)
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bool
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We are not pissed at all. I don't see where you see me being pissed
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I see heinrich complaining for nothing
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just told you that I am oddly surprised at how confident you are in your code
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Lol
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I am not even super confident
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I just checked the code
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sent a link
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and said it has to be clientside
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> relax a bit
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if someone told me my ingame serverinfo was wrong, I'd first look at where the serverinfo tab gets the player counts, then I'd look at where I send said information, then I'd look at how I collect the information
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd also be concerned about the fact that there is something called `SERVERINFO_INGAME` sounds like it could have something to do with it, maybe legacy baggage?
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The fact that I know what I send and how I send it led me to that its a client issue
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and i was right
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> where is the problem
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see where you see heinrich complaining either, he gave a reasonable explanation to the issue
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> See what I mean by everyone being so defensive this month? 😛
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> xD
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You are defensive aswell :)
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> We both are
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How am I defensive? I just told you it could be a bug in the client for all I know. I haven't tested it
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> am i late to the party
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Isnt that defense too?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Just like I do
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Clarifying the own pov
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Just take popcorn and read it :X
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 anyways I dont wanna contribute to this discussion anymore, its useless and definitely not leading anywhere
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How is it defense? I gave you a bug report, something I encountered on a mod you wrote. I didn't say it was your bug, I didn't even say which client I used to join. You just instantly said made a deduction that I thought was overly certain. I pointed out that it was rather odd that you were so confident
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> where are the rendered demos stored?
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u said u used ddnez
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, as always. Ditch me in the middle of an argument to make me look like the goof
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> LOL
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll go review the backport PR
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum %APPDATA%/Teeworlds/videos
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> thanks
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 I really dont want to make it look like this, lets continue then
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://secret.club/2021/01/15/bitlocker-bypass.html
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> amazing site btw, check out the other articles as well 🙂
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 Now you said you didnt even say what client you used, but before you said "for ddnet clients"
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No please, go right ahead. I'm quite used to it with heinrich and Ryozuki pulling the same thing almost weekly 🙂
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ❤️
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Also, as I said I am only mirroring my pov right now, because I dont get how you can be so offended or whatever.
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I just said its a client bug and I even sent a link
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Idk whats wrong about it
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> <https://secret.club/2020/06/19/battleye-packet-encryption.html> o_o xd
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> If you work almost daily on your own mod then you just can be this sure, at least I am
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> when am I gonna be on the list
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Again, I don't quite see where I'm offended. I just pointed out a handful of oddities
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @noby check out the other one where battleye has anticheat modules specifically for reverse engineers
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> windows sucks
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> At least in this situation, because as I said I recently worked on that to NOT report /64
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> heinrich is going to make the ultimate anti cheat bypass
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :feelssurprized:
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not the author of that blog ^^
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> although I'm aspiring to be as good as these guys. I probably never will be ^^
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> uh oh
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie all you need to join the club is join in on a discussion I'm having and disappear after giving an argument that's impossible to counter
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 and since thats the only place where I send the serverinfo or generate it, I KNEW it was not my server
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> An appeal to authority is the most common choice
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 would it not be clear for you that its a client thing here?
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i bet u dont even know how every line in snapshot.cpp works from memory
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ok bye
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> lol
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut no, as I don't really know where the serverinfo for the serverinfo tab ingame comes from. I guess you didn't either given it took @heinrich5991 to point out where it could be coming from
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> who cares where it comes from @Learath2, thats no information we need here
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> again
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I just said it has to be clientside
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> NOTHING MORE
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And i am mr super duper confident now for i xd
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u*
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 btw did you see I got a commit in ghidra 9.2? I've officially helped the USA in their never ending quest in world domination
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Nvm then i will smoke a cig xD
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😦 mine probably still didn't get in
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ddnet helping with drug addiction every day 👍
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut it's relevant information, how else would you debug said issue?
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 🙃
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you don't know the source of the faulty information, you can't know why it happens nor where it happens
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/pull/1889
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> still open, not looked at
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 I see why heinrich and othes would leave your discussions
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> NSA :monkaS:
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they collected heinrich data
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 have you checked the secret.club link I posted above? 🙂
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You are kinda like chillerdragon, you cant win against you
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not possible
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, very hard to argue when I'm doing nothing but stating facts
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> me too
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i remember u complaining about jupstar doing this
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I give a completely reasonable argument, I even gave reasoning as to why I think this is fact unlike Jupstar
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 no matter how much i look up to you this discussion IS POINTLESS.
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I gave my facts and arguments too
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you don't agree, by any means go ahead and tell me where I'm going wrong in my chain of reasoning
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I did so many times now
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I agree it is pointless, you are working on the assumption that I'm attacking you somehow or I'm offended
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> false
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which I've told you like 5 times throughout that I don't care
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> <a:pepesweat:566993607861469185>
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/pulls/Learath2 I still have 3 left, will probably never get them in 😛
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would pr with a alt acc just in case :pepeH:
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want the world to know that I've contributed to imperialism
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe they'll hire me
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they won't. you need to be US citizen
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably since birth or so
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 Let me explain it a last time:
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You told me about a bug where ingame the server info reports 63/64.
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And I said its not possible and has to be a clientside bug, then gave a link where you could see what the server sends. Because I recently changed it so that ddnet clients receive x/128 I knew that it was not a servers fault. And that was the only thing I said, knowing that it has to be clientside.
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Now where is your problem? I dont get it. Its not at all about fixing this bug right now or debugging it, it was just about that situation where you said I was oddly confident.
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i doubt they hire anyone on the nsa who isnt natural born in usa
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-born-citizen_clause
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> damn
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk why when i see a eagle i can only think of fascism
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe because the eagle in spain flag is fascist
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Germany
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't think I'd call today's germany fascist
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is spanish fascist flag
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/800359517383950337/unknown.png
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look the resemblance
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its incredible
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't have a problem with the bug. I don't have a problem with you having confidence. I literally just said I personally don't feel confident about the behaviour of most any piece of code. Which is apparently not such an insane position given noby seems to have a similar experience coding within ddnet aswell
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Okay, i understand that, but where the hell is our problem then xD
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well idk, you told us we were shit talking
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was only being slightly sarcastic and it was to poke a needle at jupstar as he like you is always oddly confident of his code
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah right, because I felt offended by ur ironic seizure message
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That was more supposed to be a joke, I guess it didn't go over that well through text
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sarcastic, not ironic yes
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> See, resolved. It's not that hard to finish these
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Good
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I felt like you say I havent checked anything and i just said it to protect my mod or something
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Here is to hoping I get a systemd discussion to the end one day
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But I have no Problems in having bugs or something, I just knew this was not my bug :D Thats why it "escalated"
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> anyways
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 Have a good day, I'll be mobile from now on
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 any idea what to do about check-style? I'm not really sure how best to handle this
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> bors r+
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it checks the style of the resulting merge
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, now that I think about it it's kinda weird that that's not what github runs the checks on
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because you have to run it at the point of merge. it's basically the whole point of bors 😉
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/1597.html
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > The Not Rocket Science Rule Of Software Engineering:
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > 
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > automatically maintain a repository of code that always passes all the tests
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder why something like bors isn't part of github yet. There isn't much point to a PR being green if the resulting merge wouldn't be green
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually, why are these failing anyway?
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3510
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (false positive, not sure how you can manage to have false positives there)
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3514/checks?check_run_id=1711438835 e.g. this one
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> space at EOL
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah but you didn't even touch that file
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, someone merged without bors
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because bors was broken with the python checkstyle
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, that would explain it
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is the best way to fix that? Just pushing a style commit directly before trying bors r+ again?
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just do bors r+ again
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the style is fixed already
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3515
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so yea, that's the best way to fix it
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> by doing a PR with the style fix
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We have exactly that in ctrl-shift-d, try out nightly if you want it
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :O nice
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> 
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> But would ne nice to be able to show it up Always. So u know for example how much u have to hook a tee to make him go edge before fail to freeze
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, i did that but the current consensus is that we don't want to add more commands
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and a number is not such nice ui, so instead we'd prefer to show weak hook slightly differently
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe a thinner hook: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3363
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut I added a new net object for the ddnet projectile. you should be able convert to the old projectile in your client easily. I can make a PR if you want
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3492
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```py
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> NetObjectEx("DDNetProjectile", "projectile@netobj.ddnet.tw", [
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     NetIntAny("m_X"),
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     NetIntAny("m_Y"),
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     NetIntAny("m_Angle"),
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     NetIntAny("m_Data"),

17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Thoughts on mongodb? I'm thinking of using a nosql for my own project.
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i prefer sql
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what are your requirements? what do you want to do?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more data integrity
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Is there anything that ill-advised for nosql
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> That is*
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for only data integrity I'd suggest using sqlite. it's easier for users and developers @Ryozuki
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Basically just player profile and player scores, thing like that
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mongodb uses a not OSI approved license btw
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not open soource software
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or free software
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie sounds like a perfect fit for sqlite
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sqlite is good
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk why ppl dont use it more
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if they dont have to do distrbuted stuff
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we also just started using it for ddnet server
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but we do use it now 🙂
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :justatest: what if I just don't want to write queries
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use a ORM
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I mean SQL queries
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ORM
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what language?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what language?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Both typescript and c++ actually
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u rly wanna use mongodb, there is mongoose for typescript
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for c++ i gotta search
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://mongoosejs.com/
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> What is ORM actually
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> object-relational manager
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it allows you to write queries without writing queries
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> basically a fancy interface
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I see
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> check out
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> django orm
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for a full fledged orm
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I've used mongodb on TS before. So I'm just not sure about c++
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `latest_question_list = Question.objects.order_by('-pub_date')[:5]`
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is a SQL query with the django ORM
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/800400841223569451/unknown.png
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is what orms strive for
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Why does that just looks like mongo query tho.
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if ur making a full web app
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and just want to use typescript
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this one is good https://nestjs.com/
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> It is not really an web app.
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Although it is http
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what is it then
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or is it secret
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://www.codesynthesis.com/products/odb/
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> C++ ORM that supports sqlite
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Hard to say. Some piracy stuff
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :justatest:
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:

17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Noted
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I do love the fact that this is becoming my go-to place to ask about these things for some reason.
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what do you think about the answer in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3502 ?
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm fine with it as is
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> [2021-01-17 17:45:49][censorlist]: failed to open 'censorlist.txt'
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> 
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> where do i get this txt?
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's only used by the chinese ddnet hosters
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> exposed
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the rest of the ddnet servers use an empty list
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> so i dont need it right?
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, you don't need it
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> kk thx
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why is "chinese coronavirus" on the censorlist? 😦
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I actually don't know.
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I don't know who complied the list
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Maybe the person made the list thinks implying coronavirus has a chinese heritage is bad.
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it did come from china into the rest of the world. it's not the term I'd use, but banning it if it's not required by the government seems to be too excessive
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_coronavirus
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Well if it is enough to create a outrage on social media it is bad for us.
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> On Chinese social media ofc
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 Sounds fine i guess
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but why?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the old projectile works fine, no?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's easier to support all clients if all clients speak the same protocol
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut do you want me to make the PR against f-client?
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> true, but whats the purpose of having the extra info projectile?
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But sure, if thats the only error with the fclient, then pr it
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> One thing to consider is that, a lot of time it is not the actual government doing the censorship.
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut it's for prediction and knowing whether to make it transparent if not from your team
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Departments that has any power over the people or the content would just do anything to stop people from talking about a topic too much to create out of proportion rage or misinformation to keep their lazy ass on their politically supervisor seat.
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Supervisor = superior*
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> So that's why most of the time the "censorship" is over things that are insanely stupid.
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Like animal crossing
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> <a:pepesweat:566993607861469185>
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> So I feel like being as safe as possible doesn't hurt.
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> I mean it is only for CHN servers, I would just let Tom feel as safe as he wants. We definitely try not to influence anything outside of china.
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Do I have to add Novice to the srv name that the new players see my srv 🤔
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Yes
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Can't say for other regions but CHN player usually need a week to realize the filter
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> is that why kog has "novice insane gores"?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :justatest: did it really
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Its because they have a vote
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> something like that yeah
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> if you vote easy then its novice easy
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> but if you vote insane
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> its novice insane
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> But why don't they change server name after vote
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Oh that doesn't change the novice part
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> But if you don't want noobs, not using Novice is actually a good idea
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> I love noobs
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> Then yeah. Add novice
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> What was the command in f1 to bind 2 values like cl_overlay_entities 0 100
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> toggle?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Hell yea
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> thanks
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> bind x toggle command 0 100
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> +toggle if you want to activate only while holding the key
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> yea works
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> I just forget the command
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Thanks
19:45 <+ChillerDragon> oh no downgradiing to lts fixed it this morning but now after reboot my gpu ports broke again :/ anyone on archlinux with a nvidia gpu who can reproduce this?
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> [2021-01-17 20:10:28][net]: failed to bind socket with domain 2 and type 1 (98 'Address already in use')

20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> 
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> What happend here O.o
20:33 <+ChillerDragon> classic its all over my logs :) everything still works tho
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> My Srv without connection to the database cant read the _record.dtb files
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> why?
21:28 <+ChillerDragon> because ddnet switched from dtb files to sqlite3
21:28 <+ChillerDragon> I wonder if there are any conversion scripts you can probably reuse my dtb to mysql script for that
21:29 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/lib-crash/lib-teeworlds/blob/master/dtb_to_mysql.sh maybe i should update this to support dtb to sqlite3
22:38 <+ChillerDragon> oh i think wayland is just sok and has some race condition buggos or whatever xorg masterrace fixed the day
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Marius https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/cdb5a5c28034bc7bba87108ee536f26afe755c5f/scripts/import_file_score.py
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this is the conversion script
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: it's in the ddnet repository
