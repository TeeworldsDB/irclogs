01:02 < fstd> deen: heh gentoo was what made me curious about *BSD in the first place when i realized that it's trying so hard to be as BSDish as possible
01:03 < fstd> i figured there's little point in emulating BSD on linux then, might as well use a real BSD
01:04 <@deen> I tried some BSDs as well and mainly used OpenBSD
01:04 <@deen> Now all I have are some OpenBSD fanboy posters in my room
01:05 <@deen> Didn't really need the OpenBSD server after some time and got tired by Kernel memory leaks
01:06 < fstd> hm, kernel memory leaks? what release was it?
01:07 <@deen> I don't know, Maybe 5-7 years ago
01:07 <@deen> Especially bad that the nice pf leaked
01:09 < fstd> i've seen excessive state being kept appearing like a kernel memory leak..
01:09 < fstd> well no idea about the status of pf as of 5-7 years ago
01:10 < fstd> seems to be rather solid nowadays (though i'm ATM running ipf, rather, migrating to npf)
01:11 <@deen> I'd like to use a BSD, but really don't need it
01:11 <@deen> I realized that I want as few computers to administrate as possible
01:14 < fstd> heh, it's less of a pain when administering computers doesn't involve excess googling for random fixes to problems in undocumented programs, though
01:15 < fstd> as in, when there's proper documentation, which is mainly why i enjoy working with the BSDs and don't like troubleshooting on linux
01:17 <@deen> I don't know, Debian feels pretty nice
01:17 <@deen> I only use it for the DDNet servers and they just run and run without any problems
01:19 < fstd> debian isn't so bad, yeah.
01:19 < fstd> slightly annoying that for everything there's a (or ten) special "debian way" to do things
09:33 < Savander> HI
09:33 < Savander> finally, i don't install Ubuntu, lul. 
09:37 <@EastByte> I guess you FAILED :D
09:38 < Savander> yea
09:39 < Savander> i have 4 primary partition
09:39 < Savander> installation restarting over and over again
09:39 < Savander> and, i decided to install linux on
09:39 < Savander> virtual disk ._.
09:51 <@EastByte> virtual disk?
09:51 <@EastByte> iirc ubuntu was able to install inside of a windows partition
09:53 <@EastByte> http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Wubi
09:56 < Savander> know about it
09:57 <@EastByte> okay
09:57 < Savander> but it's the same
09:57 < Savander> as from CD
09:58 < Savander> with one option, you can easily uninstall it.

14:29 <@deen> huh, that was yesterday
14:40 < laxa> well, then nimda had crashed...
14:40 < laxa> but I save the last output made in DB
14:40 < laxa> so, if it crashes, it'll give the release between the last announced released and now :)
14:43 < laxa> Guys, I have a question for you
14:43 < laxa> my server crashed 3 times in the last 3 months or so, always when something specific happened
14:43 < laxa> every time, I had to electrical reboot it
14:43 < laxa> no logs at all
14:44 < laxa> but everytime, someone was watching on my private folder on my web server
14:44 < laxa> I have ubuntu 12.04 LTS and apache 2.2.22
15:00 <@deen> watching your private folder?
15:00 <@deen> waht does that mean?
15:29 < laxa> watching a video on a folder protected by .htaccess
15:30 < laxa> downloading them never made the server crash, but watching them online make the server crash apparently
15:46 <@deen> weird
15:47 < laxa> Yes it is, I have no idea how to have more information :x
15:47 <@deen> Well, I have a similar problem without a solution
15:47 <@deen> every few weeks my server just shuts down. I guess the PSU is a bit too flaky
15:59 < laxa> Wut ?
16:01 < fstd> suspecting it's the PSU sounds about right
16:01 < fstd> (mainly because of high voltage/temperature electrolytic caps)

21:38 <@deen> oh, i should probably shut down ger2 again
21:38 <@deen> no lag complaints about GER for a few days
21:53 < eeeee> yeah or at least partially shut down
