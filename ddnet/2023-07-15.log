08:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> deen is online late currently.. i smell smth comming
08:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> :giftee_red:
11:51 < bridge_> <robyt3> @vy0x2 Do you have a crash dump? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6854
11:53 < bridge_> <vy0x2> Sorry no crash but i get timed out ingame
11:53 < bridge_> <vy0x2> @robyt3
11:53 < bridge_> <robyt3> I see
11:53 < bridge_> <robyt3> So it's like the problem with bans or any other rcon command that prints too many messages
11:54 < bridge_> <vy0x2> I think that it is very likely exactly that yes
12:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1129722571504484412/image.png
12:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> work queue icons
12:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
12:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> submit queue
12:40 < bridge_> <deen> My main complain about the github merge queue is that it's one additional click now. Previously I could just write bors r+ in the review. Now have to manually click buttons after the review. But not that bad
13:14 < bridge_> <learath2> We diagnosed this before iirc, it's just that the sendq gets completely full, vital messages get dropped and the client can never recover because the next vital it expects is no longer in the backroom
13:14 < bridge_> <robyt3> So we should add a ringbuffer for outgoing rcon messages?
13:15 < bridge_> <learath2> It's not just rcon messages, all vital messages suffer from this iirc
13:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> just replace the static limit with some growable data structure
13:17 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah maybe just replace it with a vector and call it a day
13:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i lately saw this:
13:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/spuhpointer/stack-vs-heap-benchmark
13:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> and was surprised and did some own benchmarks, bcs i wanted to reduce some heap allocations in my app.
13:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
13:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If you actually fill the data structure you allocated, it's indeed very close between heap and stack.. If you use smth like clone_from it's ofc MUCH faster with an preallocated buffer.
13:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But if you copy every element one by one it's almost same speed.. similar to the graph shown in this benchmark
13:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>

13:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i lately saw this:

13:31 < bridge_> <learath2> The nice part about stack allocation is that it's trivial to reason about it's lifetime
13:32 < bridge_> <learath2> And maybe in a larger overall program if you only have stack allocations you might get some performance benefits due to the locality principlw
13:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> isnt there smth like smallvec in cpp
13:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> smallvec resides in stack up to N and then moves to heap
13:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> growable
13:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> llvm has its own version in their core
13:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> code
13:54 < bridge_> <learath2> Now that would actually be nice
13:55 < bridge_> <learath2> It'd be great to have it still stay local for most people and only move to heap for authed mods thar get a flood of messages
13:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye just put high N
13:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or the N we have rn
13:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
13:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this might be cool to code
13:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ill look into it today
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> pls dont do it yet
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
13:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> cool
13:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> good morning chat
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 im eating out in a turkish place
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not bad
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but probs bad accoridng to real turkish standards
13:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or idk
13:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> no good morning wow i see how it is
13:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> morning
13:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> never had turkish food
13:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> kebab?
13:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> mmh
13:58 < bridge_> <Ewan> seen it
13:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> they speak turkish
13:58 < bridge_> <learath2> Is it just kebab or a proper turkish place?
13:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> proper
13:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i didnt eat kebab
13:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its a proper plate
13:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i should hwve taken pic
13:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but too late i ate it all
13:59 < bridge_> <learath2> Ah, turkish food is very very diverse, lots of different things
13:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yeah
14:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> u ever get sunburn
14:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yes
14:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> worst
14:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i try nor to
14:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> i always forget
14:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but one day i forgot solar thing
14:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and got sunburnt
14:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> sunscreen is rank shit i don't like it
14:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in a mountain
14:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's better than sunburn but not my buch lol
14:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> by much
14:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> xdd
14:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> i hate yard sale
14:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> circulate your abundance of shit with other ppl who have an abundance of shit
14:01 < bridge_> <learath2> Not getting skin cancer is a good plus
14:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea that's why it's better
14:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> i prefer the feel of burn to being gooped up all the time
14:03 < bridge_> <learath2> Maybe try different brand? I used to have a oilless one back when I still touched some grass
14:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> damn i didn't know they made that
14:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> i like the spray better but it's a much worse deal
14:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> and u have to go somewhere to do it
14:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> so ppl aren't breathing in sunscreen
14:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> my washing machine is designed so stupid
14:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> if it gets overfilled it doesn't know until most of the way through the cycle (fine i guess) but then it locks itself with the water in it
14:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> and stops
14:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> so u can't get it out ?????
14:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> have to unplug and wait 20 minutes for lock to go
14:05 < bridge_> <learath2> I'd guess some part of it gets overwhelmed rather than it detecting it's overfilled
14:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's a particular error code, it knows it's overfilled
14:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> it also lumps it in with a drainage issue which is the same thing to diagnose
14:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> but it also doesn't make sense to close in that case
14:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> because usually u pump out w/ shop vac
14:06 < bridge_> <learath2> Oh wait this isn't #off-topic LOL
14:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh rip
14:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> but it also doesn't make sense to lock* in that case
14:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> kek
14:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but the resend logic is on the sender side right?
14:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so if a packet drops for 20 seconds i'd simply call that a timeout too
14:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so the server should never fill a buffer "too" much i guess
14:11 < bridge_> <learath2> Mh the packets are marked vital. The server has no option but to queue them
14:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> yes
14:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but its at max packets / second *  20 then
14:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so i doubt its too much to buffer
14:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> its just important to timeout if a packet is resend for over 20 seconds
14:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so the client has no attack vendor
14:12 < bridge_> <learath2> But that has nothing to do with what I said btw. I meant lets let the queue grow for bursts but keep the queue in the class so we don't pay an indirection in most cases
14:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> oh ok
14:13 < bridge_> <Ewan> 🧠
14:13 < bridge_> <learath2> For mods when they get a burst it can grow and go onto the stack with sth like smallvec
14:13 < bridge_> <learath2> Heap*
14:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i mean tbf it already is on the heap right now
14:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> just part of a class object
14:14 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah different part of heap is what concerns me
14:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well in theory this makes attacks harder
14:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs position independent
14:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> anyway
14:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i thought u meant it like only trusted ppl can grow the buffer
14:15 < bridge_> <learath2> Probably doesnt matter all that much since we have a fair bit margin on the critical path for now, but if we ever get too close every feature pr from then on will need to be also messing around with shaving a couple ms to fit theirs in
14:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i already find it annoying that rcon commands fill so slow 😬
14:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> gotta waste that traffic
14:16 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah that one is sadly a protocol limitation
14:16 < bridge_> <learath2> I send it as fast as we can iirc
14:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> a list of strings lmao
14:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> fast af
14:17 < bridge_> <learath2> Every day between 1400 and 1500 my chromecast will randomly restart. I'm about to go insane
14:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> does it send it one by one? 😄
14:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> high tec
14:17 < bridge_> <learath2> It'll restart in the middle of a youtube video or music
14:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> awful
14:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> google hardware products seem rly unstable in my experience
14:18 < bridge_> <learath2> Yes, I guess we can redo it with extended protocol now. That extension was made both for tw and ddrace at the same time using old netmsgs
14:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> all modern products are unstable af
14:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
14:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> we need to go back to linux 1 and try again
14:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
14:19 < bridge_> <learath2> Yes, my grandmothers nokia 3310 still works perfectly
14:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i still experience crackling in bluetooth headset sometimes
14:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> in 2023
14:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xd
14:19 < bridge_> <chairn> it will cease to work in France starting 2025, kinda already started for Free operator
14:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> it can tell me the weather
14:20 < bridge_> <learath2> At airports my bluetooth earphones will randomly experience cutouts from the extremely congested airspace
14:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but it cannot run stable af
14:20 < bridge_> <learath2> No more 1g support?
14:20 < bridge_> <chairn> 2g and 3g will be taken down
14:20 < bridge_> <chairn> but lots of people disagree and wants the government to impose the 2g to staty
14:20 < bridge_> <learath2> Turkey will keep 2g and 3g for a couple more decades. We are very poor 😄
14:20 < bridge_> <chairn> but lots of people disagree and wants the government to impose the 2g to stay
14:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> isnt this due to bluetooth changing frequency channel? it does it automatically iirc when it notices its disturbed or wmth
14:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i have no idea xDD
14:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i just noticed that on windows its the worst
14:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> with same bt adapter
14:24 < bridge_> <learath2> I just wish I could still use my wired IEMs
14:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> why can't you
14:25 < bridge_> <learath2> No headphone jack anymore
14:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> damn
14:25 < bridge_> <Ewan> i took u for a mobile dac kind of guy
14:26 < bridge_> <learath2> I was going to get a small dac as a reward to myself for having a flawless exam session, but I failed at the very last second
14:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> ithink i read about that. very unfortunate
14:26 < bridge_> <Ewan> dude i am so peeved at discord design
14:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> why is it when im typing sometimes a stupid ass sticker comes up, and when i press the up arrow key, it adds it???
14:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> don't they know that's what ppl use to go to the start of a text <input>
14:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> idiots

16:54 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1689432865.png
16:54 < ChillerDragon> ah no this is correct one
16:54 < ChillerDragon> idk how to check wether i never do :D
16:54 < ChillerDragon> ye rigged i do not live in louis town
17:05 < bridge_> <animepdf> :BLEHHHH:
17:06 < bridge_> <animepdf> type weather in your browser
18:37 < ChillerDragon> when delete teams on ddnet?
18:38 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1689439127.png
18:38 < ChillerDragon> on full servers there are always some trols blocking slots in teams
18:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> start by deleting team 0
18:43 < bridge_> <Iza> we don't kick afk players
19:13 < ChillerDragon> i dont say kick afk
19:14 < ChillerDragon> i say delete teams
19:20 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> i say delete chiller
20:14 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> whats wrong with teams
20:34 < ChillerDragon> they block slots for no gain
20:35 < ChillerDragon> imo there should always only one team per server
20:35 < ChillerDragon> sharing slots accross unrelated game state makes no sense
20:36 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> so what if you want to play with a friend on the server you lag on the least but the One Team is taken by 2 ppl afking
20:37 < ChillerDragon> its not like the 2 afks will block you
20:37 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> but the team is lockef
20:37 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> but the team is locked
20:37 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> and t0 will block you
20:38 < ChillerDragon> 2 afks dont block
20:40 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> wdym
20:40 < ChillerDragon> they afk how would they block you
20:40 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> you cant join the team, the team is locked
20:40 < ChillerDragon> ah you meak deleting teams means keeping lock feature?
20:41 < ChillerDragon> yea i guess some people really need that lock
20:41 < ChillerDragon> sure then unlock on afk
20:41 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> what does "only one team per server" mean the
20:41 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> then
20:41 < ChillerDragon> in my head it was just deleting teams
20:41 < ChillerDragon> but your suggesting is probably less feature removing
20:41 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> so only t0?
20:41 < ChillerDragon> yes
20:42 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> welp time to get constantly blocked by noobs
20:42 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> unless we somehow get a decent automod
20:44 < bridge_> <robyt3> Somehow `git branch --merged` no longer works after we started using GitHub merge queue. I previously used this command in a script to delete merged branches automatically. Now `git branch -d PR-Branch` also says `error: The branch 'PR-Branch' is not fully merged.` for branches that have been merged with the merge queue.
20:44 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> so bors isnt a thing anymore?
20:44 < bridge_> <robyt3> No
20:45 < bridge_> <robyt3> At least for us
20:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> well we rebase and merge
20:45 < bridge_> <robyt3> GitHub does everything already and bors is going away for private users
20:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> maybe bcs it rewrites the history your script thinks the pr is not fully merged
20:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> bcs it differs
20:45 < bridge_> <robyt3> Hmm, so if it rebases then it's not the same commit anymore
20:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon seriously
20:45 < ChillerDragon> yes
20:45 < ChillerDragon> seems sensible doesnt it?
20:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i can fully understand your arguments
20:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but removing is just stupid af
20:46 < ChillerDragon> why
20:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> i dont want to play with nobos just bcs u think its great
20:46 < ChillerDragon> you dont have to
20:46 < ChillerDragon> just pick a new server and lock it down
20:46 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> chiller what if all the servers that dont lag me are taken
20:46 < ChillerDragon> how often does that happen?
20:47 < ChillerDragon> donate more servers then
20:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> xDDDd
20:47 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> damn imagine locking a 64max server for just you and a friens
20:47 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> mega ego
20:47 < ChillerDragon> less players take up less ressources
20:47 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> no money
20:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> why is it so important to you that 2 slots are blocked
20:47 < ChillerDragon> can also spawn more servers than 
20:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u could even say 64p servers are already too big
20:47 < ChillerDragon> 64p servers are way too empty
20:47 < ChillerDragon> and there is always slots by teamers blocked
20:48 < ChillerDragon> sometimes even full teams of 8 players
20:48 < ChillerDragon> just makes no sense
20:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> so if they so empty, why does it matter if a few slots are taken
20:48 < ChillerDragon> if you really have to team do it somewhere where you do not take slots of t0
20:48 < ChillerDragon> because every tee counts
20:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> on ger servers u could try 128p servers
20:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but as if it matters
20:49 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> chiller why didnt **you** just go to a different server
20:49 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> nobo
20:49 < ChillerDragon> thats more complicated to implement
20:49 < ChillerDragon> but sure would be epic
20:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> even in team 0 there are often smaller groups
20:49 < ChillerDragon> @_voxeldoesart wdym?
20:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> if the map is large giving more tees into the server wont solve anything
20:49 < ChillerDragon> @_voxeldoesart i am in a team with 60 players in t0 and 4 dudes decide to block slots how does me leaving fix anything?
20:50 < ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ and these groups might meet its so fun about t0
20:50 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> are most of the 60 players actually playing
20:50 < ChillerDragon> no
20:50 < ChillerDragon> there are afks too
20:50 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> actually yknow what would be funny
20:50 < ChillerDragon> probably most playing
20:50 < ChillerDragon> but not all
20:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> u could maybe convince me to make team disabled servers
20:50 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> rate limit multeasymap to 32 players
20:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but removing the whole feature wont happen
20:51 < ChillerDragon> i propose a team disabled server to deen once a year since years
20:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> playing in smaller teams gives more skill anyway
20:51 < ChillerDragon> lerato, heinrich and deen made it clear there wont be any extra servers

20:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> . xD too true
20:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> "Every. Single. Thing. Chiller does is unsupported. I have never in an entire decade of being here seen this man request one thing that is standard
20:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> He is that one guy who would ask if he could sit in the cockpit jumpseat like it's the most normal thing ever." - Learath
20:55 < ChillerDragon> lerato is top10 most quotable ddnet player
20:55 < ChillerDragon> i actually have to quotes of lerato in my github profile xd

21:03 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> But he started merging
21:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: .... blaming me for not open source a future open source code xD

21:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ok enough stalking bye
21:10 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Oof why are private repos public .-.
21:11 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Only one of those repos is code and that’s chillerbot-zx because it contains features that could be used to gain unfair advantages
21:12 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> The rest is just backing up hentai
21:27 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> chiller why are you storing it on github
21:45 < bridge_> <smetanolub> https://i.imgur.com/bOrxvE3.png

23:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > The hard science-fiction take on Asteroids. There's even an in-universe explanation for the top-down 2D view. We're talking 9.5 on the Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness.
23:48 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> i sometimes forget ddnet is a linux game
