00:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you can use gold, but its value would be a lot less if we talk about its physical properties. the rest is literally just like bitcoin. it has value because people say it has value
00:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no
00:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not really
00:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> encrypted and authenticated connection
00:29 < bridge_> <totar> you can't make bitcoin in Jewlery which is the largest demand for gold.
00:29 < bridge_> <totar> you can't make bitcoin in Jewelry which is the largest demand for gold.
00:30 < bridge_> <totar> you can't make bitcoin into Jewelry which is the largest demand for gold.
00:31 < bridge_> <totar> I think if the price was lower there would be significantly more going into electronics
01:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, jewelry is another point of value for gold
01:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm not sure it's valued for its appearance or for its value though
01:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> are metals that look like gold as valuable?
01:12 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> pyrite?
01:19 < bridge_> <totar> I think the value comes from a lot of things, gold never oxidizes so it stays shiny when you find it naturally. I don't think many metals do that. Probably for that same reason it has been used as a form of currency for like 6000 years because it was so easy to identify.
01:22 < bridge_> <totar> I think even 6000 years ago it was used in Jewelry because it had value so it kinda sustained a self fulfilling value for most of recorded history, which of course makes people want it now.
01:22 < bridge_> <totar> The current price is also basically the same price that costs to produce it
01:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> got a source? probably to obtain it, I don't think producing is feasible
01:24 < bridge_> <totar> https://www.americanbullion.com/the-cost-of-producing-an-ounce-of-gold/
01:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah, maybe "produce" is a different word than "produzieren"?
01:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I wouldn't say "produzieren" in german for gold
01:24 < bridge_> <totar> idk
01:24 < bridge_> <totar> cost to mine it and purify
01:25 < bridge_> <totar> it says $1000-$1200 per ounce
01:25 < bridge_> <totar> market price is $1900
01:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the link says it depends on the region
01:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but yea, it's within one order of magnitude
01:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it probably also costs around 1 btc to mine a new btc ^^
01:29 < bridge_> <totar> yeah
01:29 < bridge_> <totar> although miners also charge fees to make up the difference
01:30 < bridge_> <totar> bitcoin is weird because the price depends on how many other people are trying to mine it
01:30 < bridge_> <totar> bitcoin is weird because the price to produce depends on how many other people are trying to mine it
01:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yea
01:35 < bridge_> <reitw> Seems to be alot fake lol
02:20 < bridge_> <totar> will this help with ddos?
08:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> In future it might help. It allows to use UDP with connections, so the filter can more easily know which traffic is legit. But apparently right now cloud flare has not done it yet
08:39 < ChillerDragon> routing gaming traffic through bloatflare sounds like horrible ping to me
08:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I guess they also offer protections for real time applications
08:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe not for free tho xd

09:44 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> yo, how can i transfrom &[u32] to &[u32; 256]? :D
09:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> With or without unsafe?
09:54 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> whats the easiest to understand? LD
09:54 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> whats the easiest to understand? :D
09:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno if rust even allows such big arrays tbh xd
09:54 < ChillerDragon> rust pro does
09:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Well if u don't care about perf. Create that array. Copy the slice over
09:55 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> heinrich did this but ive no clue how that works 😦

09:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I'm in holidays chiller, latest source is on github
09:56 < ChillerDragon> where
09:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> reverse-proxying of servers no longer being useful for stealing player secrets
09:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> eh, wrong quote
09:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> would make me more comfortable routing traffic through third-parties, maybe we could try steam's offering then
09:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/Jupeyy/dd-pg/tree/test2
09:57 < ChillerDragon> where is the bus with the people that care
09:57 < ChillerDragon> xd jk
09:57 < ChillerDragon> i meant where you on holidays
09:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
09:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Somewhere in the Netherlands
09:57 < ChillerDragon> blazingly netherlands
09:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you can use `.try_into()` these days, I think
09:58 < bridge_> <learath2> give coordinates
09:58 < ChillerDragon> lerato you better be quiet you still owe us a selfie in your university
09:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 1.0, 2.0
09:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> try into
09:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> iirc
09:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> too late :p
09:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rust allows big arrays, the limit is ur stack iirc
09:59 < bridge_> <learath2> That's off the coast of ghana, liar
09:59 < ChillerDragon> trol
09:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```rs
09:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> let x: Result<[u32; 256], _> = slice.try_into();
09:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```
09:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But the default initialization is limited isn't it
10:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ghana is Netherlands colony
10:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> only due to backcompat and due to missing specialization
10:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 🥹
10:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dont think so, i think the limit u talk about is initializing a big array in the heap cuz no placement new?
10:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah idk
10:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think with generics thats not a problem anymore
10:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk
10:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> const
10:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> generics*
10:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> This troll
10:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat good job starting friday rust
10:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Oh true
10:01 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> He did my job
10:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
10:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> nah, due to backcompat it's a problem. you can only `Default::default()` arrays of up to size 32 currently
10:01 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> in last few days ive learnt so much
10:01 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> about bits, bytes, operations on them
10:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Arrays of sizes from 0 to 32 (inclusive) implement the Default trait if the element type allows it. As a stopgap, trait implementations are statically generated up to size 32.
10:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
10:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Arrays of sizes from 1 to 12 (inclusive) implement From<Tuple>, where Tuple is a homogenous tuple of appropriate length.
10:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ur right
10:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but try_into works
10:02 < bridge_> <learath2> Ok, 600km off the coast of ghana ddnet meetup, lets go
10:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Slices have a dynamic size and do not coerce to arrays. Instead, use slice.try_into().unwrap() or <ArrayType>::try_from(slice).unwrap().
10:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.array.html
10:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> all the info is here btw
10:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I think a ddnet meetup would end up in chaos
10:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Array’s try_from(slice) implementations (and the corresponding slice.try_into() array implementations) succeed if the input slice length is the same as the result array length. They optimize especially well when the optimizer can easily determine the slice length, e.g. <[u8; 4]>::try_from(&slice[4..8]).unwrap().
10:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> C vs rust
10:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Backcomp vs future humans
10:03 < bridge_> <learath2> Since I hate irl conflict I'm very much a pushover irl, it'll be fine
10:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this would have sounded better if u said the classic line "somewhere in nevada..."
10:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> For collect I still have to use an arrayvec 🥹
10:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/madness-combat-itsa-latiospoon-hank-tricky-gif-21423933
10:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i watched to much madness combat
10:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I mean Netherlands is small
10:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 do u think rust can achieve a non or semi cooperative preemptive  scheduler like go?
10:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> does go have a preemptive scheduler?
10:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> since 1.19 i think
10:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> link?
10:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> tokio is just cooperative
10:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73915144/why-is-go-considered-partially-preemptive
10:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
10:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
10:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > My answer is built on top of Andrew and Daniel's answers, and entirely based on this talk.
10:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
10:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Since go 1.14, the go scheduler is non-cooperative pre-emptive. Each go routine is pre-empted after a certain time slice. It's 10ms in go 1.19.1.
10:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
10:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > In the talk I mentioned earlier, starting 20:35, you can find the history about how the scheduler used purely co-operative pre-emption in 1.0, then compiler baked in pre-emption with go 1.2, and finally the current nature - non-coperative pre-emption.
10:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i know tokio is cooperative, thats why i ask
10:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think with a systems programming lang it might be hard
10:06 < bridge_> <learath2> What even is this btw? Why the double cast? Why to _
10:06 < bridge_> <learath2> ?
10:07 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> all questions to heinrich
10:07 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> but it works :p
10:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> btw if u want to make a ptr without making a intermediate reference, https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ptr/macro.addr_of.html is better
10:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Creating a reference with &/&mut is only allowed if the pointer is properly aligned and points to initialized data. For cases where those requirements do not hold, raw pointers should be used instead. However, &expr as *const _ creates a reference before casting it to a raw pointer, and that reference is subject to the same rules as all other references. This macro can create a raw pointer without creating a reference first.
10:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> My guess Double cast bcs pointer of type, pointer of void
10:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye the double cast is common
10:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> _ BCS lazy
10:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50384395/why-does-casting-from-a-reference-to-a-c-void-pointer-require-a-double-cast
10:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ok i think this is unrelated
10:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> The preview looks like what I meant
10:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat but just use try_into
10:09 < bridge_> <learath2> Why can't one go to void ptr directly I wonder
10:09 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i did
10:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and its even better if u take a slice of ur slice
10:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> with the length
10:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think
10:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ` They optimize especially well when the optimizer can easily determine the slice length, e.g. <[u8; 4]>::try_from(&slice[4..8]).unwrap().`
10:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but better check godbolt xd
10:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Explicitness I guess xd
10:11 < bridge_> <learath2> Where is this from btw?
10:11 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> huffman coding in libtw2
10:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think first cast is from reference to pointer of typeof freq, then a cast to void
10:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, it's not supported, it'd need compiler support
10:14 < bridge_> <learath2> It's very meh that I can't read this piece of code without an IDE, type inference was a mistake :pepeW:
10:15 < ChillerDragon> woah we got gui errors now? :D
10:15 < ChillerDragon> fancy
10:15 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1691136896.png
10:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Then u'd also need to prefix all variables with type prefixes
10:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/2c77f799f0e40ff80c2580c6ff0ed8ad19041c4e/huffman/src/lib.rs#L209
10:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'd say it's only missing experience
10:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ChillerDragon fancy af isn't it?
10:16 < ChillerDragon> yes!
10:16 < ChillerDragon> very windows user friendly
10:16 < ChillerDragon> did you build that?
10:16 < bridge_> <learath2> Their names? I don't mind the name not having the information as long as I can refer to the deifnition for the type
10:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the first cast can only be to the same type
10:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and the second one must be to the type expected in `from_frequencies
10:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and the second one must be to the type expected in `from_frequencies`
10:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah but somewhere in the usage of the variable it would be clear what type it has
10:17 < bridge_> <learath2> First cast is understandable, second cast is tougher, because there is a &* outside
10:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> can only be the target type, otherwise type inference doesn't work
10:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> i.e. `*const [u32; 256]`
10:19 < bridge_> <learath2> I see
10:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 would u use try into nowadays
10:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in that code?
10:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> obviously
10:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> was just curious
10:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
10:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it does the same as `.try_into().unwrap()`
10:19 < bridge_> <learath2> I'd still rather have my types explicit there
10:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but back then, `try_into()` didn't exist
10:19 < bridge_> <learath2> but I have an old spirit, don't mind me
10:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 the more u talk like this the more u seem like a old man nagging xd
10:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> "i have an old spirit"
10:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> XDddd
10:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :oldchrono:
10:20 < bridge_> <learath2> Life has instantly added 30 years to my age
10:20 < bridge_> <learath2> :feelsOldMan: <- me
10:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :pepeW:
10:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Back when we only had registers we never encountered such array cast problems
10:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> true
10:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> imagine having types
10:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> in C, you'd also just omit the check, probably
10:22 < bridge_> <learath2> This entire function doesn't make much sense in C anyway
10:22 < bridge_> <learath2> No slices, it's all pointers
10:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nicely placed asserts can make the optimizer improve perf right?
10:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i always forget to place asserts
10:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> always place assert!s about assumptions you make 😉
10:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yeah
10:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's nice to find bugs
10:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but i just dont have the habit
10:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i need to get that habit
10:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If panic is your first instruction, then that improves performance
10:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but a assert checking a array len
10:23 < bridge_> <learath2> If you pipe all output into /dev/null it helps a lot with performance
10:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> allows the opt to make assumptions
10:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yep, is always the question how far the compiler does tho
10:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs
10:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > I've always admired the write performance of the /dev/null schema-less database, the read performance however is a little lacking, but this is offset by /dev/null's data compression ... totally unmatched!    :)))))

10:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> This video
10:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its just so funny
10:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and so meme
10:25 < bridge_> <learath2> You just need to read from it until enough bits are flipped by cosmic rays, it should only take about 2 heat deaths of the universe, it's acceptable read performance
10:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why these characters talk about dev
10:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ChillerDragon did u try to run it in release
10:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> To enjoy the map loading perf
10:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> That's the only selling point right now
10:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> So I have to strongly highlight it
10:30 < bridge_> <learath2> I used mongodb for sth recently btw, it truly is web scale
10:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> And since variants are so nice in rust u get the network packets as structs
10:31 < bridge_> <learath2> you turn it on and it just scales, just like that
10:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :pepeW:
10:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Instead of getstring lmao
10:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @scar17off did u forgot some files here?
10:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Or what black magic does this make work
10:35 < bridge_> <scar17off> no
10:35 < bridge_> <scar17off> or yes
10:35 < bridge_> <scar17off> idk

15:51 < ChillerDragon> im quality medic reviving dead code
16:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ChillerDragon oh no so many IRC discord bugs. I guess u have to fix all before working on useless ddnet again
16:25 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> how "un"fortunate
16:35 < ChillerDragon> hrhrhr
16:36 < ChillerDragon> im kinda blocked to work on irc discord because i can for the life of it not connect to irc from my vps using nodejs 
16:36 < ChillerDragon> works locally or with the vps using weechat
16:37 < ChillerDragon> i get no error and it just does not connect so idk wat to do. Probably henrich lifebanned bridge name because he is true 0.7 enjoyer

19:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why does float need nan?
19:07 < ChillerDragon> whats first class supposed to mean
19:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> BCS devs are bad

19:08 < ChillerDragon> have you tried irc?
19:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> For streaming? Sounds like a very good idea
19:08 < ChillerDragon> i know thanks
19:08 < ChillerDragon> twitch also uses it
19:08 < ChillerDragon> must be good
19:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> True
19:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> False
19:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
19:09 < ChillerDragon> omg
19:09 < ChillerDragon> lawayer jopsti
19:09 < ChillerDragon> i got removed from ddnet++ credits
19:09 < ChillerDragon> what are my rights?
19:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Who removed you
19:10 < ChillerDragon> the russians!
19:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Then simply add it back
19:11 < ChillerDragon> They host their own russian ddnet++ fork which i have no access to .-.
19:11 < ChillerDragon> i need to start a legal battle
19:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Would be funny
19:11 < ChillerDragon> xd
19:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Would be cool if it works out
19:12 < ChillerDragon> dont think my license covers it
19:12 < ChillerDragon> they would rape me in court
19:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> You could write a letter to putin
19:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I bet he cares and has time for you
19:13 < ChillerDragon> you do pro bono right?
19:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Wat
19:14 < ChillerDragon> free and open source lawyer jospti and partners
19:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah ofc
19:17 < bridge_> <smetanolub> sorry, i think its made by chillerdragon, i dont wanna touch that
19:17 < bridge_> <smetanolub> may be we should make a whitelist only servers?
19:18 < bridge_> <smetanolub> you just tell admins ur ip and u can join
19:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Destroyed
19:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> @smetanolub if you don't want your server to be ddosed don't register it in master server
19:20 < ChillerDragon> fak bad chiler brand?
19:20 < ChillerDragon> i need to hire new marketing manager
19:20 < bridge_> <smetanolub> i dont want to die when i almost beat r1 on solo cuz ddnet is almost always have packetloss, and if not its under ddos
19:21 < bridge_> <smetanolub> even when its perfectly fine ping just jumps, its not stabler
19:21 < bridge_> <smetanolub> even when its perfectly fine ping just jumps, its not stable
19:21 < bridge_> <smetanolub> captcha is at least something we can do
19:21 < bridge_> <smetanolub> like for ger10 u join site, why not put captcha there?
19:21 < bridge_> <smetanolub> some google shit idc
19:22 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Bro, it won't do anything xd
19:23 < bridge_> <smetanolub> yeah... then what will do? account system? my own ddnet verified lan server?
19:23 < bridge_> <smetanolub> we doesnt have that
19:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Is ger10 also unstable for you?
19:23 < bridge_> <smetanolub> yes
19:23 < bridge_> <smetanolub> and its even worse than rus and ger2
19:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I think they are the only servers with custom ddos filter
19:23 < bridge_> <smetanolub> on ger10 packetloss is 25-50% almost always
19:23 < bridge_> <smetanolub> ger2 is around 10% and not always
19:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Account system won't help
19:24 < bridge_> <smetanolub> rus is without it but still not stable
19:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Reverse proxies might help a bit
19:24 < bridge_> <smetanolub> nothing will help, cuz guy sold his parents car and house to spent it on ddos
19:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Or if cloud flare adds quic protection some day, that will help
19:24 < bridge_> <smetanolub> allow me to fucking start a lan offline server which counts ranks
19:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Sad but true xd
19:24 < bridge_> <smetanolub> for at least solo and dummy maps
19:25 < bridge_> <smetanolub> dont even tell me you cant do that cuz cant protect it from cheats
19:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> We could theoretically allow uploading inputs of a run to verify a rank.. but it's a hard topic really
19:26 < bridge_> <smetanolub> all cheats existing rn works oflline and online perfectly even with ddnet lags
19:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Will it increase cheating etc
19:26 < bridge_> <smetanolub> can you increase it higher?
19:26 < ChillerDragon> yes lets rebrand lag as anti cheat
19:26 < bridge_> <smetanolub> everyone exept old players use cheats rn
19:26 < ChillerDragon> high ping makes replay bot harder
19:26 < bridge_> <smetanolub> almost all new players use cheat clients
19:26 < ChillerDragon> > almost all new players use cheat clients
19:26 < ChillerDragon> WATF
19:26 < bridge_> <smetanolub> bro im from rus ddnet communiity
19:27 < bridge_> <smetanolub> i know who bots, when, with what client
19:27 < bridge_> <smetanolub> and i wont tell you
19:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Good idea xd
19:27 < bridge_> <smetanolub> i think its GOOD to cheat ingame where others cheaters exist but no anticheat
19:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Wtf
19:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ok enough internet for the moment
19:28 < bridge_> <smetanolub> teehistorian really? to bypass it they use 90 degrees bind so it wont teleport
19:28 < bridge_> <smetanolub> oh crosshair teleport for aimbot? they dont use it, cuz triggerhook exists
19:28 < ChillerDragon> xd
19:28 < bridge_> <smetanolub> if you both have cheats and competit, its ok
19:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no advocating cheats please
19:30 < bridge_> <smetanolub> idk about ger much, but many rus players that come after game came to steam use cheats, cuz they join block gamemode, and ppl there just sell cheats
19:30 < bridge_> <smetanolub> like mur and others
19:30 < bridge_> <smetanolub> i dont
19:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> > i think its GOOD to cheat if […]
19:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, you did
19:31 < bridge_> <smetanolub> i just play it to competition, and if the guy which i play  uses it-i will use it too
19:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no, stop it
19:31 < ChillerDragon> @smetanolub please tell @learath2 about your idea on how to fix ddos its really good captchas and so on maybe he did not think of it yet
19:31 < bridge_> <smetanolub> if you can catch me-do it i will take punishment
19:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> cheating is not okay. it's just like blocking
19:31 < bridge_> <smetanolub> i think there are captchas like google captcha, why cant we use it?
19:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because adding a captcha doesn't help
19:32 < bridge_> <smetanolub> even if google wont share it, there are many others who did their own captcha
19:32 < ChillerDragon> ask @learath2 he likes discussing that
19:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but it does hurt, people will need to solve captchas
19:32 < bridge_> <smetanolub> lets think about it
19:32 < bridge_> <smetanolub> how to bypass captcha?
19:32 < bridge_> <smetanolub> dont make it ingame in chat obviously at least
19:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> attacks against game servers work by sending packets to the game server's IP address
19:33 < bridge_> <smetanolub> lets make servers where only admin can whitlist ppl they know
19:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if you only show the IP address after a captcha, the attacker will solve the captcha and then attack the game server
19:33 < bridge_> <smetanolub> learath did it in the past and it did work
19:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you haven't gained anything
19:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> can we discuss the captcha to the end first?
19:33 < bridge_> <smetanolub> you said why captcha doesnt help, why argue? you know better, im not a dev
19:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> okay, next idea:
19:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> private servers
19:34 < bridge_> <smetanolub> captcha is just one of many thing we could think of
19:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't like them. it favors established players
19:34 < bridge_> <smetanolub> yea
19:34 < bridge_> <smetanolub> and its good
19:34 < bridge_> <smetanolub> if you allow 3pts player join insane map, something is wrong bro
19:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I wouldn't want to equate points to skill
19:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> very roughly maybe, but points are mostly about how much time you spent finishing ddnet maps
19:35 < bridge_> <smetanolub> you know that i talk not about pts, but about that player is new to game and he didnt even play yet
19:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no, it seemed to me like you talk about points. okay, let's say a new player
19:36 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think a new player has every right to join a game server with a map that the new player can't finish
19:36 < bridge_> <smetanolub> why
19:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because they want to see people play, for example
19:37 < bridge_> <smetanolub> you can just add them to pause
19:38 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> who would decide who to whitelist? if it's "Learath2", then we either get an overworked Learath2 or many players who can't join
19:38 < ChillerDragon> and add ddos to pause too
19:38 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> uhhuh
19:38 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> by what criterion would we allow people to play on whitelisted servers?
19:38 < bridge_> <smetanolub> Myr. is guy selling cheats
19:39 < bridge_> <smetanolub> how long they play
19:39 < bridge_> <smetanolub> lets say if guy plays 5 years, he can play something hard?
19:39 < bridge_> <smetanolub> points
19:39 < bridge_> <smetanolub> recomendations from old players
19:40 < bridge_> <smetanolub> you decide, you the one who will develop it
19:40 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> well, if I decide then it's: we don't do it. favoring old players over old ones is bad
19:40 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> well, if I decide then it's: we don't do it. I think favoring old players over old ones is bad
19:40 < bridge_> <smetanolub> :pepeW:
19:40 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> ?
19:40 < bridge_> <smetanolub> okay lets play under ddos then
19:41 < bridge_> <skystrife.> Just make accounts 🙂
19:41 < bridge_> <smetanolub> its sad that i need to beg you to think about it
19:41 < bridge_> <smetanolub> how does it protect from ddos????
19:41 < bridge_> <learath2> You send captcha to indian captcha farm, they solve it
19:42 < bridge_> <learath2> How will captchas solve ddos anyway? You need to solve captcha to get whitelisted?
19:42 < bridge_> <skystrife.> Can only join server if you have verified account
19:42 < bridge_> <smetanolub> captcha is a crude idea that came to me when i thought about the question 0 seconds
19:42 < bridge_> <smetanolub> if you said it wont work-dont argue it again
19:42 < bridge_> <smetanolub> i just ask you to do at least something, i cant play without lags nowadays
19:42 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> ok cope with it
19:43 < bridge_> <learath2> I'm just curious what you were thinking, no need to get heated
19:43 < bridge_> <learath2> If it's a captcha to get whitelisted thing, it's not much better than our ger10 solution. Instead of a captcha we rely on a tcp handshake there
19:43 < bridge_> <smetanolub> work is underway on protection against ddos? on anti-cheat? that's all i need
19:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> accounts would probably help with anticheat a little
19:44 < bridge_> <smetanolub> @learath2 when we did play bit3 on ur server, noone had lags
19:44 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> @konsti
19:44 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> oops
19:44 < bridge_> <smetanolub> for anticheat i think we must first make game closed source
19:44 < ChillerDragon> xd
19:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if I ever finish the QUIC stuff, I might take a look at steam's reverse proxy services. that could help with DoS
19:44 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> fuck no
19:44 < bridge_> <smetanolub> or at least, not putting source of teehistorian on internet
19:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's about as helpful as adding a captcha
19:45 < bridge_> <learath2> @_noby is the anticheat department. Anti-ddos we tried lots of things, ger10 is kinda the last iteration of it. I don't think we have any other ideas to try, optimizing that with @davide55 can help, and there is the many reverse proxies idea we have but there is lots to be thought about
19:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> teehistorian is just about storing information that players send to the servers. making it closed source does not improve any security
19:45 < bridge_> <smetanolub> since game is open source, and "anticheat" too, its impossible to catch someone who thinks a bit
19:45 < bridge_> <smetanolub> at least on noby server anticheat is without source for people
19:46 < bridge_> <smetanolub> so people dont use aimbot, only zoom and aimlines
19:46 < bridge_> <learath2> We use the same anticheat as noby, the source is hidden for us too
19:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that works because it's server-side. not because it's closed source
19:46 < bridge_> <smetanolub> some people like me just use dummy, to parse tees position on map and bypass drawdistance
19:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> CSGO also has cheaters, and now?
19:46 < bridge_> <smetanolub> but there are no aimbots at least
19:46 < ChillerDragon> csgo has no aimbots?
19:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @smetanolub sorry, but admitting to cheating is too much. timed out
19:47 < bridge_> <learath2> Rip
19:47 < ChillerDragon> censor5991
19:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> ChillerDragon you read out of context
19:47 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> LOL
19:47 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> smartest russian alive
19:47 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> :troll:
19:47 < ChillerDragon> omagawd jopsti is it me braincells or is it discord replies?
19:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Reply
19:47 < ChillerDragon> henirch stop ban russian start ban reply
19:48 < bridge_> <learath2> Tfw heinrich radicalised Smetanolub, now he'll go back to spamming the servers instead of giving helpful antiddos tips
19:48 < ChillerDragon> yes
19:48 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> @_voxeldoesart hi
19:48 < ChillerDragon> engage in conversation
19:48 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> wow that was helpful
19:48 < ChillerDragon> instead of encouraging cheating by exlcuding him
19:48 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> whats next? taking the servers and pushing them somewhere else?
19:49 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> maybe it will stop the ddos
19:49 < ChillerDragon> lerato got it
19:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If you start servers on the Mars
19:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Why not
19:49 < ChillerDragon> just run ddnet servers on apple hardware
19:49 < ChillerDragon> they patched ddos on the silicon
19:49 < bridge_> <learath2> Though in all seriousness I think our very best bet is the many reverse proxies approach. We need lots of cheap proxy servers that we don't advertise the ips of but give out through one announceserver
19:49 < ChillerDragon> using room temperature
19:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
19:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> That is important
19:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It works on room temperature
19:50 < ChillerDragon> @learath2 Though in all seriousness it would be cooler to use selfhosted proxies using heinrichs closed proxy support pr instead of relying on corpo steam
19:50 < bridge_> <learath2> And some steam reverse proxies, steam ones probably will never die because valve stronk. So atleast steam players can have mostly a decent experience
19:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yep, with accounts this could™️ be managable
19:51 < bridge_> <learath2> Yeah lots of open ones we host + some steam ones
19:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and thus everyone, because people won't DoS our own reverse proxies
19:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because it hits almost no one
19:51 < bridge_> <learath2> You underestimate the brain damage some of these individuals suffer from
19:51 < ChillerDragon> rude
19:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's simple. people do it for impact. if it does no impact, then they won't do it
19:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Learath is my hero
19:52 < bridge_> <learath2> Sorry, s/brain damage/special behaviour/
19:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> see e.g. our old masterservers
19:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> people don't DoS them anymore
19:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because it's no use
19:52 < ChillerDragon> dodged a bullet there lerato
19:52 < ChillerDragon> if you rude against ddosers again i timeout you lerato
19:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Xdd
19:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ok time for beach ⛱️
19:53 < bridge_> <learath2> But the reverse proxies will mostly be cheap servers, if we dont have enough of them they might collect the ips and have enough bw to dos them all
19:53 < ChillerDragon> just put a captcha in front of the ips
19:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ?!?
19:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I thought we were through with the captcha idea
19:53 < ChillerDragon> ok sorry i stop i must me so annoying xd
19:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Some hosters allow buying servers for any time u want xd
19:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Heinrich dies internally
19:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> anyway. I should continue on the quic stuff
19:54 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> still so much to do
19:54 < bridge_> <learath2> Accounts will/can serve as some form of captcha anyway, dw about the captcha
19:55 < bridge_> <learath2> DigitalOcean gave me the same ip when I reimaged a new server, so rerolling ips isn't trivial on most hosters, and might even be considered abuse :/
19:55 < ChillerDragon> Wait so if i rent a server cancle it and buy a new i get the same ip!
19:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> aws could probably give you a bunch of IP addresses
19:56 < ChillerDragon> i totally did not expect that but i guess it makes sense they also dont want you to use their service to burn all their ips
19:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but expensive traffic
19:56 < ChillerDragon> im sure that under a certain treshhold aws is free
19:56 < bridge_> <learath2> You can spin up a new one before spinning down the old one for a new ip, but it's a little annoying to manage
19:57 < ChillerDragon> how many ips are you even aiming for?
19:57 < bridge_> <Voxel> nohello
19:57 < bridge_> <learath2> I'd aim for less than 10 players per proxy if possible
19:57 < ChillerDragon> woah
19:57 < bridge_> <learath2> But that might be cost prohibitive 😭
19:58 < ChillerDragon> what about ipv6 arent those basically free?
19:59 < ChillerDragon> or do we need the actual machine under it as well?
19:59 < ChillerDragon> i didnt fully get the idea
19:59 < ChillerDragon> can someone draw me a cool diagram how proxies solve ddos? :D 
20:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> everyone gets their own "server"
20:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but all the servers are just reverse proxies for the actual game server
20:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you can DoS your own server if you want
20:00 < ChillerDragon> okay
20:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but that just hits you
20:00 < ChillerDragon> but isnt the proxie redirecting the traffic?
20:00 < ChillerDragon> so also the dos packets?
20:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the volumetric DoS traffic isn't teeworlds traffic
20:01 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> wow ok
20:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> so the reverse proxy would just drop it
20:01 < ChillerDragon> so the reverse proxy implements the tw protocol?
20:01 < bridge_> <learath2> Wouldn't that be WAY too expensive?
20:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I was trying to get the idea across
20:02 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not give an implementation
20:03 < bridge_> <learath2> You get lots of ipv6 per server, but those are routed per subnet, so we cant increase the amount of traffic we can process like that
20:03 < ChillerDragon> its network bandwith what is the limit not the cpu of the host?
20:04 < bridge_> <learath2> Both, for our cheaper servers its cpu, for our more expensive servers its usually bandwidth
20:04 < ChillerDragon> i still did not get how the proxy would filter out bad backets
20:04 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the easiest attacks are the volumetric attacks
20:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> where our servers are hit with reflected DNS traffic e.g.
20:05 < ChillerDragon> a
20:05 < ChillerDragon> so the attacker can not make those send valid tw udp packets
20:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the reverse proxies wouldn't forward these
20:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
20:05 < ChillerDragon> i see
20:05 < ChillerDragon> i assumed the attacker has full control over the payload
20:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> additionally, we can just drop the player if they send too much traffic
20:05 < ChillerDragon> true
20:05 < bridge_> <learath2> And if it is valid tw traffic we still dont have to proxy as is. Nothing stops us from filtering on those too
20:06 < ChillerDragon> so how complex would the proxy be?
20:06 < ChillerDragon> how much of the protocol would it implement?
20:06 < ChillerDragon> does it keep state of in game stuff?
20:06 < bridge_> <learath2> We can only allow whitelisted people to join the proxies in the first place, heavily filtering the amount of traffic from the hosters upstream firewall
20:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> a little as possible
20:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no
20:07 < ChillerDragon> yea sounds good
20:07 < ChillerDragon> wouldnt need quic tho would it?
20:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> someone else can work on proxy stuff
20:07 < bridge_> <learath2> It doesn't but I guess it might be a nice time to do the protocol change too
20:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm doing quic first
20:08 < ChillerDragon> lets also drop 0.6 while at it :P
20:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no
20:08 < ChillerDragon> sadge
20:09 < ChillerDragon> soon we have 4 competing standards
20:09 < ChillerDragon> gotta love it
20:09 < ChillerDragon> split the 1000 player base in chunks of 250
20:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> we only split it if we drop 0.6
20:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not if we continue supporting both
20:10 < ChillerDragon> one part playing 0.6 the other playing 0.7 the other playing quic and the last playing ddnet2
20:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> tbf there's not a lot of players on 0.7
20:10 < ChillerDragon> guess why
20:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> on pure 0.7
20:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because of the compatibility break to 0.6
20:10 < ChillerDragon> because ddnet held it back with its market share
20:10 < ChillerDragon> and dried out ctf
20:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think you're assigning blame to the wrong thing
20:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> 0.7 changed the network protocol
20:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not ddnet
20:11 < ChillerDragon> cant blame vanilla to update the protocol every 10 years can you
20:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> they could have done it in a backward compatible fashion
20:12 < ChillerDragon> agreed
20:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and that's the issue
20:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you however seem to advocate breaking compatibility
20:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> when it was the thing that caused 0.7's death
20:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> when it is the thing that caused 0.7's death
20:13 < ChillerDragon> im trying to fix the incompability issue
20:13 < ChillerDragon> by enforcing one united standard again
20:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> great. make that quic
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/ba-dum-tsss-drum-band-gif-7320811
20:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> there's no point of changing to the 0.7 protocol
20:13 < ChillerDragon> will you implement quic for upstream?
20:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's not better than 0.6+ddnet extensions
20:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> probably not. because development died
20:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'll provide a library that you can use to implement support for it in teeworlds 0.7
20:15 < ChillerDragon> then quic will not be the united standard
20:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because you don't implement it for teeworlds 0.7, urd
20:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because you don't implement it for teeworlds 0.7, yes
20:15 < ChillerDragon> so i should do it? xd
20:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you can do it if you want
20:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I won't stop you
20:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the library will probably make it somewhat easy
20:15 < ChillerDragon> bro it took me 2 years to get a half ass connection of ddnet client to 0.7 servers xd
20:16 < ChillerDragon> how even does the quic stuff work?
20:16 < ChillerDragon> does it unpack to the same traffic?
20:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's an actual standard 😉
20:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
20:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's the plan
20:16 < ChillerDragon> so its quic + 0.6
20:17 < ChillerDragon> so adding quic to upstream would still be incompatible
20:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it seems you want to achieve an impossible thing
20:18 < ChillerDragon> yea i want vanilla and ddnet to be compatible again
20:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you want ddnet clients to be able to connect to 0.7 servers?
20:18 < ChillerDragon> yes
20:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's an interesting extension and I'd be okay with that
20:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> however, ddnet will not change to a worse protocol fo it
20:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> however, ddnet will not change to a worse protocol for it
20:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> to me it'd be okay if the ddnet client *also* supported the 0.7 protocol
20:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but that will not make ddnet speak the 0.7 protocol to ddnet servers. because that's just worse than our own protocol
20:21 < ChillerDragon> how is it worse?
20:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it doesn't support encryption, authentication, and is not standard
20:22 < ChillerDragon> so our already refers to quic
20:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> well, the 0.7 protocol is also not better than 0.6
20:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> well, the 0.7 protocol is also not better than 0.6+ddnet extensions
20:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> hmm
20:22 < ChillerDragon> why not
20:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not a lot ^^
20:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> why is it?
20:22 < ChillerDragon> well okay not better maybe
20:22 < ChillerDragon> but not worse
20:22 < ChillerDragon> i would say
20:23 < ChillerDragon> imo replacing 0.6+ddnet with 0.7+ddnet is totally fine
20:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> doesn't help though
20:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1137088391205359656/xzqfmjhd04gb1.webp
20:23 < ChillerDragon> plus the benefit of native upstream compat
20:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it doesn't provide a lot of benefits
20:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and mostly downsides
20:23 < ChillerDragon> agreed actually
20:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> we probably have more players on old ddnet versions than players on 0.7
20:24 < ChillerDragon> sounds true
20:24 < ChillerDragon> thing is i do not see teeworlds downgrading to 0.6
20:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u dont see tw moving at all
20:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its ded
20:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> (disclaimer: this is not a attack to any project)
20:25 < ChillerDragon> xd
20:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it would be fun to see a well structured tw, without any backcompat stuff, just a blank start
20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> using the knowledge from current tw
20:26 < ChillerDragon> ddnet2
20:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> even ddnet2 would have legacy code
20:27 < ChillerDragon> jopsti is not adding back compat is he?
20:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but u need to keep physics bugs
20:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ok thats backcompat
20:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nvm
20:27 < ChillerDragon> there are no bugs
20:27 < ChillerDragon> just features
20:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> iirc the sg bug is UB
20:28 < ChillerDragon> then make it non UB
20:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think someone made it non-UB already
20:28 < ChillerDragon> ez
20:28 < ChillerDragon> ddnet without sg bug would be worse change my mind
20:29 < ChillerDragon> @ryozuki lets also patch the wallhammer :p
20:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lets patch chillerbot
20:29 < ChillerDragon> ._.
20:30 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> true
20:30 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> lets patch 4 dummies
20:30 < bridge_> <Voxel> i want ddnet 2.0 to be so complex with with its graphics youd need an nvidea to play it properly (joke)
20:30 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> :gigachad:
20:30 < ChillerDragon> if you cant run ddnet2 buy new pc
20:30 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> jesus christ no thanks
20:31 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> how do you get the elasticity tunes btw
20:31 < ChillerDragon> i cant wait for new annoying vasten100 tune maps
20:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> vasten100  legend
20:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> up n down
20:32 < ChillerDragon> if i say my true opinion about vasten and up n down
20:32 < ChillerDragon> heirnich would even open irc to ban me out of existance
20:33 <@heinrich5991> I'm ready
20:33 < ChillerDragon> ou shit
20:33 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> bossfight
20:33 < ChillerDragon> while i disagree with vasten100s style of mapping i have to say he is a totally fine individual
20:35 < bridge_> <Voxel> nice save
20:38 < ChillerDragon> i wish heinrich and lerato would change roles
20:39 < ChillerDragon> lerato being in charge or code and chat moderation
20:39 < ChillerDragon> would allow using bad word usage 
20:39 < ChillerDragon> and goto statements in ddnet codebase
20:46 < bridge_> <Voxel> i cant wait until i get the time to code all my dreams
20:47 < ChillerDragon> Voxel you hittin da c++ books currently?
20:48 < ChillerDragon> @Voxel why wait arent you ddnet pro contributer already?
20:48 < ChillerDragon> #6841
20:48 < chillerbot> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6841
20:48 < bridge_> <Voxel> no because i have other things to focus on first
20:49 < bridge_> <Voxel> that update was so buggy LOL
20:49 < ChillerDragon> xd
20:50 < bridge_> <Voxel> idk what else i could do that other ppl arent doing
20:50 < ChillerDragon> you got 498 open issues to choose from
20:51 < ChillerDragon> #6963
20:51 < chillerbot> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6963
20:51 < ChillerDragon> for example china banning the space key
20:51 < ChillerDragon> xd
20:52 < ChillerDragon> no but srsly what about this one @Voxel #5781

21:27 < bridge_> <smetanolub> @learath2 i think we need you as a moderator
21:28 < bridge_> <smetanolub> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnQFkz50oU cuz some moderators act like this
21:34 < ChillerDragon> xd
21:36 < bridge_> <learath2> If only I had the time
21:40 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> that video is just asesome
22:07 < bridge_> <smetanolub> you wont have time even if you will be 24/7 free, only bad moderator wants to be moderator
22:13 < bridge_> <smetanolub> i think we should make a ./report command, so ppl dont need to text server,ingame name, ip, blocker name in discord
22:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> we can probably reintroduce that command once we have a notion of accounts
22:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> previously, it was abused pretty hard
23:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Thanks for news. Always interesting
