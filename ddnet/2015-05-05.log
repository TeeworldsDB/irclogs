00:00 < fstd> seems pretty straightforward, what's the issue?
00:01 < Learath2> savander: just wait a bit until its been some time from the release of jessie
00:01 < savander> can't found virtualbox* packages.
00:01 < fstd> savander: what does that mean?
00:02 < savander> can't install vboxvideo
00:02 < savander> driver.
00:03 <@deen> Learath2: they invited me after one of my articles was upvoted :P
00:03 < fstd> savander: do you realize that it would be more useful if you shared some information besides "it doesnt work"?
00:04 < fstd> for example, a transcript of your attempts to follow the steps in the wiki
00:04 <@deen> Also, I reduced the binary by 1 more byte!!!
00:04 <@deen> (and 32bit x86 is much smaller)
00:05 < fstd> are you using an executable packer?
00:05 < fstd> UPX or so
00:05 <@deen> no
00:05 <@deen> I'm writing the ELF by hand
00:06 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/nim-binary-size/blob/master/elf32.s
00:06 < fstd> ah i though this was about ddnet :)
00:06 <@deen> hehe, no
00:06 <@deen> wouldn't care about 1 byte :P
00:07 <@deen> I'm down to 149 bytes for x86-64 and 118 for x86. From what I can see it's not possible to go any smaller
00:07 < Learath2> deen: do quite like your nes code
00:07 < eeeee> UPX doesn't work well with windoze antivirus, shouldn't use it
00:07 <@deen> 116 for x86*
00:07 < Learath2> still in the process of learning nim tho so its kinda hard to grasp at some parts
00:07 <@deen> Learath2: feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear
00:13 < savander> Yay :) Virtualbox Guest Additions installed. I needed to add  contrib to sources.list
00:14 < savander> now graphics and mouse drivers works. 
00:26 < fstd> time to buy a mac
03:53 < eeeee> first i was like "from 160 kb to 150 kb, meh"
03:53 < eeeee> then i realized 150 is actually bytes
11:37 < Savander> hi.
11:39 <@deen> hi
15:01  * Deathman slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
15:01 <@deen> Deathman: hi
16:51 < savander> AWS activated my account. I made instance and run teeworlds server, looks great 
17:16 < fstd> server teeworlds is best teeworlds
17:17 < savander> XD
17:17 < savander> i don't need anything more
17:17 < savander> it's free, so
20:04 < Nimda> BoX by Blade just released on Ddmax at 2015-05-05 20:03

20:42 < o_be_one> hi all :)
21:46 < eeeee> server teeworlds won't be free for long with only 15gb of traffic
21:49 <@EastByte> it's time to test some stressing services :D
22:25 < savander> it won't be very expensive
22:26 < savander> i gues.
22:26 < savander> i guess.
