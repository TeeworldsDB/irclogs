00:01 < Just_a_Nick> @deen can I ask you something?
00:01 <@deen> as long as you don't assume I'm masturbating when I don't answer
00:01 < Just_a_Nick> NO
00:01 < Just_a_Nick> xd
00:02 < Just_a_Nick> 1. why your support is so good? 2. why your support is awake 24/7 xd? you are answereing so fast I mean, do you have no life? :D No wife? No work? xd
00:04 <@deen> I'm still a lazy student mostly
00:09 < Just_a_Nick> ah ok
00:10 < Just_a_Nick> my friend wrote, but in German "aja und wegen dem Skin ich render den jetz zum 10. mal und das is immer die gleiche größe und zwar genau die richtige oO"
00:10 <@deen> so, does it work in your friend's client?
00:11 < Just_a_Nick> he uses the 13x37 client
00:11 < Just_a_Nick> and yes
00:11 < Just_a_Nick> but I only use the DDNet
00:12 <@deen> ok, strange
00:12 <@deen> can you upload the skin somewhere?
00:12 <@deen> You could also test if it works in Vanilla client
00:12 <@deen> We should support the exact same skins as vanilla
00:12 <@deen> and I don't think it's useful to support any more skins
00:13 <@deen> that would just result in pain when people want to use them in other clients
00:13 < Just_a_Nick> I can send you the skin if you want
00:13 < Just_a_Nick> per eMail?
00:14 <@deen> you could just have uploaded it on one of these image hosters
00:14 <@deen> or email to deen@ddnet.tw
00:16 < Just_a_Nick> sendet you an email
00:20 <@deen> ah, so you're the UNSC guy!
00:20 <@deen> that skin doesn't look right at all
00:20 <@deen> if he says it works fine in his client, I'd say he's lying
00:21 <@deen> also doesn'T work in vanilla client

13:37 <@deen> and is cut off on a side
