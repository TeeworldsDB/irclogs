00:05 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went back online!
00:06 <@deen> contentways.de seems to have good protection, but they only have dedicated servers
00:12 <@deen> apparently we're the main ddos receiver @ datafabrik
00:12 <@deen> 2nd November the servers will be shut down
00:22 <@deen> ah, contentways is kms-hosting
00:39 <@deen> oh, and i found out that datafabrik has other vps customers :P
00:39 <@deen> they just don't oversell at all, same as harmony hosting
00:59 <@deen> the HH people tried to help at the ddos attack, but they couldn't do anything
01:44 <@deen> i don't see any good european servers with ddos protection we haven't tried
01:45 <@deen> EastByte: good luck with finding a sponsor :P
02:25 <@deen> oh, another cheap vps hoster @ ovh: https://www.monstervps.de/
06:14 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!

08:43 < captalan> Deen, since you said that I have to assist some testers to become one, I need the password to the test server to actually help them. Can you tell me what it is?
10:05 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
10:06 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
10:52 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went down!
11:11 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went back online!
11:14 < laxadedi> So deen, you are trying to find a nez ger host ?
11:14 <@deen> yes
11:15 < laxadedi> When is ger being shut down ?
11:27 <@deen> November 1
11:28 < laxadedi> You'll have a hard time finding a host with such good price/quality :x
11:28 <@deen> i know, there is none
11:28 <@deen> but even for 3-5 times the prize i can't find anything
11:29 < laxadedi> Knowing you, you'll want a GER host
11:29 <@deen> would be best i think, yes
11:30 < laxadedi> What about a cloud solution like east said ?
11:30 <@deen> what cloud solution?
11:30 < laxadedi> I don't know anything about cloud
11:30 < laxadedi> but I feel like it could be a good solution
13:08 < pause> Hello all
13:08 < pause> laxadedi: Yop
13:08 < laxadedi> pause: yo !
13:08 < pause> laxadedi: Invite plz !
13:09 < laxadedi> if you are authed, just do that /msg Q invite #chan
13:09 < pause> oh right
13:10 < pause> laxadedi: How is it going dawg ?
13:10 < laxadedi> Good !
13:10 < laxadedi> I am listening in loop the 9th symphony of dvorak movement 4 xD
13:11 < pause> Pleased to hear that !
13:11 < pause> Don't forget to tell your parents they're invited to the concert too !
13:11 < laxadedi> Oh...
13:11 < pause> Your sister too =P
13:11 < laxadedi> Need a confirmation mail for that lol
13:12 < laxadedi> address & date & time :)
13:12 < pause> ok
13:12 < pause> I'll make a global mail
13:12 < laxadedi> Just asked for my RTT for the 10th november, go cross your fingers for me xD
14:14 <@EastByte> laxadedi: the cloud thing is just a ovh vps in Strasbourg
14:15 <@EastByte> and strasbourg seems to be the best location after all
15:07 <+o_be_one> hi
15:07 < laxadedi> hi o_be_one 
15:15 <@EastByte> searching the ovh forums I accidently found a thread of Teemo
15:15 <@EastByte> http://forum.ovh.de/showthread.php?14104-Ports-%D6ffnen
15:19 <@deen> haha
16:02 <+o_be_one> can you resume what he said in english ?
16:03 <@EastByte> he asked how to open ports on a so you start server
16:03 <@EastByte> and whether he is able to install an own system (ubuntu...)
16:06 <+o_be_one> ok
16:07 <+o_be_one> thank you 
16:07 <@EastByte> looks like he wanted to buy a server without any knowledge in hosting
16:14 <@deen> i think people misunderstood the "GER is going down on November 1" a bit
16:14 <@deen> since GER is already emptier than FRA now^^
16:14 <@EastByte> haha
16:15 <@EastByte> so the news entry might've been a bad idea
16:15 <@deen> i just wante to warn them beforehand
16:15 <@deen> so noone is surprised
16:15 <@deen> and i got an offer for good ddos protected servers already
16:16 <@deen> but they just turned out to be OVH vps in Roubaix
16:16 <+o_be_one> yes deen ive read that about GER
16:16 <+o_be_one> dont tell you give up cause of DDoS x)
16:16 <@deen> huh?
16:16 <+o_be_one> its so funny for ddos kids ...
16:16 <@EastByte> even o_be_one misunderstood it^^
16:16 <@deen> didn't i clearly write that we were cancelled?
16:16 <+o_be_one> itsl ike "ok ddos kids won against the ddnet ger serv, i give up :("
16:16 <@deen> yes, they won
16:17 <+o_be_one> yes they won, but dont tell that to people ...
16:17 <@deen> because the hosting company isn't happy when other customers complain about our ddos attacks
16:17 <+o_be_one> you give too many credits to theses stupid guys
16:17 <@deen> and apparently we're the main ddos receiver
16:17 <+o_be_one> we are always the main :(
16:18 <@deen> also, anti-ddos at HH didn't work well during tournament
16:18 <@deen> we had vali & Captain Teemo playing on tournament server
16:18 <@deen> and the lags were pretty strong at times
16:19 <+o_be_one> -_-
16:19 <@deen> so the plan now is to find a sponsor for good ddos protected servers, because they are way too expensive
16:19 <+o_be_one> when we will get a lowcost awesome antiddos so ?
16:19 <+o_be_one> ask cloudflare x)
16:19 <+o_be_one> maybe they'll want to challenge their ddos protection ... we are good for this now :/
16:20 <@deen> i think we'd be small fish ddos wise for cloudflare, can't imagine that they care
16:20 <+o_be_one> try, its free.
16:21 <@deen> can't imagine that you get anything we need for free
16:21 <@deen> maybe ddos protection for a website, yes
16:34 <@EastByte> let's just find a server in strasbourg and merge FRA and GER to EU there
16:34 <@deen> i tried that, EastByte 
16:34 <@deen> didn't find anything there
16:34 <@EastByte> you havn't tried the cloud vps yet
16:34 <@deen> not available in europe
16:35 <@deen> and also, it's the bad ddos protection
16:36 <@EastByte> not available in europe?
16:36 <@deen> only location i get to choose is Canada
16:37 <@EastByte> http://eastbit.net/priv/20_Oct-14-16_35.png
16:37 <@deen> maybe ovh just doesn't like me
16:37 <@EastByte> wow why is my internet so damn lame right now
16:38 <@deen> it's the ovh site i think
16:38 <@deen> at least it's really slow for me :P
16:38 <@EastByte> yea, okay ovh was the only site I visited today^^
16:39 <@EastByte> deen: can you use my vps for first?
16:39 <@deen> ah, when you use OVH in english they don't tell you about french sites...
16:39 <@deen> about french locations*
16:39 <@EastByte> haha
16:39 <@deen> really cool
16:40 <@deen> i guess i could use yours, yes
16:41 < Nimda> mainstream by RaiNy just released on Moderate at 2014-10-20 16:37
16:41 <@EastByte> well then let's test it
16:42 <@EastByte> if the vps works stable we can even buy more of them+ips and work out interesting anti ddos solutions
16:50 <@EastByte> the ovh api is interesting
16:50 <@EastByte> ip.GameMitigationRuleProtocolEnum: {
16:50 <@EastByte>     namespace: "ip"
16:50 <@EastByte>     -
16:50 <@EastByte>     enum: [
16:50 <@EastByte>         "arma"
16:50 <@EastByte>         "gtaMultiTheftAutoSanAndreas"
16:50 <@EastByte>         "gtaSanAndreasMultiplayerMod"
16:50 <@EastByte>         "hl2Source"
16:50 <@EastByte>         "minecraftQuery"
16:50 <@EastByte>         "mumble"
16:50 <@EastByte>         "other"
16:50 <@EastByte>         "teamspeak2"
16:50 <@EastByte>         "teamspeak3"
16:50 <@EastByte>         "trackmaniaShootmania"
16:52 <@EastByte> I'm sure HH uses it to control all the vps and ip rules
16:52 <@deen> how do you access it?
16:52 <@EastByte> seems to be http json style
16:53 <@EastByte> https://api.ovh.com/
16:53 <@EastByte> they also have libs for python
16:54 <@EastByte> I guess eeeee would love to work with it
17:03 <@deen> hm, so should i call it EUR?^^ Don't have a flag for that
17:04 <@EastByte> hmm
17:04 <@EastByte> nothing that looks equal? 
17:04 <@deen> Somalian flag :P
17:04 <@EastByte> =)
17:24 <@deen> should be up
17:26 <@EastByte> hmm ingame now x)
17:26 < Nimda> New server detected : DDNet EUR!
17:26 <@EastByte> ah
17:26 <@deen> hm, the serverstatus script doesn't work
17:26 <@deen> IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/proc/net/dev'
17:28 <@EastByte> strange
17:28 <@deen> no network monitor then, meh
17:28 < Nimda> DDNet EUR went back online!
17:28 <@deen> I'm curious how far 2 cores can bring us
17:28 <@deen> i remember 2 cores being laggy on GER and Chile
17:29 <@EastByte> well we still can upgrade
17:29 <@EastByte> everything depends on network stability :)
17:29 <@deen> yes
17:39 <@EastByte> deen: so any plan for good firewall rules?
17:39 <@EastByte> block everything except tw?
17:39 <@EastByte> or somethin
17:40 <@deen> yeah, and ssh please
17:53 < laxa> http://mail.hohenstein-isolierglas.de/
17:53 < laxa> someone knows that ?
17:53 < laxa> They have flooded my smtpd server today
17:54 <@EastByte> haha xdf
17:54 < laxa> Why is it funny EastByte ? :(
17:55 <@EastByte> cant talk right now
18:08 <@EastByte> nearly finished mainstream
18:15 <@EastByte> yay
18:19 <@EastByte> deen: can't specify portranges in firewall
18:19 <@EastByte> too many ports
18:21 <@EastByte> can we split up the servers on the two ips the server has?
18:21 <@EastByte> so I can use 40 firewall rules
19:06 <@deen> EastByte: if you can explain me how to do that, yes
19:06 <@deen> I just need to set the bindaddr?
19:06 <@EastByte> you need to add another ip to the interface
19:06 <@EastByte> it is 37.187.210.137
19:07 <@deen> hm? how?
19:07 <@EastByte> e.g. "ip addr add 37.187.210.137/24 dev eth0"
19:07 <@EastByte> but that's temprorary
19:07 <@EastByte> we need to dig into the debian network conf
19:11 <@EastByte> deen: why do I get a terminal assistent on root login? :D
19:11 <@deen> ah, that's my zsh config^^
19:11 <@EastByte> how can I bypass that xd
19:11 <@deen> ctrl-c?
19:11 <@EastByte> ah
19:11 <@deen> i think you can set it up once and you won't need anymore
19:11 <@EastByte> I'm in
19:11 <@deen> i haven't seen that for a long time
19:11 <@EastByte> I wonder how ovh did the network conf
19:12 <@EastByte> iface eth0 inet static
19:12 <@EastByte>         address 92.222.217.24
19:12 <@EastByte>         netmask 255.255.255.0
19:12 <@EastByte>         gateway 92.222.217.254
19:12 <@EastByte> I will just add the ip there
19:12 <@deen> ok
19:12 <@deen> i'll try playing with bindaddr
19:12 <@EastByte> :)
19:13 <@deen> yay, works
19:13 <@EastByte> cool
19:13 <@EastByte> soo how many servers are going to run on it?
19:13 <@EastByte> I would say 30 is maximum
19:13 <@deen> i don't know, this is temporary right now
19:14 <@deen> if we want a permanent european server it will be 30 or more
19:14 <@deen> it's 29 now
19:14 <@deen> I'll put 14 over
19:14 <@EastByte> okay
19:14 <@EastByte> and I need a list of tw server ports for the ips
19:16 <@EastByte> I'll need ~5 rules per ip for amplification block
19:16 <@deen> per ip?
19:16 <@EastByte> so about 14 are left for tw servers
19:16 <@deen> ah, ok
19:16 <+o_be_one> OVH guides are powerful too for these kind of config
19:16 <@EastByte> but it's really simple
19:17 <+o_be_one> so whats about this new host ?
19:17 <+o_be_one> hosted at ovh ?
19:17 <@EastByte> vps cloud ovh
19:17 <+o_be_one> oh ok
19:17 <+o_be_one> hope it will be good
19:17 <@EastByte> I hope so too
19:18 <@EastByte> deen: let's test it with the second ip directly
19:19 <@deen> shit, my server fifos looks weird^^
19:22 <@EastByte> what does that mean? :p
19:22 <@deen> they were normal files, not fifos
19:22 <@EastByte> aha
19:35 < laxa> deen: is it normal that some servers list players according to finish and some don't when looking in internet tab ?
19:36 <@deen> depends on the mod i guess
19:36 < laxa> yeah
19:36 <@deen> ddnet should be sorted
19:36 < laxa> ddrace is
19:36 < laxa> xxlddrace64 isn't
19:36 <@deen> yeah
19:36 <@deen> i think i added that at some time
19:37 <@deen> or maybe i just wondered why xxlddrace doesn't do it
19:50 <@deen> http://youtu.be/jzjSFVD3a8Q?list=TLhjQBe4AqAOaQCi0xDsxN2shMpSSs2PLc
19:50 < Nimda> [YouTube] Title: Moderate Teeworlds DDNET Tournament [FullHD] | Rating: 4.00/5.00 | Views: 72
19:51 < BeaR_> that overlay :D
20:10 < Savander> hello
20:10 <@EastByte> hi
20:12 < Savander> deen: http://www.savander.pl/img/MqGskzsW8159
20:12 <@deen> Transformice
20:13 < Savander> xD
20:13 < Savander> ye
20:13 < Savander> xD
20:13 <@deen> need that skin for teeworlds
20:13 < Savander> haha :d
20:25 <@deen> giant lags on EUR
20:25 <@deen> only for me it seems
20:27 <@EastByte> deen: my connection attempt also took 10 seconds
20:35 < laxa> btw deen, yesterday, I had 0 lag the whole tournament on FRA
20:35 < laxa> seems like it was routing issue or something else
20:36 <@deen> laxa: they were probably just overloading some part then
21:09 <@EastByte> https://eastbit.net/public/videos/luvkobra3.webm
21:09 <@EastByte> watch to end please :)
21:10 <@EastByte> I guess I'm a blocker now
21:10 <@deen> haha
21:10 <@deen> so much fail
21:10 <@EastByte> didn't notice charly fell down
21:10 <@deen> you should post in the forum thread
21:10 <@EastByte> yea probably
21:10 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=4
21:17 < Savander> lol EastByte :D
21:17 <@EastByte> yay 10 players on second ip
21:19 <@deen> but it's pretty bad that it takes 10-20 seconds to connect =/
21:19 <@EastByte> I don't understand how this happens
21:19 <@deen> their firewall doing weird stuff?
21:19 <@EastByte> I mean status requests gets through aswell
21:20 <@EastByte> or maybe because of the second sourceport in ddnet client
21:20 <@deen> seconds sourceport?
21:20 <@EastByte> we are using different source ports for server status requests and connecting right>
21:21 <@EastByte> ?
21:21 <@deen> yes
21:22 <@EastByte> so there is a server request and after that a connectin attempt with different sourceport
21:22 <@EastByte> maybe the firewall cares about that
21:39 <@EastByte> deen: you already shut some servers down right?
21:39 <@deen> yes
21:39 <@EastByte> okay^^
21:39 <@deen> the empty ones
21:57 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
21:57 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 300
21:57 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 532 users online at 2014-09-28 20:14:41
22:20 <@EastByte> deen: I think I will risk it and add the last rule
22:22 <@deen> yes?
22:23 <@EastByte> okay works
22:24 <@EastByte> but some people seem to have problems with the firewall
22:25 <@EastByte> maybe I should enable it automatically on ddos
22:25 <@EastByte> and keep it disabled otherwise
22:26 <@EastByte> deen: can you run the servers again? :)
22:26 <@deen> on the first ip?
22:26 <@EastByte> yep
22:27 <@deen> should be up
22:27 <@EastByte> okay
22:27 <@deen> ah, you forgot 2 ips
22:27 <@deen> 37.187.210.137:833[34]
22:27 <@deen> don't they fit in the rules?
22:28 <@EastByte> rules are full
22:28 <@deen> ok
22:28 <@EastByte> but maybe there is an unused
22:28 <@EastByte> port
22:28 <@deen> i'm just disabling them
22:28 <@EastByte> okay good
22:32 <@EastByte> hmm actually need to spare another 3 rules for icmp block, tcp block, ssh authorise
22:33 <@deen> can't you just say block everything except the udp ports?
22:33 <@EastByte> I only can select between tcp/udp/icmp/...
22:34 <@EastByte> so three rules for blocking everything
22:34 <@deen> no ip?
22:34 <@EastByte> oh yea, ipv4
22:34 <@EastByte> haha
22:34 <@deen> i thought that includes all
22:35 <@EastByte> should work
22:36 <@deen> they don't have any ipv6 firewall afaik^^
22:36 <@EastByte> yea
22:36 <@EastByte> hm wut
22:37 <@EastByte> half of the firewall rules have been removed
22:38 <@EastByte> dunno what happened
22:38 <@deen> weird
22:40 <@EastByte> well the ipv4 blck works
22:40 <@EastByte> you shouldn't be able to access ssh anymore
22:41 <@deen> great :P
22:46 <@EastByte> okay everything works now
22:48 <@deen> hm, just got another crazy lag on EUR
22:49 <@deen> ping went to 600
22:50 <@EastByte> atleast kobra3 is still filling up
23:43 <@EastByte> damn
23:44 <@EastByte> I just realized the ssdp like attack in fra3.dump is going from a dynamic sourceport
23:48 <@EastByte> the firewall is useless against that
