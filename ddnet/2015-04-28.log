09:23 <@EastByte> ddnet football?
09:24 <@deen> EastByte: right, why?
09:25 <@deen> .me' has been spamming me for a few days about adding thata
09:25 <@EastByte> it was just a little bit surprising
09:25 <@deen> He wants to organize some world cup or something
09:25 <@EastByte> haha
09:25 <@EastByte> I know someone else who wanted to do that all the time
09:25 <@deen> which may be a problem with the pings
09:26 <@deen> I only wanted to organize an iCTF offline tournament, because I believe everyone who beats me has a bot
09:26 <@deen> but that's long ago
09:26 <@EastByte> offline tournament?
09:26 <@deen> LAN party thing
09:26 <@EastByte> ah
09:27 <@EastByte> hard to find 16 nearby tw players
09:27 <@deen> I think some games fuck up my NES emulator because I don't emulate the APU =/
09:28 <@EastByte> I don't know the cpu
09:28 <@EastByte> I know z80 :)
09:28 <@deen> I don't like sound but I think I have to emulate the audio processing unit anyway because the apu controls the cpu a bit
09:29 <@deen> Oh, I know the Z80 too. I started emulating it for a gameboy emulator, then I noticed dom96 was already further ahead with his Nim GB emulator
09:30 < dbd> deen: you mean the APU is used for calculation ?
09:30 < dbd> deen: a timer maybe :)
09:30 <@deen> dbd: not sure, I didn't want to look at it, but I noticed it writes some flags into the cpu
09:30 <@deen> and half of the games don't run in my emulator, so something must be wrong^^
09:32 < dbd> is there floating point on NES ?
09:32 <@deen> no
09:36 < dbd> I should write an real emulator some days :)
09:37 < dbd> I only worked on ACPI & VESA BIOS emulator ;)
09:39 <@deen> dbd: who are you btw? don't remember seeing you in here
09:39 < dbd> I come the other day as debug
09:40 < dbd> I'm a ddnet player
09:40 < dbd> I used to maintain tw client / server package for OpenBSD
09:41 <@deen> nice. ddnet needs some small fixes to work well on BSDs
09:41 <@deen> (using system libs when available)
09:45 < dbd> maybe a dumb question, but is the long term plan to merge ddnet changes in tw ?
09:45 <@deen> no, not planned
09:45 < dbd> ok
09:45 <@deen> TW devs don't like mod and I don't know what's going on with TW's development
09:46 <@deen> don't like mods*
09:46 < dbd> ok
09:46 < dbd> Yeah upstream guys keep changing :)
10:37 < ochristi> oh tw does not seem to show katakana ingame?
10:44 < ochristi> oh it's not included in dejavu, did not know
15:17 < o_be_one> hi al

16:17 < DMTee> hola liebe TW Zocker :D
16:18 < DMTee> deen falls du dann mal da bist kannst ja antworten
16:19 < DMTee> wollte mal fragen ob ihr die Foot Server nach den Standarts der letzten Jahre Einstellen könntet. Spiel seid 4 Jahren Foot und wir haben selber 2 Server und was anders bei euch ist wären das ball bouncing, da ist der Wert bei uns 25 und instant self kill
16:20 < DMTee> ohne punktabzug
16:20 < Learath2> Question of the day why do ddnet players finish maps with eachothers names ?
16:21 < DMTee> falls du willst wir haben auf unsern servern auch ein 1 vs 1 Turnier am 02.05. kannst ja kund tun falls du willst
16:21 < DMTee> to get points lea :D
16:21 < fstd> lea doesn't speak Hitler
16:21 < DMTee> :D
16:22 < DMTee> racist?
16:22 < fstd> keine spur.
16:24 < Learath2> should get some accounts to stop it :)
16:24 < DMTee> sry 4 not speaking english, i forgot about that ;)
17:46 <@deen> DMTee: send me configs please, mail at deen@ddnet.tw
17:57 < DMTee> jo deen i dont have a config data
17:59 < DMTee> @deen i just hostet the foot servers on Plattforms like teevision or so and know my friend starnight host them for us
17:59 < DMTee> -know + now
18:01 <@deen> hm
18:01 <@deen> i have no idea what the settings are
18:01 <@deen> would be nice if you could find them out
18:01 < DMTee> ball bouncing is 25
18:02 < DMTee> respawn time is 0
18:02 < DMTee> thats almost it
18:03 < DMTee> and u dont get minus points when respawning dont know if this helps u
18:04 <@deen> respawn time for ball?
18:04 < DMTee> tno for player when he kills
18:04 <@deen> no idea how to set that
18:04 < DMTee> tspawn time for ball is 7 seconds
18:04 < o_be_one> !de-fr willst du bei schreiben weinen ?
18:04 < Nimda> Translation: Envie de pleurer lors de l'écriture?
18:04 < DMTee> tafter a goal or at the beginning
18:05 <@deen> hm, doesn't work
18:07 < DMTee> what do nu need?
18:07 <@deen> respawn for players 0 and penalty off
18:08 < DMTee> yes
18:25 <@EastByte> deen: first time I saw this attack by myself
18:25 <@EastByte> https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8831639
18:26 <@EastByte> the good thing is, that's only ~20% of the ddnet block server :)
18:27 <@EastByte> ~10%
18:29 < DMTee> hola eastbyte :)
18:30 <@EastByte> hola
18:30 <@EastByte> ¿Está bien?
18:30 < DMTee> mui bien
18:30 < DMTee> i dont speak spanish :D
18:30 <@EastByte> ¡Qué pena!
18:31 < DMTee> oui ca va bien et toi?
18:31 < DMTee> only french a little :D
18:31 <@EastByte> hah
18:32 < DMTee> eastbyte i know u from teeworlds-netzwerk right?
18:33 <@EastByte> yea
18:34 < DMTee> deen everything is ok or do u need more information?
18:37 <@deen> DMTee: i don't know how to set respawn for players 0 and penalty off
18:46 < DMTee> sv_respawn_delay doesnt help right?
18:46 <@deen> no
19:01 < DMTee> eastbyte u dont know how the foot servers were settet right, dont u?
19:02 <@EastByte> no idea
19:02 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/vfxAj
19:02 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 8a6e115 def: Add != for vectors (fixes #202)
19:03 < DMTee> ok i contact starnight and come back thx anyway cu soon <3
19:03 <@EastByte> cya
21:15 <@deen> eeeee: so, how do i compile my sdl2 emulator with emscripten?
21:19 < eeeee> deen: your sdl2 emulator?
21:19 <@deen> ehm, nes emulator with sdl2 backend
21:19 < eeeee> oh
21:20 < eeeee> is it written in c++?
21:20 <@deen> in Nim, but I can compile it through C or C++
21:21 < eeeee> then you have to download emsdk from https://s3.amazonaws.com/mozilla-games/emscripten/releases/emsdk-portable.tar.gz
21:21 <@deen> yup, got that
21:21 < eeeee> yeah then pretty much just follow the instructions
21:21 <@deen> I don't see any instructions :P
21:21 < eeeee> "./emdsk install master" or sth
21:22 < eeeee> its like a package manager
21:22 < eeeee> "./emsdk update" first
21:24 < eeeee> then you have to emsdk activate whatever you've installed and then "source emsdk_env.sh" to set paths
21:25 < eeeee> after that do "emcc -v" to check that you have a compiler now
21:26 < eeeee> then go to your project and emconfigure; emmake; 
21:27 < eeeee> or just pass CC=emcc CXX=em++ to whatever build system you're using
21:28 < eeeee> gets more tricky when build system doesn't respect those though (like bam)
21:29 <@deen> hmhmhm
21:29 < eeeee> that'll likely get you a llvm bytecode file
21:29 <@EastByte> deen: nim gc doesn't work properly with emscripten
21:30 <@deen> EastByte: i know, I'll do --gc:none
21:30 <@EastByte> k
21:30 <@deen> my emulator doesn't allocate memory after it's started i think
21:30 <@deen> so shouldn't matter
21:30 < eeeee> which you then have to compile to html (emcc a.out -O2 -o blah.html)
21:31 < eeeee> well might be a good idea to throw in -g for the first try
21:31 <@deen> emcc complains about LLVM version
21:32 < eeeee> when you're installing it or when using?
21:32 <@deen> when using
21:32 <@deen> WARNING  root: LLVM version appears incorrect (seeing "3.6", expected "3.5")
21:32 < eeeee> what sdk did you install?
21:32 <@deen> none
21:33 <@deen> i thought my system llvm works^^
21:33 < eeeee> nonono
21:33 < eeeee> you have to install their clang
21:34 < eeeee> it's actually a patched clang with some js generation backend things
21:35 <@deen> meh
21:35 <@deen> this will compile forever
21:35 < eeeee> get a coffee or sth :P
21:36 < eeeee> after it's done check clang -v
21:36 <@deen> I'll work on gamepad and android support instead :P
21:36 < eeeee> should say it's emscripten-fastcomp-clang
21:36 < eeeee> right, android
21:36 < eeeee> that one gonna be so much faster :D
21:36 <@deen> haha
21:37 <@deen> maybe i should just postpone android and js indefinitely
21:37 <@deen> so much work and won't run fluidly anyway
21:37 <@deen> the emulator is too accurate, needs 50% CPU on my Core2Quad already
21:37 < eeeee> yeah
21:37 <@deen> Could make it inaccurate and much faster, but then you need to add hacks for so many games...
21:38 <@deen> i found a js nes emulator, but it totally lagged and killed my browser
21:40 < eeeee> hmm how hard can it be to emulate nes
21:40 <@deen> that thing is 30 years old after all, right?
21:41 <@deen> but i emulate every cpu, apu, ppu step
21:41 <@deen> the CPU and APU are only 2 MHz, but PPU is 8 MHz
21:42 <@deen> doing these 12 million iterations every second accurately is actually pretty expensive
21:42 <@deen> I've seen emulators use 150% CPU
21:45 <@deen> oh, and some cartridges run at 8 MHz too and can access the PPU
