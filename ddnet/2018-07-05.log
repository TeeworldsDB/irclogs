02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> i donated too 110€
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> why im not added in donater list
02:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> :c
03:02 <+Learath2> so you donated and ddos'd, very interesting
03:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> omg hi Learath2
07:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @FluffiexD where did you send it?
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> tbh my experience with LineageOS was aweful. During 2 months I dealed with bugs and tried to get used to the interface. After the testing I realized that I dislike this "classic android" design a lot.
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> tnx a lot @heinrich5991 for your render_map script. I used it in our in-game map testing system. It works very well!
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @qshar what's better in your opinion?
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> @deen
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> I really like the design and interface of MIUI. It has all the best features from Apple and Google. But there is a big problem with setting it up, because there are some hidden spying processes that are hard to delete.
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @deen can you calculate how long starkiller needed to finish all maps combined. and also can you calculate all rank1's to see how much time you would need at least to finish everything?
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> he already updated the news with that specific info
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ooh
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ```In total Starkiller finished all maps in a time of 48 days and 10 hours, with the longest time being over 17 hours on Binary and the shortest being NUT_short_race6 with just 2.22 seconds.```
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> didnt see that. would still be nice to know all rank1 combined
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> true
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum 11 days and 7 hours
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> memes are safe

12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (for now)
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @deen thanks. that means if we all play with the same name for about 2 days, we can catch up on starkiller🤔
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> :feelsamazingman:
12:59 <+Learath2> look at all those sold votes in the parliment, voting for their corporate overlords rather then the people who got them there (not that the european parliment represents the people at all or is democratic at all)
13:00 <+Learath2> If all these dinasaur politicians would just disappear overnight and we could all start over no one except their families would be sad
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah europe sucks
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its all lobbies
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think the EU sucks, I think it does useful stuff
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> see e.g. the "recently" (2016) passed gdpr
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i know germans arent eurosceptics
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it'd be nice if you stopped generalizing 🙂
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> europe cares little to 0 about human rights
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u can see all the countries now show their true side with the refugees
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> europe payed turkey in past to handle that
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but now the problem is here again
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Is this the right channel for politics?
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I would already be banned :GWfroggyMonkaThink: :feelsbadman:
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> f3
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :f3:
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> but i agree with Ryozuki :GWqlabsFeelsGoodMan:
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i find it funny heinrich applies rules he made in 5 seconds but when ppl in #general speaks another language thus breaking rule 1 he does nothing
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean rule 5
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> zooz
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :GWfroggyPeepoDetective:
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you want to discuss moderation, please go to PMs. I can't enforce rules while I'm away. I usually talk to the people who break rules, before further sanctioning them
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haHAxD
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u were surely here when people did it alteast some times
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please move moderation discussions into PM
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and ill discuss moderation here
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> stop being a kid
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> @Ryozuki
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lol muted
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i shut my mouth now :pepeH: :monkaS:
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> btw rules don’t have to be enforced super strict, if people talk 1 or 2 sentences in another language, they don’t have to be banned lol
13:46 <+Learath2> @Konsti this channel is the only one connected to the irc, so it's the right channel to discuss anything :P
13:46 <+Learath2> @jao +1
13:47 <+Learath2> EU doesn't suck because of it's decisions, EU as an idea doesn't suck, EU as it's currently implemented does suck
13:50 <+Learath2> basically unelected bureucrats claiming to represent countries
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lmao i agree with Learath pls ban me :monkaS:
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what’s the problem if the decisions don’t suck
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HelloWolrd> heinrich like being super strict with me
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HelloWolrd> but with broken rules at #general ? nah
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> cry is free
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Learath2: I'm pretty sure that every 5 years the citizens in the EU get to vote for who sits in the parliament
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe you mean the European Commision
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And successful politicians will always act within the boundaries of the system, paying off their winning coalition. So murdering all politicians and replacing them with new ones wouldn't change anything, instead you have to democratize further
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> good when they decide how my cucumber have to look like
14:08 <+Learath2> they vote for which party sits in the parliment, except for a few conscious people no one knows who is in the party list
14:08 <+Learath2> and yeah the european commision is also a joke
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/straight-cucumbers/
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wtf
14:10 <+Learath2> 10/10 rule
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromyth#Straight_cucumbers
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> zoooooz
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> @heinrich5991 I'd disagree with you about gdpr. The idea is awesome indeed, but there are many things that they didn't think about. For example game servers like ours. With gdpr game moderation became close to impossible.
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does moderation have to do with the gdpr?
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> like keeping personal data, writing logs with it. There are many more, but I don't want to write it here :)
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what personal data do you keep
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we don't (for more than a day or so), but maybe qshar wants to save IP addresses for longer
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> we cleared this info. Now we don't have ips even in logs.
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wouldn’t you need to disclose that to everyone when they first join ddnet
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> I just didn't see in gdpr text about keeping for 24 hours
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it definitely doesn't specifically say 24 hours anywhere, that's true
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> that is one of the reason for our accounts (besides its awesomeness)
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> because ingame you can't confirm anything
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it allows you to store personal data for providing the service, i.e. spam protection etc., for a reasonable time
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. your program is allowed to save the IP address of a client in memory to respond to it 😛
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @qshar you could force-pause players and show them an individual vote when they join 😄
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> yep, but you can't see it or output in logs
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> individual vote?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> showing a vote to just one player, so they can f3/f4
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> nice idea
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> sounds not too easy to implement, but the idea is good. Just not much space in vote for writing all required data
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> but need to think about it
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you could write it in the yellow server messages
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't think that this would accomplish much
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you have to gain consent, it has to be freely given – this means that people have the right to say "no", too, and not face negative consequences for it
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> IIRC
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> if they say no, then they will not join the server. The system uses their data to provide the game services, and we can use it only when they agree.
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> if they say no, then they will not join the game. The system uses their data to provide the game services, and we can use it only when they agree.
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> or do I get it wrong?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> By the way, for example /save code is a personal data too, so user agreement is needed to keep it
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> Well, that what I meant when said that gdpr idea is great, but in the reality is much worse.
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> GPRD, is more for companies, which store personal data and proccess them. GDPR is more than "accepting rules", it's more like system which is prepared to be safe for people, to have full control over your data in their ecosystem.
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> IF you have accounts, you should have options to delete everything about a certain player, move these data to another company or make possibility to download all the that you store about a guy.
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> GPRD in fact is very open in implementation and in what has to be subject
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> In my opinion, if you store data, from which you can't specify, who it belongs to, then it's k. (ofc. tracking softwares have to be accepted)
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> omg
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> for real?
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u kicked Ryo bcs he said something
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> wtf
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> abuse
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen he was heere all the time
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> he is the only guy who responed to EVERY @mod ping!
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> this is hilarious
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yes he was the most active mod and while we recognize that, that shouldnt grant him a complete immunity
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yes he was the most active mod and while we recognize that (and are very grateful for it), that shouldnt grant him a complete immunity
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i agree that mod status shouldnt grant immunity but wtf did he even do
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😪
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Im really frustrated right now
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i feel you bro
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Bb in an hour
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @noby well lately he is always discussing stuff about moderation andhe seems never to agree with it. Normaly you cant work together then.
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> This is heartbreaking for me, so much time invested on ddnet, to be thrown away by a admin ***<snip>*** who can't accept critisism in public and that he knows well that the `contact admin for staff things` just don't work. I find it even more disgusting that he removes me from `ingame moderator` for a forum/related stuff, when they said in the thread about the rule 11 where they  <message clipped>

17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ryozuki. i kinda feel u. remember for what i lostt mod? still dont like u tho
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wasn’t a decision by a single admin
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just wanted to say that textwall, i wont even try to discuss more, since i learned that its completly useless
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> mods actually are not much active in game, blockmark and other trolls/blockers do whatever they want and u even kick a most active moderator?
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> mods actually are not much active in game, blockmark and other trolls/blockers do whatever they want and u even kick the most active moderator?
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> This decission is not best for teeworlds in general if you ask me, but i understand what happend tho.
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> This decission is not best for ddnet in general if you ask me, but i understand what happend tho.
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> did they realy kick out the only mod who was in favor of harsh punishments for botting
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> smh
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> the main problem is that he was most active in game to ban blockers/trolls
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yes that sucks
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but being the most active mod shouldnt grand him fully immunity either right?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but being the most active mod shouldnt grand him full immunity either right?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ye. better remove him from release squad too
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> what did he even do lmao
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> he didnt agree with the other mods
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> he didnt agree with ur opinion?
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> kek
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i think
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I am active in the evening if you ping #moderator
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> they cant see that channel
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> you really pitch it down with "he didn't agree"
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> well yeah i dont know the full story
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but from what i know thats what it looks like
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> for me it looked like he went mental whevet he didnt like something
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> for me it looked like he went mental whenever he didnt like something
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how do u expect someone to enforce rules if he can't follow them himself
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how do u expect someone to enforce rules if they can't follow them themself
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> the rules are bad
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then discuss the rules or whatever but don't straight up violate them. and if the result of the discussion is that they stay, live with it or the consequences of violating them
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🤔
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/464466495733366804/Screenshot_1.png
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> onby - Today at 6:22 PM
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the rules are bad
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yeah that was the rule i was referring to
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> the others arent that bad ig
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> pools aren't super meaningful on such stuff, and even then, the rules wasn't removed so what makes u think it's ok to ignore them
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> pols aren't super meaningful on such stuff, and even then, the rules wasn't removed so what makes u think it's ok to ignore them
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i already explained it on my text
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why are polls not meaningful
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> cause people troll them or vote in their favor and not for what makes the most sense
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i dont think people who disagree with the rule are automatically trolling
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it can go in both ways
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and there is no way to be sure hence, not meaningful
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and i dont think they are automaticaly disagreeing cuz they think it will benefit them
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i dont even play on ddnet so i have no reason to care about whether i can complain about mods
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i just think that as a principle it should be allowed
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so you would vote without having context -> not necessarily voting for what makes most sense
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> makes the most sense isnt an objective thing
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> there are probably good arguments for both keeping and removing the rule
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> voting without having insight is not good from an objective point tho
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i didnt even vote
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i think
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye but how do you know all voters have the needed info
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> not possible
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> hence, not meaningful
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> on some stuff polls are great, on others (like administrative decisions) they don't make much sense
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> so what is a better way to make decisions about rules
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> The problem is, ryo wants an open discussion  about decisions, and jao talks about the resulting decisions(the actual consequences). Maybe you should stick to one point
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he can have discussions, but he has to follow the rules as long as they are there
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> just because u discuss something you can't ignore it's there
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he cant have discussions if exactly that is prohibited
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it's not prohibited to discuss general things
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "Creating threads or posts that question or reference administrative decisions or potential administrative decisions, [...]"
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that includes EVERY discussion
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> because it doesnt list all types that are forbidden
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but generalizes it
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it's bad worded then, the rule is to prevent complains about individual staff members
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but I think no one said it's not okay to discuss rules
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, but why shouldn't that be allowed to be discussed. he doesn't want the decisions to be unmade
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he just wants clearification
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that has to be discussed if you want to remove the rule
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well yes, that's what he tried... ok the poll was missplaced
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but the discussion was actually a good idea
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> the discussion was never the problem
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he violated the rule, the violation was not that he wanted to discuss it
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well that is the rule already
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he can't discuss without breaking the rule
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can discuss the rule in general
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we have not banned people for discussing that rule, and we never will
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if you drag individual complains into it, then you violate the rule and it misses the point of the discussion
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "I like open discussions where everyone can give his opinion and imo it shouldn't be private. I think everyone should know what administration is doing to judge if they are doing correctly or not"
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he clearly states what he wants
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dunno what you read in his post
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we offered to link to a forum where this rule is suspended and admins can respond
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ok, again: he wasn't removed for that forum thread
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but it must be more than one complain
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that is moderated by someone that is not involved in ddnet
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> idc why he was removed, currently it's more about the ideals of ddnet
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then why you reference the forum thread like it was the reason for his removal :thonkery:
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen once said in an interview, that ddnet shouldn't make the mistakes ddmax did.
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> now it becomes more and more intransparent for everyone
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and that means it might become ddmax again
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> the rules is there since a long time btw
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> the rule is there since a long time btw
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I think originally set up by deen himself
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> False
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Soreu copied  them from a site
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and back at those times
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> moderators where only deens friends

18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> wheres matodors daily jao screenshot
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> matodor go to army in next 2 days :redstripe:
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 😦
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @Matodor send mlife before u die :)
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> someone have android 5.1 or 5.1.1 version?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> lifehack, send to chat `+:troll:`
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so since ddnet mostly consists of volunteers. that is the main base for a working ->and growing<- community.
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> So why don't you give the exact details, why he was removed, and what the problems with his opposed meanings(towards the admins) are?
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and then we can discuss it
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> who said something about opposed meanings, he violated rule
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> show me
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> jupstar +1
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://hastebin.com/raw/budurecuxe
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> might have another discussion between
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats exactly what this stupid rule says
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he has no chance
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he was offered to go to PMs, he choose to not listen
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> after he was muted he even joined with 2 other accounts to evade the mute
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why was he muted [seemingly?] without warning
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well than take his posts away.
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i will ask the exact same question and break the rule
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he was offered to go to PMs, he choosed to not listen
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> there was a warning
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> (heinrich asking him to go to pms)
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> also he pulled the same stuff before, and he was warned there too
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (before = weeks ago)
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i dont count that as a direct warning but ok
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he doesn't even wants(or atleast he doesn't state) to remove any rules
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he clearly only says that there is no insight in admins decisions
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why PM then?
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i want to know everything too
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what does it matter how long ago it was
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just wanted to state it
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im free to do so (for now)
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes then discuss that, but don't straight up ignore rules lol
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then you can fuck on all rules
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> transparency is good
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> THE RULE SAYS NO DISCUSSIOn
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dude
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it's bad worded then as I already said, and ryozuki knew that it was okay to discuss the rule itself without dragging individual complaints into it
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he only complains on how decisions were made here
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> wow
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> such a great discussion
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> 🍿
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> yea, exactly
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> as always, the same persons
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he complaint about individual stuff yes
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and as he is free to do so in private, he shouldn't make a public rant about it
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> they will never agree with each other
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> 😄
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also want to state that, i dont find that removing my moderator status has something to do with breaking this rule here, i find 0 correlation in banning annoying blockers in game with breaking a rule about complaining here
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and aaa puts it like moderator is a nice status to have and its all happiness lol
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> 
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/464476826367164418/unknown.png
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> wtf does this have to do with me
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> snail - Today at 4:44 PM
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes he was the most active mod and while we recognize that (and are very grateful for it), that shouldnt grant him a complete immunity(edited)
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> snail - Today at 6:15 PM
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes that sucks
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but being the most active mod shouldnt grand him full immunity either right?(edited)
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so jao, then qoute ryozukis exact rule violation, before qouting the rules over and over again
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> and where did i state that it was complete happiness/nice status / whatever?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> in that quote
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "immunity"
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what immunity gives you being moderator
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i literally just wrote that we are thankful for what u did but that doesnt mean we should always bypass when u break rules or when ppl complain about u
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Jupstar ✪ he did it himself
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> see
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> see what
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> people said "ryozuki shouldnt have been kicked because hes the most active mod" aka => he should get an immunity whenever he breaks rules
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and i say, in his text there is nothing wrong except that he can't even discuss
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i just said thats not how it works
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he quoted his violatin himself
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he only complains about missing transparency
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he didn't say "heinrich remove it"
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> when did I say that it was about him wanting the rule to be gone LOL
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I said it's not about the rule discussion multiple times now..
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Savander "they will never agree with each other" that is the problem
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> God dammit guys, you looks like polish politicians.
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> you're barking the same phrases for 30 minutes
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Just stop
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no the problem is, if we stop now the admins win
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> you don't listen
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> you just barking
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they aren't clear
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he says, ryo gave the answer
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i don't see the conflict in his text
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he has no chance to win, because the admins can lay down their rules as they want
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the rules must be 100% clear and they shouldn't be untouchable
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and if he complains about moderation problems
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then it's in the end result of a rule
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> idk what you want, I said again and again that discussing rules itself is ok
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, but as i said, he doesn't attack heinrich directly
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he more or less wants insight into what makes heinrich's moderation style (or what ever admin) to what it it
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he more or less wants insight into what makes heinrich's moderation style (or what ever admin) to what it is
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he needs to give examples
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that breaks the rule
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye and heinrich offered him to go to PMs to get clarification on that. instead ryozuki ignores it and even evades mutes
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why in pm
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> everyone should know this
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> because that's the current rule
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> see
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Discussing someones actions is not done  in public
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes then discuss that rule
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> as I said 10 times now
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> its a bad rule
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> No u
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he has no chance in this dictatorship. untouchable admins
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> lol
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> are u ryozuki's alt
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :thonkery:
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he is not
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i thought u already tried to lead the topic towards it being a bad rule
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no, im just objective
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> because i don't play on ddnet
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and to note: i never talked to jupstar before
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Brunei government!
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> and people like it 😄
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> jupstar is keks lol
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> idk how you can say they are untouchable if heinrich literally offeres to discuss it and I say again and again that discussing rules is fine
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> ddnet's cmake file is quite something 👀
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and in his forum he wants transparency
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> quite? like what 😄
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> most ppl liked it
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and then he wants open discussions, bcs thats what everyone wants
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> except the admins that in the end, can lay down the rules so it fits their needs
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Well just like a normal goverment people have to accept which road their leaders choose. There are always people who hate on decision but yeah.
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> cmake whispering to you? 😮
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> don't you see that circulation of not getting any chance without once breaking the rule
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> @Savander just read up the latest ddnet+tw discussion and someone suggested it to move from bam to cmake as ddnet has done. but I dont know seeing this 1k+ build file now /:
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> why people think, that everyone should be equal?
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> @Savander just read up the latest ddnet+tw discussion and someone suggested  to move from bam to cmake as ddnet has done. but I dont know seeing this 1k+ build file now /:
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why do you think a community based game (mostly running by donations) give anybody the right to rule?
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i never said everyone should make admin decisions
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i am here for tranparency
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> because, they made it?
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and open discussions
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Of course someone needs to rule
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> No leader is even worse
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> i don't care that you gave money, they are exectuoners
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> i don't care that you gave money, they are executioners
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> deen made it, i want to see deen saying ryo was bad because .... and will be removed from moderation because .... and that rule is there  because ....
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why is anyone arguing against transparency
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i cant think of a good reason
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if you can't give so much insight, it's no moderation at all
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> They have full rights to do things, how they think it's good way to do.
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> do you think, that there is one best system?
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> there's not
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> indeed
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this system clearly splits the community
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> see the forum post about the "rule removing"
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> there always will be some people annoyed.
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> i follow the subject
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> don't need to check
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it's the best example of what community wants and what not
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> community it's not only 2% of whole game base
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> yea, they are most active
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> but they are not the most
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> after all, democracy isn't the best system at all. Since people are often stupid
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but if the community says ryo was a good moderator
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and ryo breaks a rule, that the community dislikes too
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i strongly questining if something else than ryo is the problem
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why should the vote of someone who plays once a year count the same as the vote of someone who plays everyday
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Lol 98% of the community doesn't give a fuck and just play ddnet maps
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes that's the best idea too @n000b , but a utopia
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in what world is a moderator that breaks rules good?
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there will always be conflicts, and again and again, that's why transparency is so important
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> because the 2% give a fuck
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> that will cause more problems
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> and again, antoerh 2% with problems
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @jao in a world where the rule might be a problem already
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @Jupstar ✪ your arguing with a brick wall
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> they are always right
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> and your always wrong
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes @ZombieToad i know xD
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> LOL
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Kind of, im fucking iron wall
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but it's amusing how they are so right about their opinion
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and thats sad
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> u r mud wall Savander
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> It's called discussion, you wanted one
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> we have one lol
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> i give you arguments, you give me as well
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> it's not like im assuming, that current system is the best one, and shouldn't be changed.
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jambi> @snail :banhammer:
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this reminds me of the Allegory of the Cave
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> [7:22 PM] ZombieToad: they are always right
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> [7:22 PM] ZombieToad: and your always wrong
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> [7:23 PM] Jupstar ✪: yes @ZombieToad i know xD
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's all because you all want monologues instead of discussions
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> discussions don't mean that we don't get to talk and you get to shit all over us because we have opinions
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i tried to start a discussion about if admins should be able to override veto and got banned for it last week
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> override veto?
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> oh like on ddnet server
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ZombieToad did you actually get banned because I said sue me and you actually did?
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why couldnt they if theyre admin
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> admin can turn off veto votes entirely to override it
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @Learath2 yes
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We override veto because it's broken, sometimes noone is playing and you can't pass a map vote
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I'm pretty sure, that "starting discussion" in a cultural way, will never cause bans
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @ZombieToad i think u got banned coz u were obviously trolling and just trying to create some drama/annoyance xd
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ZombieToad I'm sorry 😛 I was fine with you posting that screenshot
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 ```
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> jao - Today at 7:04 PM
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he complaint about individual stuff yes
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and as he is free to do so in private, he shouldn't make a public rant about it``` this is ur monologe
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> (i didnt ban u, but thats how i saw it. even tho i laughed at the "hiding his name" thing)
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> monologue means one person giving a speech, talking to himself
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> maybe u find the discussion annoying because you want to abuse rcon aswell
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> normal players have to join another server if they cant change maps
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> sue me too then 👀
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> why dont admins?
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (context is I was on a dummy server, @ZombieToad joined to show off his beep, I just changed the map he wasn't even playing)
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> normal players have to join another server if they cant change maps
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> why dont admins?
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ZombieToad u fell in ur own trap ```
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ZombieToad - Today at 7:22 PM
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are always right
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and your always wrong```
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you actually think this is an issue there is no point in discussing this, you are obviously trolling
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 nice discussion if the other side can't give a clear argument and only quotes things 10 times and says its right
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> @ZombieToad because the service provider delegated them the power to do so, I guess?
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ZombieToad u fell in ur own trap ```
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ZombieToad -
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ your arguing with a brick wall
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ZombieToad - Today at 7:22 PM
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are always right
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and your always wrong```
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> normal players have to call votes when they want to ban another player why can admins just f2 ban thats not fair
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <doxod68> Hi. I think I found a BUG in ddnet client
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> hi o/
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> ok @Learath2 ur right
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ you people don't give an argument either, your argument is that transparency is good, which we agree with, so all you do is strawman all day, "Admins hate transparency"
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> stop talking about this i dont want banned again
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you agree with it but u dont apply it?
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <doxod68> @ZombieToad you were banned?
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i clearly state what makes the rule a bad rule for the community
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The only thing we don't apply it with is staffing decisions
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dunno what you read
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> whats wrong with transparency
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but thats the whole point learath
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <doxod68> @ZombieToad why you were banned?
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @doxod68 he was trying to make fun of a rule, ended up taking the trolling too far
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why do you think it's okay to smear someones name by discussing their intentions and actions in the public?
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> @doxod68 probably best cause of action is to create an issue on github.com/ddnet/ddnet at the moment due to the ongoing discussion
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> how is it smearing someones name to say u  disagree with what someone did
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why can't the name lay down arguments for it's action?
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 because they are in a position of power, people should know what they do and create his own opinion about if its good or bad
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> accepting a position as admin seems like accepting responsibility to handle public feedback
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> wasnt just learath i was talking about
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet admins cant take critisism and thats why they defend this rule so much
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> but all the active admins
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> so learath and snail
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> critisism wont kill ddnet
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> again @Learath2 it's not about the resulting consequences, but about the way to get to the rule and it's idea
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> It' wouldn't be btter to try that stackoverflow thing?
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <doxod68> @cinaera I dont know maybe its not a bug lets discuss
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> to "ask" moderator, what happend and why on seperated forum
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ZombieToad I've never seen a force map change except for me I think
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <doxod68> I cant'l lock or unlock team while I'm muted on the server, is this a bug?
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Savander which we proposed
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> i know Learath
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> that's why im asking
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> why don't try? It' would be the best thing at the moment
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> to test it out
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @doxod68 we know this one, @deen didn't think we should fix it
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you proposed a failure, it rips off all traffic, and also you cant get anyone who isnt involved in ddnet itself to moderate that
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @Learath2 some moderators did it and i think its fine if the server is empty or nobody is playing. theres no harm in doing so and i guess thats a perk for helping ddnet, theres nothing wrong in that
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <doxod68> @Learath2 oh my god why?
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> add more transparency
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> allow open discussions
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> easy as that
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> still worth opening an issue on github IMO. Possible to keeping track of known bugs additionally to knowing the stance of the development team on this subject.
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what kind of  over exaggeration is that? Learath killed a bug so he is a murderer
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Just prepare your own rules, describe them as best as you can, and then we all can discuss it I guess. :p
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> helpers have access to rcon vote yes but they dont force vote veto because they know its abuse
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> helpers only can vote no
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> u sure?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> still worth opening an issue on github IMO. Possible to keep track of known bugs additionally to knowing the stance of the development team on this subject.
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i coded it
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We allow open discussions on everything except staffing, so what you care about isn't transparency, it's either trying to prove a point or openly shit on peoples reputations
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <doxod68> @Learath2 and I'm wonder why you ban people for "taking the trolling too far"?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> do mods have vote yes then xD
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they also have a active moderator mode
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> where they can press f3 to force vote
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> never seen that used
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> easy when u are alone in a 64p server like me
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no @Learath2 , staffing is the most important thing. YOU do allow discussions
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but only in PM
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats the whole thing
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use it
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> **used**
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xDD
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @doxod68 cause we don't need useless drama here
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @doxod68 because we can't spend hours discussing with people who don't wan't the discussion to reach anywhere or think that their point is viable. They want to waste time, we don't have much of that
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @doxod68 because we can't spend hours discussing with people who don't want the discussion to reach anywhere or think that their point is viable. They want to waste time, we don't have much of that
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> how would u know if its  being used or not lol
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it shows a server message
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <doxod68> @jao but who decide it's useless?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> telling that server is being actively moderated
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i coded it too
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> oh
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i did lot for mods
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i got kicked now
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> life is hard
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ in PM we allow reports, then we discuss the reports and take appropriate action
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @doxod68 me in that case (as the server's admin)
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Would you think it's a good idea for the people to appoint judges?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and the discussion is not visible to us
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i vote zombietoad as judge
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it ends up creating alot of conflicty
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it ends up creating alot of conflicts
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or for the people to vote for judgement?
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <doxod68> @jao it's cool to be a server admin
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Even in real life, if police leads the case, they don't spread everything to public
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the judge isnt a judge when the case is against him
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Lol, ADmins are  police! EASY AS THAT
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> :D:D
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Besides we don't even get that many reports
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @Ryozuki so they have access to vote_no but not vote no
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this isn't this huge issue that you all think it is
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> having to pm someone makes some people not do it
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ZombieToad yep
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Lol, then it's their problem
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> they can, but they don't do it
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> any complaint we got was dealt with, and every person whose complaint got dealt with was happy with the resolution
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I know what you would say
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> "admins don't care"
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's your problem if you don't want to report people
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it wouldn't hurt to improve how you can submit reports
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i complained and im not happy with the resolution
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also what about what hileute says? heinrich not answering him anymore etc
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> "every person whose complaint got dealt with was happy with the resolution" this is wrong xd
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pm failing in action
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which 9000 word post of hi leute?
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, but there is one important thing to note, indepentend of what side you pick:
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Many ppl won't see why ryo was removed.
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> And if you ask for the "why", you get a qoute to a rule.
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> And if you questening that rule, the insight stops regardless.
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> And it's your choice if it's good or bad, but theses things can split communities.
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> yea, report system ccould be modernized 😛
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> my complaint with heinrich didnt end happy :D
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ZombieToad gee, I wonder why
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Maybe AS you proposed. SEPARATED forum?
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i used a bot to finish a map and he deleted it but wouldnt show me the proof that i botted
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "every person whose complaint got dealt with was happy with the resolution this sounds more likea TV ad
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "every person whose complaint got dealt with was happy with the resolution" this sounds more likea TV ad
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "every person whose complaint got dealt with was happy with the resolution" this sounds more like a TV ad
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, but there is one important thing to note, indepentend of what side you pick:
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Many ppl won't see why ryo was removed.
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> And if you ask for the "why", you get a qoute to a rule.
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> And if you questening that rule, the insight stops regardless.
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> And it's your choice if it's good or bad, but thes things can split communities.
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe they weren't happy but did they get a resolution yes they did
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sorry we didn't draw and quarter the mod you complained about in public
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so why you said "every person whose complaint got dealt with was happy with the resolution"?
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> you said that
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no he said that
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> lol, when
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> jao said "its wrong"
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> not that he agree
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Learath2 - Today at 7:42 PM
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> any complaint we got was dealt with, and every person whose complaint got dealt with was happy with the resolution```
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> Learath you say wrong stuff here lol, don't present it as facts
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can you just remove my rank so I can be done with this mess?
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I seriously am going to pop an aneursym here
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or return my moderator, put more transparency and open discussions and we end the mess
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I made a false statement, sorry. Atleast I can admit when I'm wrong
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> srsly, don't bitch now, because he said something wrong or not directly correct
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that doesn't help
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Jupster it's perfectly nomral here
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> but, i think you are here for more than a week
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> so you should know
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What else can I do? Do you want me  to write a 1000 word polite apology that I made a wrong statement because I have to argue with 50 of you at a time?
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well a system works until it doesn't whats why i investigate now
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> How this chat can be serious, with not serious people :P. After all
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> it's a game
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @jao when u see this mess it wasnt me who started it so pls dont ban me
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsgoodman:
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> that should be the standard reply when someone has a problem with one of the staff
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> "its just a game"
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 🙄
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Why @Ryozuki  got removed?`
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> You are thinking, that this is some kind of big country, where everything have to be transparent
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We get complaints from people, complaints concern the people and the abuser, we handle it, we tell the complainee what happened. It might not be the result they want but you don't get that in your regular police either
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah like when the politicians are fcking you and they say "dont get into politics"
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah savander, it's sad that ryo broke the rule(independend of if its bad or not)
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> fact is, he did, and from what i heared he was pretty famous around the community as a mod
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh after my ddnet experience I wouldn't even join a fucking debate club
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no thank you
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Im not talking directly about ryo
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :danAmazing:
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Im with ddnet since beginning
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what means being with ddnet
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Just know, that people will never understand each other
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but you can't always look into the past
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> why he got removed from moderation?
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Brokecdx- https://hastebin.com/raw/budurecuxe
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I'm not looking, it happens
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there is a conflict now, and maybe now is a good time to questening the system
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Brokecdx- like it or not, rule 11 is still here, can't discuss it
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> it's fine
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and in the end, the admins can say, stop it, or say, we will allow this discussion, and look if it brings up some ideas
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> @Jupstar ✪ actually, there's idea
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> [7:49 PM] Jupstar ✪: there is a conflict now, and maybe now is a good time to questening the system
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hit it when it's weak? Love it
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> to make seperated forum, for complains
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> @Brokecdx- basically that + the fact that he rejoined with an alt when he got muted + that one time when he went crazy and insulted heinrich + some previous reports that we ignored because "most active mods"
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and my claim is only "it might split the community, if the community can't get the insight to their questions in more detail"
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> but there was proposal
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 ofc.. that's the most important thing about evolution, removing weak spots, and gain strength
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I mean, what do you want more :D. There have to be some kind of system
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ Okay let's go down this route. insight to which question will they not get an answer to in detail?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Well then let's everyone end this drama and accept that @Ryozuki  went too far?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Let's be mature one time ddnet community
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you really missed a lot of the convo
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Then discuss it with heinrich
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> in private chat
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> @Brokecdx- it's the whol;;e point, open discussions
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> not private one
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> it's stupid
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice argument
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> That's why we suggested to make spearted forum
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> for issues
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> just because 1 15 year old is having issues
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```Ryozuki - Today at 7:35 PM
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you proposed a failure, it rips off all traffic, and also you cant get anyone who isnt involved in ddnet itself to moderate that```
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Brokecdx- nooo, that's simply not possible because as much as they like to complain that we are a wall, they actually are no different, they will not compromise on theiir point, nor accept our proposed solutions for it
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 i want to know, why the rule makes the rule so important to the admins, that you aren't allowed to have an open discussion of such things.
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Why shouldn't anybody be allowed to criticise a direct dicision of an admin, if alot of ppl are clearly for more openess?
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <doxod68> Yes this is strange
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Brokecdx- i don't know why u hate me, but im 18
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> @Ryozuki  what i've heard about you, doesnt seem lik eit
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u dont like discussions u can just go play and ignore this
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> @Ryozuki  what i've heard about you, doesnt seem like it
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> it's pointless
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then go ahead and ignore this
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @Brokecdx- if you want to cpmain about ryozuki then please pm him
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> complain*
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> he is no staff
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> 😃
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even if i were mod u could complain about me in public since im not like those admins
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> @Learath2, wouldn't be good to make that section which we talked about? For now, it's the best approach we can choose. No one gave better idea to solve the problem.
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> but i dont
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to repost this ```Jupstar ✪ - Today at 7:52 PM
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i want to know, why the rule makes the rule so important to the admins, that you aren't allowed to have an open discussion of such things.
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Why shouldn't anybody be allowed to criticise a direct dicision of an admin, if alot of ppl are clearly for more openess?``` since it looks like it got forgotten fast
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <doxod68> I want to be staff! So no one will complain about me ever! 😀
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> oh, and you say that we are the "brick walls"
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> ill make a new ddnet that wont have the problems this ddnet has
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> there's solution, but you don't give a fuck
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> just keep repeating your shit
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ 1) We do not condone people attacking eachother in public. 
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 2) The staffing discussions are usually about peoples personalities, having them in open will mean that everyone will try to act polite and we won't actually get to the truth.
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Most of an admins decisions are either about rules or staffing. We allow open discussion of all rules, we don't allow that for staffing for which we already gave reasons. Besides, A LOT of people is like 2 people who actually know their arguments and 5 trolls that just agree with them because they just want chaos. We have 500 players. Most don't even know about this drama, nor ha <message clipped>
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> they made a decision, on request you received the apparent reason for that decision. I don't see what else is needed.
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 but you clearly see that my complain there is about his behaviour moderating so ur points are wrong
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> All public reports turn to personal attacks as seen when we are late to moderate the forums
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `we don't allow that for staffing for which we already gave reason` gave reason? instead of a reason u muted me
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u censored the discussion
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont see the hypocrit point?
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's not what you were muted for nor was I the one that muted you
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got muted for complaining about heinrich
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> moderation
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want it to be personal keep it personal, if you want it to be about all of us then keep it general
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok @Learath2  let's tear it down like this:
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "Creating threads or posts that question or reference administrative decisions or potential administrative decisions, such as post removals and thread closures, is not permitted. We are not perfect and if you feel that we have made a mistake, please privately contact a staff member and we will review the situation."
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> If admins make mistakes, i complain privatly( pretty much 1 vs all admins, who might discuss it closed)
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> So if i make a mistake in my "complain" i have no chance to get the help of others, who might be against a decision.
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Because in exactly that situation you seem to argue with that or similar rules.
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Because you cannot discuss that rule without arguments, AND THAT ARE STUFF decisions
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stop saying its personal, its clearly nto personal in the paste
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you don't get to mix the two to arbitrarily boost your  point
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> no u got muted because when he politely asked to follow the rule  u said u will ignore it and continue anyway @Ryozuki
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i know that trolls are a problem, BUT WHERE do i want the dicision to be unmade
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nowhere
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i want the insight about your dicisions nothing else
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because i wanted to discuss that publicly
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> using my free speech
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> btw. i think all of you guys read rules before joining
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> so why are you so suprise now
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> 😄
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yes but obviously when he asks u to stop, telling him u dont give a fuck and ull continue anywa isnt the way to go..
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and if 99% of the community says the decision is bad, i still don't say you should change it
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> it's like, i buy a house near to airport
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but where is your problem to even discuss such
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> and i want to destroy that airpor, because too loud
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Lol 99% doesn't give a fuck
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <doxod68> @Savander I think they'll ban you, be careful
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I don't care, i don't do bad things
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I agree that it's important we get multiple views on something. I just don't get why do you think we are all part of the same consciousness? We all have our own ideas, and disagree most of the time
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <doxod68> @Savander destroying an airport is not really good think
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ How do you feel about staffing decisions being very personal? Would you be okay with your personality being discussed in front of others? Because that's what a lot of the decisions come down to
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <doxod68> @Savander destroying an airport is not really good thing
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Haha, yea
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> but the discussions looks the same
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, i absolutly don't care if ryo is mod or not, but it seems like i can't create a thread that says the dicision by admin XY was shit because...
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> i want to drestroy airport, because lol. too loud huuh!?!
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it's not about destroying
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it's about clearification
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <doxod68> honestly I would destroy it too
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you can say i dislike the airport its so loud
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is generally never a decision by admin xy, we discuss , we all compromise until we come to an agreement
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Yea, but they wouldn't listen to you
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> since, the airport was first, you knew
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> what are you doing
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> where ok then all admins
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> and what are youa ccepting
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> doesnt change the idea
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> and what are you accepting
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah*, ok then all admins
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if i know you made a rule i would quote you as the main initializer ofc
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you don't attack any of my arguments then we won't get anywhere
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ???
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm saying staffing decisions are personal in nature, would you be okay with those being in public?
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "personal in nature"????
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it's funny
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a lot
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> because actually that's not the real point
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it's clear you removed him because he broke a rule
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <doxod68> Every time I come here, you all argue with each other, I also want to!
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that won't ever change, because you are in this point right
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are talking about a specific decision again
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't get it
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Decide please, I can't argue with 50 arguments some general some specific
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but my point is mostly, he can't arguee against that rule, because that would be a violation again
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> are we arguing about the rule or are we arguing about ryozuki?
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> see
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "You are talking about a specific decision again"
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this is the best example
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> actually the problem already
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why shouldnt i do exactly that?
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How can we debate if we can't decide what we are arguing on?
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I give you arguments for the general case, you beat down on them using arguments for a specific case
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i use ryo as an example
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i never said get ryo back
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he had just no chance to say anything without examples
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and that was already against rules
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he made the poll in the forum
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it already showed there is an idea, that the rules aren't perfect
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then you want to deliver examples and it stops
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And I replied to each and every argument there is on the poll, even ended up in compromises and agreed on some points with hi leute
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the poll was a discussion of the rule, no one was banned for it
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no one was reprimended for it
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well heinrich snipped it really hard
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but clearly you seem to not get the point
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> without giving actual examples
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and this is the best
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ryo had no chance, to discuss anything, because the rule never changes
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this problem is the conflict of the rule
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and now ppl take in position
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> your example is not an example of anything except that we do support transparency
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you say there is a conflict
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rule 11 has nothing to do with rule discussions
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we are at the beginning again, maybe it makes no sense "rule 11 has nothing to do with rule discussions"
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that's the whole thing
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how  can i give you an clear example
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tell me what should i do to show you the rule sucks?
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> give me a clear example now pls
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can't because we don't allow discussions about staff. You can only show one outside this community. Where they are very happy with discussing their staff in public
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but I can also show you examples where communities that frown upon it have thrived
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and you are sure you want this?
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> thus examples are a bad way to get to results
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok, if thats the whole problem, then maybe all admin decisions should be 100% annonym
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so you are only attacking the real problem
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if all admin decisions were 100% anonymous then we wouldn't be transparent at all 🤦
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well, but atleast we could have an open discussion
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> because else it's not possible
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i cannot always quote conflicts in other regions on this planet
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> to solve ours
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can quote stackoverflow, where people are pretty happy with their semi-transparent staffing discussions
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which we already said we could try
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <doxod68> In the society all discussions about governance are open. Isn't this enough?
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Imo, the best would be write cons and pros about current rule and about the proposition from jupstar to remove one
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> then you would see clearly, what's better, what will cause more problems
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Examples are beyond the point, I give you 2 arguments that you don't want to argue against, you just argue that there is a conflict between rule 11 and it's discussion, I tell you there isn't one, you tell me there is one
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We are all developers here, that is definitely an infinite loop 😛
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but your problem seems to be that someone is attack(smone from the admins) so, there must be any chance to attack the dicision anyway
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> stackoverflow sucks
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> it awlays comes up in google results for problems i have
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> but all the questions are closed because the members dont like the question
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ sorry, I don't understand the last one at all
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I think jupstar doesn't fully understand what everything is about
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> 😄
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he mentions the same stuff again and again
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he clearly stats that he thinks learath problem is an admin being personally attacked so he wants a chance to only attack the "decision"
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont find it that hard
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to understand
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> is it learath's problem?
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I think he got something wrong there
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe he meant argument
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never ever made a specific argument. I just told you what I feel about the rule and why I vote to keep it
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah maybe i wasnt clear about it:
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if you don't complain to a admin about stuff recruiting, but to "the admins", then you can't attack a signle person
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but the whole crew xd
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> You think, if it would be open then
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> the admin would be alone?
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> as i said
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it's more about having these open discussions
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not about attacking
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it already is about single admins
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ryo did that, but it seems heinrich was the initilizer
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it was his good "right"
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> But look
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> You dn't want attacks
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> but you will cause them
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> you think, people would be polite ? On public forum?
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah but the admins (as a whole) must be experienced enough to take such critisism
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats the task of a forum mod
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> critisism?
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> You talking about all of these trolls over there?
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dude nothing new that i cant write xd
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> But look, if you would delete those "troilled" message
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> then you would tell me its censorship
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I personally don't mind you talking shit to me, but the mod in question might not want people to insult him
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> people have to be held accountable for their mistakes, but they don't have to be trashed by some stupid rant based on lies
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well, i think you can see a difference between a good argumentation(critic) and a troll post
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Yes, and oyu will tell me it wasn't troll
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and you don't need to be in public to be held accountable
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> it's perspective
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Imo, closed reporting or delegated forum is the best thing you can do, without harming people
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> if someone got ban, they probably did something wrong
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well @Learath2 this can happen, but willing to work with the community might create hate towards a person, that tho isn't the point.
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it's about the decision:
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if i say mod XY made many mistakes(false bans) then he has to face it. is there a problem?
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> he will face with admins
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> not community
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can do that in private
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> insulting is something that is a problem independend of reports
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and it will have sufficent consequences
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and it will have sufficient consequences
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> why communit have to administer justice
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that doesn't change the fact, that we cannot make critic to any dicisions, even the ones that have nothing todo with his popularity
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or was ryos problem such a thing?
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no he broke a rule
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> in private you can 😄
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh sure the community isnt the judge
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it's the ones that discuss
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i said that few times
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the admins judge
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that will never change
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I don't like, when people without knowledge about problem
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> talks about this problem
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> like, admin kicked someone, and then
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> whole community blame admin
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> because, LOL HOW YOU DARE
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> you know backstory?
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> SEEE
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> not at all
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thanks for the argument
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> for what argument, you can't think for yoursefl?
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no, i won't get the backstory
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so i have to accept it, and can't openly discuss it
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> so it's stupid to talk about stuff, if you don't know what happened
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> and you think what would hapopend
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if the admins make reasonable decisions, you don't need the community to discuss it
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I personally don't feel the extra discussion will bring in anything new to the table, but you feel so so we even said we can try the semi-transparent model of stackoverflow
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> if everyuone could talk about every admin decision? Without context
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and why does that happen
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We already have enough people that disagree on everything
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> don't you see your owngoal?`
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> unless you do heavy moderation, there is no way to prevent people spreading lies and cause whitch hunting
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> 😃
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> For me, the topic is super closed
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> You don't gave any real solutions
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and is that something bad?
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> and removing rule isn't one
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i actually think there are alot of helpers around here
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes, for 2 weeks then they disappear
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually feel the worlds problem right now is people complaining with offering no real solution
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not just ddnet
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there is a solution
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ban bans
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> 😄
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and remove rules
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I like that one
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> YES
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anarchy
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> we should ban everyone
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> y
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Then nobody will talk
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes why don't we just live in a perfect world
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> best solution imo
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anarchy has been discussed for a millennia yet no country or community embraces it. It can't be too good
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> they suck
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> in tw anarachy is good
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Maybe we should hire a lawyer, to write
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> good rules
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyway it seems more ryozuki wasn't really talking about stuff decisions, but more dicision of stuffs(admins)
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so either way we talked about a different problem lately
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> and explanations
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> 😄
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that aren't independend tho
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> let's take it one step further and vote on ssh commands we execute on the servers
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u will see BanBansNet is going to rock
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since the rules cover both
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> as long as most people vote nothing bad will happen
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @ChillerDragon whats BanBansNet
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> a thing im working on currently
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I don't know how about you admins, but for me it's closed topic. Since noone gave any solution
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> expect the StackVOerflow one
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 8:43 PM] Jupstar ✪: since the rules cover both
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you please show me this rule you have been complaining about for the last hour? It very clearly doesn't cover both, if it does it's bad wording and we need to fix it
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> which was accepted
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rule 11
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @ZombieToad ddnet with good maps and no rules
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I want an overhaul of the rules, they are from 2015 :feelsbadman:
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Savander stackoverflow idea was by @heinrich5991 even
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> so, you have answers
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Maybe we shouldn't talk to people, which don't want to make anything more than complains?
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @ChillerDragon pls rules
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Less stress
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> less effort
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> otherwise its DDBlock
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Savander I'm already going to die young of all the stress, might aswell take it all the way
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ppl dont block if they can race @ZombieToad im hostin my block servers since years and ppl never block there bcs i have races
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> 😄
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ??XD
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sure people in the european parliament don't have to argue so much a day
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I think
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> there's the same problem
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> people don't listen
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> and complains
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> without solutions
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> that's why it's shit
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> xD
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> that's why i really like Brunei
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> one guy, absolute power
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> everyone happy
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> rich country
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao should we maybe reword rule 11 so it's clearer?
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Savander monarchy only works as long as everyone is rich af, rich in context of ddnet doesn't mean much
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> he even ban talking about money
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye and we should think a bit more about it, don't rush it
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> so it's super cool
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> they were poor
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> as fuck
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> for last 500 years
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> and they are still happy
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> 😄
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but tho i would like to know why ryo's complain was wrong, or better, how could he report his complain, but already make some discussion with anybody, who might think the same
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> they are rich, because Shell found  a lot of oil and gas
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> now they are super rich, but still the same system
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> absolute power ;PP
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> a private complain is not bad, as you ppl stated, it removes some unneeded effects(insults etc)
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i might want ppl on my side, giving good arguments, i have no chance to do that in a forum
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hell I might even agree to public mod reports, but discussions are just not a good idea imho
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> YOu can talk about everything, expect admimns
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or give an overview that many ppl dislike it, even if they don't directly report
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> and mods
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> because it can cause personall harashment
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he wasnt talking about admins, but about the decision once again
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so basically the admins collect just how many reports they get about any decision
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and then discuss it?
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> [8:50 PM] Jupstar ✪: or give an overview that many ppl dislike it, even if they don't directly report
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> very biased and not meaningful
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do you think people will only discuss the decision? we can't keep a single discussion about the discussion itself rather then the persons discussing it
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but that doesn't mean 5 admins are right directly
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> nice 5000 messages of argument pls stop now. nothing has changed. nothing will change and i cant be bothered to read anymore
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ZombieToad just mark it as read then
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> 😄
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> but i dont want to miss anything
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> it's like tv show
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> you don't like it
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> developer channel has important stuff in it
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> but you watch it
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just want to break the record of biggest log file
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> xD
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> f3 for #developer on ddnet discord being the most interesting chat ever
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> it is
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @Jupstar ✪ i think it is the biggest logfile https://ddnet.tw/irclogs/
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Guess that's it for today, we'll discuss the wording of rule 11 and it's implications
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thanks to everyone who contributed their opinion
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> rule 11 doesnt affect ddnet discord right? jao makes the rules here
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and please understand ryos point
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he did really alot for you, and only wanted "his idea" to improve ddnet to be heard
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Admins now want us to forget this
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Always works, for some weeks
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i know it's currently against your rules, but in the end, it wasn't an total atk or smth
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I didn't make the no staff complaints rule here @ZombieToad
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @jao u run the ddnet bot?
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Jesus christ lord almighty, give me strength. Your conspiracy theories actually make me paranoid of myself
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> y
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> so who typed those rules?
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ZombieToad the DDNet bot
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> again, get his position
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's a sentient neural network
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he is the one, that fears, nothing changes, after all his work
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lol the one who "typed" the latest version of the rules doesn't have to be the one who originally set them up
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @jao you own this discord so you get to make the rules here?
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I don't own this discord
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i thought welf gave it to you
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and I didn't make the staff complaints rule, again
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> then regretted giving it to you
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yea no that's not true
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ but should work always result in change?
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> welf lied to me :O
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't the validity of the arguments matteR?
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no, but i still don't see a reason to have such a harsh rule
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> so who is the current owner of this discord
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you could say, be ingame moderator, but pls stop writing to us.
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that would take his whole existence
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> because he clearly isn't against you
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> snail @ZombieToad
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> so welf gave it to snail?
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> y
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and i mean about the decisions stuff, not generally
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ as said ,we'll discuss the wording of the rule and think about a solution to the staff discussions rule
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @snail remove rule 6 pls
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i guess thats a good start for both sides
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> only ddnet bot can do that
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> remove rules after all
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :thonkery:
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> only 2 should exists
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> only 1*
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> be nice!
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> "Admin is always right"
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> "If not, see first paragraph"
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> and everyone would be happy! I really like that one
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I always put it in my rules
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> this the rules already tbh
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> then people say they didn't do wrong cause it's not in the rules
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> "admins have the final say on everything"
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but then if an admin isn't present no one is breaking any rules
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> stuff like "only english" is more of a guideline already anyways
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not good enough
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Why, if for you someone did something wrong
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> ban him!
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> rule 6 is a guideline aswell right?
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> im not joking :PP
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> #4 Use channels only for their named purpose - Read the channel descriptions for more details.
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> yall are getting banned
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> this is only for developers
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> no
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> for develoipment talk
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> changins rules is indeed development
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> but the rules are never gonna change so not really
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> wow
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this channel is kinda different because it's the only one connected to irc
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> so why we talked for a 2 hours
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> who uses irc?
21:08 <+Learath2> so I don't have to walk over to another computer
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ok I will do an update to the discord rules
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> after we did the rule 11 thing
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Man, just remove it!
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> (:D)
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ok
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> You see guys? who's the master
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Savander for supreme leader
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> no
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> im supreme leader
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can we get back to tech?
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Absolute power only
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> $ mysql -u teeworlds -p'PW2' teeworlds < ddnet-sql/record_*.sql
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> and no talk about money
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bash: sql-banbans/record_*.sql: ambiguous redirect
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> any ideas?
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can't redirect more then one file
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there is one stdin 😛
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> huh?
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but its in the ddnet readme
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> i think, you have to put
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> date
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> in plac eof * but idk
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> huh, maybe some zsh extension
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> who made ddnets sql so complicated
21:13 <+Learath2> sushitee I think :P
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> or maybe not :D:D
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and even with single files it doesnt work
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> i would abstract sql
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> :v
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it dumps some hughe usage instruction set with single files
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> can you show output for a single one?
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> used to be you had sql_password sql_username sql_prefix
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> now it has add_sqlserver
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> idk what to do with add_sqlserver
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Savander I was thinking of sth similar with a records server, and @HMH suggested a message queue, might have worked well actually
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ZombieToad that is so we can have failover servers
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/464509495196909578/error.txt
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> llike if one server fails we don't lose records or have to manually input them
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @Learath2 is add_sqlserver documented anywhere?
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> https://ddnet.tw/settingscommands/ add_sqlserver    add a sqlserver
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> doesnt help much
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> in the readme i think
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/ARsuI/fa877dd314.png
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> afk
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> wheres this
21:16 <+Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> I generally like abstraction
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/README.md
21:16 <+Learath2> @ChillerDragon, hmm I don't get why that happens
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> i don't like write the same stuff over and over again, if i can abstract it to simpler form
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> oh its under Importing the official DDNet Database
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Also, i don't like huge classes and files
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i didnt want to do that i just wanted sql xD
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon you might want to add a 0 after the w line so it doesn't try recreating it (don't remember if it's still necessary)
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> poor documentation 😦
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah very bad actually 😦
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> 😦
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> https://www.docz.site/
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do we want npm? 😛
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> meh, probably not
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> but looks good
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> 😄
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> but, markdown is pretty straighforward
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> we could use it to docs
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> maybe not like, every function in game
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> (doxygen would be better then)
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> really should have documented along the way
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> doxygen docs look like they were from 1998
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> For me, the best documentation is
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> when functions describe themselfs
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> and are not too big
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Maybe because i think in really abstract way and prefer abstraction
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Btw, how about StyleCI? have you wrote the rules? I remember you tried
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> Recently, I have learned a bit of CPP. I'm so proud of myself. Now I can at least understand what's going on in Teeworlds code 😮
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> at least, more than before
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> same
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tried getting clang-format to do our way but it doesnt want to
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> phpstorm funnily is the only thing that can do our style easily
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> phpstorm?
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> why nto CLIon
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> wer
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> on kog servers it forces ur flag to libya
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> why is it green

22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> herer it is
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it's their old flag
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> was the green flag ever official?
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yea
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> it says they used their current flag since 1951?
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> oh i see
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> it was re adopted
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao>

22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @Ravie fix libya flag
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> lol
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> just picked the random solid one. That could be strange if we force everyone to have German flag :)
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> default flag? :thonkery:
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> just pick tw flag
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how to disable /map ..-.
