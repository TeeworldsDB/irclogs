11:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> too far
11:46 < bridge_> <ryozuki> when barcelona
12:44 < bridge_> <opulently> @ryozuki in rust https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug
12:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> sen
12:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> seen
14:33 < bridge_> <reitw> yo wtf
17:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> big if true
17:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but why not clang-format 16
17:30 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Probably because it is not available in current Ubuntu LTS release (22.04).
17:30 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Probably because it is not available in current Ubuntu LTS release (22.04) (out of the box).

17:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> damned be non rolling distros
17:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ill soon switch to clang 17 tools
17:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in rust they announced a 4% speed increase in compile time
17:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> iirc
17:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and some better codegen

17:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75325
17:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this issue is what could fix rust compile times
17:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Patrick Walton @pcwalton Thanks to khei4, the single-basic-block version of the Rust memcpy killer has landed in LLVM! Note that it only works across a single BB for now, but it can be improved later. https://reviews.llvm.org/D153453
20:33 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @heinrich5991 in your libtw2 repo you have README.md with links. and the first one goes to docs but the folder is actually called 'doc' :p
21:42 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> how dare you heinrich!

23:57 < bridge_> <patiga> https://infobeamer.c3voc.de/
23:57 < bridge_> <patiga> At cccamp there are occasional slides for projects on the many monitors. If you have some time, it would be awesome to have a DDNet slide in there :)
23:57 < bridge_> <patiga> At the next events, like the congress, the same slides could be reused :ddnet:
