17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was searching to know if there was a tool that showed the most optimal way to order fields to avoid unnecesary paddings etc, like rust does this automatically, and thats why u need repr(c), and i found a SO answer from the guy i mentioned the other day that knows shit load about asm: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56761591/how-do-i-organize-members-in-a-struct-to-waste-the-least-space-on-alignment
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the world sure is small
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was searching to know if there was a tool that showed the most optimal way to order fields to avoid unnecesary paddings etc for c++ structs, like rust does this automatically, and thats why u need repr(c), and i found a SO answer from the guy i mentioned the other day that knows shit load about asm: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56761591/how-do-i-organize-members-in-a-struct-to-waste-the-least-space-on-alignment
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c++ not guaranting long to be 64 bit and stuff sure is hell
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for this to be portable
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can use fixed width integer types if it's important to your application
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://www.catb.org/esr/structure-packing/
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pog
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess, i was mostly curious anyway not doing any real thing
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually i wondered if our protocol structs could be optimized
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by reordering the fields
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which would probs break compat
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Protobuf when?
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually thought about this
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we can use it for ddnet 2.0
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://crates.io/crates/protobuf
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also finally understood the atomic seqcst and stuff thanks to this https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/atomics.html
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never rly looked into it before
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i found a funny text there
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Rust pretty blatantly just inherits the memory model for atomics from C++20. This is not due to this model being particularly excellent or easy to understand. Indeed, this model is quite complex and known to have several flaws. Rather, it is a pragmatic concession to the fact that everyone is pretty bad at modeling atomics. At very least, we can benefit from existing tooling and research around the C/C++ memory model. (You'll often see th
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Trying to fully explain the model in this book is fairly hopeless. It's defined in terms of madness-inducing causality graphs that require a full book to properly understand in a practical way. If you want all the nitty-gritty details, you should check out the C++ specification. Still, we'll try to cover the basics and some of the problems Rust developers face.
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ddnet 2.0? ðŸ¤”
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my theorical version of ddnet written in rust that breaks all compat
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and that will never exist
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> has it been decided yet if the useless new shields are gonna stay? the new layout of extras.png depends on this a bit
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> @Ravie are the HUD and Extras finalized, or does it need more visual changes? Teeskins needs a clarification before we do changes.
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Cellegen | RiH there will be a change soon, we're planning to merge some stuff into a single image
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Okay, notify us if it's finalized
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> also where did you guys localize the basic assets of each category? (hud, extras, gameskin, etc)
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Cellegen | RiH where the default are or where to put custom?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> the defaults obviously, since you see the custom ones
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I have beta
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> default is in data folder where the game is installed
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> oh... perhaps the Assets Directory shouldn't be linked to the appdata's teeworlds folder, but to the main directory instead
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> let alone, should be efficient to abandon local directory entirely
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what is the main dictonary for you? ddnet?
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or client?
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> steamapps directory -> common -> steam's ddnet -> etc
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> the data directory is where i point at
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> this is what the Assets Directory button shows, where all the custom assets may go to
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1000076383390814319/unknown.png
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> but then if you want to search for the basic assets, you have to use the main directory
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so the default assets should be "installed" to appdata?
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> no, rather it should be installed inside the Assets folder on the main directory like this:
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1000076845343047690/unknown.png
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> for better accessibility
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that wont happen
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> - the steam directory is often in Programm Files (x86). So it might require admin permission to write there.
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> - if client updates it might overwrite your customizations
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> - if u uninstall the game everything is gone
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> shouldn't be difficult to make the folders and preload them from there, if c++ won't have any performance issues with it
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> oh
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> generally never use the client data dir
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Then how other games deal with that?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what games?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> which games do you modify? ðŸ˜„
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> minecraft?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> uses .minecraft
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> any game which stores their own assets inside their home directory
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> minecraft uses appdata, so it doesn't matter
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> starbound perhaps?
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> most use mod loaders that either write the files before u start the game
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> it uses everything on the home directory, including mods
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or you dont mod the game at all ðŸ˜„
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> xd
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> one tripple A title example:
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> divinity 2 uses a dir in "Documents" even for the steam workshop stuff
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> well, shouldn't be a problem to store all assets on appdata yes, but then remove all the "duplicate" folders on the main directory also
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> as a compensation
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mh yeah i think we only ship like 2 assets right now, game_06 and louis' entities
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i guess it's not too bad to just tell the user they can find the default assets on github
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> appdata is really data directory with higher priority
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> or that too, any info on how to get the assets is a huge help indeed
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so everything from appdata is loaded first
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> even if it has the same name
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I'm scared to ask if you should load mapres files before running
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> considering you can have hundreds of mbs worth of data
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> So any chance on improvement on localization?
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> preload mapres?
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think its not useful, most ppl dont use the editor
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> So any chance on improvement on localization? (Cuz like not all assets need to be preloaded before the game starts, but it still needs a category folder for all of the assets)
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> and might hurt loading time
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> is it badly translated or what do you mean here?
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or translate the directories?
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> every folder is alright, but if it needs some clear up, then from the home directory, the **assets** folder, **maps** and **maps7** folder needs better clarification
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> is maps7 created on appdata?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> for the assets folder, you have one already in the appdata directory, which as you said, only includes some assets which won't affect performance
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think we should remove that
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so you are saying, u want a category bcs assets are loading too slow in the assets tab?
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> on maps and maps7, should be included into one folder to not get players confused on what it is.
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> it should be called **maps**, and it includes ahh
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> you cannot include points on folders as a string
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> you cannot include points on folders as a string in windows folders at least
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maps7 should simply not exists, nobody needs this except ddnet and maybe other hosters
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its not really useful for 99.99% of all players xD
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> So it can be moved to maps
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maps7 = 0.7 compatible maps
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u cannot move it
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they are named the same
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> and call the maps differently i suppose
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think we should simply not create the directory, i dont see any reason why we should
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if someone wants to use 0.7 compability he has to be aware of the map_convert tool anyway
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> some quality of life change
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> ðŸ™‚
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> but yeah, the basic assets problem is indeed a problem we'll be having
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> should be put into the custom assets folder
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i still dont really understand your problem. is it bcs of the loading time when u have many assets?
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or just the simple fact that ppl dont find the original assets
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or lets say it differently. what problems do users report, that you want to solve?
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> wait, sorry i didn't show what is exactly the problem in visual changes
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/991852189238702171/1000067899127517245/unknown.png
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> so this is what shiro sent me, since he wanted to find the asset, so i wanted to help him find it
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> and somehow my dumbass didn't look at the folder directory
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah, but i think it's ok its not listed here, since its not meant for customization
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that's the whole point for an assets tab
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u put the stuff u want and dont care about what the client ships
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> but it hasn't been mentioned anywhere that it should only contain custom assets
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> it might confuse players even more
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it doesn't need to "only" contain custom assets, but that is the main purpose
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> right
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> he can also do a default.png and it works, doesnt it?, if not we should simply move all client data to assets permanentelly
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> maybe change the name **assets directory** to **custom assets directory**?
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> makes more sense anyway D
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> default_x.png, nah it doesn't need change in name
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think its a bit oververbose. i mean most ppl are aware that this is the purpose, but we have tooltips now. u can add that if u want
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> ooooh right
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> then I'll leave it to you, hopefully it won't create more confusion already xd
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ^ @Cellegen | RiH i created an issue so its not lost
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :chearth:
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> has there been any work on automatic analysis of teehistorian data?
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> mostly for finding cheaters but it could have any purpose i guess
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> also what is Golden Week in this image? i dont see it mentioned in discord
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1000129783029567518/unknown.png
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think we currenctly parse teehistorian
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its in my todo list if i ever have time xd
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but probs another will do it before
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Week_(China)
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh, thanks
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> I've written a teehistorian parser here: https://gitlab.com/zwelf/teehistorian
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> Working on a validator too and will publish soon[tm]
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur not a weeb
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> golden week appears on most slice of life anime
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like monogatari xd
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i dont watch anime
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> normie!
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> cool
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im not a normie!
