16:21 <+o_be_two> hello
16:34 <@EastByte> hi
17:12 <@deen> that's funny
17:12 <@deen> hi
17:12 <@deen> someone asked me to write him a program and offered to pay me a club mate for that^^
17:14 <@EastByte> I want the mate :(
17:20 <+o_be_two> club mate ?
17:21 <@EastByte> soft drink for hackers sold in germany
17:30 <+o_be_two> oO lol
20:20 <+o_be_two> hey
20:20 <+o_be_two> is there a way to check if my TW server is running from an other host ?
20:20 <+o_be_two> like by netcat HOST PORT -u COMMAND
20:20 <+o_be_two> the goal is to monitor if the server is running well
20:28 <@heinrich5991> o_be_two: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10815
20:28 <@heinrich5991> you can probably adapt that
20:29 <+o_be_two> thank you heinrich5991 :)
20:38 <@EastByte> o_be_two: you can also just use twping (it's in ddnet repo)
20:43 <+o_be_two> oh nice
20:43 <+o_be_two> but the "goal" is to find a way to get monitored by uptimerobot
20:43 <+o_be_two> ive talked with them, they said they are ok to check udp for me but they need to know what to send and what to wait
20:43 <+o_be_two> (as answer)
20:46 <@EastByte> o_be_two: sending a getinfo request and waiting for the response (like twping is doing) would be one way to go
20:47 <+o_be_two> awesome
20:47 <+o_be_two> thanks a lot for all these useful hints !
20:51 <@EastByte> no problem
21:04 <+o_be_two> awesome heinrich5991 : echo -n $'\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xffgie3\xff' | netcat -u -q 1 tw2.r0x.fr 8606
21:05 <+o_be_two> found in your script, thanks a lot !
21:20 <+o_be_two> hum EastByte i'm looking about twping, is it just a function or is it a file ?
21:26 <@EastByte> it's a tool, can be compiled with `bam twping`
21:29 <@heinrich5991> src/tools/twping.cpp probably
21:56 <+o_be_two> oh ok thank you
