17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> what should we do about that? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1721
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll fix it I guess
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll also make it always stay in the entity
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> okay, because i'm looking at other issues that i may be able to fix
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well you can fix it aswell
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but the requirement is that it's reasonable ðŸ˜›
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. 100 is the biggest the text can be while staying inside the entity
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0 should be no text, without breaking freetype
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ok
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> and the biggest number like 255? can it overlaps or it needs to stay inside aswell? xd
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> stay inside
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> k
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 @Jupstar âœª mentioned a way to get a nice approximate for the size, I don't really remember though
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 one thing I wasn't sure of was whether having the sizes vary slightly would look bad, so I was going to test both ways
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> once with one size for 1 digit, 2 digit and 3 digit numbers, and once with just a variable size that fits the text inside the entity
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Learath2 yea i see but for now i try to understand what's going on with the code and how it works xd
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> :justatest:
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> since version x or a winows update idk i get these cursors stuck in consle :c
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/DB8rJ/ff5fc6e66b.png
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> ew
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> windows
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikr
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> i think
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> its not even on each line xd
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i think it depends on the time the line stays the latest or maybe if the cursor is in the blink state currently
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes tested:
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the windows console cursor blinks and if it is currently blinking while a message arrives it gets stuck there
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> weird
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> maybe a windows bug?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon it shouldnt even blink?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no because there is no input
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> dont think its a windows bug there were a few tweaks on the console over the years in ddnet as far as i remember
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> might be related to the thing u were trying to debug @heinrich5991
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the bug didnt exist in 9.0.2
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> (best version xd)
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @archimede67 stop fooding
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> @Learath2 okok
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 ^
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh nice
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that will fix the issue when u see 9999 instead of score due to (maybe) missing a packet or smth
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> PREDICT_DDRACE means the server has the ddnet network character?
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it will fix the issue of seeing 9999 instead of a score, yes
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> noice
