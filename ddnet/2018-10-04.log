11:34 <@heinrich5991> deen: do you employ code review at work?
11:40 <@heinrich5991> if so, can you tell me how that generally works? I think I have too little of an idea what to actually do there
11:55 <@deen> heinrich5991: bridge is not working discord -> irc btw
11:55 <@deen> heinrich5991: Yeah, we do have code reviews: https://hookrace.net/blog/hana-cpp-development/
11:55 <@deen> So we have some automated tools running to check stuff like clang-tidy/format etc and then 2 people who review the code manually on top
11:56 <@deen> You read the change and try to understand what it does. If you can't understand it, ask some questions or suggest comments. Try to find mistakes and unclarities
12:03 <@deen> You can review line-by-line and make sure each line seems reasonable. And you can look at the bigger picture and try to understand what the change is trying to achieve and if that's the best approach for it.
12:05 <@heinrich5991> I don't know why the bridge stopped working. I couldn't find anything related on the issue tracker :/
12:06 <@deen> Open a new bug I guess? :D (with logs ideally)
12:07 <@heinrich5991> let's look into what they want for a bug report
12:11 <@heinrich5991> huh. github has a new "new issue" screen
12:11 <@heinrich5991> I can select "bug report" or "feature request" after clicking "new issue", presumably, these are issue templates
12:11 <@deen> Looks the same to me, maybe you have some beta or a/b testing going on
12:12 <@deen> or it has to be enabled per project
12:12 <@heinrich5991> per project, probably
12:12 <@heinrich5991> try: https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/issues
12:12 <@deen> "Get organized with issue templates"
12:12 <@deen> in repo settings
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Bojidar Marinov make the Game Tiles auto placer button appear in every Group, not just the Game group. If you use it from another layer and it will use for example Front layer you have to add it to the Game group, not the current group
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> that's another issue
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> and actually, either automatically placing gametiles from another group or multi-group selection is likely going to be my next take
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> also, I would like to lessen the hassle of adding more images by putting an "Add"/"More.." button in the image picker popup, so that people don't have to open the images tab to get started
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @deen i was curious on my newest version of Demonsphere (which is on the test section) and i wanted to make the design less laggy but as i saw, i didnt see the hookthrough in the beggining while it works normally.
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> when i went entities on
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> only unhook was possible to see
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> instead of hookthrough
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> Oh... maybe that caused the problem :danAmazing: i switched the places of Game and Front x,ddd
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/497359657447456768/screenshot_2018-10-04_12-48-59.png
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> you just answered your question yourself... üòâ
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ye ik it was already night when i was found it ;c
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i was wondered it was editor bug or client bug. now we know ._.
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> PEBKAC
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Bojidar Marinov I'm coding the general solution to your problem right now üòÉ
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Bojidar Marinov I'm coding the general solution to your problem right now üôÇ
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> wow, cool! üòÑ
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> wow, cool! üòÉ
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Cellegen yeah, that's the problem. But it's a nice trick if you want to hide some stuff inside of the map I guess üòâ
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> HMMM like symbols @Im 'corneum ? :troll: üèÜ
13:47 <@heinrich5991> deen: what's LLT?
13:47 <@heinrich5991> like, what's the long version of that name?
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> @ChillerDragon Oh my... I was able to make the autoautomapper optimization work fine (and hopefully without bugs!) \o/
14:17 <@deen> heinrich5991: LTT you mean? Our custom C++ standard library
14:33 <@heinrich5991> deen: but what does LTT stand for? :)
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> @deen hello i have question about vote list in ddnet types/$SERVERS/maps is public for download ?
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps/
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps/blob/master/types/ddmax/votes.cfg
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> i saw votes.cfg
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> but in votes.cfg wrote ddnet orginals server top1
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> if there is maps file it will be better
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> in ddnet-scripts is very old update
14:49 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- opened pull request #1326: WIP: Try to test ringbuffer (for #1307) (master...ringbuffer-test) https://git.io/fxqM0
15:25 <@deen> heinrich5991: Library of Templates and Tools ;)
15:25 <@heinrich5991> ah :)
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to be honest, I don't really understand what you're asking for, @Sv3N
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Sv3N nope, the votes.cfg is not public, we use it in our internal ddnet repo where passwords and stuff lives
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ehm, votes.cfg is public, but maps file not
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 he means these files: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/types/brutal/maps
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Sv3N what's your use case?
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> i update my ddrace servers maps file manually
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you're running our scripts to create the votes.cfg from it?
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> and i'm now really tired to continue my old method
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> yes
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> craete-votes.py
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> in ddnet-scripts
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I see, what is your server called btw?
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> i not got your mean
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> you want know my server name or .. ?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sv_name on your game server
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> ddnet persian
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, cool, it's still alive
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> üòÑ
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> y
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> but with register 0
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So if I put the maps file in ddnet-maps repo is that good for you?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> y
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> will do
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> that really great
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> tnx
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> and i have a method for fix ddnet-server_sql crashing on windows
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> i don't know you tested beforce or no
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> ddnet with mysql on will crash on windows
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> good to know, how to fix it?
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> but i change a little in codes
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> can you make a PR on github?
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> a can try üòÑ
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sv3N> i*

18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> is there any way to get the nightly build with a specific sha1? or at least see the sha1 of the current nightly build?
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nope, I build them manually
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @cinaera want one? Otherwise there are also the CI builds
