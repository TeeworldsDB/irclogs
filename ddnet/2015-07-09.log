01:26 <@deen> Damn, our database has been growing a lot recently. Checking /top5 of Kobra 2 took 4 seconds on Chile, now down to 0.1 again
01:26 <@deen> only still slow on RUS, but only have 256 MB RAM on that one =/

03:01 <@deen> If anyone likes drama: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1759
04:23 < eeeee> cool drama bro
04:25 < eeeee> if only someone implemented proper serverside recordings...
10:19 < Learath2> huh whats wrong with serverside recordings now ?
10:21 <@EastByte> mainly performance
10:36 < Learath2> I'll have a try at diffing maps :)
10:40 < laxadedi> Last time we talked about that the main issues were : performance / storage / bandwitch
10:53 <@EastByte> it's pretty crazy that a demo file can be deflated by 89% using gzip
10:55 < Learath2> oh wow thats huge :P
10:55 <@EastByte> yep, the demofile format needs some updates
10:56 < Learath2> I just read how datafiles are saved and about to give up on map diffing
10:57 <@EastByte> it's kinda confusing at the beginning
10:58 <@EastByte> also diffing maps is one thing, we also need a neat way to show the changes on screen
10:58 < Learath2> was thinking of offloading that to an image differ
10:58 <@EastByte> the initial idea was to just implement it into my webgl viewer
10:59 < Learath2> i probably stole that idea from someone but no idea who :/
11:00 < Learath2> EastByte: having it in the webgl viewer also seems like a nice idea
11:02 <@EastByte> I guess I'll always be bind to js :/
11:02 <@EastByte> and I can't do proper asm.js/webassembly development since nim lack of support
11:03 <@EastByte> lacks*
11:03 < Learath2> well ill be continuing my irc bot written in nim instead
11:03 <@EastByte> good :)
11:04 < Learath2> trying to think of a neat way to add in plugin support
11:04 <@EastByte> !twp east
11:04 < Nimda> east is currently playing AiP-Gores on server : DDNet GER - Oldschool [DDraceNetwork].
11:04 <@EastByte> now follow me
11:04 <@EastByte> one single speedrun pls :D
11:19 < Learath2> EastByte: you sure there is a nim vm ? :D couldnt find one
11:20 <@EastByte> didn't use it yet
11:20 <@EastByte> deen: what do you know about the nim vm?
11:26 < Learath2> nim is compiled to c how could it have a vm :P
11:27 <@EastByte> by parsing/executing the nim code directly? :P
11:30 <@EastByte> http://forum.nim-lang.org/t/1319#8265
11:30 <@EastByte> "which does what you're after: It compiles a Nim program to Nim's AST then to bytecode and then runs the bytecode. compiler/vmops.nim shows how some math and os procs are hooked into the VM so that they can be run even though they end up using importc'ed stuff at runtime."
11:55 < Learath2> sounds like somewhere noone has ever been to :D
12:03 <@EastByte> :D

12:05 <@EastByte> skynet compilation...
12:06 < Learath2> was a nice map never could finish it tho b/c everyone got bored before the end
12:08 <@EastByte> yes everyone gets bored before reaching half of the map :P
12:08 <@EastByte> and it also is faily
12:24 < Learath2> nim compiler doesnt seem to like importing itself :/
13:50 < Learath2> well EastByte the nim vm doesnt seem to be in a good enough state to work with :P
13:51 < Learath2> even getting it to run a simple echo("Hello from VM") took me an hour

17:32 < o_be_one> hi friends :)
17:32 < Learath2> o/
18:00 < Learath2> I might have started writing the ugliest irc bot in existance
18:02 <@EastByte> oh noes o\
18:02 < Learath2> as a result ill ditch dynamic libs and try lua instead :P
18:03 <@EastByte> and I just consumed all my chocolate
18:03 <@EastByte> oh lua
18:03 < Learath2> oh noes
18:04 < Learath2> i just cant seem to find a clean way to interface with plugins
18:05 <@EastByte> I'm working on a network engine for simple server <-> server communication
18:06 <@EastByte> (in nim)
18:15 <@deen> Learath2: best don'T use dynamic libs for plugins. i used to think that's a good idea, now i don't
18:15 < Learath2> deen: any ideas ? 
18:15 <@deen> i would just build a simple program and recompile the whole thing with all plugins^^
18:16 < Learath2> already confused
18:16 < Learath2> so you mean to add a plugin you'd need to recompile the whole app ?
18:16 <@deen> yes
18:16 < Learath2> unacceptable !!!
18:16 < Learath2> :D
18:16 <@deen> why does it matter much? compilations should take 2 seconds max anyway

18:17 <@deen> shared libraries are terrible for performance anyway
18:17 <@deen> and so much overhead and complications
18:17 < Learath2> well then i lose the ability to do !loadplugin ping 
18:18 <@deen> well you'd have to compile it in first, sure, but you could enable/disable it at runtime
18:18 <@deen> i like what xmonad does, where you can recompile the whole program, then restart it and it keeps the state of the old one and just keeps running
18:19 <@EastByte> ^ I think that's the proper way
18:19 <@deen> and i wanted to write a framework for that for nim but didn't get around to it =/
18:20 <@deen> At least the forum is all full with my drama post now :P
18:20 <@EastByte> sadly you cannot keep the irc session open
18:20 <@deen> EastByte: why not?
18:20 < Learath2> who'd respond to the pings
18:20 <@EastByte> tcp connection is killed on restart
18:20 <@deen> hmmm, ok, no idea
18:21 <@deen> i thought you can maybe pass it over
18:21 <@EastByte> one reason why I dislike using tcp now
18:21 < Learath2> deen: so you say just compile plugins along with app
18:21 <@deen> with some socket_reopen magic etc
18:21 <@deen> Learath2: yes
18:21 < Learath2> well why not i gave the shared lib stuff a go and it looks so ugly my eyes hurt
18:22 <@deen> yep, that's my conclusion as well
18:22 <@deen> any nim specific problems or would it've been the same in C?
18:23 < Learath2> well being inexperienced in nim it took me a while to figure out how to expose functions and stuff but other rhen that it would be the same in C
18:27 <@EastByte> hmm when restarting sshd it keeps the connection open by forking a child process
18:27 <@EastByte> I can't find another bypass for that
18:28 <@EastByte> some 'tcp_reopen' would be nice
18:33 < BeaR_> ayy \o
18:33 <@EastByte> oi
18:33 < Learath2> just noticed im no good in program design :D
18:33 < Learath2> o/
18:33 <@EastByte> oh cool
18:33 <@EastByte> I'm not

21:13 <@deen> DeathHook is nice
21:13 <@deen> !twp deen
21:13 < Nimda> deen is currently playing DeathHook on server : DDNet GER - Moderate [DDraceNetwork].
21:13 <@deen> (and server is full)
21:30 <@deen> More people with Win95 went on ddnet.tw/hookrace.net than with BSDs, nice
21:31 <@deen> I really hope they use fake user agents and not really Win95
22:13 < eeeee> can ping them with 64kb packet to check
22:14 <@deen> haha
22:15 <@deen> Talking about packets of death, I heard that someone has a new way to kill ddnet servers. All I know is that "it's a packet that usually the masterserver sends the servers"
22:15 <@deen> and he's spamming it to the server until it crashes
22:15 <@deen> but haven't seen it in practice, i think the attacker is trying to keep it secret for now
22:15 <@deen> (but spies everywhere)
22:16 < eeeee> hmm
22:23 < eeeee> idk, maybe they are spamming errors and somehow crash the async logging or sth? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/e592d1b1fa8aaf6a5c559537ba047d47553cf9ef/src/engine/server/register.cpp#L274
22:42 < Learath2> getting people to learn ddrace is way too hard :/
22:43 < Learath2> i tried to help a friend he ended up giving up in 10 mins
22:48 < Savander> no way! I learned my friend how to play teeworlds in 2 weeks.After 2 months, he is able to play moderate maps 
22:49 <@deen> Aaaand another example for the need for map diffing: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=1727&p=18372#p18372
22:49 <@deen> yeah, it depends on the person, because it's a pretty hard game, you don't really get much help
22:50 <@deen> ideally you need someone to guide you and you need strong will power so you won't give up after failing for hours :P
22:50 < Savander> i forced him to play!
22:50 < Savander> (haha)
22:50 < Savander> just joke
22:50 < Savander> he force me, to help him
22:50 < Savander> "Man, play with me!!"
22:50 < Savander> after 10 hours
22:50 < Savander> "Why you don't want to play with me!, maan!!"
22:51 < Savander> "come, show me how to do this!"
22:51 <@deen> My brother has been playing for 2 years and he can barely finish some novice maps because he can't stay on a server after failing a part 2 times :P
22:51 < Savander> lol
22:52 < Savander> indeed, it depends xD..
22:52 < Savander> He playing run_guy25
22:52 < Savander> maybe few days
22:52 < Savander> over and over again
22:52 < Savander> his first finish of this map : 100+ minutes
23:15 < Learath2> deen: ger dead ?
23:16 <@deen> looks like a ddos
23:16 < Savander> I had to ask too hah
23:16 <@deen> server load 20, nice
23:17 <@deen> that's ddos attack #8 today =/
23:18 <@deen> TCP SYN flood and TCP RST flood at the same time from 2 botnets
23:30 <@deen> they really don't know when to stop, 4 more attacks
23:37 <@deen> EastByte: are you working on the fix for the save-team0 bug?
