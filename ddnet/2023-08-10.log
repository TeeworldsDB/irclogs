00:12 < bridge_> <bencie.> master server ded?
02:23 < bridge_> <arijanj> is fix-style.py supposed to wrap long lines cause i have a 195 character long if statement
02:23 < bridge_> <Ewan> um. ouch
02:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> anyway i feel like it's not
02:24 < bridge_> <Ewan> i've run into a few situations where i wish the clang format style had that specified
02:26 < bridge_> <arijanj> at least its not the longest line in the file
02:27 < bridge_> <Ewan> if your branching is dependent on many factors you can keep a validity indicator around (e.g. `bool proceed`) and turn it on/off as the factors are determined
02:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> or return incrementally
02:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> u know
02:39 < bridge_> <Ewan> restructuring stuff
02:40 < bridge_> <arijanj> theres another similar long if statement below it so i'm just sticking to that style
02:45 < bridge_> <arijanj> i had to add another localization string, i read the readme in scripts/languages i dont think im supposed to do anything?
02:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> I believe strings requested by Localize() calls are automatically added to the source string index
02:48 < bridge_> <arijanj> it does if i do ./update_all.py but then it adds a bunch of other strings
02:48 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you can ignore localizations, they'll be added in the next release
02:54 < bridge_> <arijanj> ok i'll just pr this little change then and see if its something you guys would want
05:19 < bridge_> <Voxel> i am splitting the images and tweaking visuals along the way
05:19 < bridge_> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1139035357460058142/image.png
05:32 < bridge_> <Voxel> Technical details:
05:32 < bridge_> <Voxel> 32x32 grid size still applies
05:32 < bridge_> <Voxel> I fixed the cutting off of the ninja muzzles, and I redid the hook positioning, so that it ACTUALLY looks like it loops

05:33 < bridge_> <Voxel> old chain top
05:33 < bridge_> <Voxel> new chain bottom
05:33 < bridge_> <Voxel> its a very small change no one will notice but i think it looks better, don't you think?
05:33 < bridge_> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1139038881757532210/image.png
05:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> yea
05:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> will you provide a gameskin converter tool
05:41 < bridge_> <Ewan> wonder if it should be python or if it should be a static exe in the game dir like dilate is, similar use case makes me think the latter though it would be easier with python bcs magick
05:48 < bridge_> <Voxel> yeah definitely, but idk how to do that yet
07:41 < bridge_> <Voxel> again i want to sort them into its most logical setup
07:41 < bridge_> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1139071032381145189/image.png
07:41 < bridge_> <Voxel> because game.png is so disorganized LOL
07:45 < bridge_> <Voxel> gonna try cleaning this all up soon because like
07:45 < bridge_> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1139071997045907538/image.png
07:45 < bridge_> <Voxel> is it like this IN GAME? if it is then it should be fixed
07:45 < bridge_> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1139072092277571614/GRASJJ_path1118.png
08:06 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> when doing that, we should provide a tool to split old game.pngs automatically. iirc minecraft does the same
08:08 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> grasjj
10:18 < bridge_> <steinchen99> Would it ever be possible that there's a setting that when you enter a by player specified teleporter you get killed? Would make speedrunning solo and race more comfortable
10:55 < bridge_> <cauldron1> I wonder if the client knows the number of a teleport.
11:09 < bridge_> <steinchen99> im pretty sure they in some way do because of this feature in the beta version
11:09 < bridge_> <steinchen99> * [Client] Add goto_switch and goto_tele commands [ChillerDragon]
11:25 < bridge_> <cauldron1> So you want this for training or for runs? Because you could run your own server in lan tab and replace the tele with kill tiles a the desired spot, but I guess thatâ€˜s too much work :troll:
11:40 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> of course
11:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> it must
12:09 < bridge_> <cauldron1> It could just send the tees coordinate, and the server tells what is there
12:11 < bridge_> <cauldron1> Theoreticalallyally
12:11 < bridge_> <cauldron1> A-lly
12:16 < bridge_> <cauldron1> Isnâ€˜t it actually that the client searches for the position of tele/switch in the goto function?
12:18 < bridge_> <cauldron1> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6887#discussion_r1289903593
12:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> client has the map so it knows the layers
12:24 < bridge_> <cauldron1> But in a way it has to first search for it?
12:30 < bridge_> <cauldron1> Anyway would be interesting to have this feature. I am thinking it further. You could have â€žbindâ€œ tiles where you can define your own bind if you touch the tile. Not just kill, but also switch to hammerâ€¦ jump or anything.
12:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> my .org domain costs 24â‚¬ on gandi but 12â‚¬ on google
12:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i guess its time to change
13:05 < bridge_> <steinchen99> What does it help me with if i want that feature so I don't have to manually kill x times on official servers?
13:05 < bridge_> <steinchen99> Am I gonna speedrun on lan server or what
13:09 < bridge_> <cauldron1> Ok. I like your request, find it interesting and want to invest more time in it.
13:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its oddly specific, the problem with having million of features like this is them breaking in the future
13:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so one has to consider how much people will use such features
13:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and if they are worth
13:16 < bridge_> <cauldron1> Thatâ€˜s a design specific question. I think such a feature could bloat the client, if you have like 100 such features, but if you could make it modular somehow you could keep it tiny. It would be sad if features would not be done only because they would bloat the client/server. In my opinion this is just another problem that can be solved for the good of the whole project.

13:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i guess
13:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ddnet code is not that modular tho xd
13:25 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Hi, are you doing the tweaks in vector?
13:25 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> I mean: would we have to recreate the images again (see https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-data-svg/pull/32/files) to have them in HD quality?
13:25 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Higher definition becomes more important now when the game has video recorder (renderer) and zoom. ðŸ™‚

13:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Is also the question if such features are desirable.. if u have 100 features like that it's kind of hidden features to most ppl.. ^^
13:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Bloat can also not happen code wise but feature wise... Ppl will lose the overview
13:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks prepare tomorrow rust class question
13:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Xd
13:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
13:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> It's important
13:34 < bridge_> <pilonpl> How do you guys understand the source code at all? I feel so dumb when i look at this lol
13:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u simply need to learn more c++
13:36 < bridge_> <pilonpl> That would probably help
13:36 < bridge_> <cauldron1> Thatâ€˜s what I meant. Feature bloat not the code. I played this other game thatâ€˜s still actively played and developed from 90s. Oldschool runescape. They have a very strict poll system where the community decided via votes/polls what features they want. Itâ€˜s really unique.
13:37 < bridge_> <pilonpl> It seems like every function i look at just calls another function that is in another file
13:38 < bridge_> <cauldron1> https://secure.runescape.com/m=poll/oldschool/
13:39 < bridge_> <cauldron1> They only implement features with >70% pro votes.
13:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> But do also sometimes remove features
13:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Besides the design is maybe not the best.. if the function name says renderhook.. I guess it's kinda clear what it tries to do xdd
13:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> DestroyHumans()
13:46 < bridge_> <cauldron1> executeC0d3()
13:46 < bridge_> <teero777> just make a src/bloat folder :kek:
13:48 < bridge_> <cauldron1> Which is good. When it turns out bad, throw it out. Or whatâ€˜s your point?
13:51 < bridge_> <pilonpl> 10 indentation levels also doesn't seem right
13:53 < bridge_> <pilonpl> It's also interesting because all of the files i was looking at contained functions but for functions to function you need a caller i suppose
13:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a program is just a bunch of functions
13:53 < bridge_> <ryozuki> you have a entry point, which is main
13:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> before main some stuff happens stack stuff and some small C runtime init or smth and then main gets called
13:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and from main we have a loop
13:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it calls functions
13:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> which call functions
13:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> which call more functions
13:54 < bridge_> <Voxel> yea
13:54 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Idk where the main function is in the source code lol
13:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> tbh u dont need to find it
13:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u wont do anything there
13:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but i suggest u go to linux
13:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> install ripgrep
13:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rg main(
13:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1139165453260955669/image.png

13:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> `rg "main\("`
13:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> `rg "main\(int argc"`
13:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> read my blog
13:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://edgarluque.com/categories/ddracenetwork/
13:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> bottom up
14:00 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Btw the link to your friend doesn't work anymore
14:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> It was missing a but du they* xd
14:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Do they sometimes remove features too?
14:05 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Oh wait, so i guess i need to a new CComponent? Well that would make a lot of sense actually
14:05 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Oh wait, so i guess i need to add a new CComponent? Well that would make a lot of sense actually
14:07 < bridge_> <cauldron1> I think yes. Iâ€˜m not so active there.
14:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yes, the client is made up of components
14:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the client calls each components method (onrender, oninput, etc) without knowing which component is what
14:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this is thanks to interfaces
14:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> classes
14:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the order which u add the component to the list matters
14:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its basic OOP
14:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> traits in rust
14:09 < bridge_> <Voxel> we can just split these
14:09 < bridge_> <Voxel> and i can provide the tweaks
14:10 < bridge_> <pilonpl> ~~isn't oop bad in 2023? Lol~~
14:12 < bridge_> <Voxel> :oop:
14:13 < bridge_> <pilonpl> So linux is better for programming right
14:16 < bridge_> <pilonpl> On mint i can use ubuntu instructions i guess
14:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i like what rust does, its nearly oop but not quite, its composition based
14:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ddnet code is old
14:23 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Rust seems really interesting
14:29 < bridge_> <Voxel> its only interesting if you like your code to not compile
14:31 < bridge_> <gxrmania> Could someone provide me with guidance on how to integrate the "tournament mod" (https://github.com/fstd/teeworlds/tree/tournament) into DDNet / TW? I'm interested in setting up a server with this mod.

14:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
15:09 < bridge_> <learath2> They should have randomly interleaved words, it'd be funnier
15:27 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Why is building on linux so easy lol
15:27 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I copied random commands from github and it works
15:35 < bridge_> <Voxel> ddnet is a linux game
15:36 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I play it on windows
15:36 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Mostly
15:36 < bridge_> <Voxel> same and i dont plan on changing that
15:36 < bridge_> <pilonpl> But i do have a setup on linux too
15:37 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Symlinks
15:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cuz its better OS
15:43 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Obviously
15:43 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Especially for illegal stuff
15:43 < bridge_> <pilonpl> When fbi is trying to find you
15:44 < bridge_> <Voxel> wrong
15:44 < bridge_> <Voxel> windows best
15:46 < bridge_> <pilonpl> On windows you don't need huge flatpaks at least
15:47 < bridge_> <Voxel> ngl i dont understand linux's views on privacy
15:47 < bridge_> <Voxel> if your computer has an intetnet connection you are most likely being watched and documented anyways
15:48 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> When its file explorer 'll support tabs and split view?
15:49 < bridge_> <Voxel> dont care about that
15:49 < bridge_> <Voxel> my machine is perfect :gigachad:
15:49 < bridge_> <Voxel> im not gonna stop boasting about it
15:56 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> Tens years later Windows supports clipboard history and it can capture a part of the screen. How many years would it take to properly support Unicode? 
15:56 < bridge_> <kaffeine0> It is a silly crappy bloated poorly designed software, missing many features needed for comfort work. The standard/builtin software is unusable.
15:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> @_voxeldoesart did u see Ms plans to add more ai to windows
15:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Is that a dilemma for u?
15:58 < bridge_> <Voxel> the typer
15:58 < bridge_> <Voxel> on windows 11 yes
15:58 < bridge_> <Voxel> not windows 10
15:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> voxel is simply in denial, trying to feel like a anti linux chad or smth
15:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its p funny
15:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> And yet he never paid for the os xdd
15:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> whats there to understand, native programs dont have telemetry, on windows, they do, and send data to microsoft, the web is another thing, because its out of control to the OS
15:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but u refuse logical arguments at this point anyway
16:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u give such an insane amount of trust to a company by using windows
16:00 < bridge_> <learath2> I'm fairly sure no one remotely cool ever used linux
16:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i would store nudes in linux and not windows
16:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :BASED:
16:01 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I made my component so how do i add it to gameclient.cpp? I dont understand where all these m_ variables came from lol
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> read the blog
16:01 < bridge_> <learath2> Check gameclient.h
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://edgarluque.com/blog/code-conventions-in-ddnet/
16:01 < bridge_> <learath2> It should be part of the declaration of CGameClient nowadays
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> he doesnt know c++
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> doing blind stuff
16:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> fun for em, annoying for me
16:02 < bridge_> <learath2> Ok, then you pick up a C++ book
16:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dont like teaching blind like this, its like nothing gets through
16:02 < bridge_> <pilonpl> C++ is worse C
16:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i have these books dusting

16:03 < bridge_> <Voxel> sorry i cant hear you guys over me doing my job
16:03 < bridge_> <learath2> Ok cool windows guy
16:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> If earth is dieing and the only spaceship available uses Linux , what would u do?
16:04 < bridge_> <Voxel> kill myse
16:04 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I know these conventions lol
16:05 < bridge_> <Voxel> and why should i care? is the fbi going to deliver me pizza?
16:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the convention tells u the m_
16:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so u clearly dont know them :p
16:06 < bridge_> <Voxel> because i know windows produces banger content daily :greenthing:
16:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no, microsoft is gonna use the data to phisocologically profile u, maybe they also get hacker and someone uses ur private info to extort u
16:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u never know
16:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u also save ur logins and cookies locally
16:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> did u login to a bank website recently?
16:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> @_voxeldoesart u American right? Lot of Americans don't trust the state and prefer private companies etc. Does that apply to u too?
16:08 < bridge_> <pilonpl> It means it's a class member or something
16:08 < bridge_> <nouaa> lot of americans are retarded :pepeW:
16:08 < bridge_> <nouaa> @_voxeldoesart are you retarded too?
16:09 < bridge_> <learath2> If they don't know C++, the definition we have for `m_` won't make much sense either. Member has a very specific meaning
16:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ˜‚
16:09 < bridge_> <learath2> You can't use the r word anymore

16:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xddd
16:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> No rust? Bad buys
16:10 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Okkkk, i know, these variables are declared in gameclient.h Which makes sense i suppose
16:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> true i need some
16:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> @heinrich5991 is this word allowed
16:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Lmao
16:11 < bridge_> <nouaa> shhhh
16:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Big ban(g)
16:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> imagine being so mad about someone using windows you slur at them
16:11 < bridge_> <nouaa> Wait what
16:11 < bridge_> <nouaa> We cool man
16:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Cyber Mobbing until u use Linux
16:12 < bridge_> <nouaa> Didn't mean to hurt ur feelings :bruh:
16:13 < bridge_> <Voxel> cope
16:13 < bridge_> <Voxel> seethe
16:13 < bridge_> <learath2> It is actually considered a slur nowadays. So don't use it anymore. It's not 2011 anymore. I learned you can't even call yourself that anymore
16:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Redarded
16:14 < bridge_> <nouaa> regarded
16:15 < bridge_> <nouaa> Yea alright, sounds kinda dumb to me
16:17 < bridge_> <nouaa> now it's called r-word and r-slur
16:18 < bridge_> <nouaa> The world is going mad
16:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> just call urself "less capacited"
16:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or that  u need special needs
16:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :justatest:
16:19 < bridge_> <learath2> I call myself brain damaged nowadays, hopefully that one is fine

16:26 < bridge_> <Voxel> yeah
16:26 < bridge_> <Voxel> its called trolling
16:26 < bridge_> <Voxel> https://youtu.be/PXqcHi2fkXI
16:35 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Undefined reference to 'vtable for CMyMod'
16:35 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Pog
16:40 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> duckduckgo gives me results for that error
16:46 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I guess adding a component is harder than i thought
16:48 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I wonder how that's even possible
16:48 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I copied my component from other components
16:48 < bridge_> <pilonpl> So how could it possibly be wrong?
16:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the program doesnt lie
16:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> have you entered the error into your favorite search engine?
16:52 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Yes and i am trying to fix this issue
16:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but it doesn't work?
16:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> have you added your_component.cpp to CMakeLists.txt?
16:57 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Now it works
16:57 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Omg
16:58 < bridge_> <pilonpl> ~~Have i mentioned i have no idea how cmake works?~~
17:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Well our cmake file is really huge. So not very easy to understand everything.
17:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> 
17:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> But basically it's such an extra layer to tell the compiler what to do
17:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> another win for rust, doesnt require cmake
17:00 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Rust compiler is actually very useful
17:01 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Anyways, finally my mod works
17:02 < bridge_> <pilonpl> And it print hello WORLD
17:02 < bridge_> <pilonpl> On console init
17:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> Mod finished
17:02 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Pretty cool
17:02 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Now i want it to press right on every tick
17:05 < bridge_> <pilonpl> There is +right command
17:05 < bridge_> <pilonpl> But it doesn't seem to work
17:06 < bridge_> <solayer> what source code editor do you use?
17:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> + commands aren't directly commands
17:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar âœª> More like actions
17:06 < bridge_> <solayer> what source code editor do you all use?
17:07 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Vscode
17:07 < bridge_> <solayer> ok
17:07 < bridge_> <pilonpl> it only works with bind i suppose
17:08 < bridge_> <solayer> how do you earn the testing role?
17:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> testing lot of maps i guess
17:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> #questions is better place
17:53 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Interesting
17:53 < bridge_> <pilonpl> OnDummyDisconnect doesn't seem to work
17:54 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I wonder what i have done wrong this time lol
17:54 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Maybe override was important actually
17:54 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Whatever it does
18:02 < bridge_> <pilonpl> OnRender does work
18:02 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Lol
18:03 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Ok i guess i did something wrong
18:04 < bridge_> <pilonpl> But i don't know how to run a command
18:04 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I found this CGameConsole class
18:33 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I managed to crash the game
18:35 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I just wanted to send emotes
18:56 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> when DDnet rewritten in Rust
19:05 < bridge_> <Voxel> never
19:05 < bridge_> <Voxel> wait no i already trolled today
19:06 < bridge_> <Voxel> tbh if ddnet converted into rust i wouldnt know how different itd be to the code now
19:06 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> ddnet rust 2031 confirmed
19:07 < bridge_> <Voxel> tbh i learned c++ by digging through c++ code
19:07 < bridge_> <Voxel> if ddnet was 100% rust id probably do the same
19:08 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i learned a lot with ddnet's source, after playing the game for 12+ years its easy to understand how stuff works, and makes understanding the code behind it easier aswell
19:08 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> so yeah i agree
19:09 < bridge_> <Voxel> there arent that many rust projects that are interesting to dig into
19:11 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i never really looked into rust myself tbh xD
19:11 < bridge_> <Voxel> i almost did but starting my own projects are a pain
19:12 < bridge_> <Voxel> its easier to edit already established code
19:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lol fake
19:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://veloren.net/
19:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> made in rust
19:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://book.veloren.net/contributors/introduction.html
19:22 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> oh is it? i played it before
19:22 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> cool
19:23 < bridge_> <Voxel> # Welcome to Veloren!
19:23 < bridge_> <Voxel> Veloren is a multiplayer voxel
19:23 < bridge_> <Voxel> im interested
19:35 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Cube world?
19:36 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Btw why does everyone confuse voxels with cubes?
19:38 < bridge_> <pilonpl> If voxels are supposed to be 3d pixels
19:38 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Then they can't have textures on top of them
19:39 < bridge_> <pilonpl> A pixel can only have one color (colour if you prefer worse English)
19:39 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Voxels should work the same way
20:03 < bridge_> <cauldron1> Do you play minetest?
20:06 < bridge_> <cauldron1> There is a mod that makes it like minecraft https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/
20:06 < bridge_> <cauldron1> Without it itâ€˜s very basic
20:14 < bridge_> <cauldron1> Are they, thatâ€˜s interesting. Imagine a voxel engine that is made of one color cubes and each cube is made of cubes too.
20:14 < bridge_> <pilonpl> Minetest is an engine, not a game so it makes sense
20:58 < bridge_> <Voxel> if i was a color id be a nice blueish purple
20:59 < bridge_> <pilonpl> I really like blueish purple actually

23:22 < bridge_> <getsaamusic> guys is there a ddnet modding framework?
23:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no, unfortunately not really
23:48 < bridge_> <deen> The best I know is https://github.com/teemods/ddnet-skeleton
23:59 < bridge_> <robyt3> @deen #6980 should also be added to version 17.2
23:59 < bridge_> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6980
