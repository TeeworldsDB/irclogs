05:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> 600mb memory usage on idle terminal :lol:
05:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> > a terminal for a more modern age
05:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> if modern age means RAMonsters like this electron+typescript abomination then see ya
06:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> headbot cant even load it on his old computer
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> can i donate with BNB or USDT?) @deen
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We used to take btc once upon a time
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Good times
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use alacritty, made in rust and gpu accelerated
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 👀
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Can't just let @TsFreddie  pay for CHN all the time
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> 👀
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4stx3v22SmQ
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @deen instead let him pay brazil🤡 :kek: :troll:
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> :pepeH:
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why is hosting so expensive in brazil?
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do brazillian hosters use ip over avian carriers?
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ig Ip ov ac would be less expensive
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> not more
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> latest rfc april fool was funny too
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's more expensive to feed the pigeons and buy new ones to compensate for losses
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> 🙄
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because the cheap vpses sucked, so we have a dedi now
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we could try vps again?
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> dedinside
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> troll
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> today advent reminded me of conway game of life
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> second part was a freebie
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://gist.github.com/edg-l/d443e9ffff286d74703b4a681adb8968>
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i even added color
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which nutjob looked at a laplace transform and thought to themselves "ah yes this insane algebraic equation is easier to solve than what I originally had"
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, it does simplify differential equations
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chīmupurei> Hello Learath2. How do you do? 🙂
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes because \frac{s^2+2s+3}{(s^2+2s+2)(s^2+2s+5)} is so much simpler to work with. Just the partial fraction decomp there is pain 😄
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> imo yes ^^
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know I promised to check out your ebuild but I haven’t had time to even look myself in the mirror 😛
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> fraction decomp is a linear system to solve, so yes much easier
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok, how? I have never seen anyone think partial fraction decompositions are simple. This one will require solving a system of linear equations with 4 variables
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’d take undetermined coefficients of over algebra any day ngl
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's what i remember from maths class is that fraction decomp is a linear system
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> if you have known value of the function, you can fill in the blanks if there are more variables than equations
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> wtf
