10:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> time to update to 0.7 bois
10:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> we already decided we don't have the dev time for this
10:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> mimimi
10:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> vanilla race support is kinda cool.
10:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 do you know any feature we used a ugly hack for that could be implemented in vanilla?
10:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> kinda 10 years late imho, but cool also works
10:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> we don't use many ugly hacks anymore, after protocol extensions
10:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> We update in ten years xd
10:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there has to be something that we can propose now to make ddrace support for 0.7 better
10:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nothing they would add would be of much use
10:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe a higher fidelity timer for the race people
10:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Imagine a power outage in 2019...
10:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Hm i mean that can be moved to a custom client. I mean more stuff that was implemented hacky in ddnet server and client to keep vanilla compability.
10:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> power outage? hm
10:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> are you runnign with battery rn? xd
10:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon we dont have much of those hacky stuff anymore
10:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> aight
10:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Proper 64p support they already added
10:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe the extrainfo in the projectiles
10:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But I dont really think they'd add that either
10:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Either way, we just dont spend enough time on development to have the time to port to 0.7
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon please stop
14:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o mariadb 10.4 is out
14:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unix socket auth
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> is there any way how to play/make teeworlds on phone?
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> yeah, on google play, but its dead, unoptimised and unplayable
19:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> ddnet.tw/downloads 9.3.1 android apk
19:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> its not good but it works
19:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> u mean
19:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <archimede67> https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-9.3.1.apk
20:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> u
20:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> unplayable
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> bad controlls, and of course lagging, plus no 21:9 support, the google play has one
20:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> okay so i cant, F
20:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there was a ios app once it run super smooth and playable on my ipad air and iphone5 even with mobile data fine ping hehe
20:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> no sorry apple poopoo heads :f4: :f4: :f4:
20:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but without mouse and keyboard ur kinda fucked
20:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> thats true shit
20:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but android supports those devices huh?
20:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> yes
20:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> but still, 10 fps
20:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bxlxr.> its kinda locked or really bad
20:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <฿ӾⱠӾⱤ> this is shitty, fuck it
