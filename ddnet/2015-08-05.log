00:19 <@deen> o_be_one: yeah, if you can narrow down the ip block and the time when it's pressed
00:30 < o_be_one> oh shit
00:30 < o_be_one> thats how donw got ddosed by marcella, deen -_-
00:31 < o_be_one> and its problem since marcella is a cheater, and donw a really fair and good player
01:35 <@deen> o_be_one: they also find out ips through skype
01:35 <@deen> just knowing someone's skype name is apparently enough to get their ip
04:27 < Sadale> Anyone still have the source code/command list/tuning list/entites.png of [N]Race?
10:48 < Learath2> how do people even hammerfly with dummies ? :P
11:30 < Sadale> With ddnet client, you can make the dummy hammar once a while
14:19 < uchar> hi, background in X-Ray have a task on github? i can't found it for...
14:25 <@deen> uchar: x-ray?
14:25 <@deen> ah, entities

14:29 < uchar> bb
14:43 < quak> Hello
14:44 < quak> I can compile the normal TW-Client using bam, but not ddnet
14:44 < quak> Can someone help?
14:44 < quak> [1/1] #1 link DDNet /usr/bin/ld: other/curl/linux/lib32/libcrypto.a(dso_dlfcn.o): undefined reference to symbol 'dlopen@@GLIBC_2.1' /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libdl.so: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status bam: 'DDNet' error 256 bam: error: a build step failed
14:49 < laxadedi> quak: what system are you running on ?
14:54 < Chairn> !twp Chairn
14:54 < Nimda> Chairn is currently playing Elo-Hell on server : DDNet GER - DDmaX [DDraceNetwork].
15:06 < quak> oops
15:06 < quak> Linux Mint x86
15:06 < quak> @laxadedi
15:07 < laxadedi> Mint ?
15:07 < quak> ubuntu based thingy
15:07 < laxadedi> Well
15:07 < quak> or are you kidding me? :D
15:07 < laxadedi> If they changed their libc
15:08 < quak> well
15:08 < laxadedi> then you'll have to deal with that yourself
15:08 < laxadedi> bam is saying he can't find dlopen inside your libc
15:08 < quak> which package would you have to install?
15:08 < laxadedi> latest libc I guess
15:08 < laxadedi> http://linux.die.net/man/3/dlopen
15:09 < laxadedi> I am pretty sure no one will be able to help you on this
15:10 < laxadedi> have you tried running a binary from ddnet.tw ?
15:10 < quak> yeah
15:10 < quak> binary works
15:11 < quak> but that's not what I want
15:11 < quak> ;)
15:11 < laxadedi> that's either bam who is having trouble finding out about your system
15:11 < quak> there is a bam.lua in the ddnet-master.zip
15:11 < laxadedi> or the linker failing to find a required lib
15:11 < quak> should I use this or the bam from teeworlds?
15:11 < laxadedi> the bam included ofc
15:11 < quak> well
15:12 < quak> that doesn't work at all
15:12 < quak> how to run the bam.lua?
15:12 < laxadedi> just ./bam inside the folder
15:12 < laxadedi> if there is a bam.lua, it'll read this configuration file
15:12 < laxadedi> not even sure you can run bam if there is not bam.lua
15:13 < quak> looool
15:13 < quak> wait a minute
15:13 < quak> Well
15:13 < quak> Not sure yet
15:13 < quak> why does it try to compile although pressing [CTRL]+C btw?
15:15 < laxadedi> Don't understand what you mean
15:15 < laxadedi> I am no expert at bam either
15:16 < laxadedi> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything
15:16 < laxadedi> and ddnet has it's own requirements as well
15:16 < laxadedi> you should make sure you got everything before trying to compile again
15:18 < quak> well
15:18 < quak> even using bam.lua makes it fail
15:18 < quak> and I think i have the requirements
15:18 < laxadedi> I think isn't good enough
15:18 < laxadedi> you need to be sure
15:20 < laxadedi> https://github.com/def-/ddnet
15:20 < laxadedi> There is a paragraph : Building
15:20 < quak> wait
15:20 < quak> already read this
15:20 < quak> but have to try something
15:21 < quak> aaand....
15:21 < quak> failed.
15:22 < laxadedi> Just my personal opinion, but, you shouldn't run a linux that you can't Handle. You should run classic Ubuntu, you should have no problem compiling tw on Ubuntu at least.
15:27 < quak> I have already tried it on Ubuntu months ago...
15:27 < quak> and Mint IS basically ubuntu
15:27 < quak> btw bam is done
15:27 < laxadedi> it's mint or ubuntu
15:27 < quak> I've managed it with using bundled and removing config.lua
15:28 < laxadedi> bam is done ?
15:28 < quak> yeah
15:28 < quak> got it to work
15:28 < quak> ;)
15:28 < quak> I've just compiled ddnet
15:28 < quak> Let's code a bot *jk*
15:28 < laxadedi> Well, next time, read the doc before asking
15:29 < quak> laxadedi: nope. I've read the doc.
15:29 < quak> I just didn't believe the doc :P
15:29 < quak> I've also googled about the error.
15:29 < laxadedi> You come to ask to the people who wrote the doc ?
15:29 < laxadedi> seems smart to me
15:29 < laxadedi> doc you don't even trust
15:29 < quak> Well
15:30 < quak> I didn't expect trying THIS could help.
15:30 < quak> And then I've done.
15:30 < laxadedi> ...
15:30 < laxadedi> Why dumb people are running linux nowadays
15:30 < quak> btw I've solved it with the doc, not with you
15:30 < laxadedi> congratz
15:30 < quak> but thanks for trying to help me too ;)
15:30 < laxadedi> after asking cause you didn't wanted to read the doc
15:30 < quak> I don't feel guilty.
15:30 < quak> At the time of ASKING I'Ve already read the doc
15:31 < laxadedi> stop running linux
15:31 < quak> or do you think I try to compile anything without reading about dependencies?
15:31 < quak> @laxadedi I don't get your point, sry.
15:31 < quak> bb and have a nice day.
15:31 < quak> And if you don't want to help, then don't answer at all.
15:31 < quak> I mean that's kinda like what IRC is for.
15:32 < quak> Asking for help, might getting help
15:32 < laxadedi> IRC is a chat
15:32 < laxadedi> not a helpdesk chan
15:32 < quak> Well
15:32 < quak> and ppl chatter to help themselves with various problems. Such as lacking entertainment but also how to compile something. That's my opinion
15:33 < quak> But I don't want to eat my and your time with a senseless discussion

15:35 < laxadedi> Am I the only one to think that guy was retarded ?
15:43 <@deen> didn't read what he wrote
15:43 <@deen> but the bug he encountered is probably this one: 
15:43 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/271
15:44 <@deen> so easy to fix
15:44 < laxadedi> indeed, seems like that
15:45 <@deen> not sure why you say stuff like "15:30 < laxadedi> Why dumb people are running linux nowadays"
15:46 < laxadedi> The guy was pissing me off, I lost 10 minutes cause he wouldn't trust the documentation of ddnet
15:46 < laxadedi> then he finally does it, and miracle, it does indeed solve the problem
15:46 <@deen> well, the documentation is wrong, as described by the issue
15:46 < laxadedi> that solved is issue ^^
15:47 < laxadedi> |his
15:47 < laxadedi> *his
15:47 <@deen> we should rather solve problems and not tell people with problems that they're too stupid for linux
15:50 <@deen> even though I'm still not sure how the issue happens, hm
15:50 <@deen> i think my initial thought with ssl was wrong
15:51 <@deen> how did he solve it btw? installing libcurl and cleaning config.lua?
15:52 <@deen> it may be the order of libs on the command line with a specific old gcc version!
17:01 < Shiki> laxadedi: that was indeed quite rude
17:02 < Savander> hi guys
17:03 < Savander> (and ladies?)
17:04 < Chairn> hello
17:08 < fstd> 'guys' is gender-neutral these days
17:21 <@deen> if anyone can reproduce the dlopen@glibc issue, tell me please. i think it happens on ubuntu with libcurl not installed, but openssl installed

18:54 < o_be_one> hey just to let you know that my ping is better on V3ROYAL now
18:55 < o_be_one> got 105 ms like on my servers, instead of 140 to 160ms before, what you did deen ?
18:55 < laxa> deen: why not link to github readme or to make a how to to compile ddnet ?
18:55 < laxa> or maybe it's somewhere
18:58 < Savander> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=114981#p114981 How you like it?
19:54 <@deen> o_be_one: nothing i did
19:54 <@deen> laxa: link where? most people never compile
19:54 < laxa> most is not none
19:55 <@deen> so, link it where?
19:56 < Savander> on download page
19:56 <@deen> it's linked there as "DDNet Client & Server"
19:56 < Savander> or settings/command
19:58 < Chairn> maybe some kind of tutorial
19:58 < Chairn> but there's already one on teeworlds forum
19:58 < Savander> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything
19:58 < Savander> its enough i guess
19:59 < Savander> + readme on github

20:21  * uchar ... There is a whiff of elitism here.
20:24 <@deen> uchar: ?
20:24 < uchar> linux can't be used for normal used?
20:24 < uchar> users*
20:25 < uchar> if you use linux = super-mega-pro ??
20:26 <@deen> yeah
20:27 < uchar> xD
20:27 <@deen> i also found that weird^^
20:56  * uchar go to use Plan 9, Linux is for nubs :P
21:02 <@deen> and GER is down
21:02 <@deen> null-routed for 4 hours because of huge ddos attack
21:02 < Savander> why?
21:03 <@deen> "A very large DDoS attack against your IP address 95.172.92.151 overloaded our connection speed and/or our router's filtering capacity at your location a short while ago and caused location-wide problems. We were forced to null-route the IP address as an emergency response measure. This null-route will need to remain in place for at least 4 hours."
21:03 < Savander> Again ddoses
21:03 <@deen> looks like someone has a new botnet
21:03 <@deen> ddos is every day
21:03 <@deen> but not 100 gbit/s
21:03 < Savander> 100gbits?
21:04 <@deen> that was last time when they null-routed us, yes
21:04 < Savander> like OVH network bandwith in poland
21:04 <@deen> haven't asked how big it was today
21:04 < Savander> in germany they has 320gbit 
21:04 < Savander> 100gb is... really much
21:04 < Savander> Maybe it's because of
21:04 < Savander> new windows
21:04 < Savander> Torrents you know
21:04 <@deen> no :P
21:05 < Savander> why not? people downloading
21:05 < Savander> new systems
21:05 <@deen> what does that have to do with our server getting ddosed?
21:05 < Savander> botnet?
21:05 <@deen> i don't get it^^
21:05 < laxa> maybe some people made a new botnet with the recent vulnerability about font
21:05 < laxa> maybe that's what Savander is saying
21:06 < laxa> https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms15-078.aspx
21:06 < laxa> this CVE
21:06 < laxa> all windows were affected
21:10 <@deen> nfoservers only has a total of 20 gbit/s connectivity at frankfurt, so they have to filter out the attack before it even gets to frankfurt or their network is overloaded
21:12 < Savander> laxa,  that's what i meant
21:12 < Savander> i'm just too bad in english to explain it
21:14 < laxa> So much big vulnerabilities this last year
21:16 <@deen> meh, they don't want to give me details about the attack
21:16 <@deen> only that it was bigger than 20 gbit/s and they couldn't filter it
21:16 < Savander> :/
21:17 <@deen> 300 people were on GER at the time of attack
21:17 <@deen> oh, GER2 being attacked now
21:18 <@deen> well, there goes GER2
21:19 < Savander> I curious, what will happen later.. when teeworlds will be more popular
21:19 < Savander> more ddos?
21:19 <@deen> not necessarily
21:19 <@deen> from what i heard most games have much fewer ddos attacks than TW
21:19 <@deen> I think TW attracts script kiddies because it's open source and available for linux
21:19 < Savander> maybe
21:19 <@deen> and the block mod attracts even more attackers
21:19 < Savander> but then more people will know teeworlds
21:19 < Savander> more ddos kiddies
21:20 < Savander> so maybe more ddos
21:20 <@deen> because in block you do nothing and get bored, so you start ddosing
21:20 <@deen> great day today for playing on ddnet =/
21:21 <@deen> whole south america (brazil, chile) lag all day, GER down, GER2 ddos too
21:21 < Savander> bad weather?
21:21 < Savander> oh
21:21 <@deen> ^^
21:21 < Savander> yes it's bad weather
21:21 < Savander> hahaha
21:21 <@EastByte> well, block servers are still part of ddnet of course...
21:21 <@EastByte> and good evening
21:21 < Savander> hi :)
21:21 <@deen> EastByte: huh?
21:22 <@deen> surprisingly they didn't target the block server directly today on GER2
21:22 <@deen> instead they attacked the ictf server....
21:22 < Savander> woah?
21:22 < Savander> For fun
21:22 < Savander> iCTF is really... unpopular
21:23 < Savander> at this time
21:23 <@deen> it was popular before we were ddosed all the time...
21:23 < Savander> generally ictf is not popular now
21:24 <@deen> i think the real attackers are a very small group of maybe 4 people
21:24 < Savander> how was before? When block wasn't in ddnet?
21:25 <@deen> no attacks
21:25 <@deen> but i removed block for a few days or more and people still attacked
21:25 < Savander> it was when ddnet wasn't really popular
21:25 < Savander> ye?
21:25 <@deen> but all the ddosers I've seen play on block server
21:25 < Savander> "no attacks"
21:25 <@deen> yeah
21:25 <@deen> in the early early start
21:25 < Savander> meh.
21:26 < Savander> probably teeworlds should have
21:26 < Savander> 2 or more big "servers"
21:26 < Savander> You know, to stabilization of situation
21:26 <@deen> nope, don't understand
21:26 < Savander> can't explain
21:27 < Savander> just experience from other games
21:46 <@deen> oh, GER is back
21:46 <@deen> that wasn't 4 hours
21:46 < Savander> :D
21:47 <@deen> "at least 4 hours" - well, i'm not complaining^^
21:49 < Chairn> ddos on ger 2 as well :(
21:49 < uchar> nice ddos?
21:49 < uchar> :(
21:51 <@deen> and GER2 going down...
21:52 < Chairn> that's weird
21:52 < Chairn> chat is working, but save doesnt work ^^
21:53 <@deen> save needs a connection to the database server, which is not localhost for GER2
21:53 < Chairn> too bad :(
21:55 <@deen> regular ssdp attack on GER2 with hacked routers
21:56 < Chairn> ahahah, save worked like 5 mins after he got timeout, but with his savecode ^^
21:57 <@deen> yeah, server tries to connect to sql server for some time
21:59 <@deen> hi FreeBeer 
22:14 < FreeBeer> hey deen
22:15 < FreeBeer> ddos over?
22:15 < laxa> What do you think of services that send mail without TLS ?
22:15 <@deen> FreeBeer: seems so, yes
22:15 <@deen> but can continue at any time
22:15 <@deen> laxa: why?
22:16 < laxa> Well, I tried to switch my postfix SMTPD to TLS only
22:16 < laxa> so I don't receive some mails
22:16 < laxa> and that's bothering me
22:16 < FreeBeer> important mails?
22:16 < laxa> Well, when I am buying stuff, that's kinda of important
22:17 < laxa> Just wanna know if you have any opinion about shops sending plain text mails
22:18 < FreeBeer> thats plain stupid
22:18 < laxa> :D
22:18 < FreeBeer> with personal information in it?
22:18 <@deen> if you want to receive all emails, don't force TLS only, if you want a bit more security allow plain text as well
22:18 <@deen> ehm
22:18 < laxa> xD
22:18 <@deen> the other way around a bit^^
22:19 <@deen> i clearly can't multitask
22:20 < laxa> Well, I finally something working
22:21 < laxa> I allow plain text, but only allow TLS for auth
22:29 < FreeBeer> plain text mails suck
22:29 <@deen> FreeBeer: what's your name on ddnet btw?
22:29 < FreeBeer> just a simple mitm attack
22:29 < FreeBeer> i'm /dev/null
22:29 <@deen> ah! =)
22:29 < FreeBeer> you looked up my ip a few days ago
22:29 <@deen> i did?
22:29 < FreeBeer> tjeah
22:29 <@deen> i don't remember looking up any ips
22:30 <@deen> why would i do that?
22:30 < Chairn> FreeBeer: i need you :D
22:30 <@deen> (I do have several people faking me on DDNet currently)
22:30 < FreeBeer> because there was an unexpected login on the iMTG server
22:30 <@deen> FreeBeer: really can't remember that
22:30 <@deen> that wasn't me i think
22:31 <@deen> i don't think i've talked to you in the last weeks or months
22:39 < FreeBeer> you didnt talk to me
22:39 < FreeBeer> sven talked you into it
22:39 < FreeBeer> because an 'unknown' player got on the iMTG DDnet Testserver
22:40 < FreeBeer> 'Marethyu'
22:41 <@deen> nope, he didn't talk to me about that and i didn't look at any server logs on imtg server in the last months
22:41 <@deen> anyway, doesn't matter who lied or misunderstood^^
22:41 < FreeBeer> thats funny
22:42 <@deen> most problems in life are communication problems
22:43 < FreeBeer> doesnt matter anyways
