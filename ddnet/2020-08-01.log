00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think the token checking should take place here: https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/blob/95a6b85b37c4af3e02c9f9ccd7e8007fb6855af0/src/engine/shared/network_server.cpp#L194-L204
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> actually no, I don't quite understand
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, one problem is that you save information about a 0.6 client after they send you `NET_CTRLMSG_CONNECT`
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, i have it from the first packet on, i think
02:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but i also think i dont save the tokens correctly for 0.6, im not sure
02:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> also i would like to use the 0.7 m_Token variables too, but I tried it already,without success
02:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> one problem is that you save something about a 0.6 sendin a CONNECT message
02:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ddnet 0.6 does not save anything about such a connect message
02:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it only starts to save something about the connection after the ACCEPT
03:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont understand this part of the network correctly tbh
04:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> client sends CONNECT
04:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> server receives the CONNECT, responds with CONNECTACCEPT containing a token (does not save anything about the client at this point)
04:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> client receives CONNECTACCEPT with token, replies with ACCEPT containing the same token
04:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> server receives the ACCEPT with the token that allows the server to verify that the client indeed played back the correct token, let's the client connect (starts saving data about the client now)
05:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Gib strong swap
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 how could i integrate the 0.6 token to the 0.7 token system?
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I think it should be easier doing that then like i did - adding all of it and having 2 systems ...
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They aren't reaaaallly compatible
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You could maybe hack around the TokenManager so it can take care of both, but you'll end up with a very ugly TokenManager
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is there any way USA test servers can be fixed
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> they'
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ve been broken for a while
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u probably have to define broken if u want them fixed
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> can't vote maps
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :nouis:
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> will fix later today or tomorrow
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> fixed @louis
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> thanks! it works
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Synonym' | Val> it's certainly a stupid question but is it possible to make an Android app for mapping ?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ofc its possible
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Whis> not
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I finished back in time 2 this morning  but when i request ingame the 42 points are missing, the page shows them :feelsbadman:
19:38 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 regarding the generated code still :D so I get that this cmake function generates the code https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/c37dc660477566da5d54deacd3f8358acb850ecc/CMakeLists.txt#L1300
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> using python datasrc/compile.py and a redirect to file
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> but when i execute "cmake .." in ddnet repo src/game/generated is still empty 
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> only after executing make it is generated? So I was searching for the python call in the Makefile but did not find it
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> no1 in team on team only map but veto can cancel vote
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i don't understand how veto works
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> same
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> maybe kill protection of one player
22:00 <+Learath2> ChillerDragon: yep, it only gets generated during compile time
