00:57 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe the hook collision preview should render with weapon in hand
00:57 < bridge> <Ewan> holy shit LOL
00:57 < bridge> <Ewan> that's my first time forwarding a message ever
00:57 < bridge> <Ewan> you'd think they'd make it collapsed by default

06:44 < bridge> <3x1st_> nah cuz i cant render it on my pos
06:44 < bridge> <3x1st_> ;c
06:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What is Pos
06:45 < bridge> <3x1st_> on player position
06:45 < bridge> <3x1st_> player char position
06:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Can you show the code that sets it
06:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or even better link your repo
06:47 < bridge> <3x1st_> ```c++

06:48 < bridge> <3x1st_> 
06:48 < bridge> <3x1st_> ```
06:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> LGTM have you looked at how the other flags are rendered?
06:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Also which screen mapping are you in? World or screen?
06:49 < bridge> <3x1st_> screen
06:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It says CHud so I assume it’s not rendering at world coordinates
06:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea map it to world
06:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you want to draw in the world
06:51 < bridge> <3x1st_> i found only in hud flag render like this
06:51 < bridge> <3x1st_> in score hud
06:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But that’s not what you want
06:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That’s not in game that’s hud
06:51 < bridge> <3x1st_> huh
06:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You need to look at the other code or call the MapToWorld method thingy
06:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Well for example draw at 0,0 could mean top left of the map or top left of your screen. That’s why there are two draw modes.
06:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Does that make sense?
06:53 < bridge> <3x1st_> aa
06:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am on the phone I can’t send you the code you gotta search for the method your self
06:53 < bridge> <3x1st_> okey
06:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It takes a bunch of screen coordinates as argument and is called something MapScreenWorld whatever xd
06:55 < bridge> <3x1st_> RenderTools()->MapScreenToGroup() <- this method fix it how i think
06:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea that looks good
06:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or you just move your code to where the in game flags are rendered
06:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Maybe in players.cpp
07:07 < bridge> <woidless> What is this?

12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you mean your game engine project which i ask you about all the time?
12:57 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I guess
12:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I'm taking it seriously now, with proper organizing and making a base for other people to build upon
12:58 < bridge> <woidless> chiller\
12:58 < bridge> <woidless> ho
12:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: are you here?
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ijoad
12:59 < bridge> <woidless> You can make it possible to redirect all actions on the server to a telegram bot or discord bot
13:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> he's only here for me
13:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :gigachad:
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what are actions

13:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sure i can add that
13:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not today
13:02 < bridge> <woidless> go tomorrow pls?
13:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if i dont forget
13:02 < bridge> <woidless> ok
13:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i will do discord bcs i dont know telegram is that oke?
13:14 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I am using it currently. Although I am not rustacean. (booting up pc)
13:17 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> It's ok. It does it job although until I got used to it I was constantly opening the [keymap](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html) to search for things
13:17 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> It's ok as in it's good but has some issues/problems
13:22 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> The first that comes to mind is that there isn't a way to map the key I pressed (α ξ κ) to the corresponding english (a j k)
13:22 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> In my previous editor ( [vis](https://github.com/martanne/vis) ) I did it like this
13:22 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ```    cmd('langmap ΑΒΨΔΕΦΓΗΙΞΚΛΜΝΟΠΡΣΤΘΩ-ΧΥΖαβψδεφγηιξκλμνοπρστθωςχυζ'
13:22 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7>             .. ' ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnoprstuvwxyz')```
13:22 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> The first issue that comes to mind is that there isn't a way to map the key I pressed (α ξ κ) to the corresponding english (a j k)
13:22 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> In my previous editor ( [vis](https://github.com/martanne/vis) ) I did it like this
13:22 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ```    cmd('langmap ΑΒΨΔΕΦΓΗΙΞΚΛΜΝΟΠΡΣΤΘΩ-ΧΥΖαβψδεφγηιξκλμνοπρστθωςχυζ'
13:22 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7>             .. ' ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnoprstuvwxyz')```
13:22 < bridge> <zhn> wow
13:24 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> And when I tried to manually set each greek letter to do the same as the english letter I ran into problems, mainly because "`(σ ς)`" capitalized became the same "`(Σ Σ)`" so helix thought it was the same key. So I kinda abandon making the mapping
13:26 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Another "problem" is that it's hasn't client-server architecture as I thought it would but I didn't really mind since `vis` didn't either
13:26 < bridge> <zhn> did you file an issue? sounds like a ridiculous problem
13:28 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> the last one that is in my mind rn, is that you can't perform actions (some?) on multiple cursors which is annoying
13:28 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> (it has mutliple cursors but sometimes they have missing features/can't do certain things you should)
13:36 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> For example (in progress making vid...)
13:41 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I didn't :justatest:
13:41 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I don't really remember if it was discussed though.
13:42 < bridge> <woidless> Ok
13:42 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1302976326311088220/search_on_multiple_cursors.mp4?ex=672a12c4&is=6728c144&hm=0652439d0763b5ed6895143dc15295193e8c10860b9863361ad4baea8b056d76&
13:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless nvm im done today xd
13:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u got a discord webhook? @woidless 
13:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKksxz2Gdnc
13:46 < ws-client> ChillerDragon: uwu from lan server axaxax
13:47 < ws-client> ChillerDragon: @woidless u afk?
13:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> being able to setup discord webhooks for ddnet#developer is quite funny xd
13:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1730724443.png
13:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I select everything inside the function (`mif`) and then I select (`s`) with regex `awful\.key\(` the `awful.key` so I have multiple cursors now. But when I search (`/`) it only searches on one cursor.
13:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> So I can't do 'select `awful.key` then search `function` add new line etc' because it only works on one cursor.
13:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I remeber I had looked it up/researched it but I didn't find useful results
13:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well in case we miss each other the new config is ``sv_chat_discord_webhook`` and the value is your full webhook url @woidless 
13:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> The good stuff is that it's good (xD). It has mutliple cursors, language server, jump to functions and stuff, highlight (ig that's a given), mouse support, submenus and generally a good workflow.
13:51 < bridge> <woidless> What
13:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat what
13:52 < bridge> <woidless> Is it fashionable step by step ?
13:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i gave you all the steps where are you stuck?
13:52 < bridge> <woidless> I just came in, I'm going to read everything now
13:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKksxz2Gdnc then add ``sv_chat_discord_webhook `` with the actual url as argument to your config
13:53 < bridge> <woidless> Should I create my own WebHoook server for it now?
13:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> to which discord channel do you want to send it?
13:54 < bridge> <woidless> first, I need to create my own server
13:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oke
13:54 < bridge> <zhn> why did you ask chiller to make his bridge in first xd
13:56 < bridge> <woidless> https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1302979649365606470/e9Xhjy75smDhBoIYNgSiEiwYlcHchZp10IzO90mxNJp6AwU7f1Qo2sWsnt56THISjTam

13:56 < bridge> <woidless> #simcr name channel
13:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats like a password
13:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you got to set it up not me 
13:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you need to add it to your config
13:57 < bridge> <woidless> this?
13:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you should revert that webhook before learath sends illegal messages on your server and gets you swatted
13:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes this
13:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``sv_chat_discord_webhook "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1302979649365606470/e9Xhjy75smDhBoIYNgSiEiwYlcHchZp10IzO90mxNJp6AwU7f1Qo2sWsnt56THISjTam"``
13:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but create a new webhook and dont share it
13:58 < bridge> <woidless> ok
13:59 < bridge> <woidless> maybe git pull
13:59 < bridge> <woidless> make
13:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
13:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you pro
13:59 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> The good stuff is that it's good (xD). It has mutliple cursors, language server, jump to functions and stuff, highlight (ig that's a given), mouse support, submenus and generally a good workflow.
13:59 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 
13:59 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> edit: I am using it currently since May I think. Maybe if I find a good server/client architecture text editor I'll switch but for now I am happy with helix :).
13:59 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> P.S. I kinda have stopped programming although I do code sometimes so maybe there are issues or features I missed to mention.
14:00 < bridge> <woidless> i need to restart this?

14:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet++ is full of bugs and if someone exploits the game server you dont want them to be linux admin
14:06 < bridge> <milkeeycat> my debian doesn't have `killall`
14:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat maybe it came with gnome pro
14:07 < bridge> <woidless> .

14:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you are really rude
14:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> well pkill works
14:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> gentoo ftw
14:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this reminds me of the good old js chillerbot linux times in this channel 
14:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but i'd say it's solid `FizzBuzzOutputGenerationContextVisitorFactory` out of 10
14:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> posting command and getting responses
14:10 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1302983347844153356/image.png?ex=672a194e&is=6728c7ce&hm=64d9bc47aff5471256ecc745f17747220b2b0986e178e2ee53bf8cb7b43de39a&
14:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless if learato sends you a command to run on your server dont run it

14:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :lol:
14:11 < bridge> <woidless> I have 4 servers with different configs, won’t it hurt?
14:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no its fine
14:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can have them all send to differnet channels
14:11 < bridge> <woidless> what if I specify a different webhook for each config?
14:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I use `kill` all the time :p
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hacker catto
14:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u know the pid?
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> tbh i also use pgrep -f and then kill
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or ``ps aux | fzf``
14:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> `$(pidof program)` :justatest:
14:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats literally pkill
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd

14:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok!
14:22 < bridge> <woidless> all work thx
14:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pro
14:23 < bridge> <woidless> Somewhere a Jupstar is happy, whom I stopped pressuring with my questions
14:25 < bridge> <woidless> Is it possible that I could write on behalf of the server through messages in discord?
14:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oof
14:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> that requires a discord bot i think i cant do that i dont have discord
14:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/jxsl13/TeeworldsEconDiscordModerationBot
14:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this might work
14:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 help
14:28 < bridge> <woidless> And you can create a command for TestDDRace that will completely make me invisible, that is, it will hide me in the tab, and I will not be visible to others. For rcon
14:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hmm maybe im not too big of a fan of admin cheats
14:30 < bridge> <woidless> <ChillerDragon> hmm maybe im not too big of a fan of admin cheats
14:30 < bridge> <woidless> oh
14:30 < bridge> <woidless> i translate this
14:30 < bridge> <woidless> It’s just that such trolling can be implemented with this
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok done @woidless you can now use the rcon command ``hide_player`` followed by the client id to hide a player
14:44 < bridge> <woidless> You're a hero
14:45 < bridge> <woidless> I need to git pull && make?
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
14:45 < bridge> <woidless> Is it possible to do without restarting the server?
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
14:46 < bridge> <woidless> Then I'll do it later.
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok
14:46 < bridge> <woidless> by the way, there is an error in the destroylaser command
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh boy there are so many errors xd
14:46 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1302992467892895744/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_0bc8d0ad-4b10-44ee-b76e-ab3fe9a37a9b.jpg?ex=672a21cc&is=6728d04c&hm=891bc46260255f18c459f9595ea16e7909a283d44e04ce4571d67ec50c314346&
14:46 < bridge> <woidless> Its normal
14:47 < bridge> <woidless> Where client id?
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``status``
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> destroylaser needs an id as argument same as ``hide_player``
14:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so for example ``destroylaser 0``
14:47 < bridge> <woidless> I know the client id of people , I say even if there is nothing to enter it here
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat
14:48 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1302992941538873404/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_3d210ae4-628d-4efc-b06c-a1268193c0bd.jpg?ex=672a223d&is=6728d0bd&hm=4c909a431b28251b3c77afedfbfe9bf72a28bb84a5f200640c08ccf1ed4f6f39&
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah its probably some1 doing /destroylaser in chat
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or idk
14:49 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1302993162058596443/rn_image_picker_lib_temp_d13f1fe7-cbdc-4968-8333-92965da846f1.jpg?ex=672a2272&is=6728d0f2&hm=fbaede96dde63ea00fd6733747eda220d82604f8caa4af2861ddbe815a4bd3ba&
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you run ``destroylaser 0`` player with client id gets destroy laser but that weapon is probably super bugged i dont even remember what it should do
14:49 < bridge> <sollybunny> killall?
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> solly
14:50 < bridge> <sollybunny> hello
14:50 < bridge> <sollybunny> that was an instant ... "response"
14:50 < bridge> <sollybunny> tells u whether u actually killed something or not
14:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i checked the code destroylaser does absolutely nothing xd
14:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :poggers2:
15:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> Damn helix is a really good text editor :cat_whaaa: 
15:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
15:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> Sane defaults, easy to use if you're at least somewhat familiar with vim motions, the config is written in toml and overall a great experience
15:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
15:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> 11/10 would recommend
15:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
15:20 < bridge> <meloƞ> (Even tho I really miss my oily vim so I still use that to manage file dirs :kek:
15:25 < bridge> <jxsl13> should also work with ddnet based servers, except for a lot of commands relying on logs to properly work across map changes
15:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> usernames are probably broken
15:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> for non zCatch
15:31 < bridge> <woidless> chilller
15:31 < bridge> <woidless> dradon
15:31 < bridge> <woidless> You can do the command /duel

15:34 < bridge> <woidless> And please, on this map, make a zone for these duels on the multi-sim playground and a zone for the block tournament and make everything work, I ask you
15:35 < bridge> <zhn> i want :justatest:
15:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless what should /duel do? also i told you place the game tile 131 for block tournament arena spawns
15:46 < bridge> <woidless> I can't, I don't know how to use the editor
15:46 < bridge> <woidless> Now I’ll show you what I mean by /duel
15:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> press ctrl+shift+e to open the editor
15:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> click on the Settings on the top then select "Show Info" "Dec"
15:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then click on "Game" in the left menu not on "#1 Game"
15:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then press space
15:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> use the mouse and left click once on 131
15:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> use the arrow keys to navigate the map to the arena
15:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> click with the mouse where you want the spawns
15:49 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1303008190895755325/image.png?ex=672a3071&is=6728def1&hm=389a57cbca9d3dfbd6a3e4b56f5294eaff56252e44bb249a4c3ad6a7bc094288&
15:49 < bridge> <woidless> where game

15:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> now hold space
15:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> select 131
15:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this is the game layer you have it already selected 
15:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1730731788.png
15:50 < bridge> <woidless> over
15:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> scroll to zoom in
15:51 < bridge> <woidless> how to move on the map?
15:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> put your mouse on the map and use arrow keys
15:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <^v>
15:51 < bridge> <woidless> Do I need to build a block tournament zone right now?
15:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or was it wasd i forgot xd
15:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah no its W, A, S, D to navigate
15:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can also click drag to move but thats harder to explain
15:52 < bridge> <woidless> Do I need to build a block tournament zone right now?
15:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just place tile 131 where you want the tournament area
15:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its just a spawn tile
15:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you dont have a arena already?
15:53 < bridge> <woidless> ye
15:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> then you need to make one for that you need to learn the editor better or hire a mapper
15:53 < bridge> <woidless> By the way, when teleporting to a block tournament zone, if there are people there, will they be visible to the participants?
15:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
15:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it should be a area that is not reachable from the spawn
15:54 < bridge> <woidless> And I know where to place it, but there are already people there, can I copy this zone in the editor and paste it somewhere else?
15:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
15:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> select the layer on the left then drag your mouse on the tiles with left click to select a area
15:55 < bridge> <woidless> I want to copy this
15:56 < bridge> <woidless> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1303009981146071060/image.png?ex=672a321c&is=6728e09c&hm=3234c562faa8554d7b1992044eeb7d7bc0261015b6cb82cc7068ac80b1627895&

17:06 < bridge> <Ewan> i love fish
17:06 < bridge> <Ewan> i always just used it in my interactive terminals & used bash for everything else
17:07 < bridge> <Ewan> no idea why
17:07 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s beastly for scripting
18:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> does anyone know how to fix cursor in ddnet, it's not moving
19:14 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon, please complete these tasks tomorrow.
19:14 < bridge> <woidless> 1. Make the camera follow me when I'm invisible
19:14 < bridge> <woidless> 2. Make a full translation into Russian , everything related to the block tournament , stats , teams /register , /login
19:14 < bridge> <woidless> 3. Make sure that an unlimited number of people can participate in the block tournament, and the reward for winning increases proportionally
19:16 < bridge> <totar> <a:HUH:1178720004980605089>
19:18 < bridge> <meloƞ> Chillerdragon: - time to stop helping people

19:22 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
19:48 < bridge> <diariesvexar> I think Chillerdragon will transform to Aggressivedragon in this week by that orders 😄
20:14 < bridge> <thenofis> How can I check if tee has been seen in the camera/viewability area?
20:15 < bridge> <kebscs> `Snap.m_aCharacters[i].m_Active`
20:15 < bridge> <kebscs> means the tee is rendered
20:15 < bridge> <kebscs> which is on screen or a bit off it
20:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> 4. send all your money to jxsl13
20:40 < bridge> <thenofis> This does not work, the players that are not visible on the camera have values of 1
20:40 < bridge> <thenofis> xd
20:44 < bridge> <kebscs> then camera->m_Center and check with ScreenWidth/Height

21:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Are you using Windows or Linux?
21:41 < bridge> <sollybunny> 128 players? thtts cringe, when are we getting 1024?
21:44 < bridge> <sollybunny> jesuss 128 players in scoreboard looks... well
21:44 < bridge> <sollybunny> big
21:44 < bridge> <sollybunny> i already think 64 is way too many

21:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> imagine i have to reply to some russian player and im there pressing shift+tab for 5 years
22:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Mouse for da weak, I'll use fifo :/
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> steam users get even more fun
22:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> y so?
22:28 < bridge> <Ewan> shift tab is the default keybind for opening the steam overlay
22:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> ah
22:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> simply dfont use steam
22:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> i need a russian keyboard
22:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> for the express purpose of pinging russians
22:29 < bridge> <hezovich> Can I post ideas here?
22:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> why not
22:30 < bridge> <Ewan> feel free to share them
22:30 < bridge> <Ewan> if it’s smth u want added to ddnet youmd better make an issue on github
22:30 < bridge> <Ewan> if it’s smth u want added to ddnet you’d be better off making an issue on github
22:30 < bridge> <hezovich> The idea is to add more orientation flags to the flags
22:30 < bridge> <Ewan> hmm
22:31 < bridge> <Ewan> are u talking about the player country flag or smth else
22:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> gay flags?
22:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> gay player country flags?
22:31 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess so
22:31 < bridge> <hezovich> yes
22:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> i think u need to specify sexual oritentation
22:31 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont rly love that idea because the flag is supposed to serve as an indicator of where you live
22:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> i though u were actually talking abt some editor feature
22:32 < bridge> <Ewan> but ppl abuse it or leave it empty all the time
22:32 < bridge> <sollybunny> about 1% plp use it for that. the rest are in north korea or dont have one
22:32 < bridge> <Ewan> i sure as hell dont live in luxembourg
22:32 < bridge> <hezovich> Imagine how cool it is that your tab displays LGBT or something else
22:33 < bridge> <hezovich> Imagine how cool it is that in your nickname tab you have LGBT or something else displayed
22:33 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe as another field
22:33 < bridge> <sollybunny> it wouldnt be compatable with 0.7, and people would use it. but i think plo would be against it as its a slippery slope, theres lots of flags
22:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> hm I dunno really, flags are specifically for location purposes. We "could" add a second category for flags - but I'm not sure about our maintainers
22:33 < bridge> <Ewan> it just seems ultimately pointless
22:33 < bridge> <sollybunny> another field for being gay is probably a bit too much
22:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> if you are adding a rainbow flag u need to draw the line where to stop adding flags
22:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> also whats the country code for rainbow flag
22:35 < bridge> <sollybunny> [gay](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1193969399619661985.gif?size=48&quality=lossless&name=gay) ?
22:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i wanna be clear that i harbor zero ill will towards anyone who’d wanna use this flag *but* technically speaking it’d be redefining existing server/client behavior which can’t/won’t be changed everywhere so support would not be great 
22:35 < bridge> <Ewan> 
22:35 < bridge> <Ewan> I also question the logic that brings you to want to show ppl your gender/orientation without having to talk to them
22:36 < bridge> <Ewan> that seems like something you keep to yourself and share with people as needed
22:36 < bridge> <Ewan> could just be me
22:36 < bridge> <hezovich> or another idea - add a window to the display tab where you can enter a skin that will be displayed during the freeze / recolor the color of the freeze
22:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> people use these flags to show their support towards these groups without belonging to them
22:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> if you have  ever been near any community they often have lots of memerobillia (?) such as flags and figures and idols etc etc. the gay community likes sticking flags on everything
22:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> Sometimes*
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
22:37 < bridge> <sollybunny> its not redefining anything, i think u can just add it to the assets and it works
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> there’s no enum?
22:37 < bridge> <sollybunny> the flag information is just a string
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> then i guess i dont see why not to
22:37 < bridge> <sollybunny> no and even if there was, its very likley theres space anyway
22:37 < bridge> <Ewan> it’s not about space
22:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> space in the size of the enum such that its compatable with old servers
22:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> Having more LGBTQ+ flags than country flags inc <a:EssexLemonEat:909223338528890900>
22:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> space in the size of the enum such that its compatable with old servers*
22:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> I don't really mind it - I only see another thing we need to moderate :monkaStop:
22:39 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah i think there’s no harm in having it
22:39 < bridge> <Ewan> just seems uber pointless
22:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> oh no theres a ton of people with gay flags!!!!
22:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> ban them!!!
22:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> "he called me a bitch for using the bisexual LGBTQ  flag"
22:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> having flags doesnt make people less or more homophobic
22:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> :monkaStop:
22:39 < bridge> <Ewan> o he called you a bitch
22:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> im sure most people are used to general name calling
22:39 < bridge> <Ewan> oddly tame
22:40 < bridge> <sollybunny> ^
22:41 < bridge> <Ewan> if you can just add images & it’ll work for whoever has it then whatever
22:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> Typing on phone hard..
22:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
22:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> I think it'll increase awareness AND toxicity towards this - so I vote f3.5
22:41 < bridge> <Ewan> but if it’s anything more than that I say no because it’s enabling more maintenance in the future & providing justification for why the next proposed profile customization thing can be added
22:42 < bridge> <Ewan> and then we’d just end up like discord
22:42 < bridge> <Ewan> idk about you but that sounds terrible
22:43 < bridge> <sollybunny> whats there to maintain, the rainbow flag doesnt change
22:43 < bridge> <Ewan> hmm wdym
22:43 < bridge> <sollybunny> wdym maintanence
22:44 < bridge> <Ewan> oh sorry if it wasn’t clear i was elaborating on my previous msg
22:44 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean the maintenance implied by the inverse case in the condition established by the first part of my sentence
22:45 < bridge> <sollybunny> yeah .. but flags dont need maintaining
22:45 < bridge> <Ewan> to paraphrase… “if there is maintenance to be done then i say no”
22:45 < bridge> <Ewan> to paraphrase… “if there is maintenance to be done then i say yes”
22:45 < bridge> <Ewan> to paraphrase… “if there is nomaintenance to be done then i say yes”
22:45 < bridge> <Ewan> to paraphrase… “if there is no maintenance to be done then i say yes”
22:45 < bridge> <sollybunny> there is none, unless the design for them changes in which case your already doing 100, so youll be doing it with a python script anyway
22:45 < bridge> <Ewan> truly a great day to be a mobile user
22:45 < bridge> <Ewan> dude
22:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i am agreeing with you
22:45 < bridge> <Ewan> please read
22:45 < bridge> <sollybunny> so am i
22:45 < bridge> <sollybunny> :)
22:46 < bridge> <Ewan> :monkaStop:
22:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont get it
22:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> im elaborating despite the fact you already agree with me
22:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i see
22:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont wanna read into it too much cuz it’s a simple miscommunication but that confused the shit out of me … usually “but” means to contradict
22:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> **I understood your point 5 minutes ago, me continuing is just for shits and giggles ** kinda vibe
22:48 < bridge> <sollybunny> yeah sorta like that
22:48 < bridge> <sollybunny> but not really
22:48 < bridge> <meloƞ> Alright good night!!! I go sleepy eepy
22:48 < bridge> <Ewan> gn
22:48 < bridge> <sollybunny> nn
22:49 < bridge> <sollybunny> aww u cant just add it to data/countryflags and have it show up
22:49 < bridge> <sollybunny> wait it is an enum?
22:49 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1303114031262863401/image.png?ex=672a9303&is=67294183&hm=0ef16b15000135a948b95623a7c5e8756fd24b970d7e821379e0b5ed79940c73&
22:49 < bridge> <sollybunny> why tho
22:52 < bridge> <Ewan> rip
22:52 < bridge> <Ewan> genuinely not sure
22:52 < bridge> <Ewan> probably just for this reason, no custom flags means no misinterpretation of somebody’s custom flag
22:52 < bridge> <sollybunny> well this kinda makes it hard for custom flags
22:52 < bridge> <Ewan> is the rainbow flag in game already?
22:52 < bridge> <sollybunny> no
22:53 < bridge> <sollybunny> its probably sending an int32 anyway so why not just send a char[4]
22:53 < bridge> <Ewan> this is probably going to be a tough sell then
22:53 < bridge> <sollybunny> i added
22:53 < bridge> <sollybunny> it to that file
22:53 < bridge> <sollybunny> but its still not showing up
22:57 < bridge> <animepdf> If I'm using std++11 library in my std++20 ddnet project, and I'm getting errors since std++11 uses `std::exception::what` without `noexcept` and everything after with, where in cmake I tell compiler to ignore it or say the lib is std++11

22:58 < bridge> <sollybunny> `set_source_files_properties(path/to/file.cpp PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS "-std cpp11")`
22:59 < bridge> <sollybunny> according to chatgpt

23:01 < bridge> <sollybunny> theres an arbritrary limit that -1 is the lowest flag id you can have
23:01 < bridge> <sollybunny> if the flag is added i think that should be... removed and made -999 (as the max is 999) and u can put whatever custom flags in there
23:02 < bridge> <sollybunny> it doesnt recompile if u use an unused flag id
23:02 < bridge> <sollybunny> it doesnt require recompile if u use an unused flag id
23:02 < bridge> <kebscs> idk if we need custom flags
23:02 < bridge> <sollybunny> make an issue ;)
23:03 < bridge> <sollybunny> it would require no changes to a single line change, and then u can just add as many as you want
23:03 < bridge> <sollybunny> the only flags worht adding are the rgb, lgbtq and trans ones, the rest are kinda icky
23:04 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1303117655179264030/iu.png?ex=672a9663&is=672944e3&hm=77ea27ac4d4e22cf0eff7c87cc31a691f14f67a9037898c6c5b4210966ddc483&

23:04 < bridge> <sollybunny> like who the fug made this one
23:04 < bridge> <sollybunny> looks like homer simpson wearing purple trousers
23:05 < bridge> <sollybunny> the only flags worht adding are the rgb, lesbian, lgbtq and trans ones, the rest are kinda icky
23:08 < bridge> <kebscs> noone asked for these
23:09 < bridge> <kebscs> and its called "country" instead of flag in some parts of the code base
23:11 < bridge> <devinci24> Why would anyone want this...
23:11 < bridge> <devinci24> And I feel it would only be used to insult others xd
23:12 < bridge> <kebscs> with the players being 80% russian we all know whats going to happen
23:12 < bridge> <kebscs> with the playerbase being 80% russian we all know whats going to happen
23:13 < bridge> <sollybunny> if you see someone with a pride flag
23:13 < bridge> <sollybunny> you know they probably arent a snotty 12 year old
23:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> you know they probably arent a snotty (imature) 12 year old
23:14 < bridge> <sollybunny> the great filter
23:15 < bridge> <sollybunny> im sure alot of people would use them
23:15 < bridge> <devinci24> I wont say my thoughts on that because free speech here is limited.
23:15 < bridge> <devinci24> 
23:15 < bridge> <devinci24> But going back to the flags. I don't understand why would you ever want to mix country flags, and political? flags
23:16 < bridge> <kebscs> anyone knows if theres a way to check if tune has set some value, or is it always using the defaults
23:16 < bridge> <louis> 🤔
23:16 < bridge> <sollybunny> they are tho
23:16 < bridge> <devinci24> I wont say my thoughts on that because free speech here is limited.
23:16 < bridge> <devinci24> 
23:16 < bridge> <devinci24> But going back to the flags. I don't understand why would you ever want to mix country flags with other type of flags.
23:16 < bridge> <kebscs> so with this if the global tune is undeep 1 i can turn off it with tune zone
23:16 < bridge> <louis> lesbian one is that common tho
23:17 < bridge> <sollybunny> nope
23:17 < bridge> <louis> lesbian one isnt that common tho
23:17 < bridge> <louis> edit: isnt*
23:17 < bridge> <sollybunny> i guessed so
23:17 < bridge> <sollybunny> i.. think youll be fine. no one will be offended by your hatred of pride flags.... being mixed with flag flags
23:18 < bridge> <sollybunny> barely anyone uses flags for their inteded purpsoe anyway
23:18 < bridge> <sollybunny> im just gonna make an issue
23:18 < bridge> <sollybunny> xd
23:18 < bridge> <robyt3> See #3639 and #5176. We don't want to add non-country or unofficial flags. The only exception are regions that have an associated language like Catalan.
23:18 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3639
23:18 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5176
23:18 < bridge> <sollybunny> o okey
23:20 < bridge> <kebscs> @robyt3 do you know?
23:20 < bridge> <louis> those issues are about un-official geographical flags, not about non-geographical flags
23:20 < bridge> <kebscs> im printing the tune zone value and its always 0 unless set to 1
23:21 < bridge> <robyt3> no
23:22 < bridge> <sollybunny> i think they will be rejected for similar reason
23:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I think representing your country is a lot more special these days than representing your sexual minority lol
23:22 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I think wanting to represent your country is a lot more special these days than wanting to represent your sexual minority lol
23:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> oreintation*, and yes... so people would use them
23:23 < bridge> <louis> not necessarily true
23:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> oreintation*, and yes... so people would use them (special being less frequent)
23:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The ones in the majority don't really care about representing it so I'm technically right :P
23:23 < bridge> <louis> yep, and no one country has the majority of the population
23:24 < bridge> <louis> so whats your point
23:24 < bridge> <sollybunny> a sexual minority. is a minority of people who are sexual. we are talking about sexual orientation (and other pride flags (trans/lgbtq)) flags
23:24 < bridge> <louis> i'm sure there are more queer people in the world than the population of a lot of the world's countries
23:24 < bridge> <devinci24> Non country flags should just not be added so discussions like this one doesn't start in game.
23:25 < bridge> <sollybunny> there wouldnt be bad discussion in game there would just be name calling
23:25 < bridge> <louis> I thought you were just complaining about there not being free speech earlier
23:25 < bridge> <louis> this is an interesting tune
23:26 < bridge> <devinci24> louis, for me you can tell in chat whatever you want.
23:26 < bridge> <devinci24> I just don't think we should incite anything. Which is different
23:26 < bridge> <louis> feels weird though, i wonder how mappers will use them
23:26 < bridge> <louis> the flag isn't doing the inciting though, it's the players
23:26 < bridge> <louis> Yes the flag will cause inciting but i don't think it falls on the addition of the flag
23:27 < bridge> <oxyzo.> could be in a solo map like if you miss you are dead idk tbh
23:27 < bridge> <louis> but i'm not sure if its a good idea anyways because it might become a bit of a slippery slope
23:27 < bridge> <devinci24> if I does I don't thinkg the reason matters. That's all
23:27 < bridge> <louis> oh real
23:27 < bridge> <sollybunny> who has write access on ddnet/ddnet?
23:27 < bridge> <devinci24> admins
23:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> equal to the ones in this dc?
23:28 < bridge> <kebscs> <https://github.com/ddnet>
23:28 < bridge> <kebscs> "People" on the right side
23:28 < bridge> <kebscs> im guessing
23:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> oke
23:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> if one of them accepted it i dont think there would be backlash
23:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> but the consesus is probably still no
23:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> make an issue x-x
