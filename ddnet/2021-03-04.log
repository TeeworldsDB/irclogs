17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lies
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> From what I heard they are now doing it on an aggregate level. They can identify that you form part of group A "Techy who loves to game" and target based off that.
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Any tips as to how I can resolve "IStorage: struct type redefinition"? I haven't changed anything besides trying to get the code to compile with MySQL.
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Hoping someone has encountered this before/can narrow down the scope of the issue.
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I remember mysql itself using the name IStorage
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Zodiac are you using latest master?
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wait
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> IStorage was a windows thing IIRC
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki yes, you can put it there. it also has a license. I think Zwelf intentionally did not put it into the wiki because it doesn't really fit the format. it's on the website
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://ddnet.tw/docs/libtw2/
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zodiac> Guilty as charged xD thinking of spawning off a linux VM quick to solve this
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we want to work on windows, this might be a bug in ddnet
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you post the full error?
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (might be this: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/objidl/nn-objidl-istorage)
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It fits perfectly on the wiki
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the reason it might not fit might be: you can't edit it on the wiki
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I think the wiki having as much of the info as possible is the best than random links everywhere
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> What u cant edit?
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I meant manually porting the docs to the wili
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Wiki
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> duplicating the effort? I don't think that's worth it
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> will lead to one becoming outdated
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like "random links" better
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I think its better to use the wiki as the source theb
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Why you like random links better
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> ok so i went in f1 and wrote : ```bind f say /team 2, /lock``` but dont work. whats wrong ?
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not what I intend to do; I believe my repository will live longer than the wiki
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The wiki has backups
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> This defeats the point of the wiki then
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> We can pack it up and delete it
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think Zwelf thinks that way
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> he explicitly split it that way
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Idk what he thinks he barely talks here
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its pointless split
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The wiki should aim to have as much info as possible
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I will port those docs my way, citing ur repo like any wiki
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It doesnt matter if its duplicate
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ur repo is a 1st source
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The wiki makes an article citing it
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I will write it in a different way
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just don't make a editable copy, please 🙂
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> What does that mean
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> reproducing the contents is no problem for me as long as you don't make it editable, that would make it hard to find the up-to-date version
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> You need to use ; instead of , and with ""
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> like bind f "say /team 2; say /lock"
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> @Ryozuki help
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/817124544946110514/unknown.png

21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I want to add info about the protocol from scratch using those docs as reference
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> first screen is on Mac
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> and second screen from Windows
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Idk if that means reproeucing the content
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> the x has a 0,1 tile difference
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> from both screen
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> even tho we used tele x y
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ok, why u ping me
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> coz u dev and there
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> maybe u know why
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Floating point stuff idk
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> so in reality we're not really at different positions ?
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> its kinda important to save a fail with a tower
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> and if we can move differently that might increase the tower possibility
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> its kinda important, to save a fail with a tower
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Neben you're at the same position
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the exact position would be 0.125, but it seems it's rounded differently to 0.12, 0.13
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> yeah ok thanks its just the rounding on the printing
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is there a way to run ./DDNet withotu a video device
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> No
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U need to code a headless client
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Decouplinng the current client from graphics is some work
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Maybe irs even faster to judt implement ur own netclient
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hm ok tkhx
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what do you want to do? @louis
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> was trying to run ./ddnet on a vps
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> so its the case too then there? 09 13 34 38 59 63 84 88 like why is it that sometimes u move 3 sometimes 4
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> in truth u move 3,5 or sth? and it will just round differently too?
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> so its the case too then there? 09 13, 34 38, 59 63, 84 88 like why is it that sometimes u move 0.03 sometimes 0.04
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 0.03125
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> or sth like this yes
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 1/32 of a tile
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> so its the same lenght nonthelss as u can move
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> the same minimal distance
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> it will just show differently cuz of rounding?
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <reo> okay thanks
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> @louis @noby made a text only client
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @louis but what should it do? ^^
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @plsplsplslol yeah but i have no idea how to use it, its a single chatonly.cpp file
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @heinrich5991 i just wanted it to run an autoexec.cfg
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> gcc
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i dont think that one runs autoexec tho
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> no its a client
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> doing ./DDNet runs autoexec.cfg ofc
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> why do you need to run autoexec.cfg
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> so i can run some commands
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @louis connect directly followed by other commands won't work btw
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well wont work anyways without vid device D: i will try to find some way to make a fake monitor or smth
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> framebuffer or so might be a word you need
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you still haven't said what you want to do btw
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "execute autoexec.cfg" is probably not the end goal 😉
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> :justatest:
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i want to connect to a server :justatest:
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u probs can run a client on a vps
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> software renderer and smth liek VNC to connect
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> m well thx ill see to it
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe something like this https://github.com/Freescale/linux-module-virtfb
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yes nobys text only client can connect to a server
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ah ok i will find it
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> can it rename too
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok, join server, rename
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we're getting closer to the requirements 😉
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes thats basically all i believe
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe /save :justatest: but not needed
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> i dont think it can rename
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ ssh -X should work
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (and mobaxterm for Windows)
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> k thank u <3
