00:10 < bridge> <Ewan> if you ask me, you're too smart of a person to keep using the llm
00:10 < bridge> <Ewan> proven at this point to make you stupider (worse critical thinking abilities) and even cause psychosis
00:10 < bridge> <Ewan> duckduckgo still works just fine
00:41 < bridge> <louis> you're too smart of a person to do a web search, go derive everything you need from scratch
00:41 < bridge> <Ewan> have you seen the studies
00:43 < bridge> <louis> u can use llms in a responsible and helpful way
00:44 < bridge> <louis> some people ask mr chat for every single thing which makes them stupid
00:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah pretty sure the act of asking questions in general isn't cursed to rot your brain
00:46 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so as long as you don't ask the bot questions you wouldn't ask a person it's fine
00:47 < bridge> <kebscs> link?
00:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> except sometimes when you'd ask a person you really should ask a person
00:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> except sometimes when you'd ask a person you really should ask a person, not a clanker
00:47 < bridge> <kebscs> if you use it as a tool and not braindead copypaste its for sure good
00:47 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> constantly asking a real person stupid questions will also make you act stupider
00:47 < bridge> <kebscs> you can learn a lot even syntax from the examples it gives
00:47 < bridge> <Ewan> it's hard not to become reliant on it to answer your questions
00:48 < bridge> <Ewan> that is the thing
00:48 < bridge> <Ewan> once you accept it's okay you're much more likely to use it more
00:48 < bridge> <Ewan> so i agree maybe it's healthy in moderation
00:48 < bridge> <Ewan> lemme find the link
00:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> we need chatbots that will tell you to stop asking stupid questions
00:48 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
00:48 < bridge> <Ewan> or ones that will ask questions in return so (a.) they don't fabricate shit and (b.) you still have to think a little bit
00:48 < bridge> <melon> "wdym center a div you brainrotten moron"
00:49 < bridge> <Ewan> https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872
00:49 < bridge> <melon> idk every time i ask AI something it spits out pure garbage
00:49 < bridge> <Ewan> they were doing a follow up study pertaining to software specifically. i dont know if it's finished
00:49 < bridge> <kebscs> chatbots hallucinate on harder questions so theres no win
00:49 < bridge> <louis> Oh having chat write your essays for you is probably the fastest way to ruin your development
00:49 < bridge> <melon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1402423394753974423/image.png?ex=6893dc11&is=68928a91&hm=852f1125e3647838e7ec479656eb283969473eff5232fe7e0745321a981f7c71&
00:50 < bridge> <melon> :angeryturtle:
00:51 < bridge> <kebscs> idk what that is but seems very specific to some lib
00:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I guess you could compare it to the phenomenon of getting bad at arithmetic once you start doing *real math* and using a calculator for 12 + 5
00:51 < bridge> <melon> angular.
00:51 < bridge> <kebscs> which the chatbot might not have any info on
00:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> at least it's somewhat self-aware
00:51 < bridge> <louis> 🤮
00:51 < bridge> <melon> xd
00:51 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah right
00:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> bro there's so much on Angular it'd be impressive if it didn't know it
00:51 < bridge> <louis> angulars syntax changes like every 2 months in my experience
00:51 < bridge> <Ewan> that's fair
00:52 < bridge> <kebscs> idk, but i had stuff like this a lot where it recommends use of some function that doesnt exist
00:52 < bridge> <kebscs> or it comes up with a python library that doesnt exist
00:52 < bridge> <melon> i remember asking it about an assumed outcome of a function, told me the function is incorrect and gave me a sample in a different lang.
00:53 < bridge> <Ewan> the LLMs i tried during the honeymoon phase were terrible at Qt which is one of the oldest APIs even in use today
00:53 < bridge> <Ewan> but that's because it changed so much over the years it would tend towards old/deprecated things unknowingly
00:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> It's becoming just like a real developer!
00:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> "I'm sure that function exists!"
00:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> "Wait, it doesn't? This library sucks!"

00:55 < bridge> <melon> hell, he is incapable of writing simple math without AI
00:55 < bridge> <Ewan> and im jobless :kek:
00:55 < bridge> <Ewan> different reasons but jesus
00:55 < bridge> <melon> he will develop software for heavy machinery at some point
00:56 < bridge> <melon> like - can kill people type of machinery
00:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> no but I start flipping tables when I try a language and it doesn't have map and filter and zip and wtf writing a zip is literally impossible because the language doesn't have tuples
00:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 
00:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm too functional-pilled
00:58 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's so weird that so many new languages don't have tuples
00:58 < bridge> <louis> just zip with generic struct idk
00:58 < bridge> <melon> sounds like you code in zig? xd
00:58 < bridge> <melon> or go
00:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> like bwuh I'm not making a class or a bunch of loosely typed objects just so I can pair up values for this one function
01:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> gdscript makes me pull out my hair, there's no optional type, there's no either type, there's no try-catch, like
01:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> this language actually has no proper way of error handling
01:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> And there's no statically typed generics so I can't write my own
01:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> you either go dynamically typed or you don't get generics
01:01 < bridge> <melon> lol i remember reading something about this - gdscript cant even return on success while also handling the error if it occurs iirc?
01:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Ig if I wanted to write a godot project without losing my mind I should just switch to C#
01:02 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> if I wanted to double lose my mind I could use the rust bindings :D :D
01:03 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> The amount of error handling you get to do depends on how nice the particular engine feature you're trying to use is
01:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> some things return error values, some things just break lol
01:04 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and you can't stop certain errors from getting logged by the engine even if they aren't fatal
01:05 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh and I haven't found a way to properly interface with the built-in logger either...
01:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> maybe I'm just blind on that tho
01:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> maybe I'm just blind on that tho, could just be some page of the docs I haven't read properly
01:07 < bridge> <louis> duck type
01:07 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah but that's gross
01:07 < bridge> <louis> ye use c# if u dont wanna be scripty
01:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah...
01:08 < bridge> <louis> i like it cuz quick dev speed idk
01:08 < bridge> <louis> just barf out code until u find what u need and then type everything after 😹
01:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I thought it was cute so I tried using it
01:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> now I'm partially doubting the entire engine
01:08 < bridge> <louis> yeah its suuper young imo
01:08 < bridge> <louis> i had to do some jank shit to get pixelated lights without downscaling->upscaling
01:09 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> tfw I learned that calling an RPC with incorrect argument types CRASHES THE SIDE BEING CALLED
01:10 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I didn't test this deeply, but I got a crash like this when a friend connected an older version of my game to my newer server
01:10 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> the client calling the RPC on the server froze the client but also crashed the server
01:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> imo rendering at a lower res and upscaling is the correct way to do that...
01:14 < bridge> <louis> i didnt wanna do that for my entire game though since i wanted the character to move smoothly
01:15 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Hmm, I'm kind of a pixel purist so my entire game is rendered at 320 by 240 (even the menus)
01:15 < bridge> <louis> so its like you have two nodes on each gameplay entity, one that moves smoothly and one that has a hitbox for anything light etc. related and you write a shader that moves the downscaled portion the fraction of pixel it's offset w the smooth side of things 🤢
01:15 < bridge> <louis> yeah its a style thing ig
01:16 < bridge> <louis> i wanted precise movement / hitboxes though, more than the size of a pixel
01:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> plenty of old games do subpixel movement
01:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I suppose it's evil to have movement the player can't see but imo that's pretty cool
01:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> you can use walls to line up precise setups still
02:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I'm never compiling ddnet-rs ever again
02:14 < bridge> <melon> xdddd grab a pre built from the runner artifacts
02:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It's like you know what's my problem
02:14 < bridge> <melon> Compilation? As you stated?
02:15 < bridge> <melon> you gave a genetic problem I gave you a generic solution
02:15 < bridge> <melon> you gave a generic problem I gave you a generic solution
02:15 < bridge> <cellegenrih> This should explain everything
02:15 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1402444873252077640/image.png?ex=6893f011&is=68929e91&hm=4be0278b80ad19ed1924e1a2143a7e305ced3fe9ecda32d7e261888821cb2707&
02:15 < bridge> <melon> That's just rust in general
02:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> The repo allocates a whopping 12GBs easily, with both compilation AND IDE Services!
02:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I ain't touching that repo
02:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> bricked the OS twice
02:17 < bridge> <melon> Allocating? Are you referring to memory usage?
02:17 < bridge> <cellegenrih> The repo allocates a whopping 12GBs easily, with both compilation AND IDE Services!
02:17 < bridge> <cellegenrih> (resulting in an over 20GB storage allocation, which I don't have lol)
02:17 < bridge> <melon> sounds like rust analyzer is bullying you
02:18 < bridge> <cellegenrih> no, as the picture should imply, storage
02:19 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I'm just sure that it won't handle 1000 libs efficiently
02:19 < bridge> <melon> If you don't plan on touching it again, Run `cargo clean` please.
02:19 < bridge> <melon> just want to see how much comes out of it
02:19 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I wiped it clean off
02:20 < bridge> <cellegenrih> you can guess I had around 100MBs of storage left before it kicked the bucket
02:20 < bridge> <cellegenrih> and what I sent picture is the aftermath of removal
02:20 < bridge> <cellegenrih> do the math urself
02:21 < bridge> <Ewan> guys i just learned code takes space
02:21 < bridge> <Ewan> :trollet:
02:21 < bridge> <teero777> don't you have any bigger drive? xd
02:21 < bridge> <teero777> my swap is double the size of that drive
02:21 < bridge> <cellegenrih> So basically, I cannot do shit on that repository, especially when it's that bad to even compile with such large amount of storage dependency... for a simple client.
02:21 < bridge> <teero777> "simple"
02:21 < bridge> <melon> It's.. not just a simple client :justatest:
02:22 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the other one is 1TB, however that's not where all my coding will go
02:22 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks you hear? it's just a simple client rightttt
02:22 < bridge> <cellegenrih> simple as in terms of size
02:22 < bridge> <cellegenrih> bruh
02:22 < bridge> <cellegenrih> not in terms of complexity
02:23 < bridge> <cellegenrih> cuz I believe if it has 1000+ libraries after all, I sure fucking think so that it is complex xd
02:23 < bridge> <teero777> i thought the size was too much for you xd
02:23 < bridge> <cellegenrih> well, doing nothing essentially amounted to over 10GBs, like ... bruh
02:24 < bridge> <melon> Blame rust-analyzers indexing
02:24 < bridge> <melon> Did you run it in debug of release
02:24 < bridge> <melon> Did you "attempt" run it in debug of release
02:24 < bridge> <teero777> what?? xd
02:24 < bridge> <melon> Did you "attempt" to run it in debug of release
02:24 < bridge> <teero777> *or?
02:24 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Ah yes blame someone else :kek:
02:24 < bridge> <melon> Phone hard
02:25 < bridge> <melon> L
02:25 < bridge> <louis> L
02:25 < bridge> <cellegenrih> L
02:25 < bridge> <melon> And yes, the ide symbols can get quite heavy.
02:25 < bridge> <melon> Same with build artifacts and debug symbols
02:25 < bridge> <cellegenrih> btw @louis.place that 1TB of storage is just Windows that has league of legends and davinci resolve on it :troll:
02:26 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Well I cannot do anything about it now do I
02:27 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Unless you want me to just, blindly explore all the code in it and pull a "trust me bro" on everything
02:27 < bridge> <teero777> you can spend like 30€ for a tb nvme
02:27 < bridge> <cellegenrih> even 1€ is too much
02:27 < bridge> <teero777> well then don't i guess xd
02:28 < bridge> <melon> Idk, rust projects have always been heavy.
02:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> How is that Godot, a fully flexible 2D and 3D game engine, doesn't amount to half the size of what this client repo tries to allocate in IDLE
02:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> How is that Godot, a fully flexible 2D and 3D game engine, doesn't amount to half the size of what this client repo tries to allocate in IDLE, BEFORE COMPILATION
02:29 < bridge> <melon> that.. is just lazy negativity
02:29 < bridge> <melon> Good night.
02:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I just don't get it duuuuud ;-;
02:30 < bridge> <teero777> have you ever seen an enterprise level godot project? xd
02:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> gn for u
02:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Yes, 80% of them are Assets, 15% is resource allocation and 5% is code
02:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Yes, 80% of them are Assets, 15% is resource allocation and 5% is code and scene
02:31 < bridge> <melon> Let me just say:
02:31 < bridge> <melon> it's a self written client by a single individual, and hasn't been FOSS for more than 10 years and worked on by hundreds.
02:32 < bridge> <melon> Let me just say:
02:32 < bridge> <melon> it's a self written client, server, editor, and account management system by a single individual, and hasn't been FOSS for more than 10 years and worked on by hundreds.
02:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Right, Godot as one of those engines that use like over 100 external libraries and another  100+ internal ones
02:33 < bridge> <Ewan> because... gdscript is interpreted, and you don't have the rest of the development tools for C++ installed?
02:33 < bridge> <melon> It's fine to be buffed by a projects size - but please do us a favor and stop comparing sticks to stones and complain that stones are harder
02:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It also has GDExtension and at least 4 more language bridges, but that's besides the point
02:35 < bridge> <cellegenrih> If it was about complexity, Godot would take it's crown at any time, cuz the type of wizardry to pull on some of the C scripts and make it somehow compatible with the entire structure, is still mind boggling to me
02:35 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Idk about ddnet-rs' overall complexity, but I assume that there are a dozen of resources for developing in it, not just resources for overall building the clientside of things
02:36 < bridge> <cellegenrih> So, can I assume that both client side and server side development is in one repository?
02:37 < bridge> <Ewan> what? C scripts?
02:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Alr, enough yapping about this. Sadge that I cannot work on it
02:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :pepeW: ayup
02:38 < bridge> <Ewan> do you mean scripts? how does it work
02:39 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet-rs, as a rust project, will depend on crates, which are in the form of source code *and* .rlib by the time it gets to you, which is the whole compiled object file as well as additional metadata
02:39 < bridge> <Ewan> indexes are large. im curious what you were using to try and compile it, if you opened it in an IDE & the index got crazy. as far as i understand it's a large codebase too. like melon said the cache there could get large
02:39 < bridge> <cellegenrih> other languages trying to run another language's code somehow, in some way. And for god forsaken reason, the same goes with a random language trying to run C code
02:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i still don't know what you mean. i am really skeptical that it actually interprets the C. it's more likely that you're expected to compile it yourself, and with that would also come several GB of tools
02:40 < bridge> <Ewan> that you don't have
02:40 < bridge> <cellegenrih> How is it depend on crates when the repository never mentions a word about it?
02:40 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1402451282387669053/image.png?ex=6893f60a&is=6892a48a&hm=4d46c7bc6ab7b594181d0bd95e3a6ce0f28f0c032756fd03a5c698439b32bd65&
02:40 < bridge> <Ewan> because cargo installs all of it, it's defined in cargo.toml under the dependencies section
02:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> You think people look at this repo blindly and tell: "Hmmm yes, I should use a crate for it as dependency"
02:41 < bridge> <Ewan> what
02:41 < bridge> <Ewan> cargo is a package manager
02:41 < bridge> <Ewan> that also invokes the compiler
02:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Oh you don't mean externally
02:41 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ok
02:41 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not completely self contained like lots of c/c++ codebases are. one of the most unanimously agreed upon problems with C and C++ is their lack of official package manager. it makes compilation and deployment much more complicated
02:42 < bridge> <Ewan> at the end of the day, it's no more cumbersome than having to check out git submodules as dependencies, or worse, relying on them already being installed on the system
02:42 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ok, good to know dude
02:42 < bridge> <Ewan> you should see the CMakeLists.txt for DDNet and then tell me cargo is overkill with a straight face
02:42 < bridge> <cellegenrih> won't solve my issue tho
02:43 < bridge> <Ewan> no the issue would be solved by using your other drive most likely
02:43 < bridge> <Ewan> idk what your partition setup looks like but 128GB root drive and 1TB reserved for "other things" maybe not ideal
02:43 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I use Windows on the other drive, as in I use editing software to make videos for someone, that takes a lot of space
02:43 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> package management is great but package management being low effort encourages people to casually pick up libs and that's bad
02:44 < bridge> <Ewan> definitely
02:44 < bridge> <Ewan> in rust it's even worse because transitive dependencies can have different versions of the same dependency
02:44 < bridge> <Ewan> so it could even be linked in there twice, statically
02:44 < bridge> <cellegenrih> That's what happened with Godot, most of their external libs are outdated anyway
02:44 < bridge> <Ewan> but PGO should eliminate most of that chub for the end user
02:44 < bridge> <cellegenrih> hence why I abandoned godot
02:44 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I personally enjoy game engine development so I'm surprised I even started using Godot
02:45 < bridge> <Ewan> otherwise developers seem content enough taking the brunt of that. they need good computers to compile it quickly anyway
02:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> though it was kind of fun getting a couple things done instead of just doing engine work...
02:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and then I started adding stuff that are basically engine features...
02:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> worked so far, so until it becomes an abysmal issue, I don't worry
02:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah I can't be trusted to finish a game ever
02:46 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And I won't just buy another hard drive, or somehow edit the only partition where I make a profit on, just to try to compile ddnet-rs
02:46 < bridge> <cellegenrih> So, I won't be able to contribute sadly. sry
02:47 < bridge> <melon> Of course you can contribute
02:47 < bridge> <melon> Download an artifact, launch, try, write issues
02:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> What about practicality?
02:47 < bridge> <Ewan> same
02:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i was always more interested in making the engine than the game
02:48 < bridge> <Ewan> i had a project on github that has no finished anything
02:48 < bridge> <Ewan> basic oop sdl backed c++ engine
02:48 < bridge> <Ewan> dime a dozen but fun project
02:48 < bridge> <melon> I'm confused, do you want to contribute to DDNet-rs to learn rust?
02:49 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I would've liked to see if I could contribute
02:49 < bridge> <cellegenrih> As a curiousity, not interest
02:49 < bridge> <pathos3005> No worries, I called this 'finished' 20 years ago when I was a teen 😄
02:49 < bridge> <pathos3005> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAyptdUvAC8
02:50 < bridge> <Ewan> doesn'
02:50 < bridge> <Ewan> doesn't look unfinished
02:50 < bridge> <pathos3005> Hahaha thanks
02:50 < bridge> <melon> lgtm, ship it!
02:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> something that's a bit closer to game programming that I can do is visual effects and general technical artist stuff
02:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> that's a way for me to escape the endless loop of architecting systems xd
02:51 < bridge> <melon> What editor do you code in?
02:51 < bridge> <melon> (unrelated to the message)
02:51 < bridge> <melon> (unrelated to the pinged message)
02:52 < bridge> <pathos3005> I'm also keen on trying Godot, but unsure if I should just jump straight into Rust
02:52 < bridge> <Ewan> bevy's getting really good...
02:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> problem with current game project: there are no fancy shader effects, it's just pixel sprites
02:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so I'm doomed to write anything but gameplay
02:52 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Visual Studio Code or Zed, depending on using Rust or C++
02:52 < bridge> <Ewan> SDL3 added their own shader language. you might see about it again
02:52 < bridge> <pathos3005> Yeah, I'm loosely following Bevy
02:52 < bridge> <Ewan> WTF
02:52 < bridge> <Ewan> zed is perfect for both
02:52 < bridge> <melon> :justatest:
02:52 < bridge> <Ewan> what's the hangup
02:53 < bridge> <melon> Yes zed is definitely good for both
02:53 < bridge> <melon> It's so much faster xd
02:53 < bridge> <Ewan> oh, speaking of
02:53 < bridge> <Ewan> https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/discussions/35511
02:53 < bridge> <Ewan> updoot? pls?
02:53 < bridge> <Ewan> i could just do it but i'm lazy
02:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Installing plugins, as in Zed, you don't have microsoft marketplace to quickly search / install plugins
02:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And I'm too lazy to manually set them up in Zed
02:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :owo:
02:53 < bridge> <Ewan> you have zed marketplace which has ample plugins
02:54 < bridge> <Ewan> but it comes with clangd support
02:54 < bridge> <Ewan> you literally just need the binary
02:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i think CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS is on
02:54 < bridge> <melon> it ships it's own lsp as a binary even, it works out of the box
02:54 < bridge> <cellegenrih> yeah and it installs some core plugins automatically when it detects it
02:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i think CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS is on, in ddnet at least? maybe you are supposed to set that on the command line. idgaf i just put it in my lists usually
02:54 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess i missed the problem then
02:54 < bridge> <cellegenrih> but I use many plugins that Zed won't pick up
02:54 < bridge> <cellegenrih> for conveniency
02:54 < bridge> <Ewan> oh you just mean lack of support
02:54 < bridge> <cellegenrih> kinda
02:55 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah there were some things i miss a little bit but it's worth using anyway imo
02:55 < bridge> <melon> Updooted, I agree
02:55 < bridge> <pathos3005> Just looked into Bevy vs. Godot, see how they're developing recently, but this looks interesting of combining parts of both! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enP4bopQllw
02:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It's perfect for debugging and coding, but it's terrible when it comes to plugins or QoL stuff
02:55 < bridge> <Ewan> btw, if anyone wants to know

02:56 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It's just GDRust with Bevy on it
02:56 < bridge> <cellegenrih> A Rust GDExtension that can use Bevy
02:57 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Not as simple as it sounds sure, but Bevy is not a core renderer in Godot
02:57 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Not as simple as it sounds sure, but Bevy is not a core render handler in Godot
02:57 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Anyway
02:57 < bridge> <Ewan> he literally just said it looks interesting
02:58 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :feelsbadman: mb
02:58 < bridge> <melon> It gets the job done with no visual eyecandy and is super fast while doing so
02:58 < bridge> <melon> 
02:58 < bridge> <melon> I dislike vsc but zed doesn't work properly on windows. I tried fixing it before but the gnu tool chain just frickin fails to generate a data directory :KEKW:
02:59 < bridge> <melon> And I don't want msvc wasting 7gb of my harddrive just to compile zed
02:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> guys have you forgotten
02:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> we already had the best text editor decades ago
02:59 < bridge> <cellegenrih> So you know how I feel and yet you don't understand why I ranted about ddnet-rs? xdd
02:59 < bridge> <melon> I use helix btw
02:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> wow that's based
02:59 < bridge> <louis> whats bad about vscofe
02:59 < bridge> <cellegenrih> vscofe, ah yes
03:00 < bridge> <melon> You ranted about a project that I know the effort put in
03:00 < bridge> <melon> 
03:00 < bridge> <melon> msvc belongs to one of the world's biggest tech companies
03:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> J🤮vaScr🤮pt
03:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I don't say the project is shit lol 😭
03:00 < bridge> <melon> You ranted about a project that I know the effort put in
03:00 < bridge> <melon> 
03:00 < bridge> <melon> msvc belongs to one of the worlds biggest tech companies
03:01 < bridge> <teero777> slowwww, nibbles on my memory and popups that can't be disabled
03:01 < bridge> <melon> Your fault for running on 32kb DDR1
03:02 < bridge> <teero777> >:(
03:02 < bridge> <melon> OMG WAIT actually
03:02 < bridge> <Ewan> it's packaged!
03:02 < bridge> <Ewan> in msys2
03:02 < bridge> <melon> Teero your PC can't handle ddr5 right
03:02 < bridge> <pathos3005> I use too many text editors lol notepad++ notepadqq, vim, nano, VS Codium
03:02 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> maybe we just cry about Rust because what kind of project actually generates enough code to threaten your available disk space
03:02 < bridge> <teero777> ofc it can't xd
03:02 < bridge> <melon> can it handle ddr4
03:02 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1402456805577326622/image.png?ex=6893fb2e&is=6892a9ae&hm=fa02dec147ff8b026f6f00b87b87c4562c61119dfc76ad0d86ef66c6015fefcd&

03:02 < bridge> <melon> Thanks for the flashbang
03:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://tenor.com/view/i-don%27t-know-idk-idk-about-that-gif-7336250873949261946
03:02 < bridge> <teero777> yea i think so, else i would have terabytes of memory
03:02 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry
03:03 < bridge> <teero777> i have a lot of ddr3 laying around
03:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i forgot ppl hate light mode
03:03 < bridge> <melon> I may be able to send you 32gigs
03:03 < bridge> <teero777> ??? wtf
03:03 < bridge> <melon> Depending on my dad, I can ask him tomorrow
03:03 < bridge> <Ewan> ive got a bunch of spare ddr3 lol
03:03 < bridge> <teero777> im at 16gb rn
03:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i was on ddr3 so long
03:03 < bridge> <teero777> but im not in need, i have the 256gb swap
03:03 < bridge> <Ewan> LOL
03:03 < bridge> <Ewan> nah bro u need ram
03:03 < bridge> <melon> Brother, you are desperate
03:03 < bridge> <melon> :KEKW:
03:03 < bridge> <melon> You should be atleast
03:03 < bridge> <Ewan> that is a shitload of swap fwiw
03:04 < bridge> <Ewan> what are you doing, like
03:04 < bridge> <cellegenrih> a what
03:04 < bridge> <Ewan> running huge models and letting them run overnight
03:04 < bridge> <melon> He's hacking the neural network of the teeworld
03:04 < bridge> <louis> i want amd strix halo 128gb apu anyone wanna fund me
03:04 < bridge> <teero777> making sure my programs don't run out of memory xd
03:04 < bridge> <teero777> like never
03:04 < bridge> <Ewan> that's too much man...
03:04 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean, not too much, you'll just never ever use that much
03:04 < bridge> <teero777> 64 wasn't enough
03:04 < bridge> <melon> (he ran out of 64gb before)
03:04 < bridge> <Ewan> i would bet money u were doing something weird
03:04 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Hey, at least his OS won't crash by a memory leak for sure :troll:
03:04 < bridge> <melon> Ah damn phone so slow
03:04 < bridge> <teero777> well no, i actually do for the tas generation stuff
03:04 < bridge> <melon> Teero, send him your blue screens rn
03:04 < bridge> <Ewan> no it'll just get progressively slower isntead
03:05 < bridge> <Ewan> [steamhappy](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1207076645115265044.webp?size=48&name=steamhappy)
03:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> big
03:05 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> clearly you underestimate Teero's ability to write memory leaks
03:05 < bridge> <teero777> better than losing my progress
03:05 < bridge> <Ewan> that's all your code? you've looked into profiling ya?
03:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :justatest:
03:05 < bridge> <Ewan> can't argue with that
03:05 < bridge> <Ewan> as long as the disk space is expendable
03:05 < bridge> <Ewan> less mammary usage
03:05 < bridge> <louis> damn that sounds like it sucks lmao
03:06 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Haven't you heard that's racist?
03:06 < bridge> <louis> is it rly that much in memory? i guess for big maps
03:06 < bridge> <teero777> yea it can be improved to use less memory buttt i would sacrifice cpu performance. according to my eyeballs doing that isn't worth currently
03:06 < bridge> <Ewan> he has to run like 100 different scenarios in parallel for his tas to work
03:06 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean
03:06 < bridge> <Ewan> n amount
03:06 < bridge> <melon> Right teero?
03:06 < bridge> <melon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1402457804551487642/Screenshot_20250806-030551.png?ex=6893fc1d&is=6892aa9d&hm=32c4b3ab5e874d79bcdf263d69ea78bf1c260f2c73e839863f1d9fda10e577d9&
03:06 < bridge> <teero777> more like 100^100
03:06 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
03:06 < bridge> <teero777> XD
03:06 < bridge> <teero777> thats an old photo
03:06 < bridge> <melon> You can see the pcs cry for help in each wave
03:06 < bridge> <cellegenrih> 💀
03:07 < bridge> <louis> i thought ur tas algo isnt necessarily parallel
03:07 < bridge> <teero777> wdym?
03:08 < bridge> <Ewan> he has a bunch of them
03:08 < bridge> <Ewan> they do different things
03:08 < bridge> <melon> Can they make me dinner
03:08 < bridge> <melon> (sry I'm tired.)
03:08 < bridge> <Ewan> i am hungry too
03:09 < bridge> <louis> has anyone made a dm1 learner
03:09 < bridge> <Ewan> i'd be interested to see
03:10 < bridge> <teero777> yea
04:07 < bridge> <Ewan> that is an excellent question actually
04:07 < bridge> <cutetabby> thanks
04:11 < bridge> <Ewan> sorry idk without looking at the code. im playing minecraft. surely u understand
04:57 < bridge> <cutetabby> yes i play terrafirmagreg for 28 hours a day
04:58 < bridge> <Ewan> 😃
05:22 < bridge> <melon> clientid shenanigans
05:45 < bridge> <Ewan> they changed at some point within the last 2 yrs i feel like
05:46 < bridge> <Ewan> it used to simply be lower id = stronger hook, and your character id (not client id) is reset on death
05:46 < bridge> <Ewan> idk for sure
05:46 < bridge> <Ewan> would have to look at prs
06:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
06:16 < bridge> <cutetabby> good morning bro
06:41 < bridge> <Ewan> gm
07:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @kollpotato: I don’t like fancy prompts they slow me down
08:07 < bridge> <lol1333_909> 62.122.215.19:8327 Ctgtg cheat
10:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oh thats RUS2 Linear indeed
10:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @MilkeeyCat the packer crashes when you try to pack a message that holds nullptrs as strings. Feature or bug?
10:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> looks like skill issue
10:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ok fair
10:30 < bridge> <milkeeycat> we can add an assert if you want to
10:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but it means you cant use the fancy curley { } init syntax to leave out fields and get empty strings
10:32 < bridge> <Ewan> just add default constructor
10:33 < bridge> <Ewan> I have no other context
10:33 < bridge> <Ewan> but that'd be my guess
10:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> the code is in C xd
10:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: do you want to treat null pointers as empty strings?
10:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i think it could be convienient
10:45 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but i am planning to add builder functions for all messages anyways so the struct { } init syntax is not needed
10:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/06/game_messages.html#NETMSGTYPE_SV_TUNEPARAMS tunes are technically sent as int but conceptually floats in the game
10:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** what type should we use?
10:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** could use floats and do some / 100 and * 100 shenigangs on unpack/pack or sent them as ints which would be more raw 
10:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** right now this segfaults ``DDNetMsgClStartInfo msg = {.name = "foo"};``
10:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so one has to do that ``DDNetMsgClStartInfo msg = {.name = "foo",.clan = "", .skin = ""}; ``
10:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** which to me seems like useless typing
10:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i like things being explicit
10:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but i get that using nullptr as empty string is morally debatable
10:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ye oke
10:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so wat about the loonie tunes
10:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> if they are used as floats, it makes sense to use floats?
10:52 < bridge> <0xdeen> just waiting for a review: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2231
10:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat yea could work i think i did that in pyson
10:52 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but u know .. floats bad
10:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> all my homies hate floats
10:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @0xdeen ??
10:53 < bridge> <melon> they did change that, if your dummy dies you keep strong
10:53 < bridge> <melon> 
10:53 < bridge> <melon> the behaviour is still the result of ClientId order tho. BµmM explained it to me once but i forgor

11:08 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oke
11:11 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: maybe I drank some stupid juice but I'm not sure I like `build_` functions :\
11:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> std::option<std::string> @chillerdragon
11:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Why not .\_.
11:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> it’s like Java it’s great
11:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Urhhhh
11:29 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Wait why is garbage collection a thing
11:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> new FactoryBuilderBuilder().build().newInstance().age(2)
11:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Is it expensive to free memory?
11:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Or is that there's no reference counting and it's finding all the references every GC
11:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not sure
11:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Allocate is expensive
11:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Not really
11:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Really
11:30 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> If allocation is too expensive you preallocate and chop it up
11:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Like bill gates expensive
11:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> - yourself
11:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Also java strings are
11:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Wide
11:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Why are wide strings still a thing
11:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @milkeeycat: otherwise it’s so much code on the user side .-.
11:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Not having a default constructor is very annoying
11:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> My class::????

12:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i removed the waiting on author
13:35 < bridge> <avolicious> That looks pretty interesting, have you looked at https://spacetimedb.com/ as well?
14:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @ryozuki: how is it prone to cheats?
14:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not doing /lock does the same

14:09 < bridge> <avolicious> merging now
14:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** can i turn off CFRM text in entities?
14:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oh its on the texture i see xd

17:49 < bridge> <jxsl13> all I read is JupsTeero 👀
18:10 < bridge> <Assa> just the normal 500 lines refactoring PR ...
18:37 < bridge> <kebscs> How close is it to editor integration
18:47 < bridge> <Assa> I already did it in a mock, that close
18:48 < bridge> <Assa> roby can probably give you a closeness measured in review hours
19:28 < bridge> <always> just makes cheating easier
19:28 < bridge> <always> well
19:28 < bridge> <always> skipping maps easier
19:29 < bridge> <always> doesnt change anything gamewise tho

20:04 < bridge> <kebscs> Still 80 open :justatest:
20:05 < bridge> <kebscs> It's stale bcs Noone did review
20:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder how much time till someone complains about an issue i closed
20:06 < bridge> <kebscs> Pr was rdy and wanted
20:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh it didnt take any minute xd
20:06 < bridge> <kebscs> :kek:
20:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> looking at comments i dont thin so
20:07 < bridge> <kebscs> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10248
20:07 < bridge> <kebscs> Idk what comment
20:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> heinrich
20:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway feel free to open the pr again in a new one if u want
20:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> this way it will probs get more attention
20:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> (also it had conflicts)
20:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> im done for today

20:09 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** F @Jupstar ✪ pc ded
20:10 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** closing a first contributers hello world pr is brutal #9806
20:10 < chillerbot1> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9806
20:10 < bridge> <kebscs> I think there was just confusion about how it, and the mod works
20:10 < bridge> <kebscs> Since he doesn't play the game
20:10 < bridge> <kebscs> I can reopen np
20:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> ChillerDragon see https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8189
20:15 < bridge> <kebscs> 1year+ looks pretty stale to me
20:15 < bridge> <kebscs> Maybe tag maintainers
20:15 < bridge> <kebscs> It got lost bcs so old
20:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> feel free to do it, my message is in general cuz most ppl cant reopen xd
20:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> ironically, me doing this brings attention to old matters :)
20:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> ChillerDragon, idk what drugs u on, but anyway github doesnt show an option for me to rebase, thats why i asked you xD
20:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1402717604610838669/image.png?ex=6894ee12&is=68939c92&hm=da8758992a9c7b2512cfed187a99ce4683c55ffba79e429c70514d02ff554038&
20:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
20:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> its chillerdragon2 lol
20:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> trolls
20:20 < bridge> <Ewan> please rebabe mr bob
20:21 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** there was a bug in bob @ryozuki i clicked on the notification too fast i think. It should have already auto rebased based on your comment 🤷
20:21 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lets wait 15 minutes to give it another try
20:22 < bridge> <Ewan> how do we know this is the *real* chillerdragon...
20:22 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you dont
20:22 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** !ping
20:22 < chillerbot1> pong
20:22 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** even chillerbot has a 1 in the name
20:24 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i appreciate your effort to reduce prs @ryozuki but maybe you went a bit too drastic on too many at once. I mean i only checked the ones where i was involved because i have no notifications for entire ddnet repo.
20:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess
20:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> but if i didnt do this
20:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> they would just stay there for more years
20:24 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** But i assume some "bump" comment on a few giving everyone time to react could be better. I am sure some newer contributors can now be forgotten forever and become sad :C 
20:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think this brings attention to them and authors can open new prs which get more attention
20:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes yes i understand the dilema
20:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> see the discussion on the issue heinrich opened
20:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i am afraight some might fall through the cracks and get no attention
20:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i opened issues for the ones i thought were useful xd
20:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** now there is no open reminder to ever check them again
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> no way we are actually asking the only maintainer actually merging stuff to slow down
20:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** even if they are not useful i dont think thats a good thing to do for a first contributor to just close
20:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i knew there would be backlash but i am ready for it
20:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thats the thing
20:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> that first contributor has had years to answer
20:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i am not worried about the backlash
20:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> they arent interested at all
20:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i am worried about the missing backlash
20:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** about the stuff that should have been reviewed instead of closed and is now forgotten
20:27 < bridge> <Ewan> imo it's better to have fewer pull requests so more maintainer attention can be allocated to each one. this is the only way to accomplish that, even if there are minor side effects, they can always be fixed
20:27 < bridge> <Ewan> need progress
20:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> i am asking you, **please open another pr with ur feature again if you feel like u should** or even better open an issue too
20:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** me?
20:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> pls comment that here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10633
20:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** no im fine
20:27 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i did not get hit by you
20:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt close most of ur prs cuz i know ur active
20:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is why i tagged u
20:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
20:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** <:poggers2:1008007455936094328>
20:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** still no maintainer btw
20:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur a dangerous entity
20:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** if i was maintainer we would already be at 20 open prs
20:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> u have bots do rebase ur prs
20:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
20:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** known botter
20:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** is #10633 the new #7777 ?
20:29 < chillerbot1> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10633
20:29 < chillerbot1> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7777
20:29 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** hot discussion on which prs to close
20:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** im so mad
20:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** bob never worked
20:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** not a single time
20:31 < bridge> <kollpotato> antibob?
20:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** no antibob is op
20:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i mean rebase bob
20:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw i knew heinrich would be the one complaining about this xd
20:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw we have 750 issues
20:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kollpotato live since almost a year! hours of development, maintenance and bugfixes!!! Not a single successful execution https://github.com/ChillerDragon/rebase-bob
20:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @ryozuki road to 666 issues
20:33 < bridge> <kebscs> Most can be closed
20:33 < bridge> <kebscs> They're just some random issues with no steps to reproduce
20:33 < bridge> <kebscs> And probably fixed when the issues are years old
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> if i do that heinrich would complain, but i agree
20:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kebscs start by closing #10633 if you have balls
20:33 < chillerbot1> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10633
20:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> i maintain the positon that if a issue is important enough it would get created again soon
20:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> pay for google ads
20:34 < bridge> <kebscs> :kek:
20:34 < bridge> <kebscs> I don't have the power
20:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> rebase bob will get gazillion users trust
20:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** trust
20:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so its gonna be worth it?
20:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> trust or rewrite in rust
20:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
20:35 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its one of few projects of mine not written in bash but in posix shell
20:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> what does bash even do
20:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> just a programming language in a terminal
20:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> 751 issues now
20:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i commented
20:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> if heinrich reopens all prs ill probs step away for some time
20:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
20:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> from reviewing
20:39 < bridge> <melon> :pepe_cry:
20:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> if a user that barely reviews stuff and only comments on select issues, but complains when a strong action is taken and sets back progress, its hard to keep motivated
20:40 < bridge> <Ewan> he is a tad pathologically avoidant to outside changes
20:40 < bridge> <Ewan> which is okay if he continued to put in the alternative work himself, but he doesn't
20:41 < bridge> <kebscs> Every time
20:41 < bridge> <Ewan> it seems he only wants to complain at this point
20:41 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe he doesn't have the will to work on ddnet himself, which i understand could be hard, but i feel like it's unfair for him to impede progress just because it's not being done his way
20:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kollpotato posix shell has less features than bash. For example fancy hash maps and other niceties.
20:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Ewan are you accusing heinrich of oyism?
20:48 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont know the history
20:48 < bridge> <Ewan> but oy seems inactive maintainer
20:48 < bridge> <Ewan> so i guess
20:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** history lesson with chilor
20:48 < bridge> <pioooooo> oh so this is officially tear :tear:. It really looked like sweat for me 😓
20:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** oy was afk
20:48 < bridge> <Ewan> inactive and authoritative maintainer*
20:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** all were mad
20:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** history lesson end
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> so real
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i am definitely accusing hein of that
20:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** !!!
20:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** accuser
20:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** how can u 
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
20:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** so mean
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> gotta be straightforward
20:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft oy wanted teeworlds to die, said game is complete
20:49 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** accusing someone of oyism is a serious matter
20:49 < bridge> <Assa> noo I need you 🙁
20:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10633
20:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can already tell heinrich one way or another will get his way and then disappear for months
20:50 < bridge> <melon> that issue got more interaction than the other 100 issues created in the last month
20:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> DRAM a
20:50 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @ryozuki do you think heinrich will vote for me becoming maintainer when i comment :popcorn: emoji into the issue?
20:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think he treats contributors as some kind of kids that will cry if their pr is closed due to inactivity
20:50 < bridge> <reitw> Did u guys see genie 3 ?
20:51 < bridge> <melon> what a weird way to say hello
20:51 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** fr

20:52 < bridge> <Assa> I believe every PR needs to be labeled before beeing closed, even if the label is Just needs more info or feature not wanted

20:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> im sure he is reading this
20:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1402726262123794462/image.png?ex=6894f622&is=6893a4a2&hm=72acf1deff5aabdc45ae1a1fc10a72045f06d09f558f1f2d9025903d2f275cca&

20:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> SOVEREIGN INDEPENDENCE
20:53 < bridge> <reitw> yeah I've been seeing a bit what you were posting sometimes, pretty cool 😄
20:53 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** <:bluekitty:346683497919807488> 
20:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Jupstar ✪ oh really is he?
20:54 < bridge> <kebscs> Both
20:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> chillerdragon: bash has hashmaps??? xd that seems redundant
20:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** xd
20:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> sometimes i want to make ddnet prs but i just dont feel like having lot of fun coding in c++
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he was. but now he has spanish gf and forgot he had an internal conflict about that
20:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> so i just review and merge
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> what are they called, associative arrays or something
20:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz i love ddnet
20:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> and dont want it stale
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> @kollpotato they're actually cool af and work on references iirc..
20:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> and robyt deserves someone to merge his beautiful prs
20:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> he puts lot of work
20:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kollpotato ``declare -A gaming;gaming["a"]=b`` ah stuff
20:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> references?
20:54 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ah wait i think i butchered the syntax
20:54 < bridge> <reitw> and me I'm having alot of fun with storage at work still :giga_chad: we've reached 15PB of storage
20:55 < bridge> <Ewan> we need consolidation of this channel's topic
20:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol
20:55 < bridge> <Ewan> xdd
20:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kollpotato just simple key value stuff
20:55 < bridge> <learath2> ChillerDragon, still want to become a maintainer?
20:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> i dont know anything about shells at all lmao
20:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** not as hyped as before
20:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but ye
20:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> why not
20:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> i vote for chiller
20:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i was hyped last weekend and the weekend before
20:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** was ready to review all prs
20:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> chiller if u keep pr count low i vote for u
20:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i will control ur 0.7 prs
20:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> they sussy baka
20:55 < bridge> <melon> xd
20:55 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i had time for ddnet
20:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** now i made other plans since i figured maintainer wont happen
20:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> time alwyas comes and goes
20:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but eventually i will look into ddnet again
20:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> even if u get maintainer
20:56 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ye 
20:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> chillerdragon: isnt it better to actually use python/lua for complex scripts rather than using bash? but i guess getting program output and passing them between is nicer
20:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> but syntax is ugly af
20:56 < bridge> <learath2> I have been veery busy mr dragon. Many stressful days
20:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur asking common sense from an insane person coding wise
20:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @ryozuki also my epic maintainer entrace got butchered by you closing hein prs i wanted to merge xd
20:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
20:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> is chiller insane?
20:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes
20:57 < bridge> <Ewan> lua and python rarely make it as easy to interface with the underlying system as bash does. they serve different roles
20:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> wtf
20:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> we are alike
20:57 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** hot
20:57 < bridge> <Ewan> the way i see it, shell scripting should only be heavily relied on if it's specifically appropriate to the system it's being run on
20:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah this makes sense
20:58 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: IRC
20:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust process api is rly nice
20:58 < bridge> <reitw> @blaiszephyr when src2
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> hi hein
20:58 < bridge> <learath2> If I know him he is probably scrolled waaaay up in this chat
20:58 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 dont worry lerato. But let me say this much. I was hyped to do 20 hour review streaks. Then I cried and then i became numb.
20:58 < bridge> <melon> :angy:
20:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> but using rust for scripts is not
20:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> xd
20:59 < bridge> <learath2> I can rehype you by throwing you a party
20:59 < bridge> <melon> wait i want a party too
20:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> invite matricks

20:59 < bridge> <Ewan> trump card
20:59 < bridge> <reitw> tf is this
20:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> My mobile internet volume
20:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I can book 1gb for free everytime I have <1GB left xD
21:00 < bridge> <learath2> No party for you, you are a fruit
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> he gets served at the partyt
21:00 < bridge> <melon> kinda rude towards a fruit ay
21:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u know if heinrich works in software related work?
21:00 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kollpotato i like bash for those tasks. rebase bob is just a simple gh cli wrapper i like calling cli tools from bash
21:00 < bridge> <reitw> you only have 15GB ? rip
21:00 < bridge> <reitw> I have like 256GB for 10€/month
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes, like every other country
21:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But germany is third world
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got 200gb
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> i barely use 10
21:01 < bridge> <kebscs> Probably, he treats ddnet as some high end corporate project where everything has to be perfect
21:01 < bridge> <kebscs> And it's 4fun open source project where we can revert any prs at any time
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol i said that because its other way around, at my company we try to keep pr count low and fast merge process
21:01 < bridge> <kebscs> And add anything
21:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> but wel i dont work at a big corporate
21:02 < bridge> <kebscs> I'm big corporate it's opposite
21:02 < bridge> <kebscs> Everything has to be discussed 20 times before action
21:02 < bridge> <learath2> No idea, he has always been rather secretive
21:02 < bridge> <Ewan> i think there is some truth to this. we really should not blame heinrich for having high standards. open source projects are very prone to turning to shit because of the abundance of new devs. the issue is that he's so insistent on it without being there to make it a reality
21:02 < bridge> <reitw> I'd say that's good, at least people can learn from stuff people like heinrich wants to do
21:02 < bridge> <melon> still waiting for the motivation to go hiking with heino and fokko
21:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> closing old prs is not lowering high standards
21:02 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @heinrich5991 still here?
21:02 < bridge> <kebscs> Good in what way
21:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> its simply making life easier to reviewers
21:03 < bridge> <learath2> No it's not. This is not a toy. We might not be making money but we still have users that we aim to keep happy
21:03 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** now that i am maintainer i can reopen #7777 right?
21:03 < chillerbot1> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7777
21:03 < bridge> <Ewan> ryo, i just replied to kebs
21:03 < bridge> <Ewan> unrelated to ur issue
21:03 < bridge> <melon> chileeeeer
21:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i've said my piece there already
21:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> a ok
21:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk fast chat
21:03 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
21:03 < bridge> <Ewan> derailed
21:03 < bridge> <reitw> you can easily learn good code and ask people why they've chosen to do smth like this etc.
21:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> im glad i turned this chat active
21:03 < bridge> <kebscs> Yes, my point is you can make users happy without it being absolutely prefect on the backend
21:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/rip-bozo-gif-22294771
21:03 < bridge> <Ewan> true
21:03 < bridge> <learath2> First act as maintainer is to get removed as maintainer. That would be funny
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> i love seeing idiots smoke cigars with their lungs
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> ur just supposed to taste it
21:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** guys chat is too fast! can someone turn followers only mode on?
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> LOL
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> superchat only
21:04 < bridge> <kebscs> I'm not saying to merge every bloat like tclient
21:04 < bridge> <reitw> what's the thing with heinrich ? he's doing a matricks move ?
21:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** whats the matricks move?
21:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you mean oy move
21:04 < bridge> <reitw> moving away
21:04 < bridge> <reitw> ah prob oy yes
21:04 < bridge> <melon> that would be oy
21:04 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** matricks move is picking new maintainer in 2002 and going afk
21:04 < bridge> <learath2> It doesn't need to be "absolutely perfect" but if we do spot something that can be improved, it has to be done. We won't merge something 4fun
21:05 < bridge> <kebscs> Exactly
21:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> he always finds nitpicks to stall prs, and since maintainers tend to avoid giving a resolution to prs that might not seem to get merged, by either closing them or merging them, they get stale
21:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> i specifically avoid merging stuff heirnich comments on in a way it seems not good
21:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> because i dont want to deal with it
21:05 < bridge> <kebscs> I didn't say merge 4fun prs, but that ddnet isn't a corporate job
21:05 < bridge> <learath2> He is still around on github, Idk why he doesn't chat in here anymore, but I'm guessing it's because this place is a little toxic
21:06 < bridge> <reitw> ah
21:06 < bridge> <reitw> sad, he's a cool guy
21:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah he is cool and rly good tech wise
21:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> but idk, he can get annoying in a way about seeming too correct all times
21:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:07 < bridge> <melon> its hard to find heinrich in a spot where he's objectively wrong xd
21:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> also i like his secretism, he rly acomplished perfect opsec from my pov, and i met him irl lol
21:08 < bridge> <kebscs> I won't look specifically for it for you, but if you only comment on things that you are 100% sure it might seem that way
21:08 < bridge> <kebscs> But you will only comment once a month
21:08 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, you won't find that happening a lot. And if it ever happens he'll usually always just tell you he was wrong
21:09 < bridge> <melon> isnt that what makes a good maintainer tho?
21:09 < bridge> <melon> if you're not sure you shouldnt approve/comment on something in general
21:09 < bridge> <melon> well "not comment" is wrong
21:09 < bridge> <melon> not sure how to explain what i mean in proper terms
21:09 < bridge> <kebscs> Good maintainer shouldn't be afraid to be wrong and be in touch with the community
21:09 < bridge> <Ewan> i may be responsible in part for driving him away and i'm sorry if i did do that
21:10 < bridge> <kebscs> Not someone who spawns once a month to close a pr
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i was just sick of seeing the same anti-progress things being said and done
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> which i think can be related to by anyone here
21:10 < bridge> <kebscs> My opinion
21:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @ryozuki go merge #10619
21:11 < chillerbot1> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10619
21:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wont lie sometimes i have the fear of doing smth wrong or merging smth which i shouldnt and i get removed, but then i think, well im not getting paid and im not gaining anything by this so just let it be, and we can always revert prs or reopen
21:11 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** heinrich approved
21:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i had opened an issue about closing prs the issue would get stale ironically
21:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> and ifi  had opened an issue about closing prs the issue would get stale ironically
21:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wont lie sometimes i have the fear of doing smth wrong or merging smth which i shouldnt and i get removed from maintainers, but then i think, well im not getting paid and im not gaining anything by this so just let it be, and we can always revert prs or reopen
21:11 < bridge> <kebscs> I mean u merged spec counter which was 50/50 from maintainers
21:12 < bridge> <kebscs> But most players like it
21:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can merge it, ddnet doesnt require 2 reviews for simple prs like those
21:12 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** even if it is #7777 related?
21:12 < chillerbot1> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7777
21:13 < bridge> <Ewan> in a healthy team of maintainers, you wouldn't be punished for that anyway, someone else would just step up a little bit so each maintainer individually can put more attention into what they review
21:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i am personally against adding code that is unused by ddnet itself, but imho adding a virtual keyword that doesnt do much in our code is of no concern to me
21:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh i got a dm warning from heinrich
21:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ono
21:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** rip ryo
21:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** you will be missed
21:16 < bridge> <milkeeycat> rip
21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> what??
21:16 < bridge> <Ewan> for??
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> the only time i got a dm warning from heinrich, it was about fussel. we all know how that turned out
21:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i feel like if i share it i might get banned but its not personal at all
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> it seems spineless and secretive
21:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> > I'd like to issue a warning regarding your mass-closure of PRs. please coordinate mass issue/PR actions and get approval for them before execution. this has happened before when you turned on github discussions and converted a lot of things into discussions which took quite some time to undo when it was deemed unwanted.
21:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
21:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> > additionally, I think it'd be nice if you could review the code of PRs you merge more closely, e.g. the one thing I just remember is the case of https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9488, I think the network message format doesn't really make sense, also the concerns about moderating were left unaddressed
21:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> > I talked to @learath2 and he agrees with my warning
21:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont care
21:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i am thinking of stepping down as maintainer anyway
21:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** bye ryo see you next month
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> holy shit it's actually happening
21:17 < bridge> <Ewan> man
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> why do i even bother sympathizing
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> heinrich, for total transparency, i want to state that you don't own this project
21:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** stepping down
21:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** is doing matricks after all
21:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> im no matricks
21:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> im a random
21:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> heinrich is the true owner seems
21:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> and idk why learath didnt say anything here xd
21:18 < bridge> <Ewan> it's literally open source
21:18 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ah i red the quote end wrong
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> if anyone "owns" it at any given time, it's the people putting the fucking work into it
21:19 < bridge> <Ewan> actually such backwards logic
21:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** no ryo dont step down
21:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: read* xdd
21:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** CATTO
21:19 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** !
21:21 < bridge> <kebscs> :kek: :kek: :kek:
21:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i answered this to heinrich
21:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Given the project seems to be governed by seemingly inactive people, i want to step down as a maintainer, i would like you to remove me from the ddnet org in github.
21:21 < bridge> <louis> is chillerbum maintainer now nice
21:21 < bridge> <kebscs> Nooo
21:21 < bridge> <Ewan> i think this could use some insight from deen
21:21 < bridge> <kebscs> Now we won't have anything merged
21:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> i jsut lost all interest man
21:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
21:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> how could i not
21:22 < bridge> <Ewan> hein did the same thing to chiller
21:22 < bridge> <Ewan> and to me
21:22 < bridge> <louis> wait wtf more drama
21:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> see you in a week
21:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh ill probs chat here, blabber about my os and rust
21:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i will not review or merge prs
21:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill just be another user
21:23 < bridge> <melon> keep us updated when you write a port so i can natively run malware (.exe files) on your OS
21:23 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** thats sadge
21:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont want to deal with this
21:23 < bridge> <milkeeycat> edlang NOT mentioned :feelsbadman:
21:23 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** <:pepedead:773232467658145822> 
21:23 < bridge> <learath2> I'm out smoking shisha with a friend. What did you need a comment on?
21:23 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** nice lerato vibin
21:23 < bridge> <kebscs> And he's still salty about the spec counter pr? :kek:
21:23 < bridge> <melon> i wish i would be fren
21:23 < bridge> <kebscs> After over 6 months?
21:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> noything, im just stepping down as maintainer cuz heinrich warned me see above
21:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> enjoy ur sisha
21:23 < bridge> <melon> learath if we ever meetup can we go shisha and whiskey somewhere
21:24 < bridge> <learath2> I did agree that you were going too fast, sorry. Idk what else to say here
21:24 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon im in
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> it's kind of short sighted
21:25 < bridge> <louis> Hmm i think most users would rather have active changes rather than everything die out
21:25 < bridge> <louis> 
21:25 < bridge> <louis> But there is the issue that a lot of prs just end up being bloaty
21:25 < bridge> <Ewan> going too fast in pursuit of making the future workload bearable for anyone is a very temporary setback
21:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lets get drunk and merge prs @learath2 
21:25 < bridge> <learath2> It's not a reflection on anything else. I felt your recent cleanup was too quick too rash. That's it, nothing personal
21:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 what flavor u smokin?
21:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> the other option was to stay the same for more years
21:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So I cannot do ID verification with a rooted phone, but with a android emulator xDD
21:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So stupid
21:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was the only one keeping prs under 100
21:25 < bridge> <kebscs> These were very old prs with 0 activity
21:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> crazy
21:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @ryozuki the other option was to review one by one 
21:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i wish there was an official forum where we could share our opinions on this matter
21:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but i do appreciate your under 100 effort a lot @ryozuki !
21:26 < bridge> <kebscs> Reopening them will bring more attention to the prs than them sitting for years with no comments
21:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i would not be surprised if it worked out to not be in heinrich's favor
21:26 < bridge> <learath2> Mixed berries, mint
21:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> my comments were ind of a review itself, no activity, no interest, close and let author put more interest
21:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> why should the project itself do it
21:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would agree with u if we were paid
21:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
21:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> weird
21:26 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 which city u in even? i cant keep up with u
21:27 < bridge> <melon> having the ghost ChillerDragonitis say that, crazy
21:27 < bridge> <kebscs> You can already see with spec counter pr, it was voted in a poll by community but he's still salty about it half a year later bcs it's not the way he wanted it
21:27 < bridge> <melon> the implementation was fine, the issue was the spec counter had an edgecase with our moderation
21:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> github discussions :kek:
21:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> heinrich is the hidden benevolent dictator
21:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> this was never truly a community guided project
21:27 < bridge> <louis> spec counter moderation could be fixed in the future tho
21:28 < bridge> <kebscs> Moderation thing got resolved quickly after
21:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon the implementation wasnt fine irrc
21:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** IIRC
21:28 < bridge> <Ewan> official forum would imply action be taken from the result
21:28 < bridge> <learath2> Would they really? Most people I talk to seem to prefer stability. The PRs being piled up is an issue, but closing them doesn't fix much
21:28 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe not within the next month or few
21:28 < bridge> <learath2> Istanbul rn, seeing friends and family
21:28 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @learath2 and whats your main base these days?
21:28 < bridge> <Ewan> how is any maintainer going to look at that list and work up the will to review? they can't. that's why nobody is reviewing
21:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> keeping them open does fix it? keeping it closed makes it easier for ppl who actually look at the pr list everyday
21:28 < bridge> <kebscs> I asked tsfreddie about it who implemented the spec stuff and it was fine
21:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> its crazy both of u get like "its rash" over a revertible action
21:29 < bridge> <kebscs> And also there's 0 problems with it
21:29 < bridge> <louis> I personally fell out of love w the game for the past few years just cause it seems theres nothing new i can explore ngl
21:29 < bridge> <louis> 
21:29 < bridge> <louis> i guess i could go get better at the things i already know, but idk just seems not fun anymore
21:30 < bridge> <learath2> Idk why you are reacting like this to what is just a warning. We can disagree on things, it's natural
21:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> why are you even warning me? why not just have a discussion? Would u have discussed this on a issue on gh that gets lost? let me tell it, it would have a vague discussion and nothing done
21:30 < bridge> <kebscs> Disagree and a warning are different
21:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> the warning made me feel childish
21:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> so i am reacting yes
21:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also have a small power that is that im one of the few active mergers
21:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it doesnt seem worth it
21:31 < bridge> <Ewan> a warning behind closed doors, with a condescending and threatening demeanor, to someone who is putting in volunteer work purely out of passion, interest and good faith
21:31 < bridge> <Ewan> i wonder why that might peeve someone!
21:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> it obviously shows we are not on equal grounds
21:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** I as a maintainer vote for ryos warning to be liften <:f3:397431188941438976> 
21:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** liften!
21:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** lifted xd
21:32 < bridge> <Ewan> liften
21:32 < bridge> <learath2> It didn't seem all that condescending, and it was handled in private which I think is better. Idk if I was doing something wrong I'd rather be warned in private
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> he wasn't doing anything wrong
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> there's no rule that says "don't merge stuff fast"
21:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** its not merged 
21:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> and a warning from 2 inactive members
21:33 < bridge> <kebscs> Not even merge just 1 click to close/open
21:33 < bridge> <Ewan> yea that too
21:33 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** historic event
21:34 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** anyways enuff irc goofing i will find some dinner
21:34 < bridge> <learath2> I think this is the bigger issue here. None of you even really think we should have any say over anything to begin with
21:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> which will result in heinrich getting his way like always
21:34 < bridge> <louis> it is kinda weird that heinrich speaks as if he manages the project while he still has no admin role here, nothing official saying so, etc
21:34 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe if the grounds for warning were better understood by maintainers you wouldn't have this issue. sadly the admins are not ready for the discussion required to establish said rules
21:34 < bridge> <Ewan> it would require addressing their shortcomings and making the consensus that they are wrong even more visible
21:35 < bridge> <Ewan> so this is the fate of ddnet?
21:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> a say in how to manage active  prs from peopel who dont interact with prs?
21:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i rly didnt think i did smth that outrageous, **closing years old prs** but it seems like i did
21:36 < bridge> <learath2> I've been merging recently, heinrich has too. And you too are just very recently active
21:36 < bridge> <learath2> Not like everyone was very active like 5 months ago
21:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> ive been steadily reviewing prs every week or so
21:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats unfair
21:36 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe i am unjustly lumping deen and robyt3 in with the group there
21:37 < bridge> <Ewan> > I've been merging recently, heinrich has too
21:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i do not believe you
21:37 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe you could find a few issues and prs to say otherwise
21:37 < bridge> <Ewan> but as a whole, ryo has been doing more than you both have for at least a few months
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @ryozuki chill
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Just set a timeout
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
21:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> "Is pr still relevant? else i close in ~3 weeks"
21:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> prs were years old
21:39 < bridge> <learath2> I debugged chillers weird ci issue just a week ago, cmon. If you said I was inactive 2 months ago I would 100% agree with you
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes but then they at least have a chance to answer. For my pr I'd have probably ignored it and said nothing
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> As idc
21:40 < bridge> <kebscs> This is literally being inactive :kek:
21:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> they had years to do stuff, but i guess
21:40 < bridge> <learath2> Like I actually do not understand a warning that was written completely matter of fact has escalated so much. We thought you were going a little too fast. Is that a crime to say
21:40 < bridge> <Ewan> I'm not going to act like I've been on top of the issues and PRs myself, but it's still less than Ryo, and in a situation like this, that's where precedence lies imo
21:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can just say that in the github issue about that, its weird to send me a warning like this for me atleast
21:41 < bridge> <melon> heinrich's Discord role is an Admin role.
21:41 < bridge> <melon> Heinrich has been part of the teeworlds team for more than a decade, and has been an Administrator and Maintainer for DDNet for a long time as well.
21:41 < bridge> <melon> i dont think a Discord role should determine his stance within the Community
21:41 < bridge> <learath2> Ok, this is actively ruining my night. I actually feel uncomfortable and this feels very hostile
21:41 < bridge> <kebscs> Why is melon #1 hein glazer
21:41 < bridge> <louis> He barely talks here though
21:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i also kinda irritates me it comes from inactive people
21:41 < bridge> <kebscs> Every time there's any discussion melon says "but he did a lot in the past" and doesn't take any criticism
21:41 < bridge> <melon> because i've yet to have a discussion with Heinrich where he was wrong. I respect his knowledge
21:42 < bridge> <learath2> Let's talk about this tomorrow. I'm making my friend uncomfortable too
21:42 < bridge> <louis> its not about being wrong or right, its literally just abt presence sometimes
21:42 < bridge> <melon> i also dont see where i agree with his actions
21:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @ryozuki you being on matricks gh profile is so badass lmao
21:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.35918e4b-70b9-48ed-9c5b-11978b1ca3b7.png
21:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have been part of ddnet for more than a decade too
21:42 < bridge> <Ewan> someone put it to a real vote with a real outcome so we can stop bickering
21:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> but io am still here, active
21:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> epic lore
21:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> he came  to discord voice
21:43 < bridge> <kebscs> You're yet to have any discussion bcs he's so inactive
21:43 < bridge> <Ewan> if u walk away tonight and avoid addressing it again, that literally just proves the point
21:43 < bridge> <kebscs> You can't be wrong if you don't talk
21:43 < bridge> <melon> i had my fair share of discussions with him, trust me ^^
21:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
21:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i am more prone of being wrong, or merging smth someone dislikes, because i am more active than you
21:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> u will just casually appear when u notice smth u dont like
21:44 < bridge> <jxsl13> make me god admin, I have the necessary distance 👀
21:44 < bridge> <kebscs> That doesn't mean he's always right
21:44 < bridge> <melon> never said he is
21:44 < bridge> <kebscs> That's the point of having multiple maintainers so everything can be discussed
21:44 < bridge> <Ewan> this is going nowhere
21:45 < bridge> <Ewan> action is needed
21:45 < bridge> <kebscs> Youre treating hein as know it all with always the last word
21:45 < bridge> <Ewan> talk is not that
21:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> you are a bit wrong though, u wouldnt be entirely correct if u have so much ppl disliking you, and humans arent perfect, he is not entirely right or wrong, but he has the power to make his "rights" become the de facto for the project
21:45 < bridge> <kebscs> "but he did a lot in the past" is exactly that
21:46 < bridge> <melon> i'm being pulled out of context here, please read the message i replied to.
21:46 < bridge> <melon> i also spoke from my personal experience, not an objective de-facto in any way
21:46 < bridge> <kebscs> We aren't speaking about your experience
21:47 < bridge> <kebscs> That's good you had it but it's a doffent situation
21:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway,  i am not heinrich so i cant impose my way of doing things even if pushing them partially, so ill become inactive maintainer wise, you can feel free to become active to replace me or find someone willing to spend time on a project that feels stale and inactive pr wise.
21:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
21:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> If i were a new contributor and saw year old prs, unless you are as big as llvm, i would say u do not care much about prs. and i probs would leave
21:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> When i joined we barely had over 30 open prs
21:47 < bridge> <kebscs> And for every thing hein does you always say but he was active in the past or whatever
21:48 < bridge> <pioooooo> I think the problem is just we have too few maintainers. I would love to see more maintainer added and say require two approve before merge
21:48 < bridge> <learath2> What is this action you want? Let's just be transparent here. Newer purple names dislike how we run the project. There is no need to be obscure.
21:48 < bridge> <learath2> 
21:48 < bridge> <learath2> Yes progress is slow, intentionally so. We prefer stability over novelty. Kebs likes his features being merged quickly because it can be unmerged. We just don't agree with that way of doing things
21:48 < bridge> <kebscs> I can look up pr from months ago where I got discouraged by hein to do any work and melons response here was also he's a good guy he was nice in past
21:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 thats unfair point, u dont even review or merge robyt prs which are qol and fixes stuff, his prs get months old if not for me lmao
21:49 < bridge> <melon> https://tenor.com/view/imnota-cat-fubuki-gif-18573529
21:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> progress is not itself slow, u are simply not active there
21:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> and using it as an excuse now imho
21:49 < bridge> <learath2> I literally merged like 4 robyt3 prs in this month
21:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> last month he had 48 prs
21:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
21:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> am I seeing anti-government statements here?
21:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> good job
21:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Is there revolutionary sentiment to be weeded out?
21:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok idk if he had 48 prs or commits but he has way more
21:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway
21:50 < bridge> <kebscs> You have 15 merges in a year, Roby himself made 50 prs in a month idk what your point is
21:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> pointless discussion cuz this wont change
21:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1402740754610389174/image.png?ex=689503a1&is=6893b221&hm=30656456245dcd5b3e66192fedf9c75abda8cd3f3812eca5ab2c460d0eda37aa&

21:51 < bridge> <jxsl13> I want all maintainers to step down and see the world burn.

21:52 < bridge> <Assa> guys every merge/review is valuable, even if you just do 1 a month. Keep in mind we all have a RL and some have more or less time.
21:52 < bridge> <learath2> This is the point, they just don't really want to say it for some reason
21:52 < bridge> <kebscs> Nothing, you're a nice guy, but saying someone is active bcs he merged 0,1% of prs is stretch
21:52 < bridge> <kebscs> Nothing, you're a nice guy, but saying someone is active bcs he merged 0,1% of prs is a stretch
21:52 < bridge> <melon> context.
21:52 < bridge> <melon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10445#issuecomment-3024242742
21:52 < bridge> <melon> 
21:52 < bridge> <melon> > his comment? doesnt sound passive aggressive at all :o
21:53 < bridge> <pioooooo> @learath2 I want this
21:53 < bridge> <kebscs> He does sound passive aggressive and it's same tone as in the just a warning
21:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u add that we wont have prs merged at all
21:53 < bridge> <learath2> Everyone here has active times and downtimes. The only person that is close to full time active is Robyt
21:53 < bridge> <pioooooo> let's find solution to the issues and just stay calm
21:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know the solution, i just dont do anything, its easy
21:54 < bridge> <louis> facts, there is nothing wrong with inactivity, i think some ppl here are missing the point
21:54 < bridge> <kebscs> OK that's why there's multiple maintainers
21:54 < bridge> <kebscs> And you're warning them for doing it
21:54 < bridge> <kebscs> When they're doing it in good faith
21:55 < bridge> <melon> look at the teeworlds repo and what happens when there's only a single maintainer who doesnt care (apart from roby and heinrich being able to merge securityfixes)
21:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> im sorry i get a bit heated sometimes, ill just think coldly that i gain nothing from this, or from merging/revewing stuff, but well who wouldnt about something they care deeply about, its just sad to see ddnet become the teeworlds i despise maintainerwise
21:55 < bridge> <Assa> I am willing to help you label issues if this helps
21:55 < bridge> <melon> look at the teeworlds repo and what happens when there's only a single maintainer who doesnt care (apart from roby and heinrich being able to merge securityfixes afaik)
21:55 < bridge> <kebscs> So why are you siding with hein when it's exactly what happening right now
21:58 < bridge> <melon> am i
21:59 < bridge> <melon> anyway, this is more of a discussion for a private talk - not a public chatroom.
21:59 < bridge> <melon> 
21:59 < bridge> <melon> i'll watch some DnD.
21:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> I want a democratic system to be introduced without anyone having the last word on any issue and pr. how does rust do that?
21:59 < bridge> <kebscs> Yes
22:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust has different groups of experts with more authority on different parts of project, but rust also has 1000x the amount of contributors and reviewers
22:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> also features go through a RFC that gets discussed
22:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> what projects do have less maintainers? gitea?
22:02 < bridge> <learath2> Rust does that by leaving the cargo fmt issue open for 7 years
22:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust only has 800 prs open
22:03 < bridge> <louis> ngl just write good code bug maintainers and you'll probably get your stuff in
22:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet, barely with a team of 3 , 110
22:03 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> guys when will Firefox follow XDG conventions?
22:03 < bridge> <learath2> Also the drain_vec pr I've been waiting on has been open for 10 years now
22:03 < bridge> <louis> but would be nice to go and clean up the issues and prs and have some sort of roadmap for good features to implement
22:04 < bridge> <kebscs> That worked for me, Roby is the best
22:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> you can do it already if u want and have the will to spend time on that
22:04 < bridge> <louis> Roadmap would be super helpful actually imo
22:04 < bridge> <kebscs> But if something is not in Roby's expertise there wasn't anyone other than Ryo
22:04 < bridge> <louis> rn its just ppl making qol fixes and small features
22:04 < bridge> <louis> itd be nice to have  ppl collaborate on larger features that both players and maintainers would actually want
22:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> u cant, we have no maintainers at all
22:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> u cant force maintainers to code what u want
22:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> they are volunteers
22:05 < bridge> <kebscs> Larger features are in prs but are stalled bcs no discussion from maintainers
22:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> we cant even agreee on opening issues before features
22:05 < bridge> <kebscs> That's why there's only small fixes
22:05 < bridge> <kebscs> Anything bigger is a waste of time currentlt
22:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well, since learath wants slow progress, me not reviewing or merging is favorable to that opinion, so it aligns with the project that i leave
22:07 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's just one opinion, nit a consensus
22:07 < bridge> <jxsl13> not
22:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> it is the opinion of both learath and heinrich, the ones who actually decide on stuff like this most of the time, because other maintainers dont have such authority
22:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> there ws never consensus in this project
22:07 < bridge> <louis> idk, should just make the best with the level of activity we have rn
22:07 < bridge> <louis> 
22:07 < bridge> <louis> promote transparency and a clear sense of direction instead of arguing type shi
22:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also even get called back by heinrich always when i ask the actual  players if they want stuff
22:08 < bridge> <learath2> Let's get that discussion going then. Maybe lets plan out 2 new big features for the next 6 months. We need to find people willing to code them though
22:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> he always says they dont know what htey want and such
22:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> it rly sets me back
22:09 < bridge> <kebscs> What about existing pr features?
22:09 < bridge> <kebscs> Tune lock?
22:09 < bridge> <learath2> Tune lock is just such a confusing concept. Is it really actually useful? It feels like a nasty hack to achieve some effect
22:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> take their authority and have all maintainers have the same authority. given the expertise of specific maintainers, it is a given that others will follow their lead in their field of expertise.
22:10 < bridge> <kebscs> It opens up a lot of map ideas with little downside
22:10 < bridge> <kebscs> Or no downside
22:10 < bridge> <kebscs> Just clearity on what tunes u get
22:10 < bridge> <kebscs> Just clarity on what tunes u get
22:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway i left the team myself now, cuz i know myself and i dont want to waste my time anymore
22:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> have a good night
22:11 < bridge> <melon> good night Ryo, take care ^^
22:11 < bridge> <jxsl13> We will get you back, my dude
22:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> i love ur blog ryo
22:11 < bridge> <kollpotato> pls post more
22:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> with force
22:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> on may the 4th
22:12 < bridge> <louis> probably best to have it in some issue or forum type post if you think it's actually a good idea
22:13 < bridge> <louis> maybe a gh issue every half year or so
22:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=259356
22:13 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh my god it might be finally happening?
22:13 < bridge> <kebscs> And the feature is literally accepted in gh discussion for ages
22:14 < bridge> <kebscs> Do we need discussions for discussions
22:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> that is a 21 year old Firefox issue, and it's like a really basic thing too lol
22:14 < bridge> <kebscs> For every maintainer disagreeing?
22:14 < bridge> <Assa> Currently @robyt3  and me are planning render generalization and making the editor use render layer
22:14 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> that is an open 21 year old Firefox issue, and it's like a really basic thing too lol
22:15 < bridge> <louis> the idea was accepted, the implementation details idk i didnt like (from my mapper pov)
22:15 < bridge> <Assa> I never directly planned it out with him tho, I am implementing and doing a mock, he is reviewing :kek:
22:16 < bridge> <learath2> Not really, unless any maintainer heavily disagrees it won't be blocking
22:18 < bridge> <kebscs> So why is the pr so stale
22:18 < bridge> <kebscs> The previous fokkonaut implementation too
22:19 < bridge> <learath2> I don't like the way it achieves the goal. I wouldn't exactly block it but I'm not really enthusiastic about it either
22:19 < bridge> <kebscs> Makes sense, but here are others
22:20 < bridge> <learath2> I would guess the others feel so too. Idk what to tell you, I think it'll be one more feature that just won't get all that much use. Especially when a mapper directly just told you it's not great
22:20 < bridge> <louis> wait i meant the idea is good but the tile implementation isnt clean in the way i wish it would be
22:20 < bridge> <kebscs> 2 mappers here told me they would love it
22:21 < bridge> <Assa> I still want to review this, reminder that we have tune zone enter text which is useful here
22:22 < bridge> <learath2> A tune lock? I thought you meant the implementation of a tune lock to achieve the effect isn't great. Mb
22:22 < bridge> <learath2> So maybe just getting them to make a map around it would be a great start
22:22 < bridge> <learath2> I would be more inclined to merge it if there was a release quality map for it
22:22 < bridge> <kebscs> For it to not be merged?
22:23 < bridge> <kebscs> My work goes to waste so we want waste mappers time too
22:23 < bridge> <learath2> Ok, then it doesn't get merged. Idk what to tell you. I feel it won't be used. You tell me it will be, but neither you nor the mappers want to spend time on it
22:24 < bridge> <learath2> It only confirms to me that it's unlikely to get used
22:24 < bridge> <kebscs> I can't map, mappers aren't tech savvy to use github and won't spend time for uncertain feature
22:24 < bridge> <kebscs> There wasn't a new gameplay feature in how long
22:24 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> not like things need to be super polished for testing
22:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'd trust a mapper to make more interesting test parts than devs
22:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> or at least ones that flow better
22:25 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> even if they're just test parts
22:25 < bridge> <learath2> The feature is already ready. There is no need for the mappers to code anything
22:25 < bridge> <robyt3> Merging a feature that is not likely to be used or has exploits not found due to lack of testing goes on maintainers' and admins' time instead
22:26 < bridge> <kebscs> Downloading it of github etc
22:27 < bridge> <kebscs> Idk there's no win here with how it's all structured
22:27 < bridge> <kebscs> Small fixes and qol it is
22:27 < bridge> <louis> yo target switches will be cool once i get time to finish it 🥺
22:28 < bridge> <louis> @essigautomat did u still want to do the sounds for it btw
22:28 < bridge> <learath2> There is a clear way to get this one merged.
22:28 < bridge> <kebscs> I have to map myself or find someone to make it
22:28 < bridge> <kebscs> Which idk anyone and I can't map so there's no way
22:28 < bridge> <learath2> I'm sure louis will deliver a map with his target switches, riight?
22:29 < bridge> <learath2> You just told me 2 mappers thought it would be a good idea. They might be a good starting point to contact
22:35 < bridge> <Assa> oh yeah :justatest:
22:36 < bridge> <Assa> !remind me 08:00 tomorrow

22:39 < bridge> <kebscs> rip
22:39 < bridge> <Assa> @learath2 Hecta is gone for now 🙁
22:41 < bridge> <kebscs> bruh tune lock requested since 2022
22:41 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1402753489460920340/image.png?ex=68950f7d&is=6893bdfd&hm=84c85a182bddbb913179cbea4007eaad1d3a68e96d1ea09657d43a2982e212df&
22:41 < bridge> <kebscs> and maintainers still cant decide
22:41 < bridge> <kebscs> theres definetly nothing wrong
22:41 < bridge> <pilonpl> My theory is that we gonna get GTA6 before GTA7
22:51 < bridge> <learath2> No offense but it's like 4 people. Only 1 of them a mapper
22:52 < bridge> <learath2> It's not can't decide. Get me a map and I'll merge it
22:55 < bridge> <Ewan> i know you're siding with heinrich in this case but you've proven way less obstructive to progress than he has. specifically what I am requesting is some sort of consensus on whether heinrich should have his authority over new PRs lessened or removed.
22:55 < bridge> <Ewan> you can usually be persuaded because you continually have a little stake in the project. he is completely checked out and still insists
22:57 < bridge> <Ewan> 4 is better than zero but ryo and kebs have a great point. i'll reiterate that what you do is appreciated, but we should not have to attribute slow development to it being "the way it is", we really need to be more insistent on tests if stability is the factor
22:57 < bridge> <Ewan> almost no incoming PRs come with unit tests.
22:57 < bridge> <kebscs> can try but its a pain
22:58 < bridge> <Ewan> before merging theyr should either write a test or make a good case to why a test is not needed for the pr
22:58 < bridge> <Ewan> before merging they should either write a test or make a good case to why a test is not needed for the pr
22:58 < bridge> <melon> the tune locks are fun to play around with
22:59 < bridge> <louis> i hate tests
22:59 < bridge> <louis> also theres not a good testing framework which is the bigger issue imo
23:00 < bridge> <louis> I dont think testing matters much unless its for physics changes, for which we basically have no testing framework
23:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> make me a maintainer
23:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> i have one commit
23:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> potatos have no rights
23:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> 🥔
23:04 < bridge> <kebscs> maybe you can cook up a map ? :owo:
23:04 < bridge> <kebscs> i see you have made the great map "2025"
23:04 < bridge> <melon> most of them are just roleplay gimmicks to be honest, making actual gameplay with it... hmm
23:04 < bridge> <melon> maybe as a quirk for dummy maps
23:05 < bridge> <melon> i'll play around with it tomorrow
23:05 < bridge> <melon> (i was moral support through 95% of it)
23:05 < bridge> <Assa> do I count as a mapper?
23:06 < bridge> <melon> also tune locks would then introduce a new tile, rendering them as the default tune_zone would be annoying if they're actually incoorperated within the gameplay
23:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> 👎 👎 👎 👎
23:06 < bridge> <melon> also tune locks would then introduce a new tile, rendering them as the default tune_zone would be annoying if they're actually incoorperated within the gameplay (backwards compat or smth)
23:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> racist
23:07 < bridge> <jxsl13> vegetable
23:07 < bridge> <kebscs> How do other new tiles did this before?
23:08 < bridge> <melon> i think the same thing happened with the weaponshields
23:08 < bridge> <Assa> I just got randomly merged by deen
23:08 < bridge> <kebscs> Shield is an entity so it's different
23:08 < bridge> <kebscs> Entities have to be shown, tiles have design
23:08 < bridge> <robyt3> I agree, in an ideal world we would have tests for almost everything already so adding tests for new features would be easier; and conversely not adding tests would be harder to excuse. I think all new map tiles should definitely also have coverage in the integration test before being merged. The script should allow adding more tests relatively easily. I think the "smoke test" is complex enough as is and we should rather test behaviors individually 
23:08 < bridge> <melon> true, mb. mixed them up
23:09 < bridge> <melon> tho that was an annoyance if you played on an older client with missing weaponshield entities
23:09 < bridge> <melon> tho that was an annoyance if you played with missing weaponshield entities
23:09 < bridge> <melon> tho that was an annoyance if you played with missing weaponshield entities - **gosh i should reread what i type before pressing enter**
23:10 < bridge> <pioooooo> my game assets don't have weaponshields :(
23:10 < bridge> <Ewan> is there a guideline on the wiki for writing unit tests? i know a lot of that developer info may be slightly less than up to date but it should be better than nothing
23:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't think the average outside contributor will always grasp why testing is important
23:11 < bridge> <Ewan> it's about momentum as much as it is about making sure the specific change is stable
23:11 < bridge> <robyt3> There's only a checkbox on PRs, but it's not in the contributing guide yet I think
23:11 < bridge> <robyt3> For new `base` functions tests are mostly required
23:11 < bridge> <kebscs> How do we test tiles though
23:12 < bridge> <melon> roby, were weaponshields merged as they are now with the knowledge that older entities are missing them? was there a discussion about that?
23:12 < bridge> <kebscs> There's coverage map only
23:12 < bridge> <robyt3> Probably add a map for every tile individually
23:13 < bridge> <robyt3> Or test combinations of tiles in one map by configuring it differently with settings if that's possible and useful to avoid duplicate code/map :thonk:
23:13 < bridge> <melon> tune_locks have a similar impact on gameplay, and if older/custom entities are missing them that may result in a lot of frustration in newer maps that utilize them.
23:13 < bridge> <kebscs> Idk if that can be resolved for tiles
23:14 < bridge> <kebscs> Maps do have design and playing with full overlay entities is optional
23:14 < bridge> <melon> i wish we could just ship newer entities to older clients with a `patch` button of sorts xd
23:14 < bridge> <Ewan> that'll depend on the tile but in concept you want to write a test that you can throw a lot of different inputs at and still get the expected result. maybe give varying tee velocities, strong/weak relationships if it's related to multiple tees, i'd kinda need a more concrete scenario but therein lies the challenge
23:14 < bridge> <robyt3> You mean https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4728 ? I don't think I was involved in this
23:14 < bridge> <Ewan> this is why so many projects don't test, and then they die out because the maintenance cost gets so high because everything is subtly broken
23:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i'm sorry if this request implies we have to use critical thinking abilities moreso than maybe we are used to
23:15 < bridge> <louis> testing propaganda
23:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i'm sorry that this request implies we have to use critical thinking abilities moreso than maybe we are used to
23:16 < bridge> <melon> > This is in my opinion another reason to let the map overwrite the game assets.
23:16 < bridge> <melon> > I will open an issue for that...
23:16 < bridge> <melon> 
23:16 < bridge> <melon> codedev, where issue :(
23:17 < bridge> <louis> u can
23:17 < bridge> <louis> Just overlay the portion of their existing entities w a new 64x64
23:17 < bridge> <robyt3> https://app.codecov.io/gh/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/src?flags%5B0%5D=unittests
23:17 < bridge> <robyt3> Only 97.73% of our testing code is tested :justatest:
23:23 < bridge> <melon> so it seems it was pretty much accepted that we cant stay compatible to everything
23:23 < bridge> <melon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1402763960788451368/image.png?ex=6895193e&is=6893c7be&hm=52c2b7e3e9b9ffed5432a442b333da08095da2e364d58411478a8b3ae699f7d7&
23:24 < bridge> <melon> anyway, i can see tune_lock being utilized ingame - i'll see if i can make a testmap for usecases i find
23:26 < bridge> <soulyvevo> chillerdragon: i found a way to zooz on fng
23:29 < bridge> <kebscs> yippie
23:42 < bridge> <Ewan> for reference
23:42 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1402768941423788183/image.png?ex=68951de1&is=6893cc61&hm=ac984ba9a740021770c915e66833c032076a0e96ec63473b734ade6c4c273a59&
23:43 < bridge> <Ewan> the coverage is actually not awesome
23:53 < bridge> <kebscs> yea theres no backwards compat for tiles
23:53 < bridge> <kebscs> only for entites
23:54 < bridge> <kebscs> live freeze tile doesnt show up
23:54 < bridge> <kebscs> yea theres no backwards compat for tiles bcs of map design
