23:49 < _KinG> on the host
23:49 < _KinG> direct admin cp
23:49 < _KinG> http://king.bor691.ir/home/king/master/default.html
23:50 < _KinG> this should be the file
23:50 < _KinG> but it is not
23:50 < _KinG> and how can i make a new page like: king.bor691.ir/king
23:51 < _KinG> ?
23:51 <@deen> i have never worked with directadmin, i have no idea
23:51 < _KinG> how do you do it on your host>
23:51 < _KinG> ?
23:52 <@deen> how do i do what?
23:52 < _KinG> create a new directory
23:52 <@deen> i read the description of directadmin but still don't understand what that is^^
23:52 < _KinG> on your host
23:52 <@deen> mkdir
23:53 < _KinG> like ddnet.tw/deen
23:53 < _KinG> and then upload a page there?
23:53 <@deen> yes
23:53 <@deen> i do it all by hand
23:53 <@deen> hm, actually by now i've transitioned to jakyll
23:54 <@deen> jekyll*
23:54 < _KinG> from which panle?
23:54 < _KinG> panel*
23:54 <@deen> No panel, it's just this: http://jekyllrb.com/
23:55 < _KinG> and
23:55 < _KinG> i don't know how to explain
23:56 < _KinG> what is the name of /deen like in here king.bor691.ir/deen?
23:56 < _KinG> it's directory?i call it right? ^^
23:56 <@deen> i don't know^^
23:56 <@deen> it's just a part of the uri
23:56 <@deen> mostly it's interpreted as a directory, so it's fine to call it that
23:56 < _KinG> i want /deen   to be a html file
23:57 < _KinG> i uploaded the file
23:57 <@deen> make a directory deen and create index.html in there?
23:57 < _KinG> but there it is .. no file
23:57 <@deen> maybe bor knows more about that?
23:57 <@deen> i really have the feeling i can't help you there
23:57 < _KinG> yep bor knows but he isn't online ^^
23:58 < _KinG> http://king.bor691.ir/home/king/master/default.html
23:58 < _KinG> this is the file i uploaded
23:58 < _KinG> but page says there is no file
23:59 <@deen> maybe you uploaded the file to the wrong directory
23:59 <@deen> sorry, i can't help you anymore, i'm busy
23:59 < _KinG> i uploaded it there and the panel created this link and gave it to me
23:59 < _KinG> ok sorry
