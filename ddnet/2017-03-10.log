00:52 <@heinrich5991> deen: how do/did you distribute the mod password to the moderators?
00:54 <@heinrich5991> and how exactly is the config file distributed to all the servers?
00:54 <@deen> heinrich5991: i haven't done that for quite some time
00:54 <@deen> config files are in git
00:55 <@deen> so we edit the config on ddnet.tw and run ./git-update-files-only.sh
00:55 <@heinrich5991> are the updates immediately applied or does it take a server restart?
00:55 <@deen> server restart
00:55 <@heinrich5991> mh...
00:55 <@deen> if it's urgent, I ssh into server and do "echo newstuff > servers/*.fifo"
00:56 <@heinrich5991> ok
00:56 <@heinrich5991> so it would theoretically be possible for east to give out passwords in an on-demand fashion?
00:56 <@heinrich5991> (or someone else)
00:56 <@deen> I guess
00:57 <@heinrich5991> a moderator asks for the new password, east generates one and puts it into the config and the relevant region's fifio
00:57 <@heinrich5991> fifo
00:57 <@deen> sure
00:57 <@heinrich5991> who has ssh access? east, ...? who can I bug with this tomorrow?
00:57 <@deen> you can have ssh access and do it yourself
00:59 <@heinrich5991> that sounds like some other unrelated work is also coming in my direction :D
00:59 <@heinrich5991> but I guess I'd rather do that than bug someone else
01:00 <@deen> just the work you want to do
05:49 < Learath2> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=4983 Seems people aren't too pleased about the timer
05:49 < Learath2> necropotame: maybe we should make it optional to have sync
07:10 < Ryozuki> deen, i could do that, on evening
07:13 < Ryozuki> oh i mean @heinrich5991 xD
08:04 < necropotame> Learath2, I saw that. Maybe we can disable it by a boolean, and latter put this boolean true if animated zones are detected
08:06 < necropotame> I don't like to force mappers to add a config variable if they want to use a particular feature
08:08 < necropotame> @heinrich5991, you said that someone (qshar or something like this) write a code for animated unhookable. Where I can found this?
08:47 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: meh. I'd be against making that per-map
08:47 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: haven't seen that, sorry
09:49 <@EastByte> why not simply using a less frequent timer that only announces every 10 minutes or so
09:58 < necropotame> They will ever more complain
10:08 <@EastByte> well, I'm complaining that people are sticking to older ddnet versions only because they don't like sdl2
10:09 <@deen> no, because sdl2 doesn't work as well for them
10:09 <@deen> so fixing the sdl2 bugs would be a good solution
10:17 <@EastByte> from what I see there are bugs with mouse/keyboard input
10:17 <@deen> and with lower fps / more input delay
10:18 <@EastByte> any way to reproduce?
10:18 <@deen> no idea
12:37 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #663: Fix handling of default passwords (master...pr_ddnet_fix_default_pws) https://git.io/vywcR
13:41 < grenade_pro> hi , i have a little question if you have free time ... is there possible to use this 
13:41 < grenade_pro> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/client/client.h#L150
13:41 < grenade_pro> in gameclient.cpp ? i mean m_aInputs or int m_CurrentInput[2];
13:42 < grenade_pro> i dont know how i must call it in gameclient.cpp
13:44 < Ryozuki> int m_CurrentInput[2]; declares an integer array with size 2
13:45 < Ryozuki> what you want to do exactly?
13:45 < grenade_pro> i want use it in gameclient.cpp
13:47 < Ryozuki> idk what it does at all didn't saw whole code, but usually i would say it checks where m_CurrentInput[0] is 1 or 0 (true or false) which means if it's pressed or not
13:47 < Ryozuki> you need to check*
13:47 < Ryozuki> but i might be wrong
13:49 < grenade_pro> src/game/client/gameclient.cpp(459) : error C2065: 'm_CurrentInput' : undeclared identifier
13:50 < grenade_pro> mem_copy(&m_DummyInput, &m_aInputs[g_Config.m_ClDummy][(m_CurrentInput[g_Config.m_ClDummy]+200-1)%200], sizeof(m_DummyInput));
13:52 <@deen> it looks private, so you're probably not supposed to access it from there
13:53 <@deen> the data is accessed out with Client()->GetInput(Tick) from gameclient.cpp
13:56 < grenade_pro> and about m_CurrentInput ?
13:57 <@deen> just use the current tick or something like that
14:31 < Learath2> deen: is it sdl2's fault or ours?
14:34 <@deen> both
14:35 <@deen> updating to new sdl2 versions fixes some problems
14:35 <@deen> so we could try switching to SDL 2.0.5 for once
15:10 < grenade_pro> how i can login with this new system rcon password ?
15:10 < Learath2> grenade_pro: with sv_rcon_password passwords?
15:10 < grenade_pro> yes
15:11 < Learath2> blank username
15:11 < grenade_pro> and if i want make a username ?
15:12 < grenade_pro> auth_add "username" "level" "password" ?
15:12 < Learath2> in your config you add "add_auth_p username level hash salt" is the suggested way
15:13 < Learath2> heinrich added a script in scripts/hash_passwords.py
15:13 < Learath2> to help hash and salt passwords
15:13 < Learath2> grenade_pro: if you are just testing auth_add is fine too
15:15 < grenade_pro> cool
15:17 < grenade_pro> i saw this /invite for locked teams in 'pr'
15:17 < grenade_pro> its awesome
15:17 < grenade_pro> it would be cool if added somthing for swap between two player too
15:18 < Learath2> thats borderline cheating tho
15:18 < grenade_pro> even if they are in team ?
15:18 < grenade_pro> i mean same team
15:20 < Learath2> then there is no way to force a player to do a part tho
15:21 < Learath2> create an issue for it either way
15:21 <@deen> switching should not be added, it's considered cheating as you switch strong/weak and can get faster times
15:21 <@deen> you can /save and /load with changed names, but always lose 1 min
15:22 < Learath2> deen: could add it with a time penalty
15:23 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: don't add time modifying stuff plz
15:24 < Learath2> im not adding anything
15:24 <@heinrich5991> do you really lose one minute though?
15:24 <@heinrich5991> you have to wait one minute before rejoining the team, but I don't think the time counts
15:26 <@deen> heinrich5991: i add a minute ;)
15:26 <@deen> to make sure people don't get better time by saving and loading all the time
15:27 <@heinrich5991> sounds ok.
15:51 < Learath2> hey no fair why can deen add time modifying stuff :( /s
15:51 <@deen> because the choice was removing /save,/load entirely
15:51 <@deen> or adding that
15:51 <@deen> and save and load are necessary for these terribly long maps we have
15:52 <@deen> so i just made it impossible to get better time and people on long maps don't care about 1 min anyway
15:52 <@deen> and you have to wait 1 min between save and load anyway, so the time is not added in some sense of the word

22:23 < ochristi> how can I disable that freaking timer broadcast, it is driving me nuts
22:44 < Learath2> ochristi: consensus seems to be its better to have synced animations which noone uses is more important then having a nice timer in a mod called ddRACE
22:45 < Learath2> any reason you aren't using DDNet client?
22:45 < ochristi> do I have to update?
22:45 < Learath2> yeah the last update has the nice timer for ddnet clients
22:45 < ochristi> all others get spammed? :D
22:46 < Learath2> yeah
22:47 < Learath2> we have been abusing the server time to get a nice timer but that has the unfortunate side effect of desynchronizing all animations
22:47 < ochristi> oh wow
22:47 < Learath2> now vanilla and non ddnet clients all get the old 0.5.2 broadcast timer
22:47 < ochristi> this is a ddrace legacy?
22:47 < ochristi> or was this introduced with ddnet?
22:49 < Learath2> yeah the broadcast timer was legacy, i think btd and greyfox reworked it to the game timer and i enabled switching between them back in the update to 0.6
22:50 < Learath2> we werent too concerned about the animations being synchronized given noone cared about them back then
22:51 < Learath2> ochristi: why aren't you on the latest version anyways?
22:55 < ochristi> dunno
22:58 < necropotame> This timer is a non-sense if nothing is using it. It's in the code, but I still don't know if or when animations will be added :/
23:02 < Learath2> necropotame: even after they are added 99% of the maps still wont be using it, we have what 500 maps now?
23:06 < Learath2> Sorry if i'm coming off a little negative here didn't have the best of days :P
23:12 <@deen> Learath2: 1593 maps
23:12 < Learath2> hmm i seem to be off a bit :P
