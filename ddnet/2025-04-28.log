05:35 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> I dislike how noticable the color banding is on desktop for the sidebar menu. This is a proposed "fix" which just changes the background position/size to only span halfway across. New vs Old

05:36 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> the `box-shadow` property also complicates the element because it draws more attention to its border

06:15 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> The player page (I believe) is not something I can control easily because I can't see the template in the uploaded repository. However, these are some random suggestions I have
06:15 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> [1] Improve spacing below playtime graph
06:15 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> [2] Correct X-alignment of finishes and partners
06:15 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> [3] More space between finishes and partners
06:15 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> [4] Improve spacing for category points (separate relationship between heading and subheadings, group subheadings with their corresponding data, more X-spacing between category + maps finished / points + team rank + rank)
06:15 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> [5] Let the "All maps finished" line stand out with some background box, throw some celebratory color flair on the text (probably green as pictured or yellow)
06:15 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> [6] Instead of odd-numbered rows matching the block background behind it, give them their own color to improve clarity
06:15 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> [7] Make the "unfinished maps" toggle more button-like

06:17 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> I think the table rows should get some padding as well so the text isnt as cluttered, something small like 1px/2px, but this is not easily done with tables

06:24 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> The light mode text inputs are an eyesore tbh, I might make that my next PR
06:38 < bridge_> <abricotiabricota> Thx gorp
07:54 < bridge_> <Assa> good morning
07:56 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> hello, if you have any feedback/suggestions for the site lmk
08:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> morning
09:03 < bridge_> <Assa> Pixelart tool now supports all image file formats, that ddnet supports üí™
09:07 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> @ryozuki my compiler backend can use function parameters üòè
09:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> pog
09:08 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> adding call instruction shouldn't be harder
09:10 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> ^ i will remember these words when i will be debugging stack misalignment
09:14 < bridge_> <Assa> what benefits does it have to make a function const, or does it just mark it as not changing class properties?
09:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> c++ right?
09:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> depends where u put the const
09:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if its at the end, it means smth like "not being able to change "this" ptr contents"
09:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if its before the name it just means a const function evaluated at compile time if possible
09:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> from a rust perspective, all c++ methods have a &mut self, adding const at the end makes it &self
09:18 < bridge_> <Assa> I have read into it a bit, it's mostly for the programmer and for safety, it can only rarely impact performance slightly
09:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but it can
09:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and it enforces "const correctness"
09:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/const-correctness
09:19 < bridge_> <Assa> I wondered, that clang-tidy only found 1 of 7 functions, I could have made const
09:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its a bit hard for tools because
09:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> suddenly if u make 1 const
09:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> then others may be able to be const
09:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its a cascading effect
09:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> because a func cant be const if it calls non const funcs
09:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this is more related to type safety
09:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> which always good
09:20 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> @teero777: omg no!
09:20 < bridge_> <Assa> makes sense, the one it found was the most basic getter (which others used)
09:21 < bridge_> <Assa> Thank you for your explanations!
12:07 < bridge_> <learath2> Sadly due to how C++ evolved with const being more of a suggestion, a lot of optimizations had to be left on the table
12:10 < bridge_> <learath2> (Though nowadays const propagation is pretty good, so even if you don't mark a function const, it will get the optimizations, it's also how clang tidy finds the functions to const for you)
12:56 < bridge_> <Assa> so I stress tested my PR now ... It crashes at some size certainly, but the tool is not the bottleneck. My editor lags out as soon as I click into this pixelart xD
12:56 < bridge_> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1366367488862064691/screenshot_2025-04-28_12-54-49.png?ex=6810b063&is=680f5ee3&hm=477b77f9f9528cd5f4a7e0b5e7be7ab3954044f094bfb4726bf92ad96bc2839a&

13:07 < bridge_> <Assa> I actually don't know, maximum 11K * 7K / 100
13:08 < bridge_> <robyt3> Could you try and add a warning like it's done for the pixelart if it's expected to break or cause severe FPS drops?
13:09 < bridge_> <Assa> I am trying to figure out when to post the warning, but should be some treshhold to Width*Height / (ImagePixelSize^2)
13:09 < bridge_> <Assa> Still runs over 60 fps, so we don't need an fps limit right? xD
13:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Time to drop ogl 1.x and write a better quad rendering pipeline
13:11 < bridge_> <Assa> One thing I did: This tool automatically adds a Clip, because this can greatly improve fps if the artwork is not in view range
13:12 < bridge_> <Assa> So an additional idea would be automatically setting clip regions for quads or splitting them into groups, that can be skipped
13:12 < bridge_> <Assa> So an additional idea would be automatically setting clip regions for quads or splitting them into groups, that can be skipped in rendering

14:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> With 100% GPU usage, so probs less on a laptop

14:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i put the map on a localhost webserver:

15:57 < bridge_> <robyt3> Do you use any browser plugins? Try with another profile without plugins and with default settings. Maybe just Ctrl+F5 also fixes it.
15:59 < bridge_> <Assa> Nope, even in private window with disabled add ons I have this issue, I can just check a different browser
16:02 < bridge_> <Assa> Seems to be a well known issue ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

17:49 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> is it bad to check lots of tiles
17:49 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs always expensive to do lots of things
17:49 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> it feels like clusteres isnt the best way to do it
17:50 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Optimize and send pr
17:50 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> am gonna use this
17:50 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Why you reading that code anyways
17:50 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs like liking a instagram post from 2016
17:50 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> lmao
17:50 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i want to add it to tclient

17:51 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> im doing the yoinking here

17:52 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> xd oke
17:52 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> also stole your warlist

18:18 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> yay
18:18 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> such ez pr
18:18 < bridge_> <robyt3> No, this is correct. It's a delay of 1 second
18:19 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> oke
18:21 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> my code doesnt work tho xd
18:23 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> becuz im an idiot
18:24 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> @0xdeen do you think you could expose more php templates? i can't find the player page markup
18:25 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> and map? i can't remember if that one was there
18:25 < bridge_> <gorp_tw> (at work rn so maybe i say dumb thing)
18:56 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> #include ordering has made my ability to sort alphabetically 10x better
19:07 < bridge_> <Assa> @sollybunny adding outlines first and then overlines would cause interactions between lasers to look weird, like imagine a freeze laser going through a door (and the outline beeing behind it while the lasers meet)
19:08 < bridge_> <Assa> and Splitting them up by type and then by outline/inline would just be a bit crazy, like splitting it into 8 components to get renderordering right
19:08 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> you dont need a seperate component for layering
19:09 < bridge_> <Assa> how would you do it then, tell me?
19:09 < bridge_> <Assa> I just have the foreground/background split in mind we do for maplayers
19:11 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> the reason maplayers is split because there are components between the layers
19:11 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> nothing needs to be between the laser fg and bg
19:13 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
19:13 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> for (each laser)
19:13 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)>   drawoutline(laser)
19:13 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> for (each laser)
19:13 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)>   drawbody(laser)
19:13 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
19:14 < bridge_> <Assa> breaks freeze/door example above
19:14 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> oh you dont want that to happen
19:14 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
19:14 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> for (each type)
19:14 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)>   for (each laser of that type)
19:14 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)>     drawoutline(laser)
19:14 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)>   for (each laser of that type)
19:14 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)>     drawbody(laser)
19:14 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
19:15 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> would be nice if lasers could be seperated into lists by type to reduce the time that takes
19:17 < bridge_> <Assa> currently it's more like this:
19:17 < bridge_> <Assa> ```C++
19:17 < bridge_> <Assa> laser = someRandomLaserRenderedFromSomewhere()
19:17 < bridge_> <Assa> drawoutline(laser)
19:17 < bridge_> <Assa> drawinline(laser)
19:17 < bridge_> <Assa> ```
19:17 < bridge_> <Assa> I wonder how you sort them
19:17 < bridge_> <learath2> Idk why we never did it, we should add the abi version of the antibot to the soname
19:17 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> did it?
19:17 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> (seperating laser by type)
19:18 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> are not all lasers rendered together
19:18 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> i assume ddnet has no z buffer xd
19:20 < bridge_> <Assa> yeah, otherwise this would be trivial
19:20 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> well its good that there isnt
19:21 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> it is unneeded
19:21 < bridge_> <Assa> if you're willing to implement it, I'd certainly be in favor of it, as long as it doesn't impact performance too heavy
19:21 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> when types are seperated into seperate lists there will be no performance overhead
19:22 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> apart from extra looping
19:22 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> ~~apart from extra looping~~
19:22 < bridge_> <Assa> and if you're at it, you also can optimize laser heads away, that are at the same spot üôà
19:22 < bridge_> <Assa> and if you're at it, you also can optimize laser heads away, that are at the same spot (of the same type)üôà
19:22 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> are they not quad containers to smthing
19:22 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> are they not quad containers or smthing
19:22 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> it doesnt matter that much there arent that many lasesr
20:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the :banhammer:
20:41 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Why are there no accounts?
20:42 < bridge_> <learath2> Accounts are tyranny

20:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The funniest thing is, that it replies in german for me
20:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So not localizable strings
20:44 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I annotated one method with virtual which caused a segfault with corrupted backtrace. Is that expected C++ behavior?
20:44 < bridge_> <Ewan> Is it a dll?
20:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
20:44 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs a .so ye
20:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> Pure virtual functions can be compiled into libraries but if they‚Äôre called without implementors you‚Äôre fucked
20:45 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs not pure tho
20:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> what is it?
20:45 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> It worked without. The diff is literally just adding the one word virtual
20:45 < bridge_> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1366485611481137264/image.png?ex=68111e65&is=680fcce5&hm=5c0de52b64b114804b8c39602177a690c5cd567b1facd5d8aea367a5dadc651e&
20:46 < ChillerDragon> @Ewan wat wat? this is the bad diff https://github.com/ChillerDragon/antibob/commit/616d9cfb0c23f61e889374b8b8443a7629f49ea7
20:46 < ChillerDragon> sadly asan doesnt help because the project is full of asan errors xd
20:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> well i think virtual function calls always trigger vtable lookups
20:47 < ChillerDragon> it even crashes without calling it
20:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> just initializing?
20:47 < ChillerDragon> its OnSayNetMessage and it segfaults on server start
20:48 < bridge_> <learath2> Corrupted backtrace sounds weird
20:48 < bridge_> <learath2> What is corrupted about it?
20:49 < ChillerDragon> just a classic broken backtrace
20:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just asan
20:49 < ChillerDragon> dont u know what i mean? the one where asan helps
20:49 < ChillerDragon> asan doesnt get that far
20:49 < bridge_> <learath2> Show backtrace, am curious
20:49 < ChillerDragon> it just shows wrong line numbers
20:49 < ChillerDragon> stepping in gdb loops in a headerfile 
20:50 < bridge_> <learath2> That sounds more like out of date symbols
20:50 < ChillerDragon> ye
20:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller are both projects compiled with the same compiler?
20:50 < ChillerDragon> ou
20:50 < ChillerDragon> eh
20:50 < ChillerDragon> maybe
20:50 < ChillerDragon> xd
20:50 < ChillerDragon> does it matter?
20:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if that isn't a c lib
20:51 < ChillerDragon> its cpp
20:51 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it matters
20:51 < ChillerDragon> common cpp L
20:51 < bridge_> <learath2> Who knows what matters, you didn't really show anything. If marking something virtual causes crashes my first guess would be calling the function on an un-initialized instance of the object
20:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> asan would catch that
20:52 < ChillerDragon> ye asan dies on odr
20:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well no
20:52 < ChillerDragon> fixing odr is tricky
20:52 < bridge_> <learath2> He says asan is full of crap üòÑ
20:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ubsan would maybe catch it
20:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> valgrind would defs catch it
20:52 < ChillerDragon> yea maybe ill go with valgrind go call
20:53 < bridge_> <learath2> Breaking ODR is also sus
20:53 < ChillerDragon> i was just confused how adding virtual could cause a segfault
20:53 < ChillerDragon> ye ik i should fix odr
20:53 < bridge_> <learath2> uninitialized vtable
20:53 < ChillerDragon> but its hard because of crypto shenanigans
20:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
20:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> fix odr
20:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there freut sich that static linking
20:53 < bridge_> <learath2> or devirtualization failing due to UB
20:54 < ChillerDragon> i get ambigous call to md5_init when i try to fix odr i just wanna delete antibot 
20:54 < ChillerDragon> just allow botting at this point
20:54 < bridge_> <learath2> The backtrace being "corrupted" is probably the first thing I'd look at. It sounds absurd
20:54 < ChillerDragon> bro lerato
20:54 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I love that blake3 is faster than even md5 st
20:55 < ChillerDragon> u make it sound like i fucked up so hard you never heard of it
20:56 < ChillerDragon> if every c++ crash would have a helpful gdb backtrace it would be python
20:56 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does python have useful bt?
20:58 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> I mean it just shows line number and error message if you fuxk up like any high level language
21:30 < bridge_> <Assa> I wonder what compiled python (Cython?) has to say about this
23:50 < bridge_> <canarda_04> @soulyvevo hello I made this inverted color skin
23:50 < bridge_> <canarda_04> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/985717921600929872/1366086384330473534
23:50 < bridge_> <canarda_04> I know that you're declining the glow skins so I was wondering if I could make a series of these inverted color skins but only for the default skins: default, twinbop, coala and fox (or I think at least adding the fox would be nice)
