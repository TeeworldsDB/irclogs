11:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Wow chillerdragon
11:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> You always talk about free speech and shit
11:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and then you censor you ddnet content in #9078
11:10 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9078
11:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I am really upset
12:10 < bridge> <learath2> Hiding his international arms trade ddnet servers
12:39 < bridge> <egyt> That's nothing compared to use of CC BY-ND license for opinions
13:43 < bridge> <kebscs> Could #9054 be added to the 18.6 release description? I believe mappers should know about this feature @0xdeen
13:43 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9054
13:44 < bridge> <kebscs> it's in the build just not in the description

14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> With wine you can also start multiple steams
14:20 < bridge> <teero777> I can do many more things with enough wine

15:14 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: wat to use instead of vector in my 0.7 serverbrowser pr?
15:15 < bridge> <meloÆž> vec4 ofc
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Sounds like you want a vec, why should it be smth else?
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The virtual list (server list) needs to access the items by index
15:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i used a vector in my pr which saves connless packets, which has to be sent when 0.7 server respond with token
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Oh ok, I don't want to understand that part anyway
15:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> xdd
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> If you don't iterate but search you often want a hashmap ig
15:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> ddnet split screen couch coop, when?
16:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
16:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> imagine dual mouse support
16:14 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
16:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> doesnt X support it
16:15 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i mean, anything supports it if you want but are't we using SDL events
16:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> not dual
16:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> up to 64/128
16:22 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i doubt you would have enough usb ports for that many mice

16:24 < bridge> <jxsl13> i actually don't need couch coop, just the ability to spectate many players at the same time on the same screen
16:24 < bridge> <jxsl13> couch coop was kinda close to that

16:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> how
16:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> does
16:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> is this right?
16:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> x-x
16:37 < bridge> <jxsl13> left target
16:37 < bridge> <sollybunny> i want to put the 3 commits on spinny-hammer to potato client
16:37 < bridge> <jxsl13> you want to swap
16:37 < bridge> <sollybunny> oke doke
16:38 < bridge> <jxsl13> if it's correct. you will see a diff if your changes below.
16:38 < bridge> <jxsl13> of*
16:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> what if
16:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> the fork is out of date
16:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> how do i only make a pr with my changes
16:39 < bridge> <sollybunny> and then a seperate one to do update to ddnet
16:41 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1290322549678280737/image.png?ex=66fc0a04&is=66fab884&hm=99685fca5526eaa5017a2112e856fcd04b65d8c8e425231ea824cf26ecdab68f&
16:41 < bridge> <sollybunny> my changes are.. shown in files changes
16:41 < bridge> <sollybunny> but not
16:41 < bridge> <sollybunny> in commits
16:41 < bridge> <sollybunny> it should be at the top
16:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> well
16:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> then you should probably fork the tater client
16:41 < bridge> <sollybunny> u can make a fork of a fork?
16:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> and apply your changes
16:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> good question, probably not
16:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> workaround would be, checkout tater master branch
16:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> and push it into one of your ddnet fork's branches
16:43 < bridge> <sollybunny> ugh... git
16:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> it's pretty urgh
16:43 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's possible to fork
16:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> you can try
16:43 < bridge> <sollybunny> i cant just "cherry pick" the 3 commits
16:43 < bridge> <sollybunny> i want
16:44 < bridge> <sollybunny> i can fork it :D
16:44 < bridge> <sollybunny> i dont want to tho
16:44 < bridge> <sollybunny> x-x
16:44 < bridge> <sollybunny> theres no merge conflicts
16:44 < bridge> <sollybunny> i shuld just be able to do it
16:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> alternatively you could checkout a commit that's before tater's master commit
16:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> on ddnet
16:45 < bridge> <jxsl13> and apply your changes
16:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> yeah i dont .... wana do that either
16:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> im gonna fork it
16:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> ill go with that
16:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's probably the easiest way
16:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> oh
16:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1290323867537248286/image.png?ex=66fc0b3f&is=66fab9bf&hm=55bfea611717664463bba8dd00425fe7353660bcba40c5bdd142da61dbc79570&
16:46 < bridge> <sollybunny> nvm
16:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> badum tssss
16:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> fork of fork: no
16:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> well u can
16:47 < bridge> <sollybunny> as long as u already dont have a fork
16:48 < bridge> <jxsl13> well
16:48 < bridge> <sollybunny> its a completley arbritrary limitation
16:48 < bridge> <sollybunny> cuz u can do it just fine in cli
16:48 < bridge> <sollybunny> you just dont get the convenient github ui which sometimes makes things easier
16:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> new souly unlocked
16:55 < bridge> <sollybunny> no0
16:55 < bridge> <sollybunny> am solly
16:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> the evil twin
16:56 < bridge> <sollybunny> can the other one use git
16:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> no
16:56 < bridge> <sollybunny> nor can i
16:56 < bridge> <sollybunny> ;-;
16:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> because he's good natured
16:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> damn
16:56 < bridge> <sollybunny> yay
16:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> x)
16:56 < bridge> <sollybunny> i know how to pull push and commit
16:56 < bridge> <sollybunny> and sometimes figure out merges
16:57 < bridge> <sollybunny> branches and anythign else are by the whims of chatgpt
16:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://www.sublimemerge.com/download
16:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> or vs code's git ui
16:58 < bridge> <sollybunny> its normally unexplained errors
16:58 < bridge> <sollybunny> an overabundance of unexplainable merges
16:58 < bridge> <sollybunny> rather than the actual task of merging
16:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> sublime merge is paid but for playing around a little bit, you can use it just fine.
17:20 < bridge> <dizyyy123> how to write your client ddnet
17:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.phoronix.com/news/DOOM-ROCm-LLVM-Port
17:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> > "The clang compiler can target GPUs directly. We emit a single kernel that calls the 'main' function. Functions that require the operating system are handled through the RPC interface. See my LLVM talk for more information.
17:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
17:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> > This implementation defines the amdgpu-loader utility, which handles launching the main kernel, setting up the SDL2 window interface, and provides functions to get the input keys and write the output framebuffer. Okay, it's not entirely on the GPU, but all the logic and rendering runs on the GPU."
19:06 < bridge> <timakro> I tried adding a new sprite to extras.png and create a new particle effect. but the particles i'm seeing are just yellow,blue,green,red squares. looks like a placeholder texture. any ideas? these are my changes
19:06 < bridge> <timakro> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1290359164454830131/particlechanges.diff?ex=66fc2c1e&is=66fada9e&hm=a81d8d25ca9f5c1c4b2bc0482fb97daa4bdab53577349d91ba3ff13667bffbd7&
19:26 < bridge> <robyt3> I made the same mistake when trying it out, you need to use the correct group `CParticles::GROUP_EXTRA` for this texture
19:26 < bridge> <timakro> ah damn it, i knew it then forgot to change it
19:26 < bridge> <timakro> thx
19:45 < bridge> <learath2> Do we still have the 128p patch from fokkonaut in the source?

20:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> im considering switching to arch now that I unsubscribed from game pass
20:05 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :greenthing:
20:06 < bridge> <tsfreddie> what's the current state of nvidia gpus on linux
20:06 < bridge> <Ewan> broad question
20:06 < bridge> <Ewan> overall not great
20:06 < bridge> <Ewan> but some setups are perfectly stable
20:07 < bridge> <Ewan> what gpu do u have
20:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> rtx 3080 laptop
20:07 < bridge> <tsfreddie> :justatest:
20:08 < bridge> <tsfreddie> with an amd integrated graphic either muxed or bypassed
20:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> my next laptop might be a framework if i'm ready to go full amd and linux
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> that is much harder
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> optimus setup is a bit of a pain in the ass
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> on nixos it's pretty ez
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> and it will work fairly well but u need to read about the different passthrough modes
20:32 < bridge> <Ewan> the driver experience itself is pretty good on xorg
20:33 < bridge> <Ewan> wayland + nvidia is currently still a pretty cursed combo but it works well on my wlroots based compositor
20:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i ran optimus to use my 3060 alongside my amd igpu and it worked well once i was able to work out some of the issues
20:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i never was able to stop periodic firefox crashes and xwayland apps having terrible performance (e.g. ingame fps was reported as good but there would be visible lags, bad latency and stuff as a symptom of an iGPU bottleneck or something)
20:37 < bridge> <Ewan> so now i just use the 3060 all the time
21:10 < bridge> <qiworzzz> what's this?
21:12 < bridge> <zhn> doom fully running on gpu
21:16 < bridge> <qiworzzz> Oh, I get it, thanks
22:26 < bridge> <kebscs> how do i log stuff that is with OUTPUT_LEVEL_ADDINFO
22:26 < bridge> <kebscs> loglevel 2 or 3 doesnt seem to work
22:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you need to adjust the correct config variable
22:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> where do you want to see it? f1 or the terminal?
22:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `loglevel` is for the log file
22:30 < bridge> <kebscs> server terminal
22:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `stdout_output_level`
22:32 < bridge> <kebscs> ty
22:33 < bridge> <kebscs> with the last whisper thing it can work with ids i just need to add another function that lets gamecontext know when someone doesnt reconnect
22:33 < bridge> <kebscs> the log with dropping reconnecting players was disable with the addinfo log so i didnt see what was wrong
22:33 < bridge> <kebscs> the log with dropping reconnecting players was disabled with the addinfo log so i didnt see what was wrong
23:48 < bridge> <timakro> i thought maybe to indicate that a player is invincible we could not render the feet and instead render a ufo so that it looks as if the tee in flying in a ufo
