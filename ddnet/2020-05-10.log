00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Just so you guys know: The antiping is so good that I was just able to finish Tech map on CHN server with 283 ping (yes, was bored)
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 I decided to remove 128 players now again. The reason why is because it is just too laggy to always send those connect/disconnect packets :/ otherwise it was working very well, also with the players with same IP having the same IDs (for dummy hammerfly and correct pings in chat). Whispers were also working. There was nothing bad about excpet the laggs coming from the (i guess) connect/disconnect packets. When I did 256 in 0.6 it
06:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut how about for 0.6? would be nice to have for a tournament
08:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybd you can batch together the updates for disconnect and connect
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> @neb yes I know that struggel and I even had the idea to patch my client to automaically toggle fullscreen on launch. Did you try a 0.7 client? Because they seem to have better tabbing etc support.
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> @ChillerDragon The one from the teeworlds.com forum?
15:56 <+ChillerDragon> @neb any 0.7 based client like the official release from teeworlds.com 
15:56 <+ChillerDragon> ddnet is 0.6 based
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> @ChillerDragon Hm coz last time I downloaded that client I couldn't even see ddnet servers but maybe I'm just blind
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @neb ddnet servers are on 0.6, a 0.7 obviously doesn't see them
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> @Learath2 There are no 0.7 servers at all ?
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> I think KoG has one or two but ye I won't be using that client if I don't have any ddrace servers
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> @ChillerDragon don't think I'll use it since there are no ddnet servers available for 0.7 but gonna try just to see if  it supports tabbing better
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> @ChillerDragon Ye it supports it :O
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we do host a handful of 0.7 ddnet servers and kog has bridged servers between 06 and 07
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> @Learath2 Yep saw that, do you know any better 0.7 client ? The Teeworlds official one doesn't even have zoom xd
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, 0.7 support is pretty meh, no matter what chillerdragon says ðŸ˜„
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He has a client somewhere that has some ddnet features so does fokkonaut, don't really remember the names of the clients though
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> @Learath2 Nooo it's just sooo much smoother
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> At least in MacOS right now everything is beautiful, fluid, and mostly ingame I see the difference
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, I'm on catalina, feels pretty much the same on both versions
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://fokkonaut.github.io/F-Client
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> my 0.7 client
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> @fokkonaut Thank you! But couldn't open it xd
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/709051645803364352/Screen_Shot_2020-05-10_at_4.36.58_PM.png
16:40 <+ChillerDragon> @neb try https://zillyhuhn.com/woods that should run on macOS
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon I dont have mac, can you try to fix the F-Client on Mac?
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Btw, can you send me a Backup of the accounts? I am trying to reproduce the master register issue locally with F-DDrace
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> I told you you should give mac a test and not just use github artifacts. I do not have access to a mac rn. Also feel free to add @zillyhuhn on wire so i can send u the data.
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> @ChillerDragon Hem, I can open ur client but once i use tabbing its crashing
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> @ChillerDragon u want logs ?
17:22 <+ChillerDragon> So my client crashes on tabbing but vanilla doesnt ? @neb
17:23 <+ChillerDragon> yea sure you can post logs but i doubt i will be able to fix it
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> @ChillerDragon Yes ! Tho on vanilla client, when I quit using the cross, it's telling me "Teeworlds quit unexpectedly" too
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> But I dont really care since its once I quit it
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/709064387477897236/zilly_tabbing_crash.rtf
17:36 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 that is fixed in ur patch huh? So id have to get a newer SDL to build i guess
17:37 <+ChillerDragon> @neb possibly fixxed soon(tm)
17:37 <@Learath2> ChillerDragon: nah they broke it again
17:38 <@Learath2> Iâ€™ll submit a patch again, if they dont accept it we are kinda fucked as we get a deadlock
17:38 <@Learath2> Weâ€™ll have to get rid of threaded rendering or atleast threaded swap
17:40 <+ChillerDragon> meh
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I added you an wire @ChillerDragon
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats wire?
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ask spies
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> who would have said web dev in rust would be fun too, i think ill use rust for everything
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/709088972437192774/unknown.png
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://rocket.rs it uses nightly rust, but looks sick
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.mozilla.org/Areweyet :lol:
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> @ChillerDragon Is there any problems with AMD processors ? DDnet seems to work so weirdly, without vsync I have 1k fps but it looks like I have 40 or smth and with vsync Im locked at 144fps but unfortunately its causing delay
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> @ChillerDragon Is there any problems with AMD processors ? DDnet seems to work so weirdly, without vsync I have 1k fps but it looks like I have 40 or smth and with vsync Im locked at 144fps, everything is fluid but unfortunately its causing delay
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> @ChillerDragon Is there any problems with AMD processors/graphic cards ? DDnet seems to work so weirdly, without vsync I have 1k fps but it looks like I have 40 or smth and with vsync Im locked at 144fps, everything is fluid but unfortunately its causing delay
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vsync causes delay always
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why you want vsync? with 144hz you should notice 0 tearing
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just lock the hz to 1000 and vsync off
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats what i do
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw tw should run above 450fps~~ to feel smooth
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> atleast for me
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <neb> @Ryozuki Yeah I guess, now it looks fine after restarting my computer
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Rust backend frameworks arent half bad, only issue is that they arent mature yet, so you need to discover some stuff as u go
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cheats.rs/ :poggers:
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki if you like ORMs diesel is not half bad
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ™‚
