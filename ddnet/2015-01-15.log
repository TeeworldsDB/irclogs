01:34 < Maple> deen please add my map
01:35 <@deen> oh right
01:36 < Maple> !
01:41 <@deen> Maple: should be up
01:41 < Maple> does the server need to be reloaded
01:41 <@deen> no, it's a vote
02:17 < Maple> deen, one more update? :*
02:18 <@deen> done
02:35 < JazzeD> someone here is admin?
02:36 < JazzeD> someone here is admin?
02:43 <@deen> wow, 83% of TW on DDNet, never seen that much
02:44 <@deen> 269 of 325
02:44 < eeeee> should rename to TWNet :)
02:44 <@deen> yeah, hosting all kinds of mods now anyway
05:35 < Nimda> Website went down!
05:36 < Nimda> Website went back online!
05:37 < Nimda> Website went down!
05:52 < Nimda> Website went back online!
08:16 < Nimda> DDNet GER went down!
08:27 < Fifi> Guys, DDNet GER died :c
08:27 < Fifi> PS. Hi
09:53 < xRoThx> deen:  Are you available?
10:43 < eeeee> well shit
11:03 < xRoThx> deen:  We can speak @ mail. 
12:15 < Nimda> DDNet GER went back online!
12:16 < laxadedi> What happend ? DDOS ? Server failure ?
12:38 <@deen> no idea
12:39 <@deen> server looks really empty now
12:40 <@deen> oh, it just came back
12:40 < laxadedi> 4 hours downtime
12:40 <@deen> that's weird
12:40 < laxadedi> maybe xrothx went there to say something about it, no idea
12:51 <@deen> i guess it was related to the website going down before and all the other ddos attacks in the last days
12:52 <@deen> but if the server goes down for exactly 4 hours, that means the provider shut it down
12:52 <@deen> maybe the attack was too strong
13:13 < laxadedi> http://www.joylent.eu/
15:11 < laxadedi> Learath2: heinrich5991 : little cs:go tonight with my noob friend ? :D
19:32 < Learath2> laxadedi: i can do that 
19:32 < laxa> well
19:32 < laxa> I am back at home
19:32 < laxa> but my friend isn't answering
19:32 < laxa> and I need to call my friend again to get the password, forgot it :D
20:01 <@heinrich5991> laxa: I'm here!
20:01 < laxa> nice
20:01 < laxa> my friend wanna play around 21h30 he told me
21:31 < maple> deen i made another zombie map
21:40 < seymour_> maple, u beast!
21:40 < maple> xD
21:40 < maple> if i fix that base it should be ok
21:48 < coffee> maple: your actual zombie map is not fair
21:48 <@deen> coffee: teach him to make good zombie maps please
21:48 < maple> yes plz
21:49 < coffee> i'm pretty busy with professionnal tasks until the next week
21:49 < coffee> and i'm busy with last changes to do in the mod
21:51 < coffee> maple:
21:51 < coffee> infz is the prefix for infectionZ
21:51 < coffee> but jungle is nice, really,  i was talking about your previous work
22:20 <@deen> so the ddos attacks are up to 40 gbit/s now =/
22:20 <@deen> and they are spamming servers
22:21 < maple> updated zJungle map
22:21 < eeeee> they mad
22:21 < maple> should be ok
22:22 <@deen> maple: i don't want to upload your map updates all the time
22:22 < maple> :x
22:24 <@deen> hm, how to make the rejoin-spam-protection better?
22:24 <@deen> right now it's limited to a single slot, which is pretty stupid
22:24 <@deen> it just remembers the last ip on that slot, and checks if someone reconnects too quickly
22:24 <@deen> so they use 2 ips to connect quickly
22:26 < seymour_> why are the ddnet servers being ddos'd?
22:26 <@deen> i don't know, they've always been ddosed
22:26 < eeeee> could have a "war mode" for a server
22:27 < eeeee> like when you have too many reconnects in last x seconds (possibly some other heuristics as well) then server transitions into war mode
22:28 < eeeee> could ban people for 5 seconds when they disconnect and impose other assraep measures to help suppress the attack
22:28 < seymour_> that is strange >.>
22:29 < eeeee> that should be a bit easier than properly filtering them out, but also wouldn't work as well
22:31 < eeeee> deen: as for a proper solution, you might be able to hijack the bans for the purpose
22:32 < eeeee> e.g. change the code to allow communications with a client which is banned for < 60 seconds (as opposed to < 1 seconds as it is now)
22:33 < eeeee> when a client disconnects ban him for 20 seconds
22:33 < eeeee> no
22:33 < eeeee> rather when a client connects ban him for +20 more seconds than he's already banned
22:33 < eeeee> well same shit i guess
22:34 < eeeee> anyway you get the idea. alternatively you can just have a separate instance of CBans just for this purpose, would be a bit cleaner i guess
22:35 <@heinrich5991> "war mode"
22:35 <@heinrich5991> sounds fun :)
22:35 <@heinrich5991> but good idea in general
22:35 <@deen> i guess they'll just go back to ddosing then
22:35 <@deen> nothing we can do against that
22:35 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: did you learn these in uni?
22:36 < eeeee> learn what?
22:36 < eeeee> i only learned math in uni
22:36 <@heinrich5991> ^^ k
22:36 <@heinrich5991> deen: apparantly they'd rather ddos the servers through other means, probably because it's cheaper
22:37 < eeeee> yeah maybe Santa didn't give them much cash this year coz they were bad boys
22:54 <@deen> eeeee: these things could cause more problems than help
22:54 <@deen> We had a spam protection with bans
22:55 <@deen> but I had to disable it because it sometimes triggered when people connected their dummy too quickly
22:55 <@deen> and then they got banned
22:55 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
22:56 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
23:20 < eeeee> deen: yeah that's why i'm suggesting a system which would accumulate the ban time first before actually starting to ban you
23:20 < eeeee> very much like the chat spam protection
