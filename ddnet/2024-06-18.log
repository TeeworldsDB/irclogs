14:00 <+bridge> <416710> I propose to diversify the editor by adding languages from different countries, and localize the language to make the editor more understandable maybe
14:02 <+bridge> <416710> Or let's privately create some plugins or something that can be localized, or have volunteers from different countries to translate for their countries IDK might be a great idea

16:49 <+bridge> <broso56> is there any good way of getting data that the ddnet client has externally? i wanna play around with a utils app that might feature an overlay, and having some data that the client has might be useful, stuff like the player position, the server the player is on, whos in it, etc.
16:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> not within the client
16:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> you could use smth like wireshark to sniff the network packets

20:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Trying to implement this in my server, currently the problem is that this line crashes as soon as i connect:
20:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5063/files#diff-d76009083687ba43c59dc7bb2c7357457c999c2eb9d913967d598e913c6fd01fR83
20:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> How can that happen?
20:23 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1252690160022192228/image.png?ex=66732220&is=6671d0a0&hm=af2b28bcc9a8568b6164e373a27e569805576a38fe055b0a2814f8cb890c2f26&
20:23 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> line 84 is `m_AttachedPlayers.clear()`
20:24 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> well, that is in line 83
20:29 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @robyt3 any ideas?
20:33 <+bridge> <robyt3> Looks like memory corruption, ASAN/Valgrind would probably help
20:35 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> How, if there is nothing in there yet at all
20:36 <+bridge> <robyt3> Assuming you applied the changes correctly, it must be something in your code that's not compatible with the changes of the PR. Do you use `m_AttachedPlayers` and `SetHookedPlayer` anywhere else? Do you perhaps `mem_zero` the entire `CGameCore` or something like that?
20:37 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I highly doubt that :D Yeah, I use them in other places where I had m_HookedPlayer = x before
20:37 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> but it crashes in CCharacter::Spawn
20:37 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> when resetting the core
20:38 <+bridge> <robyt3> You need to ensure that you don't call `SetHookedPlayer` while iterating over the set, I guess
20:38 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> How can I write it while interating? I'm not even iterating
20:38 <+bridge> <robyt3> Then it should be fine
20:39 <+bridge> <robyt3> But from what I'm gathering you are somehow corrupting the `std::set`
20:39 <+bridge> <robyt3> So ASAN/UBSAN/Valgrind should help
20:40 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Yea.. I have no idea tho, I do not mem zero it somewhere
20:40 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> and vectors of gamecore do work
20:41 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> map too
20:41 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Those structures would also break by mem_zeroing
20:42 <+bridge> <robyt3> I can only repeat my invitation to the church of ASAN ðŸ˜„
20:52 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> oh wait
20:53 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> it's not actually on spawn
20:53 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> it's the reckoningcore
20:53 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> it's in tickdefered
20:54 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> m_ReckoningCore.Init()
20:54 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> m_ReckoningCore = m_Core;
20:54 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> this is it, copying the set here is causing the issue
20:55 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> = operator in std::set
20:55 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ahhhh
20:55 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> i see now
20:55 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ```mem_zero(&m_SendCore, sizeof(m_SendCore));
20:55 <+bridge> <fokkonaut>     mem_zero(&m_ReckoningCore, sizeof(m_ReckoningCore));```
20:56 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ```mem_zero(&m_SendCore, sizeof(m_SendCore));
20:56 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> mem_zero(&m_ReckoningCore, sizeof(m_ReckoningCore));```
20:56 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> my mod vs ddnet: 
20:56 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ```m_SendCore = CCharacterCore();
20:56 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> m_ReckoningCore = CCharacterCore();```
20:56 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> works like a charm. I am ASAN myself
20:57 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> :kek:
21:00 <+bridge> <robyt3> #5255
21:00 <+bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5255
21:02 <+bridge> <robyt3> Seems like there were only a few days between the PRs being merged though
21:38 <+bridge> <bingbong669> Can we add an option in voting to play the map mirrored
21:39 <+bridge> <bingbong669> reflect the map on the y axis, mirroring all the >> and <<'s, speed boosts, etc, but not changing the map's playabliity
21:40 <+bridge> <AssassinTee> Is there a bug in ddnet 18.2 with the sound?
21:41 <+bridge> <AssassinTee> I saved a map in 18.3 and players got a warning using 18.2, that some map sounds couldn't be loaded
21:41 <+bridge> <robyt3> yeah, the warning is shown incorrectly when they have sound disabled
22:03 <+bridge> <zsmf> Is there a shortcut for making every tile in a group hookable? so i dont have to do it manually?
22:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in a design tile layer you can rightclick the layer and select a game tile. it then creates those tiles in the game layer, for example "hookable"
22:24 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @robyt3 How did DDNet solve this? https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/actions/runs/9571581242/job/26389007865
22:24 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> it's related to the new CCharacterCore initialization
22:24 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> i dont see any constructor in ddnet for example, so does this warning get disabled somewhere?
22:26 <+bridge> <robyt3> `add_cxx_compiler_flag_if_supported(OUR_FLAGS_OWN -Wno-missing-field-initializers)` I guess
22:27 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> thanks
22:27 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Lol, it's set already in my cmakelists
22:27 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ahhhh
22:28 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> wait
22:28 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> it's add_c_compiler_flag for me, not cxx, but i think that doesnt matter since everything is c for me
22:29 <+bridge> <robyt3> Only system would be c for you
22:29 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> my system is cpp actually
22:29 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> i updated it
22:30 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> but the whole cmakelists.txt is based on vanilla and uses c things instead of cxx
22:30 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> mostly
22:30 <+bridge> <robyt3> DDNet doesn't have C either, so all the flags should be for cxx
22:30 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1252722160057843864/image.png?ex=66733fed&is=6671ee6d&hm=6d6fe926322ff7f4fcb88455f1842555336482be2c132f7a6847f310e915c604&
22:30 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> it still sets them correctly, the issue is because it's another error:  ` [-Werror=uninitialized]`
22:31 <+bridge> <robyt3> I don't see anything related to `uninitialized` in DDNet's CMakeLists though
22:31 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yea
22:31 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> same
22:33 <+bridge> <robyt3> Does your `CCharacterCore::Reset` function initialize those variable that are undefined according to the warnings?
22:34 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
22:34 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> but Reset isnt getting called for m_SendCore and m_ReckoningCore in CCharacter::Spawn
22:34 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> it's only initialized
22:35 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> so it wouldnt matter
22:37 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I could maybe just initialize both with m_Core, but that's not the way to go ðŸ˜„
22:39 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I dont even understand where it thinks these variables are being used
22:39 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> It's just listing all variables, it's the order they are declared in gamecore.h, so the list probably would go on
22:40 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Ah no, it's not the same order.
22:40 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> but those are all vec2, if that's relevant
22:41 <+bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, doesn't look relevant, but I would put it in the same order anyway
22:42 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> How can this trigger in my mod, but not in ddnet?
22:43 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/c4377bb7d9e79e15ab86c9a2e7feccee814e14f5
22:43 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> this looks like it
22:45 <+bridge> <robyt3> I think that was mostly reverted by #6256 though
22:45 <+bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6256
22:46 <+bridge> <robyt3> I'd try the `add_cxx_compiler_flag_if_supported` flags and see if that works already. Looks like we use `-Wextra` which includes `-Wuninitialized`
22:46 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> which flag should i add?
22:47 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> wextra?
22:47 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I use wextra too
22:47 <+bridge> <robyt3> I mean use `add_cxx_compiler_flag_if_supported` instead of `add_c_compiler_flag_if_supported` except for the one with `OUR_FLAGS_DEP`
22:47 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ah
22:49 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> unknown command :D
22:49 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/actions/runs/9571999267/job/26390336399
22:51 <+bridge> <robyt3> Copy `function(add_cxx_compiler_flag_if_supported VARIABLE FLAG)` and following
22:54 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> it works on ubuntu latest, but not on 20.04
22:55 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> but has also before
22:55 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> this error does only appear on 20.04
22:59 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> it did run through on the pr adding it in ddnet tho
22:59 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> but that was bors
23:01 <+bridge> <meloÆž> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7886#issuecomment-2094337073
23:01 <+bridge> <meloÆž> 
23:02 <+bridge> <meloÆž> just drop 20.04 when 24.04 latest is added to CI and call it a day :kek:
23:03 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Hm
23:03 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Okay
23:04 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> :)
