02:38 <+bridge> <BillionRay> greetings my friends, can anyone point me to where the hookline is rendered in the source code? Or what the responsible function is?
02:40 <+bridge> <BillionRay> nevamind found it
02:40 <+bridge> <BillionRay> players.cc:CPlayers::RenderHookCollLine()
02:41 <+bridge> <BillionRay> players.cpp:CPlayers::RenderHookCollLine()

09:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thats not it tho
09:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thats the line to show colision
09:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> iirc
09:08 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Thats what i meant: the red line that detects collision. I already did what I wanted with that, you can see a little video i did in the #bugs channel
09:09 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Just made a circle to show reach, it turned out more distracting than useful :/
09:47 <+bridge> <Kondensator> Hi, I never looked into TW source code and map formats. I have a question though. How hard is it to parse teeworlds' map file format? I don't need any texturing or cosmetic data, the thing I am most interested in is having map as boolean 2D field of solid/nonsolid.

09:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> its not really hard, but u have to be able to work with binary data
09:55 <+bridge> <Kondensator> Okay, so a bit harder than xml/yaml of whatever but not too bad. Is there any documentation on how to read it properly?
09:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> there is a tool that can convert maps to json
09:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap
09:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> written in rust
09:56 <+bridge> <Kondensator> ohh man, that's lovely. I intented to work in rust with this problem
09:56 <+bridge> <Kondensator> you just made my day ðŸ˜›
09:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/ddnet-map-gen
09:56 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i use it here
09:59 <+bridge> <Kondensator> You really made my day with this. Thank you!
10:22 <+bridge> <VerteZzo> what
11:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> @Kondensator there's also https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2 with `datafile` and `map` crate, though I'd recommend Patiga's library instead

11:22 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> @Kondensator the last two links are documentation about the format. if you find something that's not documented well enough and you find it out in a different way, please send a PR
11:27 <+bridge> <BillionRay> May I ask what you're trying to do?
11:33 <+bridge> <Kondensator> Yup! I've been working on procedural generation for multiple projects for years but never did anything for tw. Recently I ported and extended [this](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior) in Rust. I have some cool ideas to procedurally generate gores/ctf/block maps. Maps for TW are perfect for me also as research case to get more intuition about procedural gen with markov algorithms.
11:33 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Ah i had the same isea

11:33 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Ah i had the same idea.
11:33 <+bridge> <BillionRay> I made a little thing that takes a png image and makes a map of it

11:35 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Hm this markov thing is interesting
11:39 <+bridge> <Kondensator> Yeah, it's basically programming language made for procedural generation. I fell in love with this ðŸ˜›
11:39 <+bridge> <gerdoe> every tee enjoyer did something similar xd
11:40 <+bridge> <BillionRay> The cool thing with the image is that you can edit images in real time with others -> real time collaborative map editing
11:41 <+bridge> <BillionRay> Could be cool to run a server where you could play these randomly generated maps
11:43 <+bridge> <Kondensator> I thought about sending them to KoG but hosting a server with, eg new map every day. Would be super cool
11:44 <+bridge> <gerdoe> you can visit @iMilchshake's servers rn btw xd
11:44 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ah wait, these are pregenerated
