11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Microsoft initiated a fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) campaign against OpenGL around the release of Windows Vista. In 2003, Microsoft left the OpenGL Architecture Review Board -- showing that they no longer had any interest in the future of OpenGL. Then in 2005, they gave presentations at SIGGRAPH (special interest group for graphics) and WinHEC (Windows Hardware Engineering Conference) giving the impression that Windows Vista would remove sup
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> > When Vista was released, it backpedaled on its OpenGL claims, allowing vendors to create fast installable client drivers (ICDs) that restore native OpenGL support. The OpenGL board sent out newsletters proving that OpenGL is still a first-class citizen, and that OpenGL performance on Vista was still at least as fast as Direct3D. Unfortunately for OpenGL, the damage had already been done -- public confidence in OpenGL was badly shaken.

Game journalists proved that there was no diffe

11:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can try vulkan to dx12

12:50 < bridge> <_cus> Does anyone know how to remove the speed limit for downloading maps?
12:50 < bridge> <stormaxd> isnt speed limit setted by game engine?
12:50 < bridge> <stormaxd> i might be wrong
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @_cus server or client side? udp tw map download or ddnet http download?
12:51 < bridge> <_cus> server side. idk
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @stormaxd yea but its tw game engine so you can change it :) im not sure if its limited tbh
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i wrote some docs on the map download 0.7 net code btw
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/07/map_download.html
12:51 < bridge> <stormaxd> fair enough
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its basically the client asking for map packets and the server sending em i dont think there is much sleeping anywhere
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its very similar in 0.6
12:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and then ddnet also added the option to download from a http server
12:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can also host your own maps and inform clients about ur server
12:54 < bridge> <stormaxd> so, is that even possible to make margin only for 1 part? not only HMargin or VMargin

12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @_cus also ``cl_map_download_low_speed_limit 0`` but not sure if that only applies to http download
12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea pretty sure its http only
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you wanna go fast go with http
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you need to serve the map with the checksum at the end

13:44 < bridge> <mamad3725> https://www.msys2.org/
13:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd suggest using visual studio instead
13:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (not visual studio code)
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> vscode works great with mingw
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u want to compile from cmd line, then it's similar to how you do it on linux
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just make sure to init the submodules etc.
13:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?t=5765 this is the manual for visual studio
13:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't have one for msys2
13:46 < bridge> <mamad3725> i wanna use vs code just as an code editor
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with vscode it should just work
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> use the cmake extension and the rest should work magically
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we also have a vscode workspace:
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> other\vscode\ddnet.code-workspace
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it suggests good extensions
13:52 < bridge> <mamad3725> i installed c/c++ and cmake extentions. now how can i compile ?
13:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and rust
13:53 < bridge> <mamad3725> wow
13:53 < bridge> <stormaxd> just use Clion instead :gigachad:
13:53 < bridge> <stormaxd> best IDE
13:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> use WSL -> wine -> visual studio
13:54 < bridge> <learath2> Install VS 4-5 times so it uses more space

13:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's `pacboy`?

13:57 < bridge> <learath2> It helps with the nasty package names in mingw
13:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sounds useful xD
13:57 < bridge> <learath2> E.g. you can just do `pacboy -S cmake:x`

13:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hate to*
13:58 < bridge> <learath2> For the ucrt terminal you always want `:u` at the end and that's it no need to remember the triplet or google stuff

14:05 < bridge> <Ewan> yes i'd personally recommend using the more convoluted build strategy
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i used to like it to tbh
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but nowadays vscode is just as good
14:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and slimmer
14:05 < bridge> <Ewan> they are for different tasks nowadays
14:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can open the project and have it work
14:05 < bridge> <learath2> You liking it wouldn't surprise me, heinrich liking it does
14:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> without much fiddling
14:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also, I have a tutorial for it
14:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which should answer all the questions
14:06 < bridge> <Ewan> well you still have dozens of GB of extra overhead when you install visual studio with the required workflows
14:06 < bridge> <Ewan> plus the added slog of vs itself
14:06 < bridge> <Ewan> when msys is small and lightweight in and of itself and is literally less work to create a working build
14:06 < bridge> <Ewan> doesn't make much sense
14:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> with a nice installer
14:06 < bridge> <Ewan> the msys installer is good too
14:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I wouldn't know how to give complete step-by-step instructions for msys
14:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you want to do them, please do
14:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i just did it üòÉ
14:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, that's not step-by-step
14:07 < bridge> <Ewan> yes it is
14:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ok, where can I find it?
14:07 < bridge> <Ewan> find what
14:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the step-by-step instructions
14:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I apparently can't identify them
14:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you link them to me?
14:07 < bridge> <Ewan> right here
14:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> where is the ucrt shell?
14:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what is a shell
14:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what is ucrt?
14:08 < bridge> <Ewan> windows key -> "ucrt" first result
14:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> opens bign for me
14:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> opens bing for me
14:08 < bridge> <Ewan> weird
14:08 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1182669987429765200/image.png?ex=65858a41&is=65731541&hm=9ee3f82f881d8a50196dce921dd5e85eb1b5d254d012c67fd54f1bfa633bba52&
14:08 < bridge> <Ewan> ucrt is universal crt
14:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao now it escalates
14:08 < bridge> <learath2> It could require an entire drive to itself and VS enjoyers wouldn't care. UX people only care about the UX. It ooks cool + it has one button to do what I want = is good produkt
14:08 < bridge> <Ewan> c runtime on all windows installs since win 8
14:08 < bridge> <mamad3725> i am trying it
14:08 < bridge> <Ewan> godspeed
14:08 < bridge> <Ewan> i sympathize with both i just don't see how it's any better for this application
14:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @mpft what I mean is "this is by far not a step-by-step explanation. you didn't start on how we can install msys"
14:09 < bridge> <Ewan> not saying vs is bad
14:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you want to write a tutorial, start with a clean windows VM, and record *all* the steps you do
14:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> including the ones you deem obvious
14:09 < bridge> <Ewan> k do you want like super noob instructions or ones tailored to the guy who asked a question at a knowledge level i can assume my answer is adequate for
14:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> people will not find them obvious
14:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> super noob instructions
14:09 < bridge> <learath2> You just spam next. I have a text doc detailing all the steps that I never made into a tutorial üòÑ
14:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> where do you even download it?
14:10 < bridge> <Ewan> heinrich i literally need to add like 3 steps to make the tutorial noob friendly from a fresh vm... which wasn't even the goal in the first place...
14:10 < bridge> <learath2> IMO if you can't google msys2 I think you have no business compiling anything before you get a little more competence with a computer.
14:10 < bridge> <Ewan> download msys from msys2.org downloads page
14:10 < bridge> <Ewan> run installer and press next as the installer tells you to
14:10 < bridge> <Ewan> press windows key, search msys ucrt64
14:10 < bridge> <Ewan> the rest of what i already said
14:11 < bridge> <mamad3725> finally someone üòÑ i remember compiling a game (principia) and it was so easy to me (i had 0 coding experiment)
14:12 < bridge> <Ewan> msys is goated with the sauce
14:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that looks quite good already üôÇ
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you could argue that it's still faster to google all msys stuff than installing Visual Studio üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ
14:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure if it actually works, but if someone confirms it, we could add it to the readme
14:13 < bridge> <learath2> There is only one issue with msys. If something goes wrong it looks scary. With VS if something goes wrong you get a message box saying something went wrong
14:14 < bridge> <learath2> You are stuck on the big scary user unfriendly black screen üëª
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's why i like rust
14:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> FFR
14:15 < bridge> <Ewan> heinrich if your concern really is making ddnet compilable by people who don't even know what a compiler is maybe you should create a tool that can do it for them in the click of a button...
14:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> even as dev i'd say it's nice to not know everything under the hood
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's nice to help beginners
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I know how hard it was for me to compile teeworlds for the first time
14:15 < bridge> <Ewan> sure but it's not like my instructions were beginner-unfriendly. you're just being a jerk
14:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you'd probably want to gatekeep me, back then, based on your standards
14:15 < bridge> <Fussel> may I drop in the question whiy ddnet isn't c++20 but c++17?
14:16 < bridge> <Ewan> lots of work to upgrade
14:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think there's an issue about that
14:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> on github
14:16 < bridge> <Ewan> p sure it's stalled atm
14:16 < bridge> <learath2> Googling msys2 is not very under the hood üòÑ
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the main reason is that c++20 came to a bad time, if you consider the Ubuntu release schedule
14:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so basically we wait for next ubuntu
14:17 < bridge> <Fussel> @heinrich5991 i get some warning that definitly should be taken care of, but I'm on 85% now
14:17 < bridge> <mamad3725> i just wanna learn coding so i can make a good block sv for my people on persian ddnet
14:17 < bridge> <Ewan> wholesome 100
14:17 < bridge> <Fussel> @heinrich5991 i get some warnings that definitely should be taken care of, but I'm on 85% now
14:17 < bridge> <learath2> Didn't we have an issue with linking to an old enough libc?
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but deen didnt got it working
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah that would be a nice solution too
14:17 < bridge> <learath2> He wants to sell vip to persian people so he can make bank and go to the bahamas
14:17 < bridge> <learath2> It's not wholesomechungus
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sounds good
14:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> good luck
14:18 < bridge> <Ewan> must respect the hustle
14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> stay motivated even if the beginning is hard
14:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as if they have money üòÇ
14:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think you overestimate how "obvious" stuff is to beginners
14:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i'm just missing the relevance here, the dude knew what the ucrt shell was, and he already had msys installed (he was asking how to install with msys). i just provided the missing pieces of the puzzle that he had already started
14:19 < bridge> <mamad3725> :troll:
14:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i'm just missing the relevance here, the dude knew what the ucrt shell was, and he already had msys installed (he was asking how to compile  with msys). i just provided the missing pieces of the puzzle that he had already started
14:19 < bridge> <learath2> Bam was pretty good about making it easy for beginners ngl
14:19 < bridge> <Ewan> bam is cool
14:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ^
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well tbf heinrich did not know at the point he suggested VS
14:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
14:20 < bridge> <learath2> A piece of software that embodies "it just works"
14:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> bam was absolutely horrible
14:20 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
14:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it required you to build your build system before you could build teeworlds
14:21 < bridge> <mamad3725> before you i just copied the Dependencies on ddnet github page and it didn't worked
14:21 < bridge> <learath2> Which was just double clicking `make_windows.bat` or `make_unix.sh`
14:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> versus not even having to install anything with cmake
14:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because it comes pre-installed with msvs
14:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also, placing the bam executable at a convenient place
14:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so that you could call it
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> using bam: ok IMO
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dev for bam: horrible
14:22 < bridge> <learath2> Ackshully you have to install msvs, so it's still installing something
14:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which was not trivial
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when we had both build systems in place. it was horrible xd
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it was the time where i first dev'd for ddnet xD
14:22 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah the lua configuration wasn't the very best ngl
14:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you also had to install msvs for bam, if you wanted to compile bam
14:23 < bridge> <learath2> Back then msvs didn't come with cmake. So it was the same amount of effort on windows
14:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I see. I was talking about cmake now
14:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> even back then, you could simply install cmake from the website
14:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> we should switch to c++20, u should not game on linux if u use a old distro
14:25 < bridge> <learath2> I honestly don't know why people who are unable to double click a file and copy bam.exe to C:\ is a target demographic, but sure
14:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> apt install bam worked iirc
14:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> as always its windows who has problems
14:25 < bridge> <learath2> It was too old after a while
14:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> only when teeworlds used the same version of bam currently shipped in the repos
14:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd consider myself 14-year old me to be in the target demographic
14:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> did someone make a meson poc? is it less confusing?
14:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> cmake is confusing ngl
14:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and I can tell you, compiling teeworlds for the first time was hard for me
14:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> the dev part
14:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I didn't know anything about shells
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u use old software, don't expect current one to work xd
14:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I didn't know anything about unix shells
14:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 im heading to anime convention üò¨:justatest:
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why u so hyped about meson xd
14:27 < bridge> <learath2> I was there too, I figured out stuff, I asked around, it worked out. It's part of the process. Being able to generate an executable won't get you anywhere if you aren't willing to put in any work
14:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> i tried it and it looked like the configure part was instant
14:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> cmake is far from instant
14:27 < bridge> <learath2> Why didn't you invite me?
14:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> come barcelona
14:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but that shouldn't be the main hurdle. you still have enough other hurdles to figure out
14:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why gatekeep the first working executable?
14:28 < bridge> <learath2> It's not so much gatekeeping but forced training üòÑ
14:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> once you have a working build setup, it's much easier to debug
14:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> do you not agree that in principle, building should be as easy as possible for first-time contributors?
14:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> even today, I hate it if projects have complicated building setups
14:28 < bridge> <mamad3725> cmake -B build -S
14:28 < bridge> <mamad3725> CMake Error: No source directory specified for -S
14:28 < bridge> <mamad3725> CMake Error: Run 'cmake --help' for all supported options.
14:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it makes me less likely to contribute
14:28 < bridge> <Ewan> you forgot the dot
14:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 100% agree
14:28 < bridge> <Ewan> it's `cmake -B build -S .`
14:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you're missing a dot
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my challenge is to not use any build script for rust
14:29 < bridge> <mamad3725> wow
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> until now, i didnt need it
14:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> with rust, I just write `cargo build`
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> note that dot means current directory
14:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's amazing
14:29 < bridge> <learath2> Not like they will contribute anything if they can't google msys2. It should be simple, but it doesn't have to be one button
14:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm not missing anything
14:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, they will
14:29 < bridge> <mamad3725> it's building it :DDDD
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> epic gamer moment
14:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm not sure where you get the idea from that only people willing to go through arcane build setups will contribute
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> unless u need a native c dep lib
14:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:29 < bridge> <mamad3725> -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
14:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm today still discouraged if stuff is hard to build
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> submodules checked out?
14:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. sane
14:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I haven't looked into it a lot yet
14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> how can we make ddnet more sane?
14:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> we limited to c++ stupid tooling
14:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sane, the scanning tool
14:30 < bridge> <learath2> It's not arcane to have basic computer competence. If you can't use google what hope do you have of providing any useful contribution?
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well our cmake script is huge. that's insane xdd
14:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this isn't basic computer competence
14:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> being able to code c++ and being able to handle a terminal is completely orthogonal
14:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye xd, I think projects make it more modular, cmakelists on each folrer

14:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there are windows programmers that don't like dealing with linux shells
14:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yet are perfectly capable programmers
14:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think you're a bit in a bubble
14:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest: :justatest: :justatest:
14:32 < bridge> <mamad3725> is this a big deal, can i execute the next line or ....
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> install it
14:32 < bridge> <learath2> I'd go so far as to argue that if you aren't willing to just sit down and spend 30 minutes of your time learning how to use a shell you are very likely not as competent a programmer as you think you are
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno how the package is called
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but smth like libssp xd
14:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i agree with this btw
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or r we shipping it even
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it's still submodules
14:33 < bridge> <mamad3725> bro
14:33 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
14:34 < bridge> <mamad3725> what do i do ?
14:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh tbh it should be isntalled lol
14:34 < bridge> <Ewan> oh thats some crap you have to turn off
14:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (`cmake -B build` suffices btw)
14:34 < bridge> <robyt3> `git submodule update --init --recursive`
14:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is your ddnet-libs dir empty?
14:34 < bridge> <learath2> I love how this experiment is technically proving heinrich right, if he had just used VS it would have worked out fine üòÑ
14:34 < bridge> <learath2> This one yeah
14:34 < bridge> <Ewan> :feelsbadman:
14:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i just forgot a step ok
14:34 < bridge> <robyt3> And the step by step guide should use `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet` instead
14:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 nice that you learn rust lately
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when did u secretly started?
14:35 < bridge> <mamad3725> where is home on windows ? /home/Melanin_m/ddnet
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> try the command robyte send in the ddnet dir in a git bash shell
14:35 < bridge> <mamad3725> no vs today
14:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> one more in
14:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> :NekoEvil: :NekoEvil: :NekoEvil:
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòÅ
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
14:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Where did I write rust? :thonk:
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u used rust like syntax in your pr lately
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> clear indicator
14:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> elp im surrounded by weebs
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u never did that
14:36 < bridge> <learath2> Good for you, hardwork pays off
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 is that correct? üò¨
14:37 < bridge> <learath2> Are people doing the cosplay thing?
14:37 < bridge> <robyt3> No I haven't learned any more rust yet, which PR do you mean?

14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> more the opposite
14:38 < bridge> <robyt3> I was forced by clang-tidy for some weird reasons that I don't understand
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lol
14:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok rip
14:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> lots ofc
14:39 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe the line length was too long because I changed errno to net_errno(), never had this before though
14:40 < bridge> <robyt3> *clang-format not clang-tidy
14:42 < bridge> <robyt3> Looks correct, continue with the step that previously failed
14:46 < bridge> <mamad3725> i build without any error. but i can't find the ddnet source i just cloned, i typing "pwd" and it sais "/home/Melanin_m/ddnet". then i go to "C:\Users\Melanin_m", but there is no ddnet folder here
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao it's probably in your mingw structure
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can't u do rightclick open explorer here
14:47 < bridge> <robyt3> Run the command `explorer .` in the shell in that folder, which should open Windows Explorer in that folder
14:47 < bridge> <heinrich5991> nice trick, didn't know about that one
14:48 < bridge> <learath2> Oh yeah mingw no longer uses your real user folder as your mingw user folder

14:52 < bridge> <Ewan> kill who
14:52 < bridge> <Ewan> >_>
14:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> please don't spam the channel
14:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's conversations ongoing
14:53 < bridge> <mamad3725> ha ha ha ha :DDDDDDD i build the ddnet üôÇ now lets go learn cpp
14:53 < bridge> <stormaxd> why is voxel timeouted?!
14:53 < bridge> <learath2> Now I need to get out of my bed and fix the stupid bot because people will think it's hilarious to get the bots to loop
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> good luck
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> after 10 years i still know nothing
14:54 < bridge> <Ewan> cuz it looks like learath is taking a page out of heinrich's book and muting ppl/deleting messages for no reason
14:54 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> because the mods hate fun
14:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> moderation discussion goes to DM
14:54 < bridge> <Ewan> let the record show that i was only fixing their malformed command...
14:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and it was me
14:54 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> figures
14:54 < bridge> <Ewan> lol did u delete my message
14:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> discussion is over, we can change topic
14:54 < bridge> <Ewan> insanity

14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf
14:55 < bridge> <teero777> xd
14:55 < bridge> <Ewan> yes this is better for sure
14:55 < bridge> <Ewan> ????
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @mamad3725 if u want to take it serious. i'd highly suggest to start with small tasks.
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you cannot just create a block server from nothing.
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Look what you want to achieve and split your tasks
14:56 < bridge> <mamad3725> thank you @mpft @robyt3 ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è
14:56 < bridge> <Ewan> ‚ù§Ô∏è
14:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes. try to make a trivial change first
14:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that you can observe somehow
14:57 < bridge> <mamad3725> can you guys make a thing for all of this on ddnet github page for other people ?
14:57 < bridge> <mamad3725> ok
14:57 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, not the worst idea. I'll try to polish up my text file and add it to the readme or some other file

15:13 < bridge> <learath2> @ryozuki would have been nice if you elaborated on what a callback is in your blogpost
15:14 < bridge> <levitador> It might be stopping being "valid"I think the problem is in another place
15:15 < bridge> <learath2> Are you perhap doing the load all the time?
15:15 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> already tried popping it out of the isvalid check, still happens
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> your problem is not the logo
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i assume u have tons of other assets?
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess, when u know its hard to assume what a newb wouldnt know
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or 4k assets?
15:15 < bridge> <learath2> You are supposed to load the texture once, usually into a member variable, then if it's already loaded never load it again
15:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:16 < bridge> <furo321> Are you doing a `LoadTexture` every frame? That would explain it :D Use `Graphics()->TextureSet(g_pData->m_aImages[IMAGE_BANNER].m_Id);` instead.
15:16 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, this is also my guess üòÑ
15:16 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> gawd damn i started smth - thanks, will try
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah right in cpp-ddnet textures can leak
15:17 < bridge> <learath2> When `IGraphics::CTextureHandle` RAII?
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dd-pg has it
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
15:17 < bridge> <learath2> Make it for normal ddnet too, don't be selfish
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'm not selfish
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just like modern solutions
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> to modern problems
15:18 < bridge> <learath2> @ryozuki also when `Implementing a rcon command`? I've been waiting so long for the next part of your series
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> xddd
15:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> a fan?
15:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
15:19 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, I need to add an rcon command to my mod but I can't because you won't teach
15:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> <a:Deadneko:823430684680781879>
15:21 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Ryo your blogpost helped me a bunch - continue!
15:24 < bridge> <learath2> #7555 scares me a lot, I think it's a bad bad idea to merge it
15:24 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7555
15:24 < bridge> <learath2> The scale of the change and the fact that it touches something so fundamental practically guarantees we break something
15:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the change looks bigger than it is
15:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say it rewrites it
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> most of the calculations end up being  smth like * 1
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or all
15:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> to be precise xD
15:27 < bridge> <learath2> If a majority of you agree that it should be merged I won't complain but I wouldn't touch this with a 60 foot pole
15:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd like to test it with a few ppl
15:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
15:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd generally also be against merging it. if we merge it however, it should provide proper support for demos/ghosts
15:28 < bridge> <learath2> Last time we had an issue with demos we had to roll out tools to fix demos, there are still broken demos around
15:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> only slightly against merging though, it's okay if others find it worthwhile
15:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah demos etc are defs a problem
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's not directly useful for ddnet anyway
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> could also disable demos
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and ghosts
15:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oh yeah
15:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that'd work as a band-aid solution
15:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but please no broken demos or half-working demos
15:30 < bridge> <learath2> I also see changes around prediction code, I know you hate old versions with a passion but this should be tested both backwards and forwards for compatibility
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what old versions üò¨
15:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tbh
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the biggest issue is.. wtf is prediction code smth else than server code
15:32 < bridge> <learath2> ?
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bad design
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
15:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
15:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why is*
15:32 < bridge> <learath2> wtf as in why tf?
15:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not a helpful question ^^
15:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah dunno why i wrote wtf
15:33 < bridge> <learath2> I genuinely could not decode it
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i meant why
15:33 < bridge> <learath2> It triggered an exception in my english parser
15:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's unclear what you don't understand if you don't elaborate. we're left guessing. the second question makes it clear üôÇ
15:33 < bridge> <learath2> anyway, yeah, bad bad bad design
15:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'm never sure if u sarcastic xD
15:34 < bridge> <learath2> you need to be so extremely careful when changing anything because of that
15:34 < bridge> <learath2> and it's not even just one file you need to keep an eye on, some of the prediction happens outside of `src/game/client/prediction`
15:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> use furo's suggestion so code works and feel nice? ‚ùå 
15:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
15:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> implement a bool check to LoadTexture only once? :f3:
15:35 < bridge> <learath2> LOL
15:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> use furo's suggestion so code works and feels nice? ‚ùå 
15:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
15:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> implement a bool check to LoadTexture only once? :f3:
15:35 < bridge> <learath2> And what, did you use a static?
15:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ```
15:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> static bool IsTextureLoaded = false;
15:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> static IGraphics::CTextureHandle LogoTexture;
15:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
15:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> if (!IsTextureLoaded)
15:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> {
15:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr>     dbg_msg("DDStats", "Rendering Logo");
15:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr>     LogoTexture = Graphics()->LoadTexture("gui_logo.png", IStorageTW::TYPE_ALL, CImageInfo::FORMAT_RGBA);
15:35 < bridge> <blaiszephyr>     IsTextureLoaded = LogoTexture.IsValid();
15:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> }
15:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
15:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> if (IsTextureLoaded)
15:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> {
15:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr>     Graphics()->TextureSet(LogoTexture);

15:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr>     Graphics()->QuadsEnd();

15:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
15:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> maybe
15:36 < bridge> <learath2> Excellent code, I'm proud of you
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u lost me in the first keyword
15:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> üòÑ
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `static`
15:36 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> XD
15:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `static` can be good for performance üòÑ
15:36 < bridge> <learath2> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/call_once
15:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah nice, C++ finally also got it? ^^
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> global state: ok sometimes
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> global variables: no
15:37 < bridge> <learath2> It's been there since C++11 üòÑ
15:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> nvm, it's already in C++11 üòÆ
15:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> nice
15:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what about "global" state in wasm modules?
15:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds like the perfect fit to me, since they can be instantiated any number of times
15:38 < bridge> <learath2> I'm excited for `std::latch` `std::barrier` `std::atomic::wait()`
15:38 < bridge> <learath2> When are we getting C++20?
15:38 < bridge> <Ewan> never
15:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> eventually
15:39 < bridge> <learath2> :ohNo:
15:39 < bridge> <Ewan> too busy creating ai twinbops
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep this is hard. i use global vars, but only to create wrappers to emulate as if you were coding normal source code.
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but still, if you have a HUGE wasm module u end up with the same traps
15:39 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> with ddnet 2.0 ig
15:39 < bridge> <Ewan> Too busy arguing over accounts and making trivial ui changes
15:39 < bridge> <learath2> also `std::binary_semaphore`
15:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think `std::atomic::wait` is missing from rust(?)
15:39 < bridge> <Ewan> huh?
15:40 < bridge> <_cus> Is it possible to give super to another person?
15:40 < bridge> <Ewan> thats just how u mutex
15:40 < bridge> <learath2> Not really
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep sadly
15:41 < bridge> <learath2> pthread mutex I think does something very similar but `EnterCriticalSection` works completely differently afaik
15:42 < bridge> <Ewan> put your cheese in your backpack
15:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `super <id>` maybe?
15:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't remember
15:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i once used atomic waiting to handle signals cleanly (in a way that you don't have to wait for you code to wake up)
15:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have to say, signaling is still one of the most annoying things, bcs there is no `user` ptr
15:42 < bridge> <_cus> does not work
15:42 < bridge> <towux> only peoples who accept my fingerprint (ssh) can join to my server, how to disable this?
15:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this has NOTHING to do with the fingerprint
15:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I already told you
15:43 < bridge> <learath2> If you need context with it then waiting on an atomic probably isn't the best tool
15:43 < bridge> <Ewan> when can we add noob filter to #developer
15:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> never
15:43 < bridge> <towux> has
15:43 < bridge> <Ewan> :pepeW:
15:43 < bridge> <learath2> üòÑ
15:43 < bridge> <Ewan> yes heinrich! has!
15:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but when do you not need context with it?
15:43 < bridge> <Ewan> obviously
15:43 < bridge> <towux> my friend confirmed it and was able to log in
15:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no. it has something to do with establsihing a TCP connection before UDP seems to be allowed
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> signaling and game loops kinda hate each other
15:44 < bridge> <learath2> Well e.g. I'm implementing `CHttpRequest::Block()` I just need to block until it's done
15:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ask your hoster about this
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you can enlighten me go ahead
15:44 < bridge> <learath2> an atomic is perfect
15:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for such higher level cases i think mutex/condvar is just as good
15:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @towux there's nothing we can do about it. ask your hoster: "why does UDP not work from hosts that have never connected via TCP to me?"
15:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or do u mean for signaling?
15:45 < bridge> <learath2> It's sooo heavy for just blocking a thread
15:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i meant signaling in the sense of the outside world wants to interact with you
15:45 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe you can use this as an opportunity to use a whitelist
15:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not like u send the signal and recv it
15:46 < bridge> <Ewan> http over tcp whitelist, they connected via tcp so they can connect on udo
15:46 < bridge> <Ewan> udp
15:46 < bridge> <Ewan> flpflpflpflp
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u press CTRL + C
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u want, by best case, wake up your game loop => clean all stuff up, bye
15:46 < bridge> <towux> do you know how fix this? if my friend type in cmd: `ssh root@myip` and select yes he can join to the server
15:46 < bridge> <towux> accept fingerprint
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what is the error?
15:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what if he selects "no"?
15:47 < bridge> <learath2> It's just an example of a use for an atomic wait, no signals no nothing, just a thread that needs to wait on another to complete a task
15:47 < bridge> <learath2> Now every task could have a mutex and a condvar in there that other threads could wait on
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok, well maybe u are right and atomic lock has less overheat here
15:48 < bridge> <towux> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1182695133804777562/image.png?ex=6585a1ad&is=65732cad&hm=65bb8704e4585df9f8ee31290c44d391079d904ae8c1da7f9d754109d91b120c&
15:48 < bridge> <learath2> but that's like using a thermonuclear bomb to kill a spider
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but to me this is insignificant enough, at least for what i program
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah still that problem?
15:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> r u 100% sure the VPS provider has no custom firewall on top?
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> some hosters are really weird
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u gotta click through 1000 interfaces
15:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> note that I presented the solution above, if you want to skip a few steps of debugging
15:49 < bridge> <towux> I connected to my vds via ssh and was able to log in, my friend also could, why do they have to get a fingerprint?
15:49 < bridge> <_cus> Is it possible to give super to another person?
15:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> .
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's just the certificate
15:49 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, it's absolutely insignificant, but I find it also much more ergonomic than the combo of mutex/condvar, where you need to think about the condition and make sure the mutex is held correctly while changing the predicate blablabla
15:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it has nothing to do with the fingerprint, it's a huge red herring
15:50 < bridge> <towux> but he can join only if accepted fingerprint
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf?
15:50 < bridge> <towux> i checked this 10000times
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf are we talking about
15:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he has to connect via ssh, before UDP works?
15:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's about connecting via TCP so that you can connect via UDP afterwards
15:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> NO
15:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> connect a TCP connection in any way to the VPS
15:50 < bridge> <learath2> A quick 5 question quiz
15:50 < bridge> <towux> no, only accept fingerprint
15:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then your IP address is whitelisted
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am 0% in this discussion get pinged
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have no idea wtf u all talking about xD
15:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and can connect to the UDP server
15:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but @towux completely ignores me
15:51 < bridge> <towux> no
15:51 < bridge> <learath2> Did you actually verify this btw?
15:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
15:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I couldn't connect to the server
15:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I pinged it via SSH
15:51 < bridge> <Ewan> but muh fingerprint
15:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> connection worked
15:51 < bridge> <towux> so what should I do, my PROVIDER doesn't have a firewall
15:51 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah ok, that's pretty clear cut
15:52 < bridge> <learath2> Do you maybe have ufw or sth?
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bro no joke, switch to a different VPS
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dont waste your time
15:52 < bridge> <learath2> Or maybe some iptables rules?
15:52 < bridge> <towux> vds
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> vds
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's what they say
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i bet It's some overpriced shitty vps
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it's dedicated hardware u spent AT least 10‚Ç¨ per month
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's the cheapest i know of
15:53 < bridge> <learath2> Anyway, nothing we can do. Make sure that you don't have a firewall (ufw) or maybe some iptables rules. If you don't and your provider says there is no firewall there is no way to fix it
15:53 < bridge> <learath2> Find a new one
15:54 < bridge> <learath2> You are WRONG. Kimisufi has 6$ ones üòÑ
15:55 < bridge> <towux> 20
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then still switch, 20‚Ç¨ for tw, what are u hosting üòÇ
15:55 < bridge> <Ewan> go to school you chud
15:56 < bridge> <learath2> Whatever, price of server doesn't matter
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> true
15:56 < bridge> <learath2> The issue is diagnosed, nothing more we can tell you
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i won't explain you how to create a whitelist etc.
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it's not some setting in your VDS
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then i cant help
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> neat, but sadly shitty hardware üòÑ
15:58 < bridge> <learath2> Look at my glorious uptime
15:58 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1182697752401039411/image.png?ex=6585a41d&is=65732f1d&hm=940d5f1cbf5150d37519016f078a0f02dedc510727543b52695f854a96df252f&
15:58 < bridge> <learath2> I actually have no idea if this server can come back up if it restarts, so hopefully it never has an issue üòÑ
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
15:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my vps had huge uptimes too, until it was banned bcs of the reflection attacks xD
16:08 < bridge> <_cus> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1182700313237520444/Desktop_2023.12.08_-_18.07.44.02.mp4?ex=6585a680&is=65733180&hm=7670adee123c231380bb263904fa6de134e3a538e30e5284d833ec3d1aa53b66&
16:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we understand the problem
16:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but what do you expect us to do?
16:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is some weird software doing it that the hoster probably uses
16:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for whatever reason
16:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe bcs udp ddos filtering is harder or smth
16:10 < bridge> <learath2> or some software on your vds or some firewall on your vds
16:11 < bridge> <towux> I asked, he said he didn't have a firewall.
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it doesnt need to be a firewall in a classical sense. maybe it filters the traffic before it reaches the network of the hoster already
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway. only thing u can do is check your software on the server, as lea said
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or ask the provider if other customers had this too
16:17 < bridge> <mamad3725> @jupeyy_keks where can i find that vscode workstation you talked about ?
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> other/vscode
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet.code_workspace
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in the ddnet source code
16:49 < bridge> <mamad3725> is there examples out there for editing the ddnet code like: "how to make a server that every tee skin is rainbow color"
16:50 < bridge> <mamad3725> or make a server that every players movement shown on the chat: mamad goes right. , mamad goes left, mamad jumped üòÇ
16:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Is there a code examples like: " how to make tee hook through edge automatically or how to make tee and on edge
16:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Is there a code examples like: " how to make tee hook through edge automatically or how to make tee and on edge"
16:53 < bridge> <mamad3725> i am serious
16:53 < bridge> <mamad3725> the best way of learning is through examples
16:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd ping chillerdragon
16:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he probably has such features already
16:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he generally has a pretty good block server implementation
16:54 < bridge> <mamad3725> yeah i see it, i love those laser teleporters
16:55 < bridge> <cyberfighter> Thats just a bot
16:55 < bridge> <cyberfighter> real
16:55 < bridge> <cyberfighter> Heyyy can soemeone plwaaaeese do that
16:55 < bridge> <mamad3725> do what ?
16:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Nono
16:56 < bridge> <cyberfighter> yo m
16:57 < bridge> <mamad3725> or make a server that anytime someone mentions you on chat you shift color for 0.5 s
16:58 < bridge> <mamad3725> these idea will make a really god article about editing the ddnet code for beginners
16:58 < bridge> <mamad3725> these idea will make a really good article about editing the ddnet code for beginners
16:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> How about beginners go to code and change thing themselves and see how it works :poggers2:
16:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> How about beginners go to code and change things themselves and see how it works :poggers2:
17:00 < bridge> <mamad3725> go ahead, the source code is soooo big, i can't understand a thing üòÇ
17:00 < bridge> <bts._.> how dare you say those words ‚òπÔ∏è
17:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> How are u gonna write code then
17:00 < bridge> <mamad3725> i will learn
17:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Because heinrich doesn't see it
17:03 < bridge> <mamad3725> i found an example https://edgarluque.com/blog/chat-command-ddracenetwork/
17:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> This edgar guy knows about ddnet :poggers:
17:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he epic
17:13 < bridge> <mamad3725> i remember in ddper block sv admins could read all the whisper chats. is that a default thing on any server which your are admin on ?
17:13 < bridge> <bts._.> XDDDDDDD
17:14 < bridge> <mamad3725> i remember in ddper block sv admins could read all the whisper chats. is that a default thing on any server which you are admin on ?
17:16 < bridge> <mamad3725> also they could chat as another player and say as they want
17:16 < bridge> <mamad3725> are these the server defaults ?
17:19 < bridge> <furo321> No, the DDNet server does not allow you to do these things.
17:20 < bridge> <mamad3725> good
17:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://twitter.com/MistralAI/status/1733150512395038967

17:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://vxtwitter.com/MistralAI/status/1733150512395038967
17:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet does not by default impl allow this afaik
17:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah u can rewrite the code
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i've heard that of other servers too
17:28 < bridge> <mamad3725> sounds uncool to me
17:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
17:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> future ddnet versions might be able to fix it by doing end to end encryption between two clients
17:31 < bridge> <mamad3725> nice üôÇ
17:33 < bridge> <learath2> It's highly immoral to read/log whispers
17:34 < bridge> <robyt3> Anyone got good ideas to name a RAII wrapper for `net_init` and `net_uninit` (the latter still needs to be added)? `CNetworkLifecycle`, `CNetworkRAII`, `CNetworkSetup`
17:35 < bridge> <learath2> Just `CNetworkBase` or `CNetBase`?
17:35 < bridge> <robyt3> I'd add the class to `system.h` and not to `network.h` though
17:36 < bridge> <robyt3> `CNetBase` init is also weird
17:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Shouldn't be called in engine
18:05 < bridge> <mamad3725> now do i need to type these both everytime i wanna compile the game ? 
18:05 < bridge> <mamad3725> 
18:05 < bridge> <mamad3725> cmake -B build -S .
18:05 < bridge> <mamad3725> 
18:05 < bridge> <mamad3725> cmake --build build --config Release --parallel
18:06 < bridge> <mamad3725> and do i need to delete the content of build file every time i wanna compile ?
18:07 < bridge> <mamad3725> and do i need to delete the content of build directory every time i wanna compile ?
18:07 < bridge> <learath2> No, and you should only need one of those lines
18:14 < bridge> <mamad3725> now i am officially a ddnet developer
18:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> u are if u contribute back
18:17 < bridge> <mamad3725> ok. can you make the whole code  you added at the end to  src/game/server/ddracechat.cpp from your website https://edgarluque.com/blog/chat-command-ddracenetwork/
18:17 < bridge> <mamad3725> 
18:17 < bridge> <mamad3725> cus i copied and paste the codes one by one and it wont work
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes, you need to read, understand, learn, and then it will work
18:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> he will learn
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/
18:18 < bridge> <mamad3725> i always paste the whole code and if it's working i come back and read for understanding it and editing it my self
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> its from 2020, so maybe exactly it wont work, but if u understand a bit u can adjust it easily
18:19 < bridge> <devinci24> It's insane how much of 2020 code is deprecated. Like ff programming ü•π
18:20 < bridge> <mamad3725> :feelsbadman:
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> ff?
18:20 < bridge> <mamad3725> but that little command thing just covered so many other things, it's cool
18:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://edgarluque.com/blog/ui-code-ddnet/
18:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> here i add a button
18:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a bit more rushed tho
18:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> also ui code changes more
18:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> so its probs more outdated
18:22 < bridge> <devinci24> ehhhh, my bad. I've spent too much of my time playing/watching league.
18:22 < bridge> <devinci24> I just meant it's sometimes a bit bothersome
18:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://edgarluque.com/blog/intro-to-ddnet/
18:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u read
18:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah u mean ff as in surrender
18:22 < bridge> <devinci24> yeah
18:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> i thought i said final fantasy

18:25 < bridge> <mamad3725> you forgot me :brownbear:

18:25 < bridge> <devinci24> Would you if it was in catalan? :trollet:
18:26 < bridge> <robyt3> I'm using a Redirector rule in Firefox to avoid that
18:26 < bridge> <robyt3> (for German)
18:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would make a exception kek
18:27 < bridge> <mamad3725> i had read it
18:27 < bridge> <devinci24> :nouis:
18:27 < bridge> <mamad3725> can you please put the whole code at the end of you articles ?
18:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> @devinci24 i once started my own catalan programming blog
18:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i used to have the cool domain struct.cat
18:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> sure, git clone ddnet! XD
18:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> no sorry
18:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> im lazy so
18:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is .cat a thing
18:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i put only the least effort
18:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> XD
18:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> yep, .cat is for catalan language
18:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i can have milkeey.cat :santatrollet:
18:30 < bridge> <mamad3725> the problem is when i write those lines, if i get the error i don't gonna know if the problem is from me or the ddnet code was changed
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u need to understand why u add the lines
18:32 < bridge> <mamad3725> yes, the whole purpose is that, otherwise what is the point of having a /aboutme command in you server ?
18:33 < bridge> <mamad3725> you think you can force the reader to learn ? it depends on them at the end
18:34 < bridge> <bts._.> i want to learn by not doing anything ü§ì

20:27 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/07/googles-best-gemini-demo-was-faked/
20:27 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> it isnt actually a video feed
20:28 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> its just stitched together to make it seem that way
20:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/tree/master/www/countryflags can i yoink all of these images :santatrollet:
20:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sensible critique
20:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> IMO
20:38 < bridge> <devinci24> saying it's faked it's like accusing google to lie. They didn't, you just had to click here.

20:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as if somebody reads that
20:39 < bridge> <devinci24> bard plus or however is called is still and improvement over gpt4
20:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it's fake, then it's a scam
20:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that simple
20:40 < bridge> <devinci24> imo it's not faked. just rendered in a "nice" way
20:40 < bridge> <devinci24> but I can understand the critics
20:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno, to me putting something in a light that makes your product shine more than it actually delivers is a scam
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd be ok if they needed 10 tries to get it working
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but if it never worked like that
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> scam
20:41 < bridge> <devinci24> maybe.
20:41 < bridge> <devinci24> Imo it would be if they didn't add that. For me it's more like showcasing it's potential
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the potential of AI is GI
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so dunno
20:41 < bridge> <devinci24> GI?
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> AGI
20:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I watched the video and didn't understand this
20:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> clearly they tried to hie it
20:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> clearly they tried to hide it
20:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> don't do that, it's not nice
20:43 < bridge> <devinci24> the potential of their model.
20:43 < bridge> <devinci24> If you see any other videos google posted you realize it's not that impressive tho xd
20:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but potential
20:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in 10 years?
20:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway, tbf i didnt read the critique xD
20:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i dunno if it's a scam, but the video already was a little weird
20:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the way the person talked, sounded unnatural xD
